                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The current regulations and practices related to accounting vouchers and bookkeeping in
Poland, including cross-cutting tax regulations, were assessed and compared with selected
EU countries (France, Germany and UK). The study was undertaken at the request of the
Polish Ministry of Finance, and funded under the Financial Reporting Technical Assistance
Program (FRTAP) 1, to contribute to efforts to enhance harmonization with other relevant
regulations, reduce unnecessary requirements and red tape for entities (especially SMEs
and micro entities), and to reflect current and potential future technology changes whilst
retaining control over diligence and quality of bookkeeping.

The content, quality and scope of legislation in this area was found to be generally good. In
contrast to the other countries studied, however, it takes a detailed, prescriptive approach.
The report suggests moving away from setting detailed requirements and towards the
development of a clear general framework. This would help preserve the quality of
bookkeeping and accounting practices but reduce the need for continuous amendments to
regulations to keep pace with changing circumstances, for example technological changes.
It would also create space for more liberalization and greater flexibility for market
practitioners and would be in keeping with the approach adopted in the other countries
looked at. The report identifies gaps and inconsistencies in the areas of accounting policy
and maintenance of books; accounting vouchers; financial statements; storage; provision of
bookkeeping services; and information technology (IT) and makes a number of suggestions
to address these.



BACKGROUND

The Accounting Act, the key pillar of Polish accounting regulations, was created over two
decades ago. It has been updated over the years (the legislation used in the study is dated
as of January 1, 2015) but developments, especially related to IT, still need to be reflected in
the provisions of the law. In 2014 the Polish Government made significant steps towards
deregulation of the accounting profession and improved the enforcement of filing and
publication requirements for financial statements.

There is no common approach within the EU to regulations on bookkeeping. The
comparisons with domestic law and practices in selected EU countries are used in the report
to illustrate the different approaches taken.

 The FRTAP is implemented by the World Bank Centre for Financial Reporting Reform (CFRR), with funding
provided by a grant from Switzerland through the Swiss Contribution to the Enlarged European Union.


                                                                                                         1
     Existing regulations, mainly the Accounting Act as the primary piece of legislation
     regulating accounting and financial reporting and related guidance on bookkeeping
     issued by the Accounting Standards Committee, are quite prescriptive. They offer very
     detailed instructions but lack some useful definitions, such as of accounting voucher or
     electronic evidence.




POLISH BOOKKEEPING REGULATIONS

The study, as agreed with the Ministry of Finance, focused on requirements related to
accounting records, journal entries, accounting vouchers, financial statements and archiving
as well as requirements related to outsourced bookkeeping services. The area of accounting
principles was outside the scope of the report.

The existing framework often provides detailed instructions rather than principle based
concepts. Polish regulations address requirements to document applied accounting policy
including: methods for valuation of assets and liabilities and calculation of the financial
results; chart of accounts; list of accounting books; and description of the data processing
system (if used) and data protection system. The Accounting Act requires that accounting
books are maintained in the Polish language and in Polish currency. These books may be
kept away from an entity’s premises if the tax office is informed and books and accounting
vouchers are made available as required for external control. Books of accounts are
required to be reliable, complete and accurate, with an audit trail enabling re-performance.
The audit opinion must state that the audited financial statements are prepared on the basis
of the properly maintained books of account.

Further provisions of the Act prescribe:
a)      Requirements for opening and closing the books triggered by defined events, including
        the beginning of the new financial year, liquidation, business combination etc.
b)      Elements and features of the books of accounts such as: journal, general ledger,
        subsidiary ledgers, trial balance and inventory of assets and liabilities.
c)      Types and elements of accounting vouchers (but lacks definition of accounting
        vouchers which is available in Polish accounting literature).
d)      Preparation and approval of the financial statements including required reports and
        disclosure which has been reduced for SMEs and Micro entities.
e)      Filing of financial statements to the court register and to the tax office. Archiving
        obligations related to books of accounts, accounting vouchers, accounting policy,
        employee salary documents, and financial statements as derived from accounting and
        tax regulations.



                                                                                                2
f)      Deregulation since August 2014 allows for bookkeeping to be outsourced to any
        external service organization, provided that they have professional liability insurance,
        and no convictions for crimes against the reliability of documents, or against assets,
        commercial trading, money, securities, tax regulations, accounting.
g)      Sanctions for maintaining unreliable books of account or not maintaining bookkeeping.



COMPARISON WITH ACCOUNTING VOUCHERS AND BOOKKEEPING
REGULATIONS IN FRANCE, GERMANY, AND THE UK

     Although certain similarities exist, there is no common approach to bookkeeping,
     accounting vouchers, or filing and archiving financial statements across the EU. Member
     States each define their own requirements but legislation tends to create a policy
     framework of general principles rather than detail requirements. Adopting this approach
     in Poland would preserve the overall quality of bookkeeping but leave the organization
     of internal control systems to entities rather than strict legal regulation.



Unlike accounting and financial reporting principles which have been standardized in the
form of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), topics covered in this study are
still subject to country-specific regulations. There is no common EU or international
approach nor set of guidelines. In France and Germany, the maintenance of books of
accounts and accounting vouchers is highly regulated by accounting regulations, commercial
code and tax regulations. The system of accounting regulation is driven by government
(mainly fiscal) reporting needs. In the UK, the Companies Act 2006 sets out requirements for
proper accounting books and archiving. The applicable accounting standards (IFRS and the
UK Financial Reporting Standards (FRS)) do not address the maintenance of books of
accounts or accounting vouchers. Only FRS 18 refers to accounting policy and includes a
general framework for the definition of such policy. The other source of regulations in this
common law country are court rulings.

While specifics vary across these countries, they share an approach best described as
creating a general framework rather than setting out detailed instructions. Various levels of
detail are provided, often in different pieces of legislation (such as the commercial code, tax
regulations, accounting law, general chart of accounts) but the focus appears to be more
about achieving the overall aim than on the detail.

In Poland, requirements are mainly included in the Accounting Act and follow the pattern of
very detailed instructions in the mode of compliance and control. Regulations are
sometimes outdated, especially related to IT accounting systems which do not keep pace
with the changing IT environment, e.g. use of servers in clouds. Market practitioners


                                                                                               3
indicate a need for more liberalization, flexibility, and greater consistency with other binding
regulations (for example tax and financial reporting), while preserving the adequate quality
of bookkeeping which a move towards a framework of general principles should facilitate.



AREAS IDENTIFIED FOR ATTENTION IN POLAND

    The study and discussions with finance practitioners (finance managers, accountants
    and auditors) and IT professionals dealing with accounting systems identified a number
    of areas in Poland as inconsistent, difficult to apply or outdated.


Key areas identified for attention are:
•      Some definitions of terms are missing from the Accounting Act and others lack clarity
       and consistency, allowing for different interpretations while at the same time
       requiring their application.
•      Polish accounting regulations, although regularly adjusted in line with international
       practices, are not keeping pace with rapidly changing technology in the bookkeeping
       profession.
•      Restrictions, such as on the use of any language other than Polish (which could
       enhance cooperation between Polish entities and international groups they are part
       of, as well as cooperation with international shared service centers), or requirements
       for separate recognition of cash payments, could benefit from liberalization.
•      Achieving full compatibility of tax and accounting regulations appears some way off,
       but progress will be assisted through unification of some basic definitions, e.g.
       accounting vouchers, and requirements, e.g. related to periods of archiving.
•      Some deadlines and requirements, especially for SME and micro entities, are
       unnecessarily burdensome and costly. However, any changes should not be at the
       expense of quality.
•      A move from detailed prescriptive rules towards a general principle based approach
       should make the legislation more universal and resistant to changes in the business
       environment including IT.
•      More flexibility in implementing changes of the accounting system and accounting
       policies during the financial year would enable entities to react faster to the needs of
       the market.

RECOMMENDATIONS

 The existing legislation creates a robust and generally effective framework but one that
 is perhaps too detailed and prescriptive. Recommendations have been made which
 could reduce the administrative burden on businesses, improve the quality of
 accounting books, address current inconsistencies, and align more closely with the
 approach taken in other EU countries.



There follows a summary of recommendations made in the report. These seek to make
improvements within the existing framework, retaining much of the current detailed
regulation and taking account of existing guidance issued by the Accounting Standards
Committee (KSR) affiliated at the Ministry of Finance.

Paragraph
                                          Recommendation

            to-date.
4.1.1       Amend requirements for computer assisted bookkeeping. Remove
            requirement for a detailed IT accounting system description and replace with
            obligation to keep original technical instructions received from the software
            provider.
4.1.2       Ensure all entities subject to audit apply national accounting standards.

            translation if demanded by auditors like in some other EU countries.
4.2.5       Define terms related to closing books of accounts. Allow for a period of
            adjustment in IT accounting software to assist entities that are subsidiaries of
            foreign entities and need to close the financial year for group reporting
            separately to closure of the financial year for statutory purpose and are
            having to maintain books that comply with two sets of accounting principles.
4.2.6       Allow different periods for closing books according to entity size.




                                                                                               5
Paragraph
                                           Recommendation
 number
4.2.7       Make provision for entities transforming during the financial year from
            simplified tax books to full accounting - promoting solid financial reporting
            standards and eliminating the requirement to maintain two separate books
            of accounts during the period of transformation.
4.2.8       Move wording on features of properly kept books of accounts.
4.2.9       Amend wording on monthly closing requirements. Introduce more universal
            rules, rather than detailed instructions, for the production of some reports.
4.2.10      Amend wording on annual closing requirements to alleviate short deadlines.
4.2.11      Remove requirement for separate recognition of cash payments.
4.2.12      Clarify wording on place where current books of accounts are held.
4.2.13      Clarify wording on place of storage of books of accounts/data storage.
4.2.14      Introduce 15-day notification deadline of a change in storage venue.
4.2.15      Provide for bookkeeping located on servers outside the entity.
4.2.16      Provide for format of analytical records to be at the discretion of the entity.
4.2.18      The Ministry of Finance is preparing a statement on electronic audit
            techniques (control tool) therefore no recommendations have been made.
Accounting vouchers
4.3.1       Define terms related to accounting vouchers unified with binding VAT
            regulations.
4.3.2       Define terms related to electronic accounting vouchers.
4.3.3       Ensure references to accounting vouchers in the Act can be understood to
            apply interchangeably to both traditional and electronic forms.
4.3.4       Clarify the use of “source documents”, changing where appropriate to
            “accounting vouchers”.
4.3.5       Remove need for confirmatory printouts of books of accounts.
Financial Statements
4.4.1       Extend deadlines for preparing financial statements according to entity size.
4.4.2       Unify reporting deadlines set by accounting and tax laws, although linked
            there are areas of difference in tax and accounting requirements which are
            burdensome because entities need to comply with both.




                                                                                              6
Paragraph
                                           Recommendation
 number
4.4.3       Address a lack of consistency between the Accounting Act and The
            Commercial Code related to the preparation of financial statements for
            entities in transformation of their legal forms can lead to confusion by
            unifying those regulations. Clarify financial statement requirements for
            partnerships not obligated to apply the Accounting Act.
Storage
4.5.1       Clarify notion of “records storage”.
4.5.2       Clarify requirements for storage of books of accounts.
4.5.3       Allow for storage, with approval, of books of accounts outside the entity.
4.5.4       Introduce regulation for storage of accounting data on servers outside the
            entity.
4.5.5       Introduce 10-year financial statement storage requirement. Current
            regulations have no time limit which can be burdensome and not feasible,
            especially as the value of those documents deteriorates in time.
4.5.6       Provide a defined period for storage of documentation of accounting policy.
            Some accounting vouchers (e.g. payroll documentation) has extremely long
            retention periods which is burdensome, especially for SMEs.
4.5.7       Unify retention periods given by the accounting and tax laws. Introduce
            defined storage periods for different types of accounting files. Allow filing of
            accounting vouchers in the National Archives of Personal and Payroll
            Documentation. This institution already exists and filing there would help
            ensure that accounting vouchers remain accessible after the expiry of
            retention periods.
4.5.8       Clarify methods of making files available to third parties.
Provision of Bookkeeping Services
4.6.1       Ensure greater consistency in some areas of outsourcing accounting services,
            i.e. with reference to requirements related to domestic and foreign service
            organizations. Apply provisions of the Accounting Act to entities from other
            countries providing services in Poland.
4.6.3       Differentiate failure to supervise from specific accounting offences.
Information Technology
4.7.1       Allow for change of IT system during financial year.
4.7.2       Define “IT system”, “financial and accounting system” and “report”.

       1. ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION, INCLUDING TAX
                            LEGISLATION


1.1.       DOCUMENTATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICY


1.1.1.     Definition of accounting policy

Accounting policy is an element of accounting. This is set forth in art. 4 par. 3 pt 1 of the
Accounting Act.

Accounting policy is nothing else than a set of accounting principles, applied by the entity.

                                            ACCOUNTING POLICY
                                                         =
                        a set of accounting principles, applied by the entity*.

*accounting principles - art. 3 par. 1 pt 11 of the Act – are solutions selected and applied by an entity,
permitted by this Act, including those specified in the IAS, ensuring the required quality of financial statements.



1.1.2.     Objective of accounting policy

The objective of the accounting policy is to select such principles of accounting, as will
ensure that books of accounts and financial statements present a true and fair view of
assets, financial standing and financial result of the entity.


1.1.3.     Elements of accounting policy

Elements which must be included in the accounting policy are listed in art. 10 par. 1 of the
Accounting Act. It is the minimum scope.

                                   Art. 10 par. 1 of the Accounting Act

  Documentation of the adopted accounting principles (policy) should specify at least:
  1.     the definition of a financial year and the reporting periods included in it;
  2.     methods for measuring assets and liabilities and for determining the financial
         result;
  3.     the bookkeeping techniques, including at least:




                                                                                                                  8
             a.     internal chart of accounts
             b.     list of the books of accounts
             c.     description of the data processing system,

    4.       System for protecting data and data files.


Bookkeeping techniques (pt 3) have been treated in a more detailed manner in the Act.

Thus, it has been specified, that:
1.       Internal chart of accounts determines:
         •    general ledger accounts,
         •         rules adopted for classifying events,
         •         methods for keeping subsidiary ledger accounts as well as their links with the
                   general ledger accounts

2.       in case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, accounting policy should include a list of
         books of accounts in form of a list of data files comprising the books of accounts on
         IT data carriers, specifying their structure, their mutual links and functions in the
         organization of all the books of accounts and in data processing
3.       in case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, accounting policy should include a
         description of the data processing system in form of a description of the IT system
         containing a list of software programmes, procedures or functions, depending on the
         software structure, along with a description of the algorithms and parameters as well
         as the data protection mechanisms provided by the software programme including, in
         particular, the methods of data access control as well as the data processing system,
         and, moreover, the designation of the software version and the date it came into use.


1.1.4.            Accounting policy and computer-assisted bookkeeping

In case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, accounting policy, in accordance with the
Accounting Act, should include:
•        a list of books of accounts in form of a list of data files comprising the books of
         accounts on IT data carriers, specifying their structure, their mutual links and
         functions in the organization of all the books of accounts and in data processing
•        Description of the IT system, including:
         o         depending on the software structure - a list of software programmes, procedures
                   or functions,
         o         description of the algorithms and parameters


                                                                                                9
     o     description of data protection mechanisms provided by the software programme
           including, in particular, the methods of data access control as well as the data
           processing system,
     o     designation of the software version
     o     date, on which the software came into use.


1.1.5.   Accounting policy and accountability

According to art. 4 par. 5 of the Accounting Act, the Manager of an entity is responsible for
the performance of the accounting obligations specified by the Act, including for preparing
the accounting policy. The manager of an entity is responsible for the performance of the
accounting obligations specified by the Act, including for supervision, also if certain
accounting obligations are assigned to a third party with his/her/its consent.

According to art. 10 par. 2 of the Accounting Act, the Manager of an entity defines and
updates the accounting policy in writing.


1.1.6.   Accounting policy and regulations

In developing an accounting policy, the entities are obligated to follow the provisions of the
Accounting Act.

In matters left unregulated by the provisions of the Act, entities may apply:
•    domestic accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards Committee,
•    if no relevant domestic standard is available, entities other than those preparing
     financial statements in accordance with the IAS, may apply the IAS.

Above hierarchy of regulation stems from art. 10 par. 3 of the Accounting Act.


1.1.7.   Accounting policy and language

The Accounting Act – art. 10 par. 1 – obligates the entities to possess an accounting policy in
Polish. This obligation is also confirmed by the Position of the Accounting Standards
Committee of 13 April 2010 on certain principles of maintaining books of accounts (pt 17):
“documentation describing the methods of maintaining books of accounts should be
available in Polish”.




                                                                                            10
1.2.       BOOKS OF ACCOUNTS


1.2.1.     Definition of the books of accounts

The concept of the books of accounts was defined in art. 13 par. 1 of the Accounting Act in a
following manner:

                                                            the journal

Books of accounts consist of                            the general ledger
files of accounting entries,                            subsidiary ledgers
totals (sums of entries) and
                                     Summaries: Trial balances of the general ledger accounts
balances, which consist of:                  and of the subsidiary ledger accounts
                                             a list of assets and liabilities (inventory)


Par. 2 of the article indicated above refers to computer-assisted bookkeeping, by stating: In
the case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, accounting information resources in the form
of separate:
•      data files
•      databases
•      separate parts of databases,
irrespective of their place of origin or storage, are considered to be equivalent to such books
of accounts.

However, as a condition to maintaining accounting system information resources in the
form specified above, an entity must possess software that makes it possible to obtain
legible information regarding the entries made in the books of accounts by printing out or
transferring them to an IT data carrier.


1.2.2.     Language and currency

                                 Art. 9 of the Accounting Act

recognized in books of accounts in a foreign language and numeric data in foreign currency.

Detailed explanations in scope of principles of bookkeeping in Polish are presented in
Chapter IV of the Position of Accounting Standards Committee. The essential explanations
are presented in the table below.

  Position of the Accounting Standards Committee of 13 April 2010 on certain principles
                               of bookkeeping – Chapter IV

         In case of using software developed in a foreign language, the entity is not
         obligated to possess the entire software in Polish. The requirement of using
         Polish language for computer-assisted bookkeeping pertains only to data
 Pt 13   included in the financial-accounting systems, and in particular fixed data, such as:
 and     a) names of accounts;
 14
         b) descriptions of types of transactions, posting entries, etc.;
         c) names of business transactions;
         d) names of currencies.

         The set of reports in Polish available in the financial and accounting system
         include reports with information content the same as information content of the
         books of accounts (art. 13 par. 1 of the Act), i.e.:
         a) the journal
         b) trial balances of the general ledger accounts and of the subsidiary ledger
            accounts
 Pt 15
         c) trial balances of the general ledger accounts and of the subsidiary ledger
            accounts
         d) inventory.

         Other reports, going beyond minimum requirements in scope of information
         content of books of accounts, may be treated as auxiliary and do not have to be
         available in Polish.

         Reports with information content the same as information content of books of
         accounts (pt 15), should also meet other requirements set forth in the Act (e.g.
         totals at the end of pages, system version number). Those requirements pertain
         both to the presented data and other elements of the report, such as:
 Pt 16
         a) headers and footers of the report;
         b) names of columns and lines.

         Availability of reports may be ensured either directly from the financial and


                                                                                           12
         accounting system or through other IT solutions.

         The requirement of maintaining books of accounts in Polish means, that the
         content of entries (in particular descriptions of events) made in financial and
         accounting system has to be expressed in Polish. This requirement does not
         pertain to cases when the entries are made in form of codes, abbreviations or
         symbols; however, in such a case there should be a list available of allowed and
 Pt 18   applied codes, abbreviations or symbols, with a description of such codes,
         abbreviations and symbols provided in Polish. In case of accounting vouchers in
         form of entries made automatically in the accounting and financial system, in
         particular interest notes, depreciation accrual, etc. content of those entries,
         unless it is in form of code, abbreviation or symbol (created automatically by the
         system) should be available in Polish.

         In case of data moved to a durable IT data carrier, it should be archived in Polish.
 Pt 19   This means, that if data is in form of reports, those reports should be available in
         Polish.


1.2.3.   Place of keeping books of accounts

Place of keeping books of accounts has been set forth in art. 11 and 11a of the Accounting
Act as well as pts 20-27 of the Position of Accounting Standards Committee of 13 April 2010
on certain principles of bookkeeping.

                                Art. 11 of the Accounting Act

                                 Books of account may be:

         kept by the entity            outsourced for keeping to authorized enterprises


                              Books of account may be kept:

 At the entity’s seat or place of governance      Outside of the entity’s seat or place of
                                                               governance

                                                in the entity’s      Outsourced to an
                                                branch, office      enterprise providing
                                                    or unit         services in scope of
                                                                       bookkeeping


Art. 11a of the Accounting Act – in case the books of accounts are kept outside the head
office or place of management, the entity’s manager is obliged to:


                                                                                             13
•    notify the relevant revenue office of the place where the books of accounts are kept
     within 15 days of releasing the books
•    ensure availability of the books of accounts along with accounting vouchers for
     authorized external inspection or supervision authorities at the head office or place of
     management of the entity, or at a different place with the consent of the inspection or
     supervision authority

According to art. 9 par. 1 of the Act of 13.10.1995 on principles of registration and
identification of taxpayers and payers: “Entities, referred to in art. 6 par. 1, 1a and 10, are
obligated to update the data required for the identification notice by making a data update
notice to head of revenue office no later than 7 days from the moment data change
occurred”.

The Position of Accounting Standards Committee presents the conditions for the three
options of bookkeeping. They are presented in the table below.

Books of        are kept using the resources (personnel, premises equipment) which at the
accounts        disposal of the entity. The entity is not limited as to the place where it
kept by the     keeps its books (e.g. head office, branch or plant, unit), which may be

                An entity, as per art. 51 of the Act, an entity may authorize a branch (plant)
                which as organizational unit does not prepare individual financial
                statements, to keep the books for both the branch (plant) itself and the
                entire entity. Authorization for a branch (plant) to keep books for the
                branch (plant) or the entire entity does not result in an obligation for such
                a branch (plant) to prepare financial statements of the branch (plant) or
                the entire entity.

Bookkeeping Outsourcing bookkeeping to an enterprise offering services in scope of
outsourced  bookkeeping does not relieve the manager of the entity from the
to another  responsibility for performing their duties in scope of accounting.
entity
            The manager of the entity should ensure that the obligations in scope of
            accounting are fulfilled by: careful selection of the enterprise providing
            bookkeeping services, including relevant clauses in bookkeeping services
            contract, and controlling observance of contractual conditions. Particular
            attention should be given to those provisions of the contracts, which
            stipulate responsibility of additional persons – other than the manager of
            the entity – for specific areas of accounting. Effective supervision over
            outsourced bookkeeping requires implementation of such solutions as will
            allow the manager of the entity current control and analysis of
            bookkeeping entries made (by way of e.g. online access, periodic or on


                                                                                            14

                 as to the qualifications, including certification to provide bookkeeping
                 services, of persons actually performing those activities on behalf of the
                 enterprise, as well as information on active third party liability insurance
                 held by the enterprise.

                    and accounting vouchers;
                 e) Data in books of accounts is effectively protected from unauthorized

                    has their content written down on another permanent data carrier,
                    available and possible to read at the entity's place of bookkeeping, for
                    a period no shorter than required accounting records retention period
                    (5 years).


1.2.4.   Criteria of correctness of the books of accounts

                 •    consist of automatically numbered pages
                 •    have a clearly marked first and last page
                 •    include a sum total for each page on an ongoing basis throughout the
                      financial year

    Books of accounts should be printed out no later than at the end of the financial year.
         Transferring the contents of books of accounts to an IT data carrier is considered
                              equivalent to printing out such books.


1.2.6.2.       The journal

                                      Art. 14 of the Accounting Act

 3.    Entries in the journal must be numbered.
 4.    Sums of the entries (totals) must be calculated in a continuous manner.
 5.    Journal entries should be made in such a way as to ensure that they may be
       unambiguously linked to checked and approved accounting vouchers.
 6.    It is possible to keep one journal, or a number of journals for individual groups of
       business transactions (sub-journals); if sub-journals are used, then a summary of
       their totals for a given reporting period should be prepared.
 7.    Computer-assisted bookkeeping: an accounting entry should have an
       automatically assigned item number under which it was entered in the journal,
       as well as data identifying the individual responsible for the contents of the
       entry.


1.2.6.3.   The general ledger

                                Art. 15 of the Accounting Act

       •    purchase operations;
       •    costs and assets significant for the entity;
       •    cash operations in the event that a cash register is operated.


1.2.6.5.   Trial balances

                                Art. 18 of the Accounting Act

                                       Trial balances

1.2.6.6.       Inventory

                                      Art. 19 of the Accounting Act

           confirmed by stocktaking.
    3.     In entities, which continue keeping books of accounts in a manner specified in the
           Accounting Act, general ledger accounts’ trial balances as well as subsidiary ledger
           accounts’ trial balances constitute the inventory.



1.2.7.      Principles of making entries

Entries in the books of accounts are made:
•        in a permanent manner,
•        without leaving room for any subsequent additions or changes,
•        in case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, appropriate procedures and measures
         protecting against destruction, modification of, or hiding entries should be applied
•        in a manner enabling the transaction amount to be determined both in the Polish and
         foreign currency - in case of transactions in foreign currencies,
•        in a manner ensuring their durability for a time no shorter than the time required for
         storing books of accounts.

Entries in the journal and general ledger accounts should be crosslinked in a manner
enabling them to be checked.


1.2.8.      Elements of entries

                                           the date of the business transaction
An                                     type of the underlying accounting voucher
accounting
                                reference number of the underlying accounting voucher
entry should
contain at                date of accounting voucher, if different from the transaction date
least:               comprehensible text, abbreviation or code of the transaction’s description
                                                    amount of the entry



                                                                                                22
                                                          date of the entry
                                       designation of the accounts to which it pertains


1.2.9.       Books of accounts and taxes

For the purposes of tax law, Tax Ordinance introduces the notion of tax registers.

                                       Art. 3 pt 4 Of Tax Ordinance Act

                                                   TAX BOOKS

      Books of accounts            Tax register of revenue and expenses           Records and registers


As the above shows, for entities subject to provisions of the Accounting Act, tax registers are
– for tax purposes – the books of accounts.

According to art. 181 of the Tax Ordinance, tax registers constitute evidence in tax
proceedings. If tax registers are kept reliably and correctly, they constitute evidence of the
circumstances indicated therein (art. 193 par. 1 of TO).

                                        TAX REGISTERS ARE DEEMED:

           RELIABLE (art. 193 par. 2 of TO)                        CORRECT (art. 193 par. 3 of TO)
       if entries made in the books reflect the                  if they are kept in accordance with
                 actual state of affairs.                        principles stemming from separate
                                                                              legislation


Thus, the Tax Ordinance recognizes those tax registers as reliable and correct, as are kept in
accordance with accounting principles stemming from the Accounting Act.



1.3.         ACCOUNTING VOUCHERS


1.3.1.       Definition

One of the binding principles of Polish accounting is that any business transaction which is
to be recorded must be previously documented. In other words, there can be no records
without an appropriate accounting document 2.

An accounting voucher is a document which constitutes the basis for an entry made in
books of accounts3.

The Accounting Act in itself does not provide a direct definition of an accounting voucher. It
focuses rather on types of accounting vouchers and their constituent elements.

An accounting voucher is the basis for record (entry) in books of accounts. The Position of
the Accounting Standards Committee clarifies, that an entry can also be made based on
electronic documents entered into the books, which constitute accounting vouchers. At the
same time, pt 7 of the Position describes the term “electronic document”.

                       Pt 7 of the Position of Accounting Standards Committee

    The term “electronic document” refers to the form of the document, such as e.g.:
    electronic invoice, a printout from an Internet banking system, electronic warehouse
    document, electronic airline ticket, data from billing systems etc.


The term “electronic document” was also defined in the Tax Ordinance.

                                     Art. 3 pt 13 of Tax Ordinance Act

    Whenever in the Act a reference is made to:
    13) electronic document - it means an electronic document referred to in Article 3, pt
        2 of the Act on Informatization of Activities of Entities Implementing Public Tasks
        of 17 February 2005 (Journal of Laws No. 64, item 565, as amended).


         Art. 3 pt 2 of the Act on Informatization of Activities of Entities Implementing Public
                                                  Tasks

    Terms used in the Act shall be understood to mean:
    2)     electronic document – a data file, constituting a separate distinctive whole in
           terms of meaning, arranged in a specific internal structure and recorded on an IT
           data carrier.


The above shows that there is no consistency between accounting regulations and tax
regulations.

While talking about definitions, Act on Goods and Services Tax should be mentioned, which,
after an amendment enacted in 2012, has introduced a definition of an invoice and
electronic invoice into its list of definitions.

                                 Art. 2 pt 31 of the VAT Act

 "invoice" shall mean a document in a paper or an electronic form including particulars
 required under a legislative act or regulations issued pursuant to said act;

                                 Art. 2 pt 32 of the VAT Act

 "electronic invoice" shall mean an invoice in an electronic form issued and received in
 any electronic format;



1.3.2.   Types of accounting vouchers

Within the framework of accounting theory, many criteria were developed for classification
of accounting vouchers. For the purposes of this study, only the criteria presented in the
Accounting Act will be presented, as set forth in art. 20 thereof.

literature) listed in the Accounting Act are presented below:

       cash report                                      private individuals


Other accounting vouchers are accounting vouchers drawn up by the entity.

Accounting vouchers generated electronically may also be a basis for entries in books of
accounts4.

                                  Art. 20. 4 par. 5 of the Accounting Act

    In the case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, entries made in the books of accounts
    automatically by means of telecommunication devices, IT data carriers, or developed
    according to an algorithm (software) based on information already included in the books
    should be considered equivalent to source documents, provided that at least the
    following conditions are met at the registration of such entries:
    1)     they become permanently legible and consistent with the content of the relevant
           accounting vouchers
    2)     it is possible to track their origin and the individual responsible for making the
           entry
    3)     the procedure applied ensures the possibility to check if the relevant data was
           correctly processed and the relevant entries are complete and identical;
    4)     the source data is duly protected at its place of origin, in a manner ensuring its
           invariability during the period of storage required for a given type of accounting
           voucher

Thus, in case of computer assisted bookkeeping, the basis for making accounting entries
may be 5:
•        electronic accounting vouchers received from third parties and automatically
         transmitted to the entity’s systems by means of telecommunication devices, IT data
         carriers,
•        Vouchers generated automatically, by the entity’s systems, created according to an
         algorithm (software) based on information already included in the books.


1.3.3.       Elements of accounting vouchers


1.3.3.1.       Requirements of the Accounting Act

Every accounting voucher must include very specific elements, listed in art. 21 of the
Accounting Act.

These elements are presented in the table below.

    the signature of the individual
    responsible for such indication


Accounting documents are not an element of books of accounts, so they may be prepared in
a foreign language 6. However, the Act requires that in such a situation, at the request of
inspection authorities or an auditor, documents indicated by them written in a foreign
language should be reliably translated into Polish.


1.3.3.2.       Control and account assignment of accounting vouchers

Elements of an accounting voucher include:
•        Confirmation of verification – control,
•        Confirmation of approval for recognition in books of accounts – account assignment.

Accounting documents undergo formal, substantive and calculation control.

The entity records principles of control and account assignment of accounting vouchers in
the documentation determining the principles of bookkeeping – the accounting policy.
Same documentation may specify principles allowing omission of confirmation of
verification stated on the voucher, as well as account assignment, if so stipulated by
techniques for making accounting entries.


1.3.3.3.     VAT invoices

A VAT invoice is an accounting voucher, with respect to which tax regulations have
requirements far more detailed than those stemming from the Accounting Act.

Thus, a VAT invoice must meet requirements stemming from:
•       the Accounting Act
•       VAT Act – art. 106e of the Act of 11 March 2004 on goods and services tax
•       Regulation of Minister of Finance of 3.12.2013 on issuing invoices.


1.3.4.     Correcting errors in source documents

Errors in accounting vouchers are corrected in a following manner:

           Type of voucher                            Manner of correction

    Entity’s external vouchers      Sending a relevant document containing a rectification
                                    and providing reasons for this, unless other regulations
    Third party external vouchers   stipulate otherwise



                                                                                          29

                                     Crossing out any erroneous text or amounts, preserving
                                     the legibility of the crossed out expressions or figures,
    Internal vouchers                and inserting the correct text as well as the date of the
                                     correction and the signature of the authorized individual,
                                     unless other regulations stipulate otherwise


1.3.5.     Attributes of accounting vouchers

According to art. 22 par. 1 of Accounting Act, accounting vouchers should be:
•       reliable – consistent with the actual course of the business transaction to which they
        pertain,
•       complete – containing at least the details specified in the Act,
•       free from any calculation errors.



1.4.       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (ENTITY)


1.4.1.     Definition of financial statements

The Accounting Act does not provide a definition of financial statements in the glossary (art.
3 par. 1). It focuses more on elements and attributes of financial statements.


1.4.2.     Elements of financial statements

According to art. 45 par. 2 and 3 of the Accounting Act, financial statements consist of:
1)      balance sheet;
2)      profit and loss statement;
3)      supplementary information, comprising an introduction to the financial statements as
        well as notes,
and in case of the entities specified in Article 64 par. 1, subject to mandatory annual audit,
also:
4)      statement of cash flows, and
5)      statement of changes in equity.

According to art. 45 par. 4, annual financial statements are accompanied by a management
report, if the obligation to prepare such a report results from the Act or separate legal



                                                                                             30
regulations. Provision of art. 49 par. 1 states, that companies, limited joint-stock
partnerships, mutual insurance companies, mutual reinsurance companies, cooperatives
and State-owned companies must also prepare a management report.

Scope of individual financial statements was specified in Annexes to the Act, separately for:
•        entities from so-called “general sector”, i.e. other than banks, insurance companies
         and reinsurance companies – in Annex No. 1 to the Act,
•        banks – in Annex No. 2 to the Act,
•        insurance companies and reinsurance companies – in Annex No. 3 to the Act
•        for micro entities – in Annex No. 4 to the Act.


1.4.3.        Micro entities – scope of simplifications

The Act envisages a possibility of certain simplifications in preparation of financial
statements for micro entities, definition of which is provided in par. 1a of the Account Act:

                             Art. 3 par. 1a and 1b of the Accounting Act

                                            Micro Entities
    1.    commercial companies and partnerships (including those under organization), civil
          partnerships, other legal entities as well as branches of foreign companies (in the
          understanding of the regulations on freedom of business activity), if:
          •      in the financial year for which it is preparing the financial statements and in
                 the preceding financial year
          •      and in case of entities commencing their operation in the given financial
                 year, in the year in which they commenced their activity, have not exceeded
                 at least two of following three figures:
                 a)   total assets as of the end of financial year did not exceed 1.500.000
                      PLN
                 b)   net revenues from sales of goods and services for the financial year
                      did not exceed 3.000.000 PLN
                 c)   average annual employment calculated as full time jobs did not
                      exceed 10 people
    2.    associations, trade unions, organizations of employers, economic chambers,
          foundations, representative offices of foreign enterprises, social and professional
          organizations of farmers, organizations of professional self-government,
          organizations of artisan self-government and Polish Office of Motor Insurance




                                                                                                   31
             Companies - if they do not conduct business activity;
    3.       individuals, civil partnerships of individuals, general partnerships of individuals,
             and professional partnerships, if their net proceeds from sales of goods, products
             and financial operations
             •     for the previous financial year;
             •     in case of entities commencing their activity or bookkeeping in compliance
                   with Accounting Act – in the year, in which they commenced their activity or
                   bookkeeping in compliance with Accounting Act;
             amounted to 1.200.000 EUR ≤ Equivalent in Polish currency ≤ 2.000.000 EUR
    4.       individuals, civil partnerships of individuals, general partnerships of individuals,
             and professional partnerships which keep books of accounts voluntarily, if their
             revenues (in accordance with art. 2 par. 2 of the Accounting Act) amounted to less
             than Equivalent in Polish currency ≤ 1.200.000 EUR

    A necessary condition for the entities meeting the above requirements to become
    micro entities is a decision of the approving body to prepare the financial statements
    with simplifications envisaged for micro entities by the Accounting Act.

    Since for those entities the Act envisages meeting specified criteria for two financial
    years, it specifies, that micro entities are also entities, which:
    5.       have applied simplifications envisaged by the Act for micro entities in preparing
             their financial statements for the previous financial year, and
    6.       in the financial year, for which the financial statement is prepared, or in the
             preceding financial year, they have exceeded two of following three figures:
             a)    total assets as of the end of financial year did not exceed 1.500.000 PLN
             b)    net revenues from sales of goods and services for the financial year did not
                   exceed 3.000.000 PLN
             c)    average annual employment calculated as full time jobs did not exceed 10
                   people



Following entities cannot be micro entities regardless of the level of revenues:
•        public finance sector entities,
•        entities operating in the financial market, in particular:
         o        banks
         o        insurance companies,
         o        credit unions,


                                                                                                  32
•       entities applying or intending to apply for permits to operate based on provisions of:
        o     Banking law,
        o     Securities law,
        o     Insurance and reinsurance activity regulations,
        o     Investment funds,
        o     Pension funds,
        o     Credit unions.

The Act envisages following simplifications in financial statements of micro entities:

                  Act of law                                    Micro entity:
    Art.46 par. 5 pt 4);                     May prepare the balance sheet and profit and loss
    Art. 47 par. 4 pt 4)                     statement in the format provided in Annex No. 4
                                             to the Accounting Act

    Art. 48. par. 3 of the Accounting Act    May not prepare notes to financial statements (if
                                             specified conditions are met)

    Art. 48a. par. 3 of the Accounting Act   May not prepare the statement of changes in
                                             equity

    Art. 48b. par. 4 of the Accounting Act   May not prepare cash flows statement

    Art. 49. par. 4 of the Accounting Act    May not prepare management report (if specified
                                             conditions are met)


Application of these simplifications in micro entities is not mandatory and depends on the
decision of the approving body. However, making a decision to apply the simplifications
requires updating the accounting policy.


1.4.4.      Other entities – scope of simplifications

The Accounting Act envisages also other simplifications in scope of financial statements:

          Act of law                    Entity                           Exemption
    Art. 45. par. 3 of the   Investment funds                Prepare a statement of changes
    Accounting Act                                           in net assets (instead of
                                                             statement of changes in equity)

    Art. 45. par. 3a of      Open investment funds;          No obligation to prepare the
    the Accounting Act       Specialized investment funds    statement of cash flows



                                                                                                 33
                           Art. 50 par. 2 and 4 of the Accounting Act

 Entities from the so-called “general sector” (other than credit unions) which have not
 achieved two of the following three figures in the financial year for which it is preparing
 the financial statements and in the preceding financial year:
 a)      average annual employment calculated as full time jobs did not exceed 50
         people
 b)      total assets as of the end of financial year did not exceed the equivalent of
         2.000.000 EUR in Polish currency
 c)      net revenues from sales of goods and services for the financial year did not
         exceed the equivalent of 4.000.000 EUR in Polish currency
 may prepare their financial statements in simplified format, i.e. presenting only the
 items marked with Roman letters and numerals in Annex No. 1 to the Accounting Act.

                           Art. 50 par. 1 and 3 of the Accounting Act

 The information included in the financial statements, as listed in Annexes to the Act,
 may be:
 a)      more detailed, depending on the needs and specific profile of the entity
 b)      omitted, if there is no information pertaining to the respective items of the
         financial statements of an entity for a financial year and for the preceding financial
         year



1.4.5.    Language and currency

                                  Art. 5 of the Accounting Act

                              Financial statements* are prepared:

               in Polish language                                in Polish currency

* and management report


As in case of books of accounts (art. 9), the Accounting Act consistently imposes an
obligation to use Polish language and Polish currency, however numerical data can be
represented rounded to full thousands of PLN, if it does not result in misstatement of the
entity’s view presented in the financial statements and management report.




                                                                                              34
1.4.6.    Preparing financial statements – responsibility and deadlines

                                 Art. 52 of the Accounting Act

 Manager of the entity is responsible for accounting in the entity, which includes
 responsibility for preparing financial statements (art. 4. par. 3 pt 5). Even in a situation in
 which certain obligations are assigned to a third party with his/her/its consent, manager
 of the entity retains responsibility for supervision.

 In particular, the Accounting Act states, that the manager:
 •     ensures preparation of annual financial statements, financial statements for other
       balance sheet dates, as specified in art. 12 par. 2 of the Act, as well as
       management report, if required, no later than three months after the balance
       sheet date (art. 52 par. 1-3)
 •       submits financial statements for auditing (mandatory or voluntary)
 •       submits them to the approving body in accordance with the legal regulations
         applicable to the entity, as well as the provisions of the statutes or articles of
         association (art. 52 par. 1)

 3 months after balance sheet date is the final deadline for preparation of financial
 statements.

 Financial statements should be signed by the individual in charge of keeping the books
 of accounts and by the manager of the entity, and if the entity is under the direction of a
 governing body composed of more than one member, by all members of the body,
 specifying the date of the signature. A refusal to sign (by any of the above persons)
 requires a written justification that should be attached to the financial statements.



1.4.7.    Approving financial statements – responsibility and deadlines

                                 Art. 53 of the Accounting Act

 Annual financial statements and management report (if such were prepared) of an
 entity are subject to approval by its approving body as indicated in the company’s
 statutes or articles of association, by no later than six months from the balance sheet
 date.

 If the entity is subject to mandatory audit, as per art. 64 par. 1 of the Accounting Act,
 financial statements must be audited before being submitted for approval.

 As per par. 2a, financial statements of entities that have been declared bankrupt are not



                                                                                               35
 subject to approval.

 The annual financial statements of a branch of a foreign business entity are considered
 to have been approved if the financial statements of the foreign business entity covering
 the data of that branch have been approved.



1.4.8.   Penalties and sanctions as per the Accounting Act and the Act on KRS

As per art. 77 pt 2 of the Accounting Act, whoever, contrary to the provisions of this Act,
allows that financial statements are not prepared, is liable to a fine or imprisonment of up
to two years, or both. Whosoever, contrary to the provisions of the Act, fails to submit
financial statements or management reports to the relevant court register, fails to make
available to partners financial statements and other documents referred to in Article 68 of
the Act is also liable to a fine or penalty of restriction of liberty, as per art. 79 of the
Accounting Act.

A fine is also envisaged for failing to submit financial statements to the relevant court
register. Since 1 January 2015, pursuant to art. 24 par. 1 of the Act on National Court
Register, in case of finding that documents which are mandatory for submission were not
submitted within deadline, the register court initially calls the obligated party to submit such
documents, setting an additional 7 day deadline. If the party fails to submit the documents
by then, the register court imposes a fine, envisaged in the provisions of Code of Civil
Procedure on enforcement of non-monetary obligations (coercive proceedings).

If, despite the call of the court, the entity failed to file its financial statements for two
subsequent financial years, register court initiates ex officio proceedings to disband the
entity entered into the register without undergoing liquidation procedure. This stems from
art. 25a par. 1 of the Act on National Court Register (KRS). Pursuant to art. 5 of the Act of 28
November 2014 amending the Act on KRS, abovementioned dissolution proceedings are
initiated also in case of failure to submit annual financial statements for two subsequent
financial years, despite being called to do so by the court, pursuant to provisions which
remained in force until 31 December 2014, if obligations relating to the statements are not
fulfilled within 6 months from 1 January 2015, i.e. by end of June 2015.


1.4.9.   Penal sanctions stemming from the tax penal code

Since 1 January 2015 – pursuant to art. 80b of the Tax Penal Code – an entity which submits
its financial statement in the tax office after the deadline envisaged in tax law (art. 27
par. 2 of CIT Act and 45 par. 5 of PIT Act) may expect to be fined for a tax misdemeanor. In
light of art. 48 of Tax Penal Code, the fine amount may range from one tenth to twenty




                                                                                             36
times the minimum wage, unless the Code states otherwise. Currently, the amount may
range from 175 PLN to 35.000 PLN.



1.5.      STORAGE


1.5.1.    The notion of “files”

                                          FILES MAY BE STORED:

         art. 73 par.1                                          art. 73 par.4
       Within the entity           Outside the entity – in the event that they are transferred for
                                  storage to another entity providing document storage services

                                                                  art. 11a
                                  The entity is obligated to:
                                  •   notify the relevant revenue office of the place where the
                                      books of accounts are kept within 15 days of releasing the
                                      books
                                  •   ensure availability of the books of accounts along with
                                      accounting vouchers for authorized external inspection or
                                      supervision authorities at the head office or place of
                                      management of the entity, or at a different place with the
                                      consent of the inspection or supervision authority


The files are stored:
•       in their original form,

        kept,
•       classified by reporting periods,
•       in a manner ensuring their easy retrieval.

The files of entities that have discontinued their operations as a result of a business
combination with another entity or transformation of their legal form should be stored by
the surviving entity.

The files of entities that have been liquidated should be stored by an appointed individual or
entity; relevant court or other authority maintaining a register or record of business
activities as well as the revenue office must be informed about the place of storage of such
files.

accounting vouchers pertaining to revenues from retail sales, accounting vouchers
concerning construction in progress, bank and non-bank loans and commercial contracts,
claims pursued in civil proceedings or covered by criminal or tax proceedings.




                                                                                            39

       STORAGE PERIODS ABOVE SHOULD BE CALCULATED STARTING FROM THE YEAR
        FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL YEAR TO WHICH THE RESPECTIVE FILES PERTAIN.


When determining records storage periods, one should also remember regulations set forth
in specific provisions of the law, which are not analyzed for the purposes of this study.


1.5.5.     Records storage in case of computer-assisted bookkeeping


1.5.5.1.    Books of accounts

In case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, data protection should consist of (pursuant to
art. 71 par. 2 of the Accounting Act):
•      using damage-proof data carriers,
•      selecting appropriate external protection measures,
•      systematically creating backup copies of data files recorded on IT data carriers,
       provided that the accounting system information is durably recorded, for a time no
       shorter than the time required for the storage of books of accounts,
•      ensuring protection of computer software and IT accounting system data by using
       appropriate software and organizational solutions protecting against unauthorized
       access or destruction.

If above conditions are met, books of accounts may take the form of files recorded on IT
data carriers.

If the above conditions are not met, the records should be printed out within the time limits
prescribed.


1.5.5.2.    Accounting vouchers

Following the approval of financial statements, the contents of accounting vouchers may be
transferred to IT data carriers ensuring that the vouchers’ content is permanently
preserved. However, a condition to using such a method of data storage is that the entity
should possess devices making it possible to retrieve the vouchers in the form of a printout,
unless other legal regulations provide otherwise.

Above storage methods do not apply to:



                                                                                          41
•       documents concerning transfers of property rights to immovable property,
•       assignment of responsibility for assets,
•       significant contracts,
•       other important documents specified by the manager of the entity.


1.5.6.      Granting access to files

In accordance with requirements of art. 75, the files can be made available to a third party:
1.      for review on the premises of the entity – with required consent of the entity’s
        manager or an individual authorized by him/her,
2.      outside the head office of the entity’s (branch’s) management – with the written
        consent of the entity’s manager and provided that a confirmed list of the documents
        taken away is left at the entity,

Other legal regulations may regulate access to files otherwise.


1.5.7.      Electronic invoices

Since 1 January 2013, Regulation of the Minister of Finance of 20 December 2012 on
transmitting invoices in electronic format, principles of storage and procedures for providing
access to internal revenue bodies or tax inspection bodies has been in force.

According to § 6.1. invoices sent in electronic format are to be preserved, divided by
settlement periods, in any manner which ensures:
•       authenticity of origin, integrity of content, and legibility of invoices, from the moment
        of issuance until the moment of expiration of tax obligation,
•       easy retrieval,
•       immediate access to invoices granted to internal revenue bodies or tax inspection
        bodies, on demand, in compliance with separate regulations.

Authenticity of origin and integrity of content have been defined in the Regulation.

                                        The invoices are stored:

             § 6. 2.                                          § 6. 3.

     On the territory of the      Outside the territory of the country, provided that the invoices
            country                are stored in electronic format in a manner enabling internal
                                 revenue bodies or tax inspection bodies to gain online access to
                                      such invoices via means of electronic communication.



                                                                                                 42
      Invoices sent in electronic format and stored in same format are made available to
      internal revenue bodies and tax inspection bodies in a manner enabling immediate
                      download and processing of data contained therein.




1.6.        PROVISION OF BOOKKEEPING SERVICES

The matter of providing bookkeeping services is regulated in Chapter 8a of the Accounting
Act. Due to expected deregulation of the profession, only the most important matters will
be indicated in this study.


1.6.1.      Scope of the term

Art. 76a par. 1 defines the matter of bookkeeping services as follows:

                       keeping books of accounts, based on accounting vouchers, containing
                             records of events in a chronological and systematic order

    Bookkeeping        periodically determining or checking by way of stocktaking the actual
    services are a                        balances of assets and liabilities
    business             measuring the value of assets and liabilities and determining the
    activity                                     financial result
    covering:                              preparing financial statements
                          collecting and storing accounting vouchers as well as the other
                                        documentation specified in the Act


Business entities performing the activity in scope of bookkeeping services are also
authorized to perform activities covering:
•       keeping tax books and other records for tax purposes, for and on behalf of taxpayers,
        tax remitters and collectors, and providing assistance to them in this field,
•       preparing, for and on behalf of tax payers, tax remitters and collectors, tax returns and
        declarations, or providing assistance to them in this field.


1.6.2.      Persons and entities licensed to provide bookkeeping services

Until 9 August 2014, entities licensed to provide bookkeeping services were:
•       Individuals holding an accountancy certificate,
•       Individuals entered into the register of statutory auditors,



                                                                                               43
•      Individuals entered on the tax advisors list.

The individuals referred to above could use the assistance of non-licensed individuals. In
such cases, they were obliged to ensure constant and direct supervision over the
performance of such activities.

Activity in scope of bookkeeping services could be performed by:
•      business entities which are individuals, if they were licensed to perform activities
       concerning bookkeeping services,
•      other business entities, provided that the activities were performed by individuals
       licensed to perform bookkeeping services.

Changes, introduced by Act of 9 May 2014 on facilitation of access to certain regulated
professions (Journal of Laws of 2014, item 768), as of 10 August 2014 have repealed the
obligation for providers of bookkeeping services to hold an accountancy certificate form the
Ministry of Finance. Now, bookkeeping services may be provided by any person who meets
jointly the following conditions, as per art. 76a par. 3 and 76h par. 1:
•      has full capacity to perform legal acts and has not been convicted of offences against
       document credibility, property, business dealings or dealings in money and securities,
       or of tax offences or the acts specified in Chapter 9 of the Act (listed in pt 1.6.4.), and
•      holds a third party liability insurance contract against damages caused in connection
       with carrying out the business activity.


1.6.3.     Scope of responsibility

                               Art. 4. par. 5 of the Accounting Act

    The manager of an entity is responsible for the performance of the accounting
    obligations specified by the Act, including for supervision, also if certain accounting
    obligations, save for the responsibility for physical stocktaking, are assigned to a third
    party with his/her/its consent.


Pt 24 of the Position of Accounting Standards Committee also states, that “outsourcing
bookkeeping to an enterprise offering services in scope of bookkeeping does not relieve the
manager of the entity from the responsibility for performing their duties in scope of
accounting”.

Further on, the standard indicates, that the manager of the entity should carefully select the
entity providing bookkeeping services, ensure inclusion of relevant clauses in the contract,
and control compliance with conditions of the contract.



                                                                                               44
1.6.4.       Penalties and sanctions as per the Accounting Act

Accounting Act, in Chapter 9, specifies criminal liability applicable also in case of providing
bookkeeping services.

Liability pertains to:
•        failure to meet the requirements of no criminal record as set forth in art. 76a par. 3.
•        failure to meet the obligation of entering into a third party liability insurance contract,
         as specified in art. 76h par. 1.

Sanctions, envisaged in art. 77 of the Accounting Act are a fine or restriction of liberty.


1.6.5.       Penal sanctions stemming from the tax penal code

Providing bookkeeping services results in liability stemming in particular from 7:
•        Tax penal code,
•        Penal code,
•        Civil code,
•        Act on counteracting money laundering and financing terrorism .

              2. ANALYSIS OF INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS


2.1.       ACCOUNTING IN FRANCE


2.1.1.     Background and legal basis

French accounting system is based on the continental model 8. In many area it is modeled
after German accounting system. It is to a large extent determined by the influence of tax
regulations, but accounting principles are independent from tax principles.

Accounting in France does not have a long tradition, or strong theory, and is treated first
and foremost as a practical discipline 9.

The main act of law, regulating the principles of French accounting and chart of accounts is
the Plan Comptable General (PCG), enacted by Regulation No. 99-03 of 29 April 1999. In
translation, Plan Comptable General means General Chart of Accounts.

Major part of issues related to bookkeeping was set forth in Code de Commerce – French
Commercial Code.

Regulations in scope of documentation can also be found in tax regulations, especially those
in scope of VAT, and in following documents:
•      Livre des procedures fiscales – the book of tax proceedings,
•      Code civil – the Civil Code.


2.1.2.     Plan Comptable General – General Chart of Accounts - PCG

General Chart of Accounts (PCG) comprises the following five parts:
•      Title I – Principles and objectives of accounting,
•      Title II - Definitions of assets, liabilities, revenues and costs,
•      Title III – Principles of recognition and measurement,
•      Title IV – Maintenance, structure and operation of accounts,
•      Title V - Financial statements.




8
  The continental model is characterized by subordinating accounting to information needs of the government,
and as a result, in France it’s the government that issues regulations in scope of accounting.

Issues in scope of bookkeeping are presented in Title IV – Maintenance, structure and
operation of accounts. Main provisions are set forth in articles 410-1 to 410-6 and 420-1 to
420-6.


2.1.2.1.   Language and currency

                                      art. 410-1 of PCG

                                  Accounting is conducted:

             in national language                            in national currency


Transactions expressed in foreign currencies may remain untranslated until the closing of
the year – however, it must be justified by specificity and nature of the entity’s operation.
In such cases, only balance of the account is translated into national currency as of the day
of closing the financial year.


2.1.2.2.   Accounting policy

In order to enable understanding of operation of the information processing system and its
control, documentation is prepared describing procedures and organization of accounting.
This documentation is stored as long, as presentation of accounting documents, to which it
pertains, is required. The act does not list required content of such documentation.


2.1.2.3.   Data processing

Computer-assisted bookkeeping requires access to documentation pertaining to data
analysis, processing and programming. The objective of such access – among other things –
is to enable testing necessary to verify the conditions of entering and storing documentation
(data).

Any and all accounting data entered into the processing system is recorded in a legible
format:
•    on paper,
•    or on any carrier ensuring the possibility to use it as evidence.


2.1.2.4.   Books of accounts

Article 410-6 of PCG lists books of accounts as the journal, general ledger and inventory
book, and every entity applying the PCG is obligated to keep these books.
The journal and the inventory book must be numbered and initialed.



                                                                                          47
Written, electronic versions of documents may serve as the journal and inventory books, if
they are identifiable and if they are numbered and dated from the moment they were
created in a manner ensuring the possibility of using them as evidence.


2.1.2.5.   Accounting entries

Entries made in the journal are segregated in the general ledger in order of the applied chart
of accounts.

Journal and general ledger are divided into as many subsidiary journals and subsidiary
ledgers as necessary due to specific nature of the entity. Entries in subsidiary journals and
ledgers must be summarized (sum total) at least once a month in the journal and general
ledger.


2.1.2.6.   Inventory

Every entity must verify inventory data at least once every twelve months.
Stocktaking is a confirmation of all assets and liabilities identified by number and value as of
the day of stocktaking. Stocktaking data is preserved and organized in such a manner as to
justify the content of each item in the balance sheet.


2.1.2.7.   Principles of creating records

Entries are made in accordance with double-entry method.

All accounting entries indicate origin, content and designation of each data item and refer to
the documentation which was the basis for entry.

Every entry is based on a dated document, prepared on paper or in a manner which ensures
its reliability, durability and possibility to retrieve its contents for the required period of
time. Transactions of the same type, performed on the same day and at the same place
may be reflected in a single collective document.

Documents are arranged in order specified in the documentation – description of
accounting procedures and organization (accounting policy).

Entries are made in the journal:
•    day after day, transaction after transaction,
•    or by listing, at least once a month, totals of transactions, on condition that all
     documents enabling verification of such transactions day after day, transaction after
     transaction are preserved.

Definitive character of records in the journal and the inventory book is ensured by:



                                                                                             48
•      in case of computer-assisted records – approval procedure, which prohibits any
       changes or deletion of entries,
•       in case of other records – no interruptions of entries and no changes made.

Closing procedure, intended to maintain chronology and ensure that enters are unalterable,
is performed no later than at the end of the next period.

In case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, if transaction date pertains to a period already
closed, transaction is recorded on the first day of the period not yet closed.


2.1.2.8.     Summary

PCG provides general framework for bookkeeping. It does not regulate the details. In many
instances, it refers to the matters of electronic documentation and data processing.
Significant importance is attached to security of data processing systems. PCG does not
refer to the matter of storage of documents, or level of detail of subsidiary records.

It is a general document, which however determines the most important issues.


2.1.3.     Code de Commerce – French Commercial Code

Provisions pertaining to accounting in scope of bookkeeping were placed, among others, in
articles L123-12, L123-22 and L123-23.

                         Entries, recording transactions which have an impact on the entity’s
                                        assets are made in chronological order.

    Provisions of               Stocktaking is performed at least once every 12 months.
    Code de                Accounting documents are kept in EUR and in French language.

statements



2.1.4.     Livre des procedures fiscales – the book of tax proceedings

This act of law contains the principles for presenting accounting documents during
inspection by entities (taxpayers) and required storage periods for tax purposes. These
regulations were included in this study, as it is necessary to apply them in bookkeeping.


                                                                                                             49
2.1.4.1.   Presentation of accounting documents

In case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, inspection covers all information and data
processed in the IT systems, which indirectly or directly contribute to calculation or tax
results and to preparation of mandatory declarations. Inspection also covers documentation
pertaining to data analysis, processing and programming.


2.1.4.2.   Inspection of electronic invoices

Inspection conducted by tax officials is intended to ensure confirmation of authenticity of
origin, integrity of content and legibility of invoices issued or received by the taxpayer. For
this purpose, all information, documents, data, IT systems and information processing
systems are subject to inspection, as well as the documentation describing how data is
processed. If inspection covers electronic documents, they have to be made available in
electronic version.

If above verification cannot be performed, or if the inspection conducted does not
guarantee authenticity of origin, integrity of content and legibility of invoices – the
documents will not be considered original invoices.


2.1.4.3.   Records storage periods

Books, registers and other documents must be preserved for a period of six years form the
date of last operation recorded in the books or the last date at which an entry was made. All
information, data, documents, IT systems and information processing systems must be
preserved for this period.

If documents mentioned above are prepared or maintained in an electronic format, they
should be stored in same format for a period at least equal to period mentioned above.

Original documents pertaining to transactions, which constitute a basis for deductions with
respect to sales tax are stored for a period of 6 years.
Documentation pertaining to data analysis, processing and programming should be
preserved until the end of the third year following the year to which it pertains.

Invoices in hardcopy must be stored on the territory of France. Invoices stored in electronic
format may be stored outside of the territory of France, on condition that quick access to
compete data is possible via Internet. Invoices in electronic format cannot be stored in a
country, which does not have a cooperation agreement with France or which does not
provide direct online access to the entirety of data for the purpose of downloading and use.

Invoices must be stored in their original form – paper or electronic – in which they were
submitted or made available.




                                                                                            50
Taxpayers are obligated to inform relevant authorities about the place where invoices are
stored if it is located outside the territory of France, as well as any changes in that respect.


2.1.5.      Code civil – the Civil Code

For evidence purposes, Code civil equates electronic documents with paper documents.

                                        Art. 1316-1 Code civil

     An electronic document is admissible as evidence in a case, same as a paper document,
     on condition that the person who created it can be identified and on condition that it is
     created and stored in conditions which ensure its integrity.




2.2.        ACCOUNTING IN GERMANY


2.2.1.      Background and legal basis

In literature, it is stated that German accounting system is based on the continental model.
In 2009 German accounting law was modernized, and certain elements of Anglo-Saxon
accounting model were introduced into the German model. This may mean, that in
Germany, a hybrid accounting model is gradually being established 10.

Main acts of law, which regulate accounting in Germany are:
•       Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB) – commercial code,
•       Abgabeordnung (AO) – tax ordinance.

Depending on ownership format of the entity, detailed regulations in scope of records and
reporting are provided in following acts of legislation 11:
•       Act on limited liability companies (GmbH – Gesetz),
•       Act on shareholding companies (GmbH – Gesetz),
•       Act on publication of financial statements (Publizita(a)tsgesetz),
•       Act on cooperatives (Genoessenschaftsgesetz).

Accounting in Germany is also regulated by:

Accounting documentation must be kept in such a manner as to enable an external expert
to obtain – in a reasonable timeframe – information about business transaction and
standing of the entity. Documentation must be legible.

Since every entry in books of accounts must be confirmed by a source document,
enterprises are obligated to keep a true copy of the sent document.


2.2.2.2.   Language

Par. 239 of HGB states, that books of accounts are to be kept in a living language.

they were made originally or later.


2.2.2.4.   Accounting entries and accounting documents – data carriers

Books of accounts and accounting documents pertaining to them may also be placed in an
orderly binder or be kept on data carriers in accordance with the procedure applied by the
entity (i.e. in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices). In such a case,
availability of data must be ensured throughout the entire storage period so that they can
be retrieved at any moment and in reasonable time. If using data carriers, the entity is
obligated to ensure that bookkeeping entries and accounting documents meet the
requirements described in pt 2.2.2.3.



                                                                                           53
2.2.2.5.     Stocktaking

Stocktaking is mentioned in par. 240 of HGB.

including value of individual assets, as well as debt, as of the day of commencement of
operation.

At the end of every financial year the enterprise is obligated to conduct stocktaking. HGB
does not specify methods or terms of stocktaking. According to the regulations, in case of
fixed assets and fast turnover fixed value inventory which is not of primary importance for
the entity, stocktaking may be conducted every three years.


2.2.2.6.     Storage

Records storage is regulated by par. 257 of HGB.

Subject and periods of storage are presented in the table below.

     reasonable timeframe. Transactions must be possible to trace from the moment of
     origination to the moment of completion.
2.   Books of accounts and accounting vouchers relating to them must be kept in a
     complete, correct, timely and ordered manner.
3.   Books of accounts and documents pertaining to them must be kept in a living
     language. Using languages other than German may result in necessity to translate,
     upon demand of an internal revenue body. If abbreviations, numbers, letters or

5.   Books of accounts and accounting vouchers may be also placed in an ordered
     document binder, or on data carriers, provided they conform with the accounting
     form, including procedures applied, in compliance with principles of proper
     accounting.




                                                                                           55
6.       If books of accounts and accounting documents are kept on data carriers, it must be

2.2.3.3.        Storage of accounting documents

As per German tax ordinance, principles of storage are as follows:
1.       Books of accounts, accounting entries, inventory, annual financial statements,
         management reports, opening balances, as well as instructions necessary for
         understanding them and other organization documents, as well as accounting
         vouchers, are stored for a period of 10 years,
2.       Offers received, business and commercial letters, copies of sent commercial and
         business letters, as well as other documents important for the purpose of taxation are
         stored for a period of 6 years.

Storage period starts at the end of the calendar year in which the last entry was made in the
books of accounts, inventory was created, opening balance sheet was prepared, financial
statements were prepared, commercial letters were sent or received, or an accounting
document was created.

In scope of storage on data carriers, following regulations are in place:
1.       Accounting documents – other than financial statements and opening balances - may
         also be stored as a reproduction on image carriers or other data carriers, provided
         they meet generally accepted accounting principles and ensure that copied documents
         legible and available throughout the entire storage period at any time.
2.       When storing documents in form of reproduction on image carriers or other data
         carries, the enterprise is obligated to provide, at its own expense, tools necessary to
         ensure legibility of documents.
3.       If the enterprise uses a data processing system, internal revenue bodies must have the
         right to access stored data and to use the data processing system for analysis of such
         documents.


2.2.4.       Grundsa(a)tze ordnungsma(a)ss(ss)iger Buchfu(u)hrung – principles of
             proper accounting - GoB

These are the principles of bookkeeping and preparing financial statements, partially
codified in HGB, and partially stemming from customary norms, business practice,
recommendations and interpretations of various institutions.15

In German accounting law, the most important principles of proper accounting – referring to
principles of accounting – are as follows 16:
1.     Books of accounts should be reliable and transparent.
2.     Business transactions should be recorded in a complete, correct and timely manner.
3.     Entries must not be made without source documents.
4.     Original content of bookkeeping entries must not become illegible, and in case of
       computer-assisted bookkeeping, accounting entries should be protected from
       deletion.
5.     All accounting documents and arrangements, other than the balance sheet, may be
       stored in electronic format, provided that data contained therein can be read in
       printout form or on screen.
6.     Accounting documentation, including: books of accounts, stocktaking documents,
       opening and closing balances, as well as source documents, should be stored for ten
       years; business correspondence should be sorted for six years.


2.2.5.    Summary

German regulations tackle the most important issues. They provide a framework for
principles of proper accounting GoB. Accounting law and tax law are highly aligned. The
regulations refer to the matters of electronic documentation in a general manner, setting
only the framework for it, but with significant emphasis on creating conditions ensuring
security of books of accounts and underlying accounting vouchers.

2.3.1.    Background and legal basis

UK is a typical representative of countries which apply the Anglo-Saxon model of
accounting 17.

Sources of law in scope of British accounting are:
•      Companies Act 2006 – British Act on companies – in particular sections 15 and 37,
•      accounting standards,
•      jurisprudence,

•         provisions of acts on VAT and on income taxes.


2.3.2.       Companies Act 2006 – British Act on companies


2.3.2.1.       Accounting documentation

British Act on companies, in Section 386, determines that every company must maintain
appropriate accounting documentation.

                                Appropriate accounting documentation

     is documentation which is sufficient to:
     1)     Present and explain business transactions of the entity,
     2)     Disclose with due diligence – at any time – current situation of the entity,
     3)     Enable ensuring compliance of all documents with applicable regulations.


Accounting documentation must include in particular:
1.        daily records of amounts received and paid by the entity, including description of
          transactions to which such inflow or outflow pertained,
2.        recognition of the entity’s assets and liabilities.

Additionally, if the entity trades in inventory, its accounting documentation must contain:
1.        documents stating the balance of inventory at the end of each financial year,
2.        stocktaking documents, based on which documentation from pt 1 was prepared,
3.        documents confirming sales and purchase of inventory, containing information
          enabling identification of inventory items, to which the transaction pertained, the
          buyer and the seller (this point does not apply to sales of inventory within the
          framework of regular retail trade).


2.3.2.2.       Storage

Accounting documentation of the entity:
•         may be stored at the head office of the entity or in other place deemed appropriate by
          the management,
•         must always be available for viewing for the entity’s management.

Storage periods of accounting documentation are:
•         in case of a private company – 3 years from the day it was created,


                                                                                              58
•       in case of a public company – 6 years from the day it was created,

For tax purposes – in general – storage period is 6 years.


2.3.2.3.       Year close

The regulations do not include the notion of “year close”. It can be assumed, that year close
is to be effected within deadlines, on which the entities are obligated to submit their
financial statements to relevant registers. Those deadlines are as follows:
•       in case of a private company – 9 months from balance sheet date,
•       in case of a public company – 6 months from balance sheet date.


2.3.2.4.       Forms of records

Accounting documentation may be:
•       Recorded on paper r in electronic format,
•       arranged in a manner deemed appropriate by the management,
provided, that the information will be available in the future.

If documentation is stored in electronic format, it must be possible to print it out.


2.3.3.        Accounting standards

In UK, there is a choice between applying British accounting standards or IFRS (choice does
not apply to listed companies). Currently there are FRS standards in place, issued by
Financial Reporting Council. There is also a number of so-called Statements (SSAP), issued by
Accounting Standards Board. These however do not regulate the matter of bookkeeping,
leaving it in the discretion of the enterprises. FRS 18 is a certain exception here, as it refers
to accounting policy. It defines a general framework, that accounting policy should set.


2.3.4.        Jurisprudence

Jurisprudence plays a very important role as a source of law, due to the fact, that the legal
system is based on case law 18.


2.3.5.        Professional certification

Essentially, anyone can call themselves an accountant and provide bookkeeping services,
however there is a number of professional organizations of accountants (e.g. ACCA, ICAEW)

which certify qualifications. If someone is a member of such organization, they are
obligated to comply with the requirements set forth by such an organization.

         3. DEFINITION OF PROBLEMS DIAGNOSED DURING
              ANALYSIS OF POLISH AND INTERNATIONAL
                           REGULATIONS


3.1.     COMPARISON BETWEEN POLISH REGULATIONS AND
         REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES

In light of the characteristics of regulation in Poland, France, Germany and UK, as described
in previous chapters, one general conclusion can be drawn, namely: there is no uniform
regulation of bookkeeping principles in various countries. Nonetheless, a number of areas
can be named, which distinguish the scope of Polish regulation from other described
countries. Most important ones include issues presented in the table below:

        Area                        Poland                         Other countries

 vouchers and         doubt                              data, its security and enabling

 computer                                                inspections

  Regulations of the Accounting Act are very detailed and – one could say – exhaustive.
 However, they contain too many cases of overly detailed wording in scope of computer
                                 assisted bookkeeping.

 International regulations tend to rather provide a framework for proper bookkeeping,
     leaving details at the discretion of the users. The matter of computer assisted
 bookkeeping is most frequently mentioned in context of the need to ensure security of
    data and access, as well as understanding of data processing principles by users,
                        including in particular external inspectors.



3.2.     AREAS OF POLISH REGULATION IN NEED OF CHANGE

The Accounting Act was enacted in 1994. Vast majority of the provisions pertaining to
principles of bookkeeping come from the same period.

The Act should provide a framework more general than the current one, and detailed issues
should be regulated by National Accounting Standards, application of which should be
mandatory.

Below, we present the main identified problem areas, along with recommended directions
for change:


3.2.1.   Elimination of ambiguity and sensitivity to interpretation, caused by
         lack of regulation of definitions and notions

Wording of the Act is ambiguous and may be understood by its users differently, due to lack
of regulation of certain notion in the definitions dictionary. Examples of such notions


                                                                                        62
include: accounting voucher, financial and accounting system, final closing of the books, etc.
While the Act imposes specific requirements on the entities in scope of applying those
notions, it does not define them sufficiently, which gives rise to doubts. Another problem in
this area could be lack of uniform legal basis binding for the entities developing the
accounting policy. A good example of that could be giving the entities a choice of applying
the national accounting standards or not, which, as a consequence, leads to lack of
comparability of financial statements.


3.2.2.   Updating the regulations to include technological changes, which
         occurred in the past decade

Over the past twenty years, computer techniques of bookkeeping have been developing
very rapidly. At the moment – in current state of technology – many of the provisions of the
Accounting Act become obsolete. Examples of such provisions include: obligation that the
entity must possess software that makes it possible to obtain legible information regarding
the entries made in the books of accounts (art. 13 par. 3) and requirement that books are
kept and stored in the same place. In the first case, emergence of so-called “cloud”
technologies resulted in a situation, in which the entity no longer must possess the
software, using it on subscription basis instead. In the second case, increased popularity of
remote access and globalization of IT services have resulted in possibility of complete
decoupling the place where books are stored (the server) from the place where they are
kept by authorized persons. At the same time, as electronic documents become
increasingly common, additional concerns and problems have emerged with respect to
them, such as should be addressed in the Accounting Act.


3.2.3.   Taking into account much greater intensity and frequency of contact
         between the enterprises and foreign entities

Increasing integration of Polish market with foreign markets, as well as removing barriers to
cross-border trade, have resulted in increased number of foreign entities operating in
Poland, and a growing number of entities forming a part of capital groups. These entities
frequently use financial and accounting systems which are common for the entire
organization they are a part of, and internal procedures force greater integration with
foreign entities by e.g. remote initiation of certain processes in the financial system,
resulting in entries being made in the books of the Polish entity, developing common
accounting policies, uniform across the organization.

In light of ongoing globalization and pressure to reduce costs, an increasingly common
solution is to create large organizations providing external accounting services, so-called
shared services centers, which frequently serve entities from a number of countries,
including Poland. In such a situation, on one hand, certain solutions become problematic,



                                                                                           63
such as e.g. limitations on possibilities of outsourcing bookkeeping to enterprises from
outside the EU and European Economic Area, and on the other – there is a clear risk of
lowering the quality of accounting, due to lack of quality requirements with respect to
enterprises and individuals providing external bookkeeping services.


3.2.4.   Lack of consistency between the provisions of Accounting Act and
         other domestic legislation (e.g. tax law)

Accounting Act, being an act of law, should be consistent with regulations of other branches
of the law. Unfortunately, in comparing the provisions of Accounting Act with Acts on
personal income tax and corporate income tax, in scope of requirements in scope of
reporting, and with other tax regulations Another example could be different terms for
notification in case of keeping the books outside of the entity’s head office or management
premises required by the Accounting Act and Act of 13 October 1995 on principles of
registration and identification of taxpayers and payers. Documentation storage periods also
differ between the Accounting Act and tax regulations.

Lack of uniformity of regulations and definitions (notions) in scope of areas common to
accounting and tax regulations results in interpretation concerns among the entities.


3.2.5.   Liberalization of excessively rigid terms and obligations imposed on
         enterprises, especially in the small and medium entities sector

In certain cases, provisions of the Accounting Act impose overly shot deadlines for
performance of certain activities, which may be onerous to entities, especially small and
medium ones. Examples of such provisions include: too short deadlines for printing out
certain reports (e.g. for trial balances for the financial year – art.24 par. 5 pt 2) or closing
books of accounts after the day ending the financial year (art. 12 par. 2).

The Act also imposes certain obligations on the entities, such as e.g. preparation of a
monthly trial balance, which in case of entities reporting on a cycle different than monthly is
an additional, unjustified burden. Another example could be very long storage periods for
certain documents, with no regard to the fact, that information contained therein after a
certain period becomes “obsolete” and is no longer useful.

Another reason for doubts is putting all of the responsibility for quality of books of accounts
on manager of the entity, especially in situations, in which the manager has outsourced
bookkeeping to another entity providing bookkeeping services. Manager of the entity often
is not qualified to enforce such supervision. In combination with relaxed requirements with
respect to persons providing bookkeeping services, introduced in 2014, it may increase the
risk of deteriorated quality of the books.




                                                                                             64
3.2.6.   Elimination of excessive detail in defining parameters in exchange for
         definition of general principles

In some places, the provisions of Accounting Act define scope of certain reports, e.g. format
of subsidiary ledgers (art. 16 par. 1) in excessive detail, which also seems unnecessary. This
leads to additional costs for those entities, which must adapt certain reports, which indeed
serve as auxiliary records, to the requirements of Accounting Act. Leaving the format of
analytical records to the discretion of the entity would allow a more universal nature of
provisions.


3.2.7.   Facilitation of introducing modifications during the financial year

The Accounting Act conspicuously does not regulate the possibility of introducing certain
changes during the financial year, which can be problematic for the entities. Examples
include: implementation of computer systems and possibility to adopt accounting principles
(policy) during the course of the financial year. The second issue is important for entities
which so far did not apply the provisions of the Accounting Act (e.g. sole proprietorships,
civil partnerships or general partnerships) transforming into a commercial company, during
the transition period, from preparation of the transformation plan to the day the
transformed company is entered into the National Court Register. At this point, they cannot
perform such an action unless they notify a relevant tax office before the beginning of
financial year about their intention to keep accounting records in form of books of accounts.
This limitation causes them practical problems with respect to obligations in scope of
preparing financial statements.

Proposed directions for change in regulations were collected in form of recommendations,
divided into following seven thematic groups:
•    4.1. Accounting policy
•    4.2. Books of accounts
•    4.3. Accounting vouchers
•    4.4. Financial statements
•    4.5. Storage (archiving)
•    4.6. Provision of bookkeeping services
•    4.7. Other

Alongside each recommendation information is provided about the provision which requires
modification or act of law, which needs to be amended.

4.1.       ACCOUNTING POLICY


4.1.1.     Mandatory elements of accounting policy

                        Act of law: Art. 10. par. 1 of the Accounting Act

 An entity should possess documentation describing in Polish the accounting principles
 (policy) adopted by it, including in particular those relating to:
 1)      the definition of a financial year and the reporting periods included in it;
 2)      methods for measuring assets and liabilities and for determining the financial
         result;
 3)      the bookkeeping techniques, including at least:
         a)    an internal chart of accounts specifying the general ledger accounts, the
               rules adopted for classifying events, methods for keeping subsidiary ledger
               accounts as well as their links with the general ledger accounts,
         b)    a list of the books of accounts and, in the case of computer-assisted
               bookkeeping, a list of data files comprising the books of accounts on IT data
               carriers, specifying their structure, their mutual links and functions in the
               organization of all the books of accounts and in data processing,
         c)    a description of the data processing system, and in the case of computer-
               assisted bookkeeping, a description of the IT system containing a list of
               software programmes, procedures or functions, depending on the software
               structure, along with a description of the algorithms and parameters as
               well as the data protection mechanisms provided by the software
               programme including, in particular, the methods of data access control as
               well as the data processing system, and, moreover, the designation of the
               software version and the date it came into use;
 4)      the system for protecting data and data files, including accounting vouchers,
         books of accounts and other documents underlying disclosures made therein.



4.1.1.1.      Problem

Using, in pts 3b and 3c, wording incomprehensible for financial and accounting services,
with respect to computer assisted bookkeeping.



                                                                                           66
Arguments:
Accounting policy is a basic element of accounting. It is based on accounting policy that
financial and accounting services should understand principles of accounting and solutions
applied in the entity. This documentation should be first and foremost comprehensible,
legible and up-to-date. Experience shows, that most entities do have an accounting policy.
However, frequently it is only in order to meet a formal requirement. Also, in many cases
the accounting policy is not updated.

The greatest doubts and controversy are caused by the requirement to include in the
accounting policy, in case of computer-assisted bookkeeping:
•     a list of data files comprising the books of accounts on IT data carriers, specifying their
      structure, their mutual links and functions in the organization of all the books of
      accounts and in data processing
•     a description of the IT system containing a list of software programmes, procedures or
      functions, depending on the software structure, along with a description of the
      algorithms and parameters as well as the data protection mechanisms provided by the
      software programme including, in particular, the methods of data access control as
      well as the data processing system, and, moreover, the designation of the software
      version and the date it came into use;

Wording of the above paragraphs is ambiguous and understood differently by accountants
and IT specialists. As a result, sometimes it is difficult to determine unequivocally what the
accounting policy really should contain. Usually, instead of a description of the IT elements,
software instruction is attached (user manual, system description, module description, etc.)
– in general, something that will allow the entity to “defend itself” as having a complete
accounting policy, in particular at inspection time. IT companies which deliver such
documentation may be unwilling to include required descriptions and elements, as software
is usually protected by copyright. On the other hand, even if descriptions are provided, they
are usually simply incomprehensible for financial and accounting services as well as
inspectors.

From the perspective of persons, who use it systems in their daily work for bookkeeping,
description of data structure, algorithm, parameters and procedures is not important. What
is important and necessary is an up-to-date user manual which, in a comprehensible
manner, almost step by step, will take the user through methods/techniques of recognition
of a business event, preparing a report, list, valuation, etc. However, the law does not
require this kind of documentation 19.

4.1.1.2.     Recommendations

Recommendation 1:
Replacing the requirement to include in the accounting policy, in case of computer-assisted
bookkeeping:
•      a list of data files comprising the books of accounts on IT data carriers, specifying their
       structure, their mutual links and functions in the organization of all the books of
       accounts and in data processing,
•      a description of the IT system containing a list of software programmes, procedures or
       functions, depending on the software structure, along with a description of the
       algorithms and parameters as well as the data protection mechanisms provided by the
       software programme including, in particular, the methods of data access control as
       well as the data processing system, and, moreover, the designation of the software
       version and the date it came into use,
by a requirement to possess up-to-date user documentation (appropriate for the software
version in use).

                               Placement of the recommendation

    Art. 20 par. 1 of the Accounting Act Art. 10. par. 1 of the Accounting Act – modification of
                                        par. 1 pt 3 b and c.


Recommendation 2:
Responsibility for providing up-to-date user documentation should be transferred to
software vendor. Responsibility of the manager of the entity in this case should be limited
to ensuring that up-to-date user documentation is in place.

                               Placement of the recommendation

    Art. 10 par. 2 of the Accounting Act – adding a sentence setting forth responsibility of the
                  software vendor for providing up-to-date user documentation.


Recommendation 3:
Introducing, to main list of definitions, a definition of “user documentation” and indication
of elements it should include, among which, besides the detailed description of operation of
the IT system - a list of data files comprising the books of accounts on IT data carriers,
specifying their structure, their mutual links and functions in the organization of all the
books of accounts and in data processing, list of programmes (modules), principles of data
protection provided by the software.

               Art. 3. par. 1 of the Accounting Act – adding another definition.


Recommendation 4:
It is proposed to make it possible to keep user documentation in a foreign language, with
stipulation of obligation to translate it upon demand of inspection bodies or statutory
auditors. To this purpose, art. 9 could be worded: “Books of accounts are kept in the Polish
language and currency, with due regard to provision of art. 10 par. ……”, and to art. 10 a
new paragraph should be added, worded as follows: “User documentation, referred to in
art. 10 par. 1 pt 3b and 3c, may be prepared in a foreign language. In such case, upon
demand of inspection bodies or statutory auditor, reliable translation of indicated content
into Polish must be provided”.

                             Placement of the recommendation

 Art. 9 and art. 10 of the Accounting Act – modification of provisions of art. 9 and adding a
                                  new paragraph to art. 10.



4.1.2.     Application of National Accounting Standards

                       Act of law: Art. 10. par. 3 of the Accounting Act

 In matters left unregulated by the provisions of the Act, when adopting accounting
 principles (policy), entities may apply the domestic accounting standards issued by the
 Accounting Standards Committee. If no relevant domestic standard is available,
 entities other than those listed in Article 2 par. 3 may apply the IAS.


4.1.2.1.    Problem

Lack of uniform legal basis binding for the entities developing the accounting policy leads to
lack of comparability of financial statements.

Arguments:
Discretion in application of national accounting standards in cases unregulated by the law
makes financial statements incomparable. Users of financial statements may be misled – of
course, not necessarily on purpose.

It often happens, that statutory auditors are put in an uncomfortable situation as well. This
happens in case the entity applies principles significantly divergent from regulations of
national accounting standards. A good example would be provisions for employee benefits.


                                                                                            69
Currently, it turns out, national accounting standards are applied:
•      by entities which want to present reliable data in compliance with applicable
       regulations – in every case,
•      by entities which want to present reliable data in compliance with applicable
       regulations – in case their application influences presented data in line with
       expectations of the management.

If financial data resulting from application of national accounting standards is not
satisfactory for the management – it can simply be changed in a chosen area. In such a case
it is difficult to argue the obligation to apply national accounting standards with the
management.

When, during conversations with accountants, a question is asked: “Is application of
national accounting standards mandatory in Poland” response is often hesitant. Usually the
first response is affirmative. Most of survey participants have indicated that national
accounting standards are mandatory.


4.1.2.2.    Recommendations

Introduction of obligation to apply national accounting standards in cases unregulated by
the law. Exemption from the obligation for entities whose annual financial statements are
not subject to compulsory audit by statutory auditors. Exemption should be conditional on
materiality principle. Application of IAS should be left as an option in case of absence of
regulation by the law and absence of national accounting standards. We propose that in
art. 10 par. 3 – in first sentence the phrase “entities may apply” should be replaced with
“entities apply, taking into account the materiality principle” and adding par. 4 to art.10,
worded as follows: “In case annual financial statements of the entity are not subject to
compulsory audit and publication as per art. 64 par. 1, the entity may choose not to apply
the national accounting standards.”

 1.      Books of accounts consist of files of accounting entries, totals (sums of entries)
         and balances, which consist of:
         1)    The journal;
         2)    The general ledger;
         3)    Subsidiary ledgers;
         4)    Summaries: trial balances of the general ledger accounts and of the
               subsidiary ledger accounts;
         5)    A list of assets and liabilities (inventory).
 2.      In case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, accounting information resources in
         the form of separate computer data files, databases or separate parts thereof,
         irrespective of their place of origin or storage, are considered to be equivalent to
         such books of accounts.


4.2.1.1.      Problem

There is no definition of books of accounts in the Act’s list of definitions. books of accounts
is imprecise in case of computer assisted bookkeeping.

Arguments:
A notion as important as definition of books of accounts should be placed at the beginning
of the Act, in the list of definitions. Wording of par. 2 should be more precise.


4.2.1.2.      Recommendations

Placing the definition of books of accounts from art. 13 par. 1 and 2 in the list of definitions.
A modification of par. 2 is also proposed, consisting of adding, after the words “are
considered equivalent to” the words “listed in par. 1”

4.2.2.1.       Problem

There is no definition of bookkeeping in the Act’s list of definitions.

Arguments:
Explanation of the notion of bookkeeping has been included in the Position of the
Accounting Standards Committee, in pt 2 as “making records of economic events in the
books of accounts, in an organized and continuous manner, based on accounting vouchers,
as well as grouping and reconciliation thereof”. A notion as important as definition of
bookkeeping should be placed at the beginning of the Act, in the list of definitions.


4.2.2.2.       Recommendations

Implementing the provisions of pt 2 of the Position of Accounting Standards Committee to
the list of definitions of the Accounting Act, by defining bookkeeping as: “making records of
economic events in the books of accounts, in an organized and continuous manner, based
on accounting vouchers, as well as grouping and reconciliation thereof”.

4.2.3.       Books of accounts “in the cloud”

                            Act of law: Art. 13. par. 3 of the Accounting Act

     As a condition to maintaining accounting system information resources in the form
     specified in par. 2 above, an entity must possess software that makes it possible to
     obtain legible information regarding the entries made in the books of accounts by
     printing out or transferring them to an IT data carrier.


4.2.3.1.       Problem

Phrase “entity must possess software” is obsolete.

Arguments: 20
Entities very frequently no longer own the software. Many companies use software
outsourcing. More and more often, data is stored “in the cloud”, which is used on
subscription basis – the entity has the right to use the operator’s software, databases,

infrastructure, but holds no ownership title to either. Therefore, the Act should not refer to
ownership of software.


4.2.3.2.    Recommendations

Provisions of the Accounting Act should take into consideration the possibility of using
software in form of outsourcing. The matter of ownership should be omitted from the Act –
it will give it a more universal character. We propose replacing the words “entity must
possess software” with the words “entity must have the possibility to use software”.

                           Act of law: art. 9 of the Accounting Act

 Books of accounts are kept in the Polish language and currency.


4.2.4.1.    Problem

Information recognized in books of accounts only in Polish.

Arguments:
In light of globalization, when Polish entities are frequently members of foreign capital
groups, which use uniform accounting systems, including an integrated chart of accounts, in
certain situations the need arises to use languages other than Polish. Permission to keep
books of accounts in languages other than Polish would definitely be a major convenience
for foreign entities operating in Poland, especially those, which create central accounting
departments for their subsidiaries from several countries, including Poland, in one country
or entrust their bookkeeping to international accountancy service providers, so-called
shared services centers. This group of users have complained about overly rigid, in their
opinion, requirements of Polish regulations, especially in context of solutions implemented
by other EU countries. For example, in Germany and Austria the regulations permit
bookkeeping in other generally used language (usually: English) on condition that in case of
inspection by internal revenue bodies or audit by statutory auditor, the entity would provide
a reliable translation of indicated content into the language of the given country. Some of
the users, in requesting liberalization of this provision, at the same time pointed out
potential problems stemming from the ambiguity of the term “reliable” and concern, that
internal revenue bodies would always require expensive certified translations.


                                                                                           73
At this point, it would be good to refer to the definition of the word "reliable" (wiarygodny),
which, according to a dictionary of Polish language 21 means “deserving trust, beyond doubt;
true, sure authentic” and to heretofore practice of internal revenue bodies in scope of
documents prepared in foreign languages. Art. 287 § 1 of the Tax Ordinance states, that the
entity is obligated to provide, at the request of the inspector, a Polish translation of
documents prepared in a foreign language concerning the matters being the object of
inspection. However, this does not mean that it must be done by a certified translator. Tax
Office has the right, in case of doubts as to accuracy of translation, to bring in an expert, as
per art. 197 of the tax Ordinance.


4.2.4.2.      Recommendations

It is proposed to make it possible to keep user documentation in a foreign language, with
stipulation of obligation to translate it upon demand of inspection bodies or statutory
auditors. For this purpose, current wording of art. 9 would have to be modified by inserting
following content in par. 1: “Books of accounts are kept in the Polish language and currency,
with due regard to provision of art. 10 par. ……” (relevant description under 4.1.1.
Recommendation 4) and by adding par. 2: “Books of accounts may be kept in a foreign
language. In such case, at the request of inspection authorities or an auditor, documents
indicated by them written in a foreign language should be reliably translated into Polish.

                          Act of law: Art. 12. par. 5 of the Accounting Act

     Closing of books of accounts is an irreversible exclusion of the possibility to make
     entries in the data files comprising the closed books of accounts, with due regard to
     art. 13 par. 2 and 3.


4.2.5.1.      Problem

There is no definition of notions “final closing of the books” and “closing the month”.

of books of accounts”, but only the notion of “closing the books of accounts” is defined. As
a result, explanations were necessary, and the Accounting Standards Committee has
presented such in its Position. However, explanations do not have the character of
definitions. Essentially, the entities still have problems understanding what “closing the
books of accounts” really means. While “closing the month” is understandable, it is difficult
to find differences between “closing the books of accounts” and “final closing of the books
of accounts” – difference seems to be in name only. Some of the entities pointed out, that
for them, a good solution would be to introduce the so-called adjustment months or
periods, especially if early closing of the books is required in, inter alia, foreign capital
groups of which they are part. This way, closing the year for the purposes of the capital
group could be clearly differentiated from closing the year for the purpose of domestic
reporting. On the other hand, statutory auditors and other inspectors (from e.g. internal
revenue bodies) have pointed out the practice of entities notoriously not closing the books
for many months after the balance sheet date, and keeping the documents in a so-called
”buffer”, which stemmed from the entities not understanding the requirement to close the
books. This matter should be regulated, so as to make the Act more systematic and provide
the users with uniform explanations.


4.2.5.2.   Recommendations

Recommendation 1:
Adding the basic notion of “closing the month” to the list of definitions. For that purpose,
implementation of provisions of pt 34 of the Position of Accounting Standards Committee
which defines closing the month as “excluding the possibility of making entries or
adjustments of entries in the given month”.

                             Placement of the recommendation

               Art. 3. par. 1 of the Accounting Act – adding another definition.


Recommendation 2:
Adding the basic notion of “closing the books of accounts” to the list of definitions. For this
purpose, implementation of art. 12 par. 5 of the Accounting Act: “Closing of books of
accounts is an irreversible exclusion of the possibility to make entries in the data files
comprising the closed books of accounts”.

                             Placement of the recommendation

               Art. 3. par. 1 of the Accounting Act – adding another definition.

Recommendation 3:
Adding the basic notion of “closing the year” to the list of definitions.

Defining the notion of “closing the year” as “irreversible exclusion of the possibility to make
any entries in the closed financial year”.

                Art. 3. par. 1 of the Accounting Act – adding another definition.


Recommendation 4:
In connection with Recommendation 3, modification is necessary of art. 12 par. 4, in which
the phrase “final closing and opening of books of accounts” should be replaced by the
phrase “closing the year and final opening of books of accounts for the next year”.

                              Placement of the recommendation

   Art. 12 par. 4 of the Accounting Act – modification of the provision in line with wording
                                           above.


Recommendation 5:
In connection with Recommendation 2, modification is necessary of art. 12 par. 5. The
objective of the modification is a clear indication of possibility to make accounting entries
not in individual months of the financial year, as those are closed, but in the so-called
thirteenth month. Therefore, it seems reasonable to supplement par. 5 with the sentence
“After books of accounts are closed and until the day financial statements are approved,
accounting entries are made in the additional month”.

                              Placement of the recommendation

  Books of accounts are closed, (…):
  1)     on the date ending a financial year (…)
         – no later than three months after such events have taken place.

4.2.6.1.    Problem

The deadline for closing the books is too short in case of the day ending the financial year.

Arguments:
Some of the accountants pointed out, that the period of three months from the balance
sheet date for closing the books is often – especially for small entities - not sufficient.
Therefore, this provision is often not observed. Entities make accounting entries in time
depending on the date of planned approval of financial statements, or date of submitting
the financial statements to the relevant tax office (this matter is discussed in more detail in
pt 4.4.2. of this study). It would be worthwhile to consider extending the deadline for
closing books of accounts by at least a month. End of the fourth month seems to be the
threshold date for practical reasons, as entities which are not legal persons operate on a
financial year equaling the calendar year, and their owners need the financial information to
settle the personal income tax by April 30th.


4.2.6.2.    Recommendations

We propose differentiating the periods for closing the books depending on the size of the
entity: for micro entities it would be 4 months from balance sheet date, and for other
entities - 3 months from balance sheet date. In such a case, art. 12 par. 2 should be
supplemented so as to include the sentence: “In case of micro entities, a possibility is
allowed to close the books of accounts for a day ending the financial year within 4 months

                        Act of law: Art. 2. par. 2 of the Accounting Act

 Individuals, civil partnerships of individuals, general partnerships of individuals or
 professional partnerships may also apply the accounting principles specified in this Act
 from the start of the following financial year, if their net proceeds from the sales of
 goods, products and financial operations for the previous financial year are lower than
 the Polish currency equivalent of EUR 1,200,000. In such a case, these individuals or
 partners are obliged to notify the Revenue Office competent for their income tax
 matters before the start of the financial year.

4.2.7.1.   Problem

Restricting the possibility of voluntary application of the provisions of the Accounting Act for
individuals, civil partnerships of individuals, general partnerships of individuals or
professional partnerships by a requirement to notify the Revenue Office before the start of
financial year results in problems for entities which are in process of transforming into an
entity obligated to apply the principles of accounting.

Arguments:
The problem pertains to transformation of sole proprietorships and partnerships operating
based on revenue and expense ledger. These entities are bound by a transformation
procedure stemming from Code of Commercial Companies (hereinafter referred to as CCC),
including: obligation to prepare financial statements, referred to in art. 558 § 2 pt 4 and
art. 5847 § 2 of CCC for the purpose of transformation and measurement of assets. Since
the transforming entity does not apply the provisions of the Accounting Act, such
statements usually only comprise the balance sheet, prepared as of a specific day in the
month preceding presentation of transformation plan to the partners. From that day until
the day of transformation is effected, i.e. the new transformed company is entered into the
register and old company is deregistered, usually a few months pass, during which the
company is operating, selling, buying, incurring costs and achieving revenues.

The transforming entity must then prepare another financial statement, as of the day
preceding the day of change of legal format, as per art. 12 par. 2 pt 3). If such an entity did
not notify the Revenue Office before the start of financial year that it wants to apply books
of accounts voluntarily, it must continue keeping records in the tax revenue and expense
ledger. The users have pointed out here, that they miss the right to open books of accounts
already in the “transition period”, so in order to meet the above reporting requirements,
and ensure continuity between one and the next set of financial statements, they often
keep the books on an informal basis.

In such situations, it seems justifiable to allow moving to the books of accounts even before
the transformed company is entered into the business register, e.g. since the day of
preparation of the financial statements referred to in art. 558 § 2 pt 4 and art. 5847 § 3 of
CCC.


4.2.7.2.   Recommendations

We propose adding par. 2b, worded as follows: “If the entity, referred to in par. 2, begins
the process of transformation into a commercial company during the financial year, it may
open the books of accounts and apply principles of accounting as set forth in the Accounting
Act, no earlier than at the beginning of the financial year, and no later than on the day as of
which it prepared the financial statement, referred to in art. 558 § 2 pt 4 and art. 5847 § 3
of the Code of Commercial Companies. In such cases, the persons or partners before the

start of the financial year are obligated to notify the Revenue Office competent for their
income tax matters within 15 days from opening the books of accounts”.

 Art. 18 par.1

 Based on the entries made in the general ledger, at the end of each reporting period,
 and no less frequently than at the end of the month, a trial balance is drawn up.


4.2.9.1.   Problem

Preparing trial balances on a monthly basis is too frequent and – from the perspective of the
entities – unnecessary.

Arguments:
Entities reporting in periods other than monthly (e.g. quarterly, semi-annually) entities
which make VAT or income tax settlements quarterly, as well as entities which pay their
income taxes in a simplified procedure, should not be obligated to prepare monthly trial
balances. A sufficient obligation for the books of accounts to be deemed kept on ongoing
basis, would be preparing trial balances for individual reporting periods, within deadlines
enabling such entities to meet their reporting obligations. A reporting period – as per art. 3
par. 1 pt 8 – is a period for which financial statements are drawn up according to the
procedure set forth in the Act, or other statements prepared based on books of accounts;
Such reduced encumbrance for the entities must not, however, result in a risk that the
entities would be able to delay making accounting entries.


4.2.9.2.   Recommendations

Deleting from art. 24 par. 5 pt 2 and art. 18 par. 1 of the Accounting Act the phrase “no less
frequently than at the end of each month”.

Adding to art. 24 par. 1 pt 5 a next sub-point (4) requiring that bookkeeping is current, with

4.2.10. Current bookkeeping – closing the year

                     Act of law: Art. 24 par. 5 pt 2 of the Accounting Act

 Books of accounts are considered to be kept on an on-going basis, if:
 1)    (…),
 2)    general ledger trial balances are prepared at least for the respective reporting
       periods and no less frequently than at the end of each month, in a timely manner
       as mentioned in item 1 above, and for the financial year, no later than the 85th
       day after the balance sheet date.


4.2.10.1. Problem

Deadline for preparation of general ledger trial balances for a financial year is too short.
Deadline for preparation of general ledger trial balances (85 days) is inconsistent with
provisions of art. 12 par. 2, which says: “Books of accounts are closed, (…): - no later than
three months after such events have taken place” (3 months).

Arguments:
The users have emphasized the incomprehensible from their perspective deadline for
preparation of trail balances of 85 days after balance sheet date, since it is not related either
to books closing deadlines nor to deadlines for preparing tax statements. In practice, in
many entities this provision remains defunct. Therefore, it would seem reasonable to align
the two deadlines (85 days and 3 months). Nonetheless, keeping in mind the issue
described in pt 4.2.6. above, those deadlines should be extended at least for small and
medium entities – as is the case for example in Germany.


4.2.10.2. Recommendations

In art. 24 par. 5 pt 2 of the Accounting Act, we propose replacing the phrase “no later than
the 85th day after the balance sheet date” with following wording: “no later than at the
deadline for closing the books of accounts”.

 Books of accounts are considered to be kept on an on-going basis, if:

       (…),
 3)    payments received and made in cash, cheques and bills of exchange, as well as
       any transactions in retail trade and in food services, are recognized on the day on
       which they were affected.


4.2.11.1. Problem

Requirement of recognizing cash payments in the books of accounts causes additional work
for entities, in which cash payments are of marginal importance.

Arguments:
Provisions of the Accounting Act should be more universal, rather than regulate selected
transactions in such detail. The entities have pointed out, that the requirement of
recognizing payments received and made in cash on the day on which they were effected as
one of conditions of considering the books to be kept on ongoing basis seems obsolete.
Additionally, it does not function in practice.

In the era of widespread cashless payments, entities other than those operating in retail and
food services, significantly limit their cash transactions in terms of number and value, or
even eliminate cash desks entirely. In such a situation, it is perfectly enough to recognize
cash transactions in the books once a month. Cheques and bills of exchange play a very
limited role in business.

Even in retail and food services it seems that such a restrictive approach is not necessary, if
cash payments are registered on a cash register and documents are preserved in accordance
with applicable requirements of tax regulations. In entities with a large network of local
outlets, accounting is usually kept in one place. On the other hand, small food service
entities and stores which only have one or two locations frequently outsource accounting
services from an external service provider. In both cases, daily submission of accounting
documents for the purpose of recognizing them in the books would generate high costs and
would not be practical. Experience of statutory auditors and other inspectors shows, that
just keeping accounting entries pertaining to cash balances is not sufficient to ensure an
appropriate level of internal control over these assets. A far more effective fraud deterrent
are frequent, continuous and ad hoc inspections of cash register and balances performed by
operations managers.

4.2.12. Place of keeping books of accounts

                      Act of law: Art. 11 and 11a of the Accounting Act

 Art. 11 par.1

 Books of accounts kept by the entity.

 Art. 11a

 In case the books of accounts are kept outside the head office or place of
 management, the entity’s manager is obliged to:
 1)    notify the relevant revenue office of the place where the books of accounts are
       kept within 15 days of releasing the books


4.2.12.1. Problem

This provision is illogical – it pertains to the place of bookkeeping, and in par. 1, instead
about the place, it talks about who keeps the books.

There is no clear indication of the place of bookkeeping if the books are kept in the entity.

Arguments:
The provision pertains to the place of bookkeeping. However, in par. 1 there is a misleading
sentence: “Books of accounts are kept by the entity”. Since the next paragraph speaks not
about bookkeeping by a third party, but rather about keeping them in a place other than the
entity’s head office or place of management, it should be inferred that what the legislators
had in mind with respect to par. 1 was keeping the books “at the entity”.

Assuming, that par 1. indeed pertains to the place where bookkeeping is done, the entities
are not clear as to the actual possibility of choosing the place of bookkeeping – this pertains
in particular to having branches, offices, etc. Art. 11a indicates obligations which occur if
books are kept in a place other than the entity’s head office or place of management. There
is a certain mental leap between art. 11 and 11a, resulting in concern about keeping the
books in e.g. a branch, or another place “constituting a part of the entity”.

In connection with doubts as to application of art. 11, relevant provisions were included in
the position of the Accounting Standards Committee. Pt 1 of the Position says, that books
of accounts are kept “using the resources (personnel, premises, equipment) which are at


                                                                                                83
the disposal of the entity”. The entity is not limited as to the place where it keeps its books
(e.g. head office, branch or plant, unit), which may be located either in Poland or outside its
borders. It is perhaps worth consideration as to whether this catalog could remain open.
Art. 11a will become much clearer then. It will then state unequivocally, that keeping the
books outside the entity’s head office or place of management is subject to relevant
notifications.


4.2.12.2. Recommendations

We propose to modify art. 11 par. 1 of the Accounting Act by replacing the word “by” with
the word “at”. The provision will then be worded: “Books of accounts kept at the entity”.

We propose adding to art. 11 par. 1a, worded as follows: “The entity may keep its books of
accounts at its head office, place of management, branch, plant, office, place of operation”.

4.2.13. Place of bookkeeping and place of storage of books of accounts

                        Act of law: Art. 11a pt 1 of the Accounting Act

 In case the books of accounts are kept outside the head office or place of
 management, the entity’s manager is obliged to:
 1)    notify the relevant revenue office of the place where the books of accounts are
       kept within 15 days of releasing the books


4.2.13.1. Problem

Place of bookkeeping and place of storage of books of accounts are equated. Lack of clarity
in interpretation of these provisions was pointed out by, among others, the users from
capital groups, which establish central accounting departments for their entities, the so-
called internal shared services centers (insourcing).

Arguments:
The part of the sentence saying “from the day of releasing the books” suggests that
bookkeeping is the same as storage of books of accounts. Besides that, the Accounting Act
does not clearly differentiate between bookkeeping and storage of books of accounts. In the
era of computerization, organization of work in accounting has changed fundamentally.
Currently, the place of bookkeeping is increasingly often different than the place of storage


                                                                                            84
of books of accounts, as well as data. Notification of data storage place is regulated by art.
73 par. 4 of the Accounting Act.

Another issue which requires consideration is the issue of introducing the provision about
the obligation to notify in case of discontinuation of keeping the books in a place other than
the entity’s head office or place of management.


4.2.13.2. Recommendations

        the entity’s head office or place of management.

                       Act of law: Art. 11a pt 1 of the Accounting Act

 In case the books of accounts are kept outside the head office or place of
 management, the entity’s manager is obliged to:
 1.    notify the relevant revenue office of the place where the books of accounts are
       kept within 15 days of releasing the books


4.2.14.1. Problem

Deadlines for notification differ between accounting and tax regulations.

Arguments:
According to art. 9 par. 1 of the Act of 13 October 1995 on principles of registration and


                                                                                           85
identification of taxpayers and payers: “Entities, referred to in art. 6 par. 1, 1a and 10, are
obligated to update the data required for the identification notice by making a data update
notice to head of revenue office no later than 7 days from the moment data change
occurred”. Therefore, a doubt arises, whether the notice (data update) submitted in line
with tax requirements is sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the Accounting Act. Should
notification be submitted on relevant tax forms, or should it be done by a separate letter.
Thus, content of this provision as currently worded is only formal – for the entities,
compliance with tax regulations is more important, and a different notification deadline in
the Accounting Act may be misleading. Some of the users have also pointed out, that a
seven days deadline is too short, especially in context of other deadlines required by the
Act.


4.2.14.2. Recommendations

There is a need to regulate the matter of bookkeeping conducted on servers located outside

Books of accounts kept using a server in a location different than the place of bookkeeping
are deemed to be kept correctly if at least the following conditions are met:
a)      The entity maintains control over the books of accounts and entries made therein;
b)      The entity ensures that books of accounts are identical with copies of the reports
        received over a transmission link (wired) or wireless;
c)      Books of accounts are kept in a reliable, error-free, verifiable manner and on an on-

d)      Unequivocal links are ensured between entries in books of accounts and accounting
        vouchers;
e)      Data in books of accounts is effectively protected from unauthorized modification,
        unauthorized access, damage or destruction;
f)      Books of accounts are always available at the entity’s place of bookkeeping;
g)      The entity has a printout of the books of accounts for closed periods or has their
        content written down on another permanent data carrier, available and possible to
        read at the entity's place of bookkeeping, for a period no shorter than required
        accounting records retention period (5 years).

4.2.16. Subsidiary ledgers – the form of records

                         Act of law: Art. 16. par. 1 of the Accounting Act

     Subsidiary ledger accounts contain entries that detail and supplement the general
     ledger accounts. They are kept in a systematic manner as a separate system of books,
     files (sets of accounts) and computerized data files, reconciled with the balances and
     entries in the general ledger accounts.


4.2.16.1. Problem

The provision pertaining to forms of keeping the analytical records is detached from reality,
which is dominated by IT systems.

Arguments: 23
Techniques of building analytical records should not be detailed in the law. Currently, the

records – as per the Accounting Act – are to be kept in form of separate system of books,
files (sets of accounts) and computerized data files. It happens very often, however, that an
analytical account is a part of a synthetic account, rather than something separate.
Determining the forms of keeping analytical records in the era of rapid technological
changes will result in the need to change of the provisions of the law, which will have to be
effected so as to ensure that the Act “keeps up” with technology. Leaving the format of
analytical records to the discretion of the entity would allow a more universal nature of

We propose to modify the second sentence of art. 16 par. 1 of the Accounting Act in a
following manner: “They are kept in a systematic manner, in a form appropriate for the
specific nature of the entity, identified and described in the accounting policy, reconciled
with the balances and entries in the general ledger accounts”.

4.2.17. Trial balances – form of the report

                      Act of law: Art. 18. par. 1 of the Accounting Act

 1)    Based on the entries made in the general ledger, at the end of each reporting
       period, and no less frequently than at the end of the month, a trial balance is
       drawn up, containing:
       a)    symbols or names of accounts;
       b)    the opening balances of accounts, totals for the reporting period and year-
             to-date from the beginning of the financial year as well as closing balances
             of accounts;
       c)    the sum of opening balances, totals for the reporting period and year-to-
             date from the beginning of the financial year as well as the sum of the
             closing balances.


4.2.17.1. Problem

Excessive regulation of the scope of trial balance is detached from reality, which is
dominated by IT systems.

Arguments:
Some of the users have pointed out, that requirements in scope of totals for the reporting
period and year-to-date from the beginning of the financial year are not used in practice. On
the other hand, persons implementing IT systems have pointed out, that requirement of the
Act in this scope result in the need to modify existing solutions in scope of totals and
balances, already implemented in the financial and accounting systems and used in other
countries; this results in additional costs. However, some of the accountants did speak in
favor of usefulness of totals for the reporting period and year-to-date for the purpose of
current control of correctness of books and entries. Therefore, it seems reasonable to leave
this provision unchanged.

4.2.18.1. Problem

Checking books of accounts using IT techniques.

Arguments:
Increasingly frequent use of the possibility to keep and store records in electronic format
means, that external control bodies (including audit by statutory auditors, tax inspection)
must be prepared to analyze the books of accounts in an IT environment. This situation will
be more and more widespread – it is expected, that electronic invoices will be used more
and more commonly, and that, with time, will also determine their storage and
preservation. There are various possibilities of analyzing the books of accounts, depending
on the software used by the entity. There is a problem with systems generating files, which
cannot be edited, or editing is very time-consuming. It would seem, that in order to save
time of the entity and of external inspectors, as well as to increase efficiency of inspection, it
would be necessary to obligate the entities to have software enabling generating specific
reports in a format easily read and analyzed by inspectors – e.g. by applying XML standard.



                                                                                               89
4.2.18.2. Recommendations

The Accounting Act should include a provision indicating the obligation for the entity to
possess software enabling generating printouts of at least the journal in a manner allowing
easy analysis. However, the Act should not specify in detail the format of the printouts – due
to changes in technology and rapid progress in IT. Detailed regulations in this scope should
be left to tax legislation, in context of changes in scope of downloads of accounting
vouchers in electronic format by internal revenue bodies and possibility to edit them for the
purpose of e.g. tax inspection, tax investigation, or tax enforcement proceedings, as well as
the single control file; at this time, no provisions in this scope are proposed to be included in
the Accounting Act.

4.3.1.1.    Problem

The Accounting Act does not include a definition of a basic notion of “accounting voucher”.
Chapter 2 of the Accounting Act lists types of accounting vouchers, their elements, features
and error correction.

Arguments:
Introduction of the notion of “accounting voucher” seems necessary for the purpose of
making the Act more systematic.

The most important feature of the accounting voucher is its unequivocal linkage to business
transaction, to which it pertains. For example: a notary deed documenting sale of property,
or estimation of provisions with appropriate calculation issued by relevant persons.

From the user perspective, consistency with tax regulations is very important. This is
because accounting vouchers are used both for the purpose of making entries, reflecting
economic events, in the books of accounts, and for proper documentation and calculation of
taxes. In tax regulations pertaining to documenting transactions (in particular those


                                                                                              90
pertaining to VAT invoices) we see less formalization of accounting vouchers as compared to
previous years. However, regardless of form, in which the invoices are issued or sent, the
following must be ensured: legibility, i.e. no doubt as to the individual elements, integrity of
content, i.e. protection against accidental rather than deliberate modification of the
document, and authenticity of origin, which is understood as certainty with respect to
identity of the issuer of the document. Authenticity of origin, integrity of content and
legibility of the document (voucher) can be assured by way of any business controls, which
determine a reliable audit trail between the document (voucher) and the transaction or
event to which it pertains.


4.3.1.2.    Recommendations

Based on provisions of art. 20 par. 1 of the Accounting Act, we propose to include following
notions in the list of definitions in the Act: “accounting voucher”, “authenticity of origin”,
“integrity of content ” and "legibility” and define them as follows: An accounting voucher is
a document constituting the basis for an entry made in the books of accounts, in a manner
ensuring legibility, integrity of content and authenticity of origin, as well as unequivocal link
to business transaction to which it pertains:
•    “Authenticity of origin – means certainty as to the identity of the issuer of the
     voucher”
•    “Integrity of content of the voucher – is ensured by protecting the voucher against
     modification”.
•    “Legibility of the voucher – means a situation in which there is no doubt as to the
     content and meaning of individual elements of the voucher".

4.3.2.1.    Problem

The Accounting Act does not include a definition of “electronic accounting voucher”.

Arguments:
Provisions of the Accounting Act pertain first and foremost to traditional accounting


                                                                                              91
vouchers (hardcopy). In connection with progress, development of IT systems, electronic
data exchange, numerous doubts arise as to the acceptable forms of accounting vouchers.
Accounting Standards Committee, in its Position, has undertaken an attempt to clarify these
matters. The Committee specified, that the term ”electronic document” refers to the form
of the document, such as e.g.: electronic invoice, a printout from an Internet banking
system, electronic warehouse document, electronic airline ticket, data from billing systems
etc.

In general, the notion of “electronic document”, of which “electronic accounting voucher”
seems to be a subset, is defined differently in different disciplines – there is no uniform
definition. In order to harmonize the provisions of the Accounting Act with tax regulations,
Accounting Act would have to base some provisions on the Tax Ordinance. The problem is,
however, that the Tax Ordinance in scope of definition refers to the Act on informatization
of entities implementing public tasks, which defines electronic document as “data file,
constituting a separate distinctive whole in terms of meaning, arranged in a specific internal
structure and recorded on an IT data carrier”. This definition is inconsistent with the
Position of the Accounting Standards Committee, and authors of publications mention its
ambiguities, including those quoted by Ms Sylwia Kotecka 24:
•     change of status of an electronic document during transmission – the document is not
      at the time “recorded on an IT data carrier”, so an e-document effectively ceases to be
      one,
•     an electronic document is a “data file arranged in a specific internal structure” – such
      an interpretation may limit the notion of an electronic document exclusively to forms
      located on websites; moreover, it is not clear whether the internal structure of the
      electronic document may be determined by technical standards, or does it have to be
      defined by law.

Essentially, the most pertinent definition of an electronic document can be found on
Wikipedia: “For legal purposes, an electronic document is any document which can be
presented in a digital format. Such documents can be converted in any manner and
recorded on any carrier, provided that they can be later retrieved and restored to their
original form. The same electronic document may be saved in many places and on many
carriers at the same time”. Such a definition corresponds to explanations of the Position of
Accounting Standards Committee.

Due to the need to ensure consistency with tax regulations, as indicated in pt 4.3.1, it
means, that acceptable electronic formats must be those, which ensure legibility, integrity
of content and authenticity of origin. These features of the document may be ensured:
•     By way of any business controls, which determine a reliable audit trail between the

•    By identifying sources, between which the documents would be transmitted, e.g. E-
     mail addresses or dedicated web portals, and
•    By putting the document in an appropriate format, granting at least minimum
     protection against accidental modification or editing of its content.


4.3.2.2.    Recommendations

It is proposed to include the notions of “electronic document” and “electronic accounting
voucher” as well as “IT data carrier” to the list of definitions in the Act. Definitions should
be as general as possible, so as to avoid the need to amend the Act in line with technological
progress.

Following definitions are proposed:
•    “Electronic accounting voucher is an electronic document constituting the basis for an
     entry made in the books of accounts, in a manner ensuring legibility, integrity of
     content and authenticity of origin, as well as unequivocal link to business transaction
     to which it pertains”
•    “Electronic document is any document recorded on an IT data carrier, which can be
     presented in digital format”
•    “IT data carrier” is a material or device serving the purpose of recording, storing and
     reading data in digital form”

in use.

4.3.3.2.    Recommendations

It is proposed, that in the list of definitions, after the definition of the notions of “accounting
voucher” and “electronic accounting voucher”, following text should be added: “whenever
in the Act a reference is made to an accounting voucher, it is to be understood to mean
electronic accounting voucher as well”.

                                    Act of law: art. 20 par.5

  In the case of computer-assisted bookkeeping, entries made in the books of accounts
  automatically by means of telecommunication devices (…) should be considered
  equivalent to source documents (…).


4.3.4.1.    Problem

Are those entries equivalent to source documents or accounting vouchers.

Arguments:
Art. 20 par. 1-3 specifies types of accounting vouchers. This division suggests, that we have
accounting vouchers called „source documents” in form of third party external vouchers,
own external vouchers and internal vouchers, as well as other accounting vouchers, such as
collective vouchers, vouchers adjusting previous entries, and settlement vouchers.

Entries in books of accounts, which are made automatically via telecommunication devices -
while meeting the legal criteria – are referred to by the Act as source documents. In
practice, such entries are also made based on e.g. other accounting vouchers, such as
collective vouchers (source documents are in the modules, subsystems, etc., and in the
books collective entries are made based on collective vouchers). The situation would be
more clear, if the words “source documents” was replaced by “accounting vouchers”.

At this point, it should be mentioned, that in literature, terms “accounting vouchers” and
“source documents” are treated as synonyms. However, wording of art. 20 par. 1-3
indicates, that the notion of “accounting voucher” is a broader term than “source
document”.

       translation of such values into Polish currency according to the exchange rate
       prevailing on the date of the transaction. The result of the translation should be
       stated directly on the voucher unless the data processing system ensures
       automatic translation of foreign currencies into Polish currency and this
       translation is confirmed by the relevant printout.


4.3.5.1.   Problem

The need to create printouts in case of using a data processing system.

Arguments:
Due to the fact, that accounting processes will be computerized to a growing extent, and
hardcopy accounting vouchers will be replaced by electronic vouchers, importance will
increase of accurate and comprehensible description of techniques of documenting
accounting entries. In this context, the requirement to attach printouts is problematic – for
one, due to time-consuming work and economic reasons, and two, due to impossibility of
attaching a printout to a document, which more and more often will be in electronic format.
For example, the technique of documenting accounting entries may specify that relevant
printouts would be created monthly and placed in specified locations.

In practical application, it should be pointed out, that sometimes the accounting voucher
which will be appropriate for entering the cost into books of accounts will also be the
appropriate document for tax purposes, although frequently it will be insufficient. This
pertains mostly to vouchers confirming the nature of the transaction (objective, nature,
connection to revenue etc.).


4.3.5.2.   Recommendations

It is proposed, that the phrases in art. 21 par. 2 “is confirmed on a printout” and in par. 3 “is
confirmed by a relevant printout” should be replaced by, respectively, phrases “which is
confirmed in a manner specified in the technique of documenting accounting entries” in
par. 2 and “confirmed in a manner specified in the technique of documenting accounting
entries” in par. 3.

4.4.1.     Preparing and approving financial statements – deadlines

               Act of law: Art. 52 par. 1 and art. 53 par. 1 of the Accounting Act

 Art. 52 par.1

 The manager of an entity should ensure that the annual financial statements are
 prepared no later than three months after the balance sheet date, and should submit
 them to the appropriate authorities in accordance with the legal regulations
 applicable to the entity, as well as the provisions of the statutes or articles of
 association.

 Art. 53 par.1

 Subject to par. 2b below, annual financial statements of an entity are subject to
 approval by its approving body by no later than six months from the balance sheet
 date. Before approval, the annual financial statements of the entities referred to in
 Article 64 below are subject to audit in accordance with the rules set out in Chapter 7.


4.4.1.1.    Problem

The deadline for closing the books is too short in case of the day ending the financial year,
and the same is true of the deadline for preparing financial statements. As a result of
changes of deadlines for closing the books of accounts proposed in recommendation 1 in pt
4.2.6, deadlines related to financial reporting should be extended accordingly.

Arguments:
Three months from balance sheet date is often not enough time for entities to prepare
financial statements, especially if they are subject to audit. Therefore, this provision is often
not observed. The entities have pointed out, that preparation of financial statements by the
end of third month from the balance sheet date is sometimes only an appearance of effort
and the actual date of preparation of financial statements depends on the date of planned
approval thereof. The entities have pointed out the convergence of deadlines for closing the
books of accounts and preparing financial statements. Another difficult to understand
aspect was a fairly long time (three months) that the legislators envisaged as a period
between preparation of financial statements and approval thereof, even in case of entities
subject to mandatory audit.

Under the circumstances, the need for extension of deadline for approval of financial
statements by the approving body was also considered. Allowing extended deadlines for


                                                                                              97
approval of financial statements, and consequently, of filing them with the court register,
would be a relief for some entities. However, most of those interviewed did not see the
need for extension. Due to facilitated communication between the manager of the entity
and the body approving financial statements, as well as the need to access information
contained in financial statements, it is recommended to leave the provision unchanged.


4.4.1.2.   Recommendations

Recommendation 1:
Differentiation of deadlines for preparing financial statements depending on size of the
entity: for large entities, 3 months from balance sheet date, and for micro entities, 5
months from balance sheet date. In such a case, in art. 52 par.1 needs to be modified by
replacing words “…no later than 3 months from balance sheet date…” with words “no later
than 4 months from balance sheet date…„.

allowed to prepare financial statements no later than 5 months from balance sheet date
and submit them to the appropriate authorities in accordance with the legal regulations
applicable to the entity, as well as the provisions of the statutes or articles of association,
with due regard to art. 53 par. 1.”

                               the Act on personal income tax

 Art. 27 par. 1 and 2 of the Act on corporate income tax

 1.      Taxpayers (…) shall submit to internal revenue offices tax returns made using a
         standard form, reporting the amount of income (loss) in a given tax year - by the
         end of the third month of the following year (…).
 2.      Taxpayers who are obligated to prepare financial statements shall submit to a
         internal revenue office their financial statements accompanied by an opinion
         and report of statutory auditor within 10 days from the day of approval of
         annual financial statements, and in the case of companies - accompanied also by
         a copy of a resolution of a general meeting approving the financial statements.
         The obligation to submit an opinion and report does not apply to taxpayers
         whose financial statements are exempt from the audit obligation pursuant to
         separate provisions.

 Art. 45 par. 1 and 5 of the Act on personal income tax

 1.      Taxpayers shall submit tax returns to internal revenue offices, using a standard
         form, reporting the amount of income earned (loss incurred) in a tax year by 30
         April of the year following a tax year (…).
 5.      Taxpayers who keep books of accounts and are obligated to prepare financial
         statements attach financial statements to the tax returns.


4.4.2.1.    Problem

Different set of requirements with respect to taxpayers of corporate income tax and
taxpayers of personal income tax in scope of deadlines and set of documents to be attached
to financial statements submitted to the internal revenue office. In case of taxpayers of
personal income tax, obligations in scope of financial reporting do not take into account
deadlines and requirements of the Accounting Act. Entities have issues with interpretation
of regulations pertaining to reporting obligations in case of partnerships and natural persons
conducting business activity (sole proprietorships).

Arguments:
In scope of financial reporting, provisions of the Act on corporate income tax take into
account deadlines for preparation and approval of financial statements, stemming from the
Accounting Act, and differentiate between entities depending on whether they are subject


                                                                                              99
to mandatory audit of financial statements or not. Provisions of art. 27 par. 1 of the Act on
corporate income tax only require submission of reports on the amount of income (loss) in
a given tax year - by the end of the third month of the following year. In following the
requirements of art. 52 and 53 of the Accounting Act, many entities at that time are still in
process of auditing their financial statements. Therefore, the tax return is often of
“preliminary” nature, as the taxpayers submit the adjustment invoice only after the audit of
financial statements is completed. On the other hand, provisions of art. 27 par. 2 of the Act
on corporate income tax clearly refer to the Accounting Act and require the entities
obligated to prepare financial statements to submit to the internal revenue office the
financial statements along with opinion and report of statutory auditor, and copy of a
resolution of a general meeting approving the financial statements within 10 days from the
day of approval of annual financial statements. The obligation to submit an opinion and
report does not apply to taxpayers whose financial statements are exempt from the audit
obligation. This regulation clearly states, that unless the financial statements have been
approved by the authorized body, they cannot be submitted to the internal revenue office.
Moreover, the taxpayers who had their financial statements audited by an authorized entity
on a voluntary basis are not obligated to submit statutory auditor’s report and opinion to
the internal revenue office. In this respect, provisions of the tax aw fully take into account
the deadlines for approval of financial statements stemming from the Accounting Act, and
their requirements in scope of set of documents to be submitted by the entity, except for
additional requirement to submit the statutory auditor’s report, are consistent with
obligations in scope of submission of financial statements to a relevant court register, in
accordance with art. 69 of the Accounting Act.

Requirements pertaining to taxpayers of personal income tax are completely different.
Pursuant to art. 45 par. 1 of Act on personal income tax, they are obligated to file tax
returns with the internal revenue office, using a standard form, reporting the amount of
income earned (loss incurred) in a tax year by 30 April of the year following a tax year, and
entities which are obligated to prepare financial statements attach financial statements to
the tax returns. (pursuant to art. 45 par. 5 of Act on personal income tax). Financial
statements submitted at such time may be not yet approved, or – in case of entities subject
to mandatory audit – not audited. Later date of approval (in accordance with art. 53 of the
Accounting Act) does not obligate the entities to re-submit the financial statements. There is
also no obligation to submit to the internal revenue office the copy of a resolution of a
general meeting approving the financial statements, or opinion and report of statutory
auditor, even if the financial statements were subject to mandatory audit pursuant to art.
64 par. 1 of the Accounting Act.

As a result, internal revenue bodies often receive from taxpayers preliminary versions of
financial statements, which may differ from the final one. As opposed to the case of
taxpayers of corporate income tax, internal revenue bodies do not receive statutory
auditor’s opinion or report.


                                                                                          100
4.4.2.2.    Recommendations

We propose replacing the content of art. 45 par. 5 of Act on personal income tax by same
content as in art 27 par. 2 of Act on corporate income tax. “Taxpayers who are obligated to
prepare financial statements shall submit to a internal revenue office their financial
statements accompanied by an opinion and report of statutory auditor within 10 days from
the day of approval of annual financial statements, and in the case of companies -
accompanied also by a copy of a resolution of a general meeting approving the financial
statements. The obligation to submit an opinion and report does not apply to taxpayers
whose financial statements are exempt from the audit obligation pursuant to separate
provisions.”

4.4.3.     Preparing financial statements in partnerships which do not apply the
           principles of accounting

               Act of law: art.558 § 1 and § 2 of Code of Commercial Companies

 Art.558 § 2 pt. 4 of Code of Commercial Companies

 The following documents shall be attached to the transformation plan:

 4)      the financial statements drawn up for the company in connection with the
         transformation as at the date referred to in § 1 pt 1 above, with the use of the
         same methods and the same layout as the last annual financial statements.


4.4.3.1.    Problem

In case of civil partnerships of individuals, general partnerships of individuals and
professional partnerships, which previously were not, or are not – during preparation of
financial statements as an attachment to the transformation plan - obligated to apply the
accountancy principles as per art. 2 par. 1 pt 2) of the Accounting Act, it is not clear as to
what methods should be used in preparation of those financial statements.

Arguments:
The problem pertains to transformation of partnerships operating based on revenue and
expense ledger. These entities are also bound by a transformation procedure stemming
from Code of Commercial Companies (hereinafter referred to as CCC), including: obligation
to prepare financial statements, referred to in art. 558 § 2 pt 4 and art. 5847 § 2 of CCC for



                                                                                          101
the purpose of transformation and measurement of assets. Since the entity undergoing
transformation has not applied the accounting principles so far, and was not obligated t
prepare annual financial statements, it has no basis for preparation of those statements, or
the later financial statements, prepared as of the day preceding the day of transformation
(as per art. 12 par. 2 pt 3) of the Accounting Act).

At this point, it should be mentioned, that in case of transformation of sole proprietorships,
this problem was regulated by adding art 5847 § 3 of Code of Commercial Companies,
worded as follows: “If an entrepreneur is not obligated to keep books of accounts pursuant
to the Accounting Act of 29 September 1994, the financial statements (…) are prepared
based on a summary of the entries in the revenue and expense ledger and other records
kept by the company for tax purposes, physical inventory and other documents enabling the
statements to be prepared.”


4.4.3.2.    Recommendations

It is proposed to add par. 3 in art. 558 § 2 pt 4 of Code of Commercial Companies, worded as
follows: “If a partnership is not obligated to keep books of accounts pursuant to the
Accounting Act of 29 September 1994, the financial statements referred to in § 2 (4) are
prepared based on a summary of the entries in the revenue and expense ledger and other
records kept by the company for tax purposes, physical inventory and other documents
enabling the statements to be prepared.”

4.4.4.     Financial statements - language

                       Act of law: Art. 45. par. 5 of the Accounting Act

 Financial statements and management reports should be prepared in the Polish
 language and currency. (...)


4.4.4.1.    Problem

Financial statements are to be prepared in Polish only.

Arguments:
In the era of globalization, when Polish entities are frequently members of foreign capital
groups, which use uniform accounting systems, including an integrated chart of accounts, in



                                                                                          102
certain situations the need arises to use languages other than Polish. (this issue is discussed
in more detail in pts 4.1.1 and 4.2.4).

In this situation, a question arises of allowing preparation of financial statements in
languages other than Polish. However, in this case it does not seem advisable, due to public
nature of the documents and their availability to a broad range of users. On the other hand,
the entities themselves have admitted, that the obligation to prepare financial statements
in Polish is not a major encumbrance for them, since, as opposed to the books of accounts,
they are prepared fairly rarely (usually once a year).

4.5.1.1.    Problem

Do provisions of chapter 8 in certain places refer to the current period or the period after
approval of financial statements – in general, the regulations are clear, and applied
interpretation correct, but in thorough reading of some provisions on must notice the need
for definitions regulation.

Arguments:
The Accounting Act does not contain the notion of “records storage”, and chapter 8 of the
Accounting Act talks about storage both during the current period and after approval of
financial statements. Absence of definitions results in interpretation difficulties with respect
to art. 73 par. 4 of the Act, which says: “The files (…) may be stored in the manner specified
in par. 1–3 above outside the head office of the entity in the event that they are to be
transferred for storage to another entity providing document storage services”. It is
generally accepted that this point pertains to archiving (storage after approval of financial


                                                                                            103

practices must provide storage services as well).


4.5.1.2.    Recommendations

It is proposed to add to par. 1 art. 71 of the Accounting Act a sentence worded as follows:
“records storage pertains both to current period and period after approval of financial
statements”.

 1.      Accounting vouchers and stocktaking records should be stored at an entity (…)
 4.      The files referred to in Article 71 par. 1 above may be stored (…) outside the head
         office of the entity in the event that they are to be transferred for storage to
         another entity providing document storage services. The provision of Art.11a
         should be applied accordingly.


4.5.2.1.    Problem

There is no clear indication of the place of records storage if the books are kept in the entity.
This topic is similar to 4.2.12. Reference to art. 11a is ambiguous.

Arguments:
Assuming, that par 1. indeed pertains to the place where bookkeeping is done, the entities
are not clear as to the actual possibility of choosing the place of bookkeeping – this pertains
in particular to having branches, offices, etc. Reference in art. 73. par. 4 of the Accounting
Act to art. 11a of same Act means, that the entity has obligations in case of storage of books
of accounts outside the head office of the entity or its place of management. There is a
certain mental leap between art. 73 par. 4 and 11a, resulting in concern about storing the
books in e.g. a branch, or another place “constituting a part of the entity”.

In accordance with the VAT Act, taxpayer whose business domicile is on the territory of
Poland are obligated to store the invoices on the territory of Poland. However, if we are
dealing with electronic invoices, above provision does not have to be applied and invoices


                                                                                             104
can be stored abroad, in electronic format. However, online access to these invoices must
be provided, as well as data downloading and processing ability. 25


4.5.2.2.      Recommendations

Recommendation 1:
It is proposed to supplement art. 73 par. 1 with an indication of place of storage of books of
accounts in case they are stored by the entity, by adding following wording: “The entity may
store its books of accounts at its head office, place of management, branch, plant, office,
place of operation”.

Recommendation 2:
It is proposed to add par. 5 to art. 73 and inserting there the provisions of art. 11a of the
Accounting Act, while art. 11a needs to be modified by replacing the phrase “place of
bookkeeping” with the phrase “place of storage of books of accounts”. It will then state
unequivocally, that keeping the books outside the entity’s head office or place of
management is subject to relevant notifications.

     “The files referred to in Article 71 par. 1 above may be stored in the manner specified
     in par. 1–3 above outside the head office of the entity in the event that they are to be
     transferred for storage to another entity providing document storage services.” The
     provision of Art.11a should be applied accordingly.


4.5.3.1.      Problem

The problem is essentially described in the sections above, “Definition of records storage”

and “Storage location”. It is also linked to the topic “Definition of bookkeeping”.

Arguments:
Literal wording of the provision could mean two things: Either only the place of storage of
financial statements after approval is subject to notification to the internal revenue office,
and current storage is not notified, or both are notified, but storage may only be provided to
an entity which provides services in scope of document storage”. In the second case, it
should be noted that accountancy practices often do not include document storage in their
registration parameters, and statutory auditor firms cannot have such a parameter – they
are prohibited from doing so by a statutory list specifying scope of activity. A separate issue
is a problem of long term storage of certain documents, e.g. payroll sheets (this matter is
discussed in more detail in pt 4.5.7).


4.5.3.2.    Recommendations

It is proposed, that art. 73 par. 4 should contain the sentence: “after approval of the
financial statements, the files may be stored outside the entity only by entities providing
services in scope of documents storage, or institutions created for that purpose pursuant to
separate legislation”.

4.5.4.1.    Problem

No regulation of the option of storage in the “cloud”.

Arguments:
The Accounting Act does not regulate the matter of files storage, which may be effected in
electronic format, in the so-called cloud. The provisions regulating storage only speak about
archiving in the entity or outside of it. Here, the matter arises of storage by the entity but
not physically at the entity (this also pertains to the situation in which storage is provided by
an authorized entity, but not physically at its own premises). This pertains to the situation in
which data is stored in the cloud, which means using a subscription service on external
servers. Provisions of the tax law, indicating the possibility of storage on serves outside the

country, do not indicate the ownership of the server, etc. The only requirement is to ensure
online access.


4.5.4.2.    Recommendations

It is proposed to introduce to chapter 8 of the Accounting Act a provision regulating the
possibility of storage of electronic data using servers located outside the entity, on condition
of providing access to this data. Such a permission should also pertain to the situation of
archiving data by entities providing services in scope of document storage.

4.5.5.     Archiving financial statements (storage)

                       Act of law: Art. 74. par. 1 of the Accounting Act

 Approved annual financial statements should be stored permanently.


4.5.5.1.    Problem

In comparing the regulations in force in other countries, Poland is the only country which
requires permanent storage of approved financial statements. This matter was pointed out
by nearly all the survey participants, who opined, that there is no justification or need for
permanent storage.


Arguments:
Approved annual financial statements are submitted to the relevant court register. It is
usually the National Court Register (KRS). Storage of files by KRS is regulated by the
Regulation of Minister of Justice of 5 March 2004 on storage of case files and their transfer
to state archives or to be destroyed (Journal of Laws of 2004, No. 46, item 443).

Analysis of the provisions of the Regulation shows, that files from the business register are
stored for a period of 30 years and then transferred to state archives or destroyed –
decision in this scope is taken by a committee appointed by the president of the relevant
court.

It would seem reasonable to introduce a limit on storage period for approved financial
statements. Storage period could be 10 years. However, such limitation of required storage
period should be conditional upon submission of approved financial statements to the


                                                                                            107
relevant court register. The problem here will be financial statements of natural persons
conducting business activity and civil partnerships, which apply provisions of the Accounting
Act. A natural person conducting business activity is not required to be entered into KRS,
and may commence business operations upon being entered into register of businesses.
Accounting Act (art. 69) names only the court register as body competent for submission of
approved annual financial statements. It does not envisage an obligation to submit financial
statements to any other registry.

Such a solution would be a convenience for the entrepreneurs, reducing their administrative
burdens – does not apply to natural persons conducting business activity and partners of
civil partnerships.


4.5.5.2.    Recommendations

It is proposed that art. 74 par. 1 should be worded as follows: “Approved annual financial
statements, which were submitted to the National Court Register, should be stored for a
period of 10 years from the end of the year in which the financial statements were
approved”. Financial statements not submitted to the National Court Register should be
stored for a period of 30 years from the end of the year in which the financial statements
were approved.

 Documentation of the bookkeeping method adopted – for a period no shorter than
 five years from the expiry of its validity date.


4.5.6.1.    Problem

There is no clear definition as to when the validity date of accounting policy expires.

Arguments:
Many entities do not update their documentation of accounting policy. In many cases, the
update is effected in form of individual annexes, but a consolidated text is not produced. It
is difficult for the entities to determine the moment when the validity date of accounting
policy expires.

In order to formulate this in a more clear manner, French regulations could be used, which
in context of the accounting policy say: “Documentation of accounting policy is stored as
long, as presentation of accounting documents, to which it pertains, is required.”


4.5.6.2.      Recommendations

It is proposed to change the wording in scope of accounting policy storage period as follows:
replacing the phrase in art. 74 par. 2 pt 5 “for a period no shorter than five years from the
expiry of its validity date” with a phrase “as long, as presentation of accounting documents,
to which it pertains, is required”.

If the description of the IT system is not going to be an element of accounting policy, it will
be necessary to specify its storage period in the Accounting Act.

         2)    employee payroll sheets or equivalents thereof - for the time for which
               access to such information is required under the legal regulations
               applicable to retirement pensions and disability allowances as well as
               under tax regulations, however no less than five years;
         3)    Accounting vouchers concerning proceeds from retail sales - until the date
               of the approval of the financial statements for a given financial year,
               however at least until the date the individuals in charge of assets intended
               for retail sales are discharged;
         4)    Accounting vouchers concerning construction in progress, bank and non-
               bank loans and commercial contracts, claims pursued in civil proceedings or
               covered by criminal or tax proceedings - for five years starting from the
               beginning of the year following the financial year in which the transactions
               and proceedings were finally terminated, paid off, settled or time-barred;
         5)    (…);



                                                                                           109
          6)    Documents concerning statutory warranties and complaints - 1 year after
                the expiry of the warranty validity date or settlement of the complaint;
          7)    stocktaking records – 5 years;
          8)    Other accounting vouchers and documents – 5 years.
    3.    Storage periods determined in par. 2 above should be calculated starting from
          the year following the financial year to which the respective files pertain.


4.5.7.1.       Problem

There are no uniform storage periods for books of accounts and accounting documents
specified in the Accounting Act and other regulations, including in particular tax regulations.

Arguments:
Tax Ordinance Act, in art. 86 par. 1 obligates the taxpayers to store books of accounts and
related documents until the statutes of limitation on tax obligation expire. According to art.
70 par. 1 of Tax Ordinance, statutes of limitation on a tax obligation expire in 5 years from
the end of calendar year in which tax payment term expired (however, one should keep in
mind the regulations determining interruptions of the limitation period). In general, this
means a need to store books and accounting documents for a period of 6 years after the
financial year to which given books and documents pertain. In comparison to requirements
of tax law, regulations of the Accounting Act quoted in the frame above seem to be defunct
– actually, they should not be applied, as in confrontation with tax law they might cause
serious trouble to the entities. All the participants of the survey have pointed out the need
to harmonize the provisions of tax and accounting law.

Entities also point out certain practical problems with meeting the requirements of art. 74
par. 2 pt 2 with respect to storage of payroll lists, payroll sheets, or other documents based
on which pension or disability benefits are calculated, for a period of 50 years from the day
the insured discontinued employment with the given payer. This stems from art. 125a par. 4
of the Act of 17 December 1998 on retirement pensions and disability allowances from
Social Insurance Fund (Journal of Laws of 2009, No. 153, item 1227 as amended).

In order to:
•        provide better security t employees themselves, by better protection of their personal
         data and ensuring physical security of documents, and
•        Reduce costs of small and medium companies,
it would be worth considering, whether perhaps the employer’s obligation to store such
documents should be limited to a few years period, same as in case of other documents.
After that period, employers would transfer the documents to State Archive of Personnel
and Payroll Records, which store relevant records.


                                                                                           110
Principles of transferring such documentation to state archives would require regulation in
the provisions of Act of 14 July 1983 on national archival fond and archives (Journal of Laws
of 2011, No. 123, item 698, as amended)


4.5.7.2.   Recommendations

Recommendation 1:
It is proposed to introduce storage periods listed below, counted from the beginning of the
year following the financial year to which the given files pertain.

                Type of file                                 Storage period

 Books of accounts                            6 years

 Employee payroll sheets or equivalents       For the time for which access to such
                                              information is required under the legal
                                              regulations applicable to retirement
                                              pensions and disability allowances as well as
                                              under tax regulations, however no less than
                                              6 years

 Accounting vouchers concerning               6 years
 proceeds from retail sales

 Accounting vouchers concerning               6 years starting from the beginning of the
 construction in progress, bank and non-      year following the financial year in which the
 bank loans and commercial contracts,         transactions and proceedings were finally
 claims pursued in civil proceedings or       terminated, paid off, settled or time-barred
 covered by criminal or tax proceedings

                               Placement of the recommendation

        Art. 74 par. 2 pt 1-4 and 6-8 of the Accounting Act – modification of wording.


Recommendation 2:
We propose adding par. 3, worded as follows: In case of the files indicated in par. 2 pt 2),


                                                                                          111
the entities may transfer them to State Archive of Personnel and Payroll Records, on
principles set forth in separate legislation”.

                             Placement of the recommendation

                       New paragraph in art. 74 of the Accounting Act.



4.5.8.     Granting access to files

                           Act of law: art. 75 of the Accounting Act

 Files or a part thereof may be made available to a third party:

 1)      for review on the premises of the entity – requires consent of the entity’s
         manager or an individual authorized by him/her,
 2)      outside the head office of the entity’s (branch’s) management – requires written
         consent of the entity’s manager and provided that a confirmed list of the
         documents taken away is left at the entity, (…).


4.5.8.1.    Problem

Methods of making files available to third parties on the entity’s premises but not in the
head office (branch) are not determined.

Arguments:
Doubts may arise with respect to making the files available e.g. at place of business
operations, which is neither the head office nor branch office, etc.

Here we propose to refer to the place of business operations, especially since in the VAT
regulations the competence of internal revenue body as a principles is determined not
according to head office or place of residence, but place of business operations.


4.5.8.2.    Recommendations

It is proposed to modify wording of art. 75 pt 2 by replacing the phrase “outside the head
office of the entity’s (branch’s) management” by phrase “outside the head office or place of
business operations of the entity”.

                             Placement of the recommendation

                              Art. 75 pt 2 of the Accounting Act.

 Chapters 2 and 8 of the Accounting Act.


4.5.9.1.    Problem

Frequent doubts of entities with respect to the possibility of electronic storage.

Arguments:
Entities are often not sure about possibilities of electronic storage. It is illustrated by high
frequency of inquiries made by representatives of entities in that respect. Also in the
Report on performance of II part of the Task, Attachment 15 – Selected comments of
entrepreneurs collected during direct interviews within the framework of measurement of
administrative burdens in provisions of commercial law, developed by Ministry of Economy,
there is a statement saying: “It would be a great simplification for many entrepreneurs if
archived accounting documentation could be stored in electronic format”. In general,
provisions of Chapters 2 and 8 of the Accounting Act unequivocally refer to printouts, but
they also open a possibility to move data to IT data carriers (provided that certain conditions
are met). Tax regulations do not include such an unequivocal determination.


4.5.9.2.    Recommendations

Since the scope of provisions of the Accounting Act is sufficient and understandable, it is
proposed to leave them unchanged,

                             Placement of the recommendation

 An entity may outsource bookkeeping to a company referred to in Article 76a par.3
 below, or to a company based in another member state in the understanding of Article
 2 par.1, item 4 of the Act on Providing Services in the Republic of Poland, dated 4
 March 2010 (…), carrying out a business activity in this area.

 Art. 76a par. 1 and 3

 1.    Bookkeeping services are a business activity within the meaning of the legal
       regulations on freedom of economic activity, consisting of providing services in
       the field of the activities referred to in Article 4 par. 3 items 2–6 above.
 3.    The activity referred to in par.1 and 2 above may be conducted by business
       entities, on condition that activities in this scope will be performed by persons
       who:
       1)    have full legal capacity;
       2)    were not convicted by a final and non-appealable court judgment of
             offences against document credibility, property, business dealings or
             dealings in money and securities, of tax offences or the acts specified in
             Chapter 9 of the Act.

 Art. 76h par.1

 1.    The business entities referred to in Article 76a par.3 above are obligated to
       conclude a third party liability insurance contract against damages caused in
       connection with carrying out the business activity referred to in Article 76a par. 1
       and 2 above.



4.6.1.1.    Problem

Foreign entities are excluded from the requirements of chapter 8a in scope of provision of
bookkeeping services. This results in a risk of lower quality of provided services.

Arguments:
In the era of progressing globalization, an increasingly frequent solution is to outsource
accounting services to so-called shared services centers, which frequently provide services
to entities from a number of countries, including entities from Poland, which apply the
provisions of Accounting Act. Such entities may be located either in Poland or abroad. In
the second case, the notion of foreign company applies, as stated in art. 11 par. 2.

Due to the fact, that the provision is formulated as an alternative (using the word “or”), in
case of outsourcing bookkeeping services to a foreign entity such an entity is not required to



                                                                                          114
meet any of the obligations from chapter 8a, i.e. neither requirements in scope of clean
criminal record (art. 76a par. 3) nor in scope of mandatory third party liability insurance (art.
76h par. 1). Such requirements are imposed by the Act on Polish entities providing
bookkeeping services. Such inconsistency favors foreign entities at the expense of Polish
ones. Moreover, lack of regulation and even very limited requirements with respect to
foreign entities increases the risk of reduced quality of provided services.

Proposed solution refers to requirements of art. 10 par. 1 pt 10) of the Act of 4 March 2010
on Providing Services in the Republic of Poland, according to which “The service provider,
before entering into a written contract, and in case of absence of a written contract –
before commencing provision of services, is obligated to provide the client following
information (if in place): (...) about mandatory insurance or financial guarantee, along with
information on insurer or guarantor, as well as about territorial scope of insurance;”.


4.6.1.2.    Recommendations

Recommendation 1:
We propose adding par. 3a to art. 76a, worded as follows: “Provisions of par. 3 apply
respectively to entities from other member states, conducting business activity in this
scope, in the understanding of art. 11 par. 2”.

 An entity may outsource bookkeeping to a company referred to in Article 76a Section
 3 below, or to a company based in another member state in the understanding of
 Article 2 Section 1, item 4 of the Act on Providing Services in the Republic of Poland,
 dated 4 March 2010 (…), carrying out a business activity in this area.


4.6.2.1.    Problem

Limited possibility of outsourcing bookkeeping services to foreign entities from certain
countries.

Arguments:
In the era of progressing globalization, an increasingly frequent solution is to outsource
accounting services to so-called shared services centers, which frequently provide services
to entities from a number of countries, including entities from Poland, which apply the
provisions of Accounting Act. Such entities may be located either in Poland or abroad.

Definition of a foreign entity stems from the Act on Providing Services in the Republic of
Poland. According to this definition, “member state” means a member state of European
Union, member state of European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) – a party to agreement on
European Economic Area and states, which entered into agreements with European
Community and its member states, regulating freedom of services provision.

Some users have pointed out that the provisions regulating outsourcing bookkeeping
services to foreign entities limit this possibility only to certain countries. It would seem that
this problem could be important for entities - members of international capital groups,
which create shared services centers in selected countries.


4.6.2.2.    Recommendations

However, due to the risk of lowering the quality of services provided, as well as inconsistent
criteria for foreign entities (this matter is discussed in more detail in pt 4.6.1.), we do not
suggest changing these regulations.

                             Placement of the recommendation

4.6.3.     Responsibility for supervision

                        Act of law: Art. 4. par. 5 of the Accounting Act



                                                                                             116
    The manager of an entity is responsible for the performance of the accounting
    obligations specified by the Act, including for supervision, also if certain accounting
    obligations, save for the responsibility for physical stocktaking, are assigned to a third
    party with his/her/its consent. (…)


4.6.3.1.     Problem

Accumulation of responsibility of the manager of the entity in case accounting obligations
are assigned to a third party. This issue pertains both to accountancy practices and
employees of the entity. There is no direct indication of responsibility of persons, to whom
the obligations in scope of accounting were assigned. This responsibility stems only from
provisions of art. 77-79 of the Accounting Act, which pertain to criminal liability.

Arguments:
In case of assigning accounting obligations to a third party, manager of the entity is
responsible for:
•      performance of obligations in scope of accounting,
•      supervision.

It is evident that there is an accumulation of responsibility of the manager of the entity. It
should be considered, whether maybe at least in case of small and medium entities – in case
of assignment of accounting obligation to a third party with their consent, in particular to
persons providing bookkeeping services – responsibility of the manager of the entity should
be limited to supervision only.

At this point, it is worthwhile to look at art. 77-79 of the Accounting Act, which pertain to
criminal liability. Among offences against Accounting Act, offence related to lack of
supervision was not listed. In a situation of tort – if the manager of the entity assigns tasks
in scope of accounting to another person - manager of the entity will also be liable as
perpetrator. He/she will also be liable for supervision – however they will not be penalized
based on the Accounting Act, as art 77-79 do not specify any sanctions for lack of
supervision.


4.6.3.2.     Recommendations

Recommendation 1:
In order to differentiate the offence of “lack of supervision” from such accounting offences
as: „“failure to keep books of accounts”, “failure to prepare financial statements”, “posting
inaccurate data in books of accounts”, including inaccurate data in financial statements",



                                                                                            117
“incorrect bookkeeping”, “incorrect preparation of financial statements” 26, it is proposed to
insert another point in art. 77, “failure to meet supervision obligations”.

                                Placement of the recommendation

                        Art. 77 of the Accounting Act – a new point added.


Recommendation 2:
It is proposed to add to art. 4 par. 5 of the Accounting Act a sentence worded as follows:
“Persons, to whom tasks in scope of accounting were assigned with their consent are
responsible for performance of accounting obligations".

                                Placement of the recommendation

4.7.       OTHER


4.7.1.     Change of IT system during the year


4.7.1.1.     Problem

The Accounting Act does not provide a procedure for handling change of IT system during
the year.

Arguments:
Many entities, for various reasons, change their IT systems during the year. Many doubts
arise then. The Accounting Standards Committee, in its Position, in pts 35-45 has provided
detailed regulation in this scope. Change of software, or parts thereof, or even only the
version, also causes controversy in terms of requirements in scope of marking the books of
accounts with the name of data processing system – what should those markings be in case
of a switch during the course of the year.

It is proposed to:
•      in case application of national accounting standards becomes mandatory – create a

4.7.2.     Notions included in the Position of the Accounting Standards

4.7.2.1.    Problem

In the Accounting Act, there are no definitions of notions: IT system, financial and
accounting system, report.

Arguments:
Accounting Act using notions of: IT system, financial and accounting system, report without
providing definitions results in lack of clarity and different interpretations by users.


4.7.2.2.    Recommendations

It is proposed to insert notions: IT system, financial and accounting system, report,
contained in pts 3, 4 and 5 of the Position of Accounting Standards Committee to the list of
definitions of the Accounting Act.

                           CONCLUDING REMARK

In preparing this study, our main objective was first and foremost to provide, in the
