When asked, health care staff can usually list the types of problems they
face daily in providing patient care. However, often they do not believe
that they have the accountability or power to do anything about it.
And in many organizations, staff members have not been trained in the
Quality Improvement approaches used to investigate and solve problems.
Nonetheless, Quality Improvement methodology is increasingly being
used effectively in many developing countries to help health care teams
to identify problems and to find and implement solutions.

The key factor in this process is the use of data to support decisions.
The type of data collected will vary from place to place, but commonly

STEP 1: Get Organized                                                     STEP 3: Conduct the Assessment
The first step towards improving standards of care and services is        What areas does the Assessment cover?
to form a Quality Assessment Team (or committee). Management              The Self-Assessment Template that follows is based on a defined set of
should write the terms of reference for the team to provide the team      31 standards, covering five key areas:
members with the expectations for their work.
                                                                          Clinical Governance and Leadership (CGL)
A team leader needs to be appointed who is responsible for organizing     •	 Governance documents	
the group, assigning tasks and coordinating the effort. Several           •	   Management responsibility for operations
characteristics have been identified for an effective team leader;        •	   Oversight of contracts	
this is a person who is interested, respected by others, an effective     •	   Departmental scope of services and policies and procedures
facilitator, and can devote the necessary time required. This person is   •	   Space and equipment planning	
not necessarily a manager.                                                •	   Staff recruitment, retention and development

All main categories of staff (e.g. medical, nursing, pharmacy,            Ethics and Patient Rights (EPR)
housekeeping, and security) should participate on the team. A team        •	 Verification of professional staff credentials	
of six to eight individuals is often considered to be most effective.     •	   Processes to support patient and family rights
                                                                          •	   Informed consent
                                                                          •	   Framework for ethical management
STEP 2: Orient the Team                                                   •	   Organ and tissue donation
Who conducts the assessment?                                              •	   Reproductive health policies/IVF
The Quality Assessment Team is responsible for conducting the             •	   Termination of pregnancy services	
assessment. And they may also ask for assistance from any member          •	   Clinical research
of the staff. The assessment should be a participative process, so that
ownership of the quality improvement process spreads throughout           Quality Measurement and Improvement (QMI)
the organization. Community members also may be invited to                •	   Clinical practice guidelines and pathways	
participate. These might be individuals who hold specific positions,      •	   Leaders’ involvement and support
such as members of a community health committee (if one exists),          •	   Infection prevention and control	
parent-teachers’ association, local council or non-governmental           •	   Medications use
organization (NGO). Or they may be individuals who have had               •	   Sentinel events	
recent experiences in the hospital, as these individuals can provide
insights from the users’ perspective. When conducting assessments of      Patient Safety (PS)	
the fire systems, the Civil Defense may be consulted with.                •	   Patient identification	
                                                                          •	   Effective communication
Team orientation                                                          •	   High alert medications	
The team needs to be oriented to its purpose and objectives, as well as   •	   Correct site, procedure, and patient for surgery
to key quality principles and methodologies. An introduction to the       •	   Health care associated infections
importance of quality improvement by the head of the facility will        •	   Risk of falls
lend credence to the team’s work. The team leader is a likely person
to review the quality standards and assist the team in understanding
how to conduct the assessment. If the organization has individuals
who have been trained in Quality Improvement methods, they could
be helpful in training the team.

Intent of CGL.4
Each department has a document called a “Scope of Services” that describes the goals and services provided by the department. The scope also
includes the types of staff required to assess and meet patient care needs. The document describes how clinical services are coordinated within
each department as well as with other departments and services. Unnecessary duplication of services is avoided or eliminated to conserve
resources. Policies and procedures are written to standardize clinical care. A consistent format is used for departmental documents.

Each department’s leader communicates their human resources and other resource requirements to the organization’s senior managers. This
helps ensure that adequate staff, space, equipment, and other resources are available to meet patients’ needs at all times. As these resource
needs may change or may not be fully met, the departmental leaders need to have plans to respond to resource shortages to ensure safe and
effective care for all patients.

Standard CGL.6 [Staff recruitment, retention and development]
Organization leaders ensure that there are uniform programs for the recruitment, retention, development, continuing education, and
health and safety of all staff.

Intent of CGL.6
An organization’s ability to care for patients is directly related to its ability to attract and retain qualified, competent staff. Leaders recognize
that staff retention, more than recruitment, provides greater long-term benefit. Retention is increased when leaders support staff advancement
through continuing education. Thus, the leaders plan and implement programs related to recruitment, retention, development, and continuing
education for each category of staff. The organization’s recruitment program considers published guidelines such as those from the WHO,
the International Council of Nurses, and the World Medical Association. The health and safety of an organization’s staff are critical for
maintaining staff security, satisfaction, and productivity.

Ethics and Patient Rights (EPR)
Standard EPR.1 [Verification of credentials of professional staff]
The organization has an effective process for gathering, verifying, and evaluating the credentials (e.g. licenses, education, training, and
experience) of those professional staff permitted to provide patient care.

Intent of EPR.1
Physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists and others who are licensed to provide clinical services represent those primarily responsible for
patient care and care outcomes. Thus, the organization has the highest level of accountability to ensure that each of these practitioners is
qualified to provide safe and effective care and treatment to patients. The organization assumes this accountability by:

•	 understanding the applicable laws and regulations that identify those permitted to work in these positions;
•	 confirming that the organization will only permit such practitioners to work within it;
•	 gathering all available credentials for each practitioner including:
   –– at least evidence of education and training and evidence of current licensure,
   –– evidence of current competence through information from other organizations at which the practitioner practiced,
   –– letters of recommendation, and/or
   –– other information the organization may require such as health history, pictures/ID, etc.;
•	 verifying of essential information such as:
   –– current registry or licensure, especially when such documents are periodically renewed,
   –– any certifications, and
   –– evidence of completion of postgraduate education.

The organization needs to make every effort to verify essential information, especially when the education took place in another country and/
or a significant time ago. Secure web-sites, documented phone confirmation from sources, written confirmation, and verification by trusted
third parties, such as designated official governmental or nongovernmental agencies, may be used.

Standard EPR.2 [Patient and family rights]
The organization implements processes that support patients’ and families’ rights during care.

Intent of EPR.2
An organization’s leaders are primarily responsible for how the organization treats its patients. Thus, the leaders need to know and understand
patient and family rights and their organization’s responsibilities as identified in laws and regulations. The leaders provide direction to ensure
that staff members throughout the organization assume responsibility for protecting these rights. To effectively protect and advance patient
rights, the leaders work collaboratively and seek to understand their responsibilities in relation to the community served by the organization.
The organization respects the right of patients (and in some circumstances the rights of the patient’s family) to have the prerogative to determine
what information regarding their care would be provided to their families or others, and under what circumstances. For example, some patients
may not wish to have a diagnosis shared with their family. Policies and procedures are developed and implemented to ensure that all staff
members are aware of and respond to patient and family rights issues when they interact with and care for patients throughout the organization.

Standard EPR.3 [Informed consent]
Patients’ informed consent is obtained through a process defined by the organization and is carried out by trained staff.

Intent of EPR.3
One of the main ways that patients are involved in their care decisions is by granting informed consent. To consent, a patient must be informed
of those factors related to the planned care required for an informed decision. Informed consent may be obtained at several points in the care
process, e.g. when a patient is admitted for inpatient care, and before undertaking certain procedures or treatments for which the risks may be
high. The consent process is clearly defined by the organization in policies and procedures. Relevant laws and regulations are incorporated into
the policies and procedures. Patients and families are informed as to what tests, procedures, and treatments require consent and how they can
give consent (e.g. verbally, by signing a consent form, or through some other means). Patients and families understand who may, in addition to
the patient, give consent. Designated staff members are trained in how to inform patients and in how to obtain and document their consent.

Standard EPR.4 [Ethical management]
The organization establishes a framework for ethical management that ensures that patient care is provided within business, financial,
ethical, and legal norms and that protects patients and their rights.

Intent of EPR.4
A health care organization has an ethical and legal responsibility to its patients and its community. The leaders understand these responsibilities
as they apply to the organization’s business and clinical activities. They create guiding documents to provide a consistent framework to carry
out these responsibilities. The organization operates within this framework to:

•	    disclose ownership and any conflicts of interest;
•	    honestly portray its services;
•	    provide clear admission, transfer, and discharge policies;
•	    accurately bill for its services; and
•	    resolve conflicts when financial incentives and payment arrangements could compromise patient care.

The framework also supports the organization’s professional staff when confronted by ethical dilemmas in patient care such as disagreements
between patients and their families, and between patients and their care providers, regarding care decisions, and inter-professional disagreements.
These documents are readily available to provide such support.

Standard EPR.5 [Organ and tissue donation and transplantation]
The organization implements safeguards to ensure compliance with international guidelines.

Intent of EPR.5
Transplant services raise many important ethical issues. For organizations involved in or with links to organ donation and transplant programs:

•	    The organization supports the choice of patients and families to donate organs and other tissues for research or transplantation.
•	    Information is provided on the donation process.
•	    Policies and procedures are developed to guide the procurement and donation process and the transplantation process.
•	    The policies are consistent with laws and regulations and take account of social and ethical issues.
•	    Staff are trained in implementing the policies and procedures to support patient and family choices.
•	    The organization complies with recognized international guidelines on organ donation and transplantation9, 10, 11. Staff are trained in
      these guidelines and in related contemporary concerns and issues. These include, for example information on organ and tissue shortages,
      the illegal trade in organs, the harvesting of organs without consent from dead patients (or executed prisoners).

The organization has a responsibility to ensure that valid consent is received from live donors. It ensures that adequate controls are in
place to prevent patients from feeling pressured to donate. Controls also identify instances where there may be commercial arrangements
between donors and recipients, including via third parties, e.g. agents and intermediaries. It cooperates with other organizations and agencies
responsible for all or a portion of the procurement, banking, transportation, or transplantation process.

Standard EPR.6 [Reproductive health practices/IVF]
The organization sets policies and oversees practices relating to fertility treatment.

Intent of EPR.6
Organizations providing fertility services develop and implement reproductive health policies for fertility treatment (e.g. IVF), which take
account of legal, social and ethical considerations.

IVF services raise many important ethical issues that should be addressed in the policies. For example:

•	 When embryos are formed outside the body, what should be done with those that are not transferred?
   –– Is it acceptable to use them for research?
   –– Could they be donated to another infertile couple?
   –– Should they be frozen for future use? Or should they be destroyed?
   –– And who has the right to make these decisions?
•	 Donation of gametes (egg and sperm)
   –– What criteria are used to determine who may donate and who may receive gametes (e.g. age, relationship status, family size, etc?)
   –– What procedures are followed for recruiting, counseling and treating donors?
   –– What rules apply to the compensation of donors?
   –– What are the rules determining anonymity, or otherwise, of donors?
•	 Ethical questions concern the practice of transferring several embryos in order to increase the likelihood of pregnancy. (If all the embryos
   successfully implant, the woman faces the prospect of a high order multiple pregnancy, with its attendant increased risks of obstetric
   complications, premature birth and disability12).

Sex selection using IVF techniques presents a wide range of important ethical, legal and social implications. A significant ethical concern is
that sex selection for non-medical reasons may reinforce discrimination, particularly against women and girls.13

Informed consent by women for all reproductive services is required. Services are carried out based on standardized procedures by qualified
practitioners. And, a registry is kept to track the outcomes.

Standard EPR.7 [Termination of pregnancy services]
The organization sets policies and procedures relating to termination of pregnancy services.

Intent of EPR.7
Organizations providing termination of pregnancy services take account of legal, social and ethical considerations.

Informed consent by women is required.

Services are carried out based on standardized procedures by qualified practitioners.

Sex selection using termination of pregnancy presents a wide range of important ethical, legal and social implications. A significant ethical
concern is that sex selection for non-medical reasons may reinforce discrimination, particularly against women and girls.

Standard EPR.8 [Clinical research]
The organization informs patients and their families about how to gain access to clinical research, investigations or trials involving
human subjects.

Intent of EPR.8
An organization that conducts research, investigations, or clinical trials involving human subjects provides information to patients and families
about how to gain access to those activities when relevant to the patient’s treatment needs19. The organization does not commence trials until
their purpose and benefits are clear and pertinent ethical issues have been fully considered. When patients are asked to participate, they are
given information upon which to base their decision. Patients are informed that they can refuse to participate or withdraw participation and
that their refusal or withdrawal will not compromise their access to the organization’s services. The organization has policies and procedures
for providing patients and families with this information.

Quality Measurement and Improvement (QMI)
Standard QMI.1 [Clinical practice guidelines]
Clinical practice guidelines and clinical pathways are used to guide clinical care.

Intent of QMI.1
The goals of health care organizations include:

•	     using evidence-based medicine;
•	     standardizing clinical care processes;
•	     reducing risks within care processes, particularly those associated with critical decision steps; and
•	     providing clinical care in a timely, effective manner using available resources efficiently.

The organization uses a variety of tools to reach these goals. It seeks to develop clinical care processes and make clinical care decisions based
on the best available scientific evidence. Clinical practice guidelines are useful tools in this effort to understand and apply the best science to
a particular diagnosis or condition.

The organization seeks to standardize care processes. Clinical care pathways (protocols, algorithms, etc) are useful tools in this effort to ensure
effective integration and coordination of care and efficient use of available resources.

The organization’s leaders collaborate to carry out a Quality Improvement and Patient Safety program.

Intent of QMI.2
The organization’s leaders play a key role in ensuring that the quality improvement and patient safety plans shape the organization’s culture
and make an impact on every aspect of operations. Leaders ensure the program involves:

•	 continuous system design and redesign in the quality improvement process;
•	 a multidisciplinary approach, with all departments and services in the organization included;
•	 coordination among the multiple organizational units concerned with quality and safety. These might include, for example,
   –– a clinical laboratory quality control program,
   –– a facility risk management program, or
   –– a patient safety program.
      (An inclusive program is necessary to improving patient outcomes because patients typically receive care from many different
      departments and services and/or types of clinical staff); and,
•	 a systematic approach, i.e. employing similar quality processes to carry out all improvement and patient safety activities across the
   organization.

Standard QMI.3 [Infection control]
There is a designated coordination mechanism for all infection control activities that involves physicians, nurses, and others as
appropriate to the size and complexity of the organization.

Intent of QMI.3
Infection prevention and control activities reach into every part of a health care organization and involve individuals in multiple departments
and services, e.g. in clinical departments, facility maintenance, food services, house-keeping, laboratory, pharmacy and sterilization services.
There is a designated mechanism to coordinate the overall Infection Control program. That mechanism may involve a small working group,
or a coordinating committee. Responsibilities include, for example, setting criteria to define health care–associated infections, establishing
data collection and surveillance methods, designing strategies to address infection prevention and control risks, and reporting processes.
Coordination involves communicating with all parts of the organization to ensure that the program is continuous and proactive. Whatever
the mechanism chosen by the organization to coordinate the infection control program, physicians and nurses are represented and engaged
in the activities with the infection control professionals. Others may be included as determined by the organization’s size and complexity
of services (e.g. epidemiologist, data collection expert, statistician, central sterilization manager, microbiologist, pharmacist, housekeeping
services manager, environmental or facilities services manager, operating theater supervisor).

Standard QMI.4 [Medications use]
Medications use complies with applicable laws and regulations and is efficiently organized to meet patient needs.

Intent of QMI.4
Medications, as important resources in patient care, must be organized effectively and efficiently. Medication management is not only the
responsibility of the pharmaceutical service but also of managers and clinicians. How this responsibility is shared depends on the organization’s
structure and staffing. In those cases where a pharmacy is not present, medications may be managed on each clinical unit according to
organization policy. In other cases, where a large central pharmacy is present, the pharmacy may organize and control medications throughout
the organization. Applicable laws and regulations are incorporated into the operation of the medication management system. To ensure
efficient and effective medication management and use, the organization conducts a systems review at least once a year. The review includes
the medications selection and procurement, storage, ordering and transcribing, preparing and dispensing, administration and monitoring.
The review considers evidence-based practices, monitoring activities, documentation of improvements, and safety systems.

The organization uses a defined process for identifying and managing sentinel events.

Intent of QMI.5
The organization’s definition of a sentinel event includes events as may be required by law or regulation, and those viewed by the organization
as appropriate. All events that meet the definition are assessed by performing a credible root cause analysis50. When the root cause analysis
reveals that systems improvements or other actions can prevent or reduce the risk of such sentinel events recurring, the organization redesigns
the processes and takes whatever other actions are appropriate to do so. It is important to note that the term “sentinel event” does not always
refer to an error or mistake, or suggest any particular legal liability.

Patient Safety (PS)
Standard PS.1 [Patient identification]
The organization has established procedures for accurately identifying patients.

Intent of PS.1
Wrong-patient errors occur in virtually all aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Patients may be sedated, disoriented, or not fully alert; may
change beds, rooms, or locations within the hospital; may have sensory disabilities; or may be subject to other situations that may lead
to errors in correct identification. The intent of this goal is twofold: first, to reliably identify the individual as the person for whom the
service or treatment is intended; second, to match the service or treatment to that individual. Policies and/or procedures are collaboratively
developed to improve identification processes. In particular, these include the processes used to identify a patient: prior to surgery; when
giving medications; blood, or blood products; taking blood and other specimens for clinical testing; or providing any other treatments or
procedures. The policies and/or procedures require at least two ways to identify a patient, such as the patient’s name, identification number,
birth date, or other ways. The patient’s room number or location cannot be used for identification. The policies and/or procedures clarify
the use of two different identifiers in different locations within the organization, such as outpatient services, the emergency department, or
operating theater. Procedures for identifying comatose patients who are not in possession of identification documents are also included.

Standard PS.2 [Effective communication]
The organization develops an approach to improve the effectiveness of communication among caregivers.

Intent of PS.2
Effective communication, which is timely, accurate, complete, clear, and understood by the recipient, reduces errors, and results in improved
patient safety. Communication can be electronic, written, or verbal. The most error-prone communications are patient care orders given
verbally, including those given over the telephone. (For example, an error-prone communication is the verbal report back of critical test results,
such as a clinical laboratory telephoning a patient care unit to report the results of a STAT test).

The organization collaboratively develops a policy and/or procedure for verbal and telephone orders that includes:

•	 the writing down, or entering into a computer, of the complete order (or test result by the receiver of the information),
•	 the receiver reading back the order (or test result), and
•	 the confirmation that what has been written down and read back is accurate.

(This practice is sometimes referred to as “Listen, Write and Read”).

The policy and/or procedure identify permissible alternatives when the read-back process may not be possible, such as in the operating theater
and in emergency situations.

Standard PS.3 [High alert medications]
The organization develops an approach to improve the safety of high-alert medications.

Intent of PS.3
When medications are part of a patient treatment plan, appropriate management is critical to ensuring patient safety. A frequently cited
medication safety issue is the unintentional administration of concentrated electrolytes (e.g. potassium chloride [2mEq/ml or more
concentrated], potassium phosphate, sodium chloride [0.9% or more concentrated], and magnesium sulfate [50% or more concentrated]).
This error can occur when a staff member has not been properly oriented to the patient care unit, when contract nurses are used and not
properly oriented, or during emergencies. The most effective means to reduce or eliminate this occurrence is to remove the concentrated
electrolytes from the patient care unit to the pharmacy. The organization collaboratively develops a policy and/or procedure that prevents the
location of concentrated electrolytes in patient care areas where misadministration can occur. The policy and/or procedure specifies any areas
where concentrated electrolytes are clinically necessary (such as the emergency department or operating theater); how they are clearly labeled;
and how they are stored in those areas in a manner that restricts access to prevent inadvertent administration.

Standard PS.4 [Correct site, procedure, and patient for surgery]
The organization develops an approach to ensuring correct-site, correct-procedure, and correct-patient surgery.

Intent of PS.4
Wrong-site, wrong-procedure, wrong-patient surgery is a disturbingly common occurrence in health care organizations. These errors are the
result of ineffective or inadequate communication between members of the surgical team, lack of patient involvement in site marking, and
lack of procedures for verifying the operative site.

Frequent contributing factors include inadequate patient assessment, a culture that does not support open communication among surgical
team members, problems related to illegible handwriting, and the use of abbreviations.

Organizations need to collaboratively develop a policy and/or procedure that is effective in eliminating these problems. Evidence-based
practices include those described in the WHO Safe Surgery Checklist51 and the Joint Commission’s Universal Protocol for Preventing Wrong
Site, Wrong Procedure, Wrong Person Surgery™52.

The essential processes found in these protocols are:
•	 marking the surgical site;
•	 a preoperative verification process; and
•	 a time-out that is held immediately before the start of a procedure.

Marking the surgical site involves the patient and is done with an unambiguous mark. The mark:
•	 should be consistent throughout the organization;
•	 should be made by the person performing the procedure (i.e. the surgeon);
•	 should take place with the patient awake and aware, if possible; and
•	 must be visible after the patient is prepped and draped.

The surgical site is marked in all cases involving laterality, multiple structures (fingers, toes, lesions), or multiple levels (spine). The purpose of
the preoperative verification process is to:
•	 verify the correct site, procedure, and patient;
•	 ensure that all relevant documents, images, and studies are available, properly labeled, and displayed; and
•	 verify that any required special equipment and/or implants are present.

The time-out permits any unanswered questions or confusion to be resolved. The time-out is conducted in the location the procedure will be
done, just before starting the procedure, and involves the entire operative team. The organization determines how the process is to be briefly
documented, such as in a checklist.

Infection prevention and control are challenging in most health care settings, and rising rates of health care associated infections are a major
concern for patients and health care professionals. Infections common to all health care settings include catheter-associated urinary tract
infections, blood stream infections and pneumonia (often associated with mechanical ventilation). Central to the elimination of these and
other infections is proper hand hygiene. Internationally acceptable hand hygiene guidelines are available from the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) – see resources referenced in earlier footnotes 44 to 48.

The organization has a collaborative process to develop policies and/or procedures that adapt or adopt currently published and generally
accepted hand hygiene guidelines, and for the implementation of those guidelines within the organization.

Standard PS.6 [Falls prevention]
The organization develops an approach to reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from falls.

Intent of PS.6
Falls account for a significant portion of injuries in hospitalized patients. The organization should evaluate patients’ risk of falls and take
action to reduce this risk and to reduce the risk of injury should a fall occur. The evaluation could include fall history, medications and alcohol
consumption review, gait and balance screening, and walking aids used by the patient.

The organization establishes and implements a fall-risk reduction/prevention program. This is based on appropriate policies and/or procedures,
and on physical modifications to the facilities (e.g. fitting of hand-rails, non-slip floor covering etc).

Facility Safety and Emergency Management (FSE)
Standard FSE.1 [Safety and security]
The organization plans and implements a program to provide a safe and secure physical environment.

Intent of FSE.1
The organization provides a safe and secure facility. Prevention and planning are essential to creating a safe and supportive patient care facility.
To plan effectively, the organization must be aware of all of the risks present in the facility. This includes safety as well as security risks. The
objectives are to:
1.	prevent accidents and injuries;
2.	maintain a safe and secure environment for patients, families, staff and visitors; and
3.	reduce and control potential hazards and risks.
(These are particularly important during periods of construction or renovation).

In addition, to ensure security, all staff, visitors, vendors and others in the organization are identified and issued temporary or permanent
badges or other identification. Areas intended to be secure (such as the newborn nursery) are secure and monitored. Periodic inspections of
the facility check for potential hazards, e.g. sharp and broken furniture that could injure, locations where there is no escape from fire, or secure
areas where there is inadequate monitoring/control. These periodic inspections are documented and help the organization to plan and carry
out improvements and to plan for longer-term facility upgrading or replacement. By understanding the risks present in the organization’s
physical facility, the management can develop a proactive plan to reduce these risks for patients, families, staff, and visitors.

The organization plans and implements a program to ensure that all occupants are safe from fire, smoke, or other potential emergencies
in the facility.

Intent of FSE.4
Fire is an ever-present risk in a health care facility. Thus, every organization needs to plan how it will keep its occupants safe in case of fire or
smoke. The organization adopts preventive measures including:
•	 safe storage and handling of potentially flammable materials (e.g. flammable medical gasses such as oxygen);
•	 use of early warning/early detection systems such as fire patrols, smoke detectors and fire alarms;
•	 provision of suppression mechanisms such as water hoses, chemical suppressants, and sprinkler systems;
•	 managing hazards related to any construction in or adjacent to the patient-occupied buildings; and
•	 ensuring safe and unobstructed means of exit for patients, staff and visitors in the event of a fire.

Such plans and safeguards are required no matter what the age, size, or construction of the facility.

Intent of FSE.5
In order to ensure that medical equipment is available for use and functioning properly, the organization
•	 maintains an inventory of medical equipment;
•	 regularly inspects medical equipment;
•	 tests medical equipment as appropriate to its use and requirements; and
•	 undertakes preventive maintenance.

Qualified individuals provide these services. Equipment is inspected and tested when new and then on an ongoing basis, as appropriate
to the equipment’s age and use, or based on manufacturers’ instructions. Inspections, test results, and any maintenance undertaken are
documented. This helps ensure continuity of the maintenance process and supports capital planning for equipment replacements, upgrades,
and other changes.

Standard FSE.6 [Utilities management]
Potable water, electrical power, and medical gases are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, through regular or alternate sources,
to meet essential patient care needs.

Intent of FSE.6
Patient care, both routine and urgent, is provided on a 24-hour basis, every day of the week in most health care organizations. Thus, an
uninterrupted source of clean water and electrical power is essential to meet patient care needs. The organization continually endeavors to
ensure uninterrupted supply of potable water and of electrical power. Regular and alternate sources may be used to achieve this.

Next Steps



STEP 4: Score Performance
and Identify Gaps
After completing the assessment, the team should calculate the scores
and review the findings. The aim of this exercise is to identify the gaps
toward meeting the standards in order to make improvements and
take corrective actions. The process for doing this is described below.

The responses for each standard are summed to determine the level of
achievement, as follows:

1. 	Enter the scores for each question/element in the
    Self-Assessment Template on the following pages.
    The Scoring Key is:

	     0 = the organization does not meet the criterion

	     5 = yes, some elements are in place, but
      the criterion is not fully satisfied

	     10 = yes, the criterion is fully satisfied


2. 	 Add the 0, 5 and 10 scores for all of the measurable
     elements.

3. 	 Determine overall achievement by adding together
     the scores for all the standards and dividing by 1,600*
     (the total score possible).

* Note - The Highest Possible Score will be less if there are standards that
are not applicable (e.g. IVF, organ transplantation). Subtract 10 from the
Highest Possible Score for each element that is not applicable.

The reason that the following score-tables have a “Baseline Score”
column along with additional Score columns is to allow progress to
be tracked over time, i.e. as future assessments are undertaken.

The team will be able to determine the percentage of the standards met for each category, as well as the overall percentage of standards met.
This percentage will give the team a guide to where the main gaps are and where the organization needs to focus its attention. The team should
graph the overall score and use this percentage as a measure of on-going progress.

11. Organ donation and transplant
The organization complies with the WHO Guiding Principles on
Human Organ Transplantation.

Organ retrieval from living persons is not undertaken where there are
reasonable grounds to suspect that the donation is coerced or that a
financial consideration is expected by the donor.

The organization permits the allocation of organs on the basis of
morally relevant criteria only.

Transplantation is prohibited when the chance of success is insufficient
to justify the risks.

The buying and selling of organs are not performed or condoned by
the organization.

The harvesting of organs without prior consent from dead patients
(or their legal representative) is not performed or condoned by the
organization.

12. Gender selection
Sex selection, by selectively terminating a pregnancy for non-medical
reasons, is not performed or condoned. This encompasses a number
of related practices, including pregnancy ultrasound scanning,
where there are reasonable grounds to suspect a risk of termination
of pregnancy dependent upon the determined sex of the embryo or
fetus.

13. Assisted reproductive technologies
Interventions of human procreative processes [e.g. invitro fertilization
(IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), artificial insemination
by donor (AID)] are carried out with due consideration to donor
confidentiality, parental age limits, same sex couples, ownership of
donated sperm/eggs, multiple embryo transfer and genetic testing.
All such procedures are carried out within the laws and regulations
of the country.

Exploitation of clients seeking reproductive assistance (e.g. non-
required testing procedures or procedures unlikely to yield results),
or of egg donors is prohibited.

Harvesting of stem cells must only be done with the express permission
of the donor under the laws and regulations of the country.

14. Female genital mutilation
Female circumcision is not performed or condoned by the
organization.
