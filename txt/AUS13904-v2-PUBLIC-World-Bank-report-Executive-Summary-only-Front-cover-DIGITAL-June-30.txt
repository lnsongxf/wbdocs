FOREWORD

           Assistance to Least Developed Countries (LCDs), which Myanmar joined in April
           2013, the Government of Myanmar has asked the World Bank Group (WBG) to
           be the implementing agency for a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS).

           The general objectives of a DTIS are: (i) to assist the government in mainstreaming
           trade and competitiveness in the country’s overall development strategy; (ii) to
           provide a diagnostic and analytical tool to prioritize and sequence key reforms
           in the area of trade and competitiveness; and (iii) to provide a platform for
           development partners to coordinate action and align trade-related assistance
           with government priorities.

           This DTIS has identified a number of domestic and external constraints facing
           Myanmar as it strives to leverage regional and global integration for inclusive,
           export-led growth. Based on this, the current report provides analytical input
           on the linkages between trade and poverty, and highlights key steps to remove
           bottlenecks in terms of trade policy and trade facilitation.

                                          OVERVIEW
                                          After waiting in isolation for almost
                                          four decades, its re-integration
                                          into the global economy has
                                          presented Myanmar with a unique
                                          opportunity to leverage growth in
                                          trade to reduce poverty, promote
                                          shared prosperity and sustain the
                                          nationwide peace process.
                                          Following Myanmar’s dramatic decision to change
                                          its trajectory in recent years, the boom in trade and
                                          investment has boosted average economic growth
                                          beyond 7 percent per year as the country starts to
                                          catch up with its neighbors. With significant natural
                                          and agricultural resources, and comparative advantages
                                          from its resources, pool of labor and location as a
                                          natural hub to 40 percent of the world’s population,
                                          Myanmar has great potential. What is crucial now
                                          is that this potential is not squandered, but used to
                                          achieve transformational development gains that will
                                          improve the lives of its citizens by reducing poverty,
                                          spreading wealth, and helping to reduce social and
                                          ethnic tensions. All of this is within Myanmar’s
                                          grasp if it can seize the moment to design and apply
                                          appropriate policies to encourage trade and economic
                                          openness, and ensure that all stakeholders in the
                                          country’s future can share in the benefits, especially
                                          those in the most vulnerable and marginalized groups.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




The policies suggested in this
report have the potential not
only to transform Myanmar’s
economy through greater
trade, but also to transform the
lives of all of Myanmar’s citizens.
Trade can be honed by
policymakers into a tool for
wealth distribution and
poverty reduction. Myanmar
is at a historic juncture when
it could transform its economy
into one that addresses these
issues through improved trade
openness.

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY
Myanmar’s elections in 2015
marked      another    historic
milestone in the country’s
political    and    economic
transition that began in 2011.
In November 2015, the people of Myanmar voted
overwhelmingly for change and reform. It is now up
to Myanmar’s policymakers to deliver on the people’s
hopes and aspirations for a more prosperous, equitable
and peaceful Myanmar, with support from development
partners, including the World Bank Group.

Leveraging trade to underpin inclusive growth and
poverty reduction is within reach. While growing
rapidly in recent years, Myanmar’s trade is still modest
as a proportion of its GDP compared with its neighbors.
It still has huge potential to grow. Developing into
a major trading partner with its ASEAN neighbors
and beyond offers Myanmar a unique opportunity
to empower the private sector to drive its economic
opening, and spread the benefits of increasing trade
more equitably throughout society and across regions.
After all, Myanmar shares borders with countries that
account for some 20 percent of global GDP and 40
percent of the world’s population. Expanding trade can
help Myanmar to rebalance its economy away from
over-reliance on natural-resource industries that very
often offer little in the way of employment to ordinary
people, and have a history of provoking social tensions
and unrest in Myanmar’s more remote ethnic-minority
regions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




A new paradigm for private-sector driven growth.
Based on its diagnostic analysis of Myanmar’s current
trade environment, this report offers suggestions for
fostering competitiveness and a dynamic environment
for private sector growth to drive trade. Myanmar is
poised to take off on a new and ambitious trajectory
going forward. The challenges are daunting and success
cannot be guaranteed, but our hope is that the findings
in this report can provide important guidance and policy
options that can help to ensure success.

    Infrastructure
    development and
    regulatory reforms
    can occur in tandem


    Only one-third of homes have electricity in
    Myanmar. Only 33 percent of Myanmar households
    have access to electricity, compared with 60 percent
    in Bangladesh and 99 percent in Vietnam. Myanmar’s
    logistics infrastructure (ports and their hinterland
    connections) ranked 137th out of 160 countries in the
    2014 Logistics Performance Indicator (LPI), the lowest
    among ASEAN countries. It is also less connected
    with global shipping-liner networks than Bangladesh
    or Vietnam. Both Yangon’s seaport terminals and
    highways along the country’s main economic corridors
    (i.e., Yangon-Mandalay-Muse) will soon reach their
    capacity limits, while the road along the Mandalay-
    Tamu corridor has been severely damaged by flooding.

    The business environment remains challenging for
    the private sector. While securing electricity and
    starting a business in Myanmar have become much
    easier and boosted its ranking in the World Bank
    Group’s 2016 Doing Business survey from 177 in
    2015 to 167, the business environment in Myanmar
    remains challenging for the private sector. International
    experience has shown time and again that in order to
    reap the benefits of hard infrastructure investments, it
    is also vital for the government to work in parallel on
    “soft” infrastructure reforms, including, in Myanmar’s
    case, (i) reforming procedures and regulations; (ii)
    strengthening institutional capacity; and (iii) ensuring
    broad ownership of the reforms.

Changes in procedures and incentives could be
considered to reduce trade costs and stimulate the
provision of services. On top of the steps already
taken to reduce import and export licenses, a number of
other procedures could also be considered for removal,
and whose objectives can be better addressed through
other means. Examples include: (i) the requirement for
exporters to pay 2 percent income tax in advance; (ii)
limits on how much banks can charge traders to process
L/Cs; and (iii) requirements to demonstrate that foreign
buyers have already paid for exports (or have used L/Cs).
Another example is the flat and relatively low charges
levied for storing containers in port (of just US$2/day),
creating port congestion. The Ministry of Commerce
(MoC) could consider reviewing these practices and
consulting stakeholders, including the Myanmar
Business Forum, with a view to removing them.

•	 Availability of reliable trade-related data (action
   A2 in the Action Matrix). Myanmar’s trade
   statistics are inadequate, while plenty of technical
   assistance from the World Bank Group, the
   WTO, the International Trade Center (ITC) and
   the UN Statistics Division (UNSD) is on hand
   to help build up the necessary know-how. In the
   interim, the MoC could start working with the
   Ministry of Finance, in particular with Customs,
   to put in place a reliable trade-statistics tool and
   forward the data to the UNSD for inclusion in the
   UN Comtrade database.
•	 Capacity to analyse data and develop policy
   briefs (action A3). The MoC could consider
   working with other ministries (e.g., Labor,
   Planning and Finance, and Central Statistical
   Organization) and think-tank organizations to
   build up the statistical capabilities needed to
   inform policy through data collection and sharing
                                                               protocols, together with the hiring of competent
                                                               professionals. It could also consider creating and

                                                               can be met.

                                                               Building capacity through training is important

                                                            Myanmar’s tariff structure could be streamlined

                                                            This implies tariff reform, as well as continued efforts

While trade opens new economic
opportunities, it also carries the risk
of increased tensions if its benefits
are not perceived as being shared
fairly, or if proper safeguards are
not in place to protect vulnerable
populations from expropriation,
environmental degradation, or
poor working conditions.

Ensuring that trade development works to reinforce rather than
undermine the peace process will require a number of steps to be
adopted (a positive list) and mistakes to be avoided (a negative
list). Trade expansion and an influx of investment may also
aggravate employment, skills development and wage disparities
between men and women, and women may not be able to access
economic opportunities if their interests as enterprise owners,
traders and workers are not taken into account.




Myanmar has an opportunity to raise its share of the
gains from mining, in particular in jade mining. Jade
is currently exported raw and the current system fails to
provide local communities with a sense of ownership
or any of the gains from Myanmar’s huge scale on the
world jade market. In this regard, economic theory
suggests that a small export tax would raise government
revenue without any offsetting economic loss.1 Such
a tax would generate revenue that could then be used
with the advice of local communities to fund local
development programs, such as vocational training,
poverty reduction and health programs, and other basic
infrastructure in Kachin State (the source of most of
the country’s jade). (action B1). For the mining sector
to support greater development objective in Myanmar,
transparency in data could be improved. This issue
has contributed to the generation of social discontent
and frustration. The Secretariat for Extractive
Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) could work

The need for a quality infrastructure
in Myanmar is gradually rising.

3.
In Myanmar today, most export-oriented
production struggles to comply with important
technical regulations and voluntary standards.

However, the quality requirements are largely
informal and few producers demand the full array of
services offered by a modern quality infrastructure.
Global reintegration will only reinforce this trend,
but change will be slow. Therefore, commercial
demand for quality infrastructure services will be
specific. Likewise, the demand for quality services
that is derived from the regulators needing to enforce
regulations to protect consumer safety and health will
be specific to particular health threats. Even in the best
of cases, the supply will be slow to come forward, in
particular the public supply of quality infrastructure
services, because the capacity of the government
within quality infrastructure is very limited and a rapid
expansion of services cannot be realistically expected.

In order to compete successfully in export markets,
Myanmar might consider adapting its quality
infrastructure to meet the demands of buyers with
their various levels of demands in terms of quality
and SPS certification. This could be achieved with
both a legislative/regulatory modernization effort and
a capacity-building effort in ministries involved in
setting and enforcing standards. However, it will be
important for the process to be driven by the demand
of the market and from regulators seeking to protect
consumer health and safety. Furthermore, it will
also be important for Myanmar to avoid rushing to
build a quality infrastructure disproportionate to the
enforcement capabilities. The regulatory framework
will benefit from being carefully designed to avoid
conflicts of interest and rent-seeking by the ministries

                                                             by the ministries involved.

Located on the ancient Silk Road, Myanmar holds a strategic
position to facilitate trade, which is key to unlocking its
economic potential. Myanmar shares land borders with
China, India, Lao PDR and Thailand, together accounting
for about US$15 trillion, or one-fifth, of global GDP.


As poverty tends to be higher isolated and remote
areas, while industrial agglomeration occurs in
cities, a coherent approach would help to link
infrastructure development with local economic
potential, particularly in mountainous and western
coastal areas, and link these areas to industrial
agglomerations and nearby international markets.
Such an approach would benefit from a coordinated
effort to reduce hard and soft bottlenecks in
logistics infrastructure, which could generate huge
competitive gains for local economic development.

Planned upgrades of the country’s infrastructure
offer opportunities for transformational change.
Both inclusive development and the needs of
international investors point towards the need to build
infrastructure to international standards. Myanmar’s
highway network is around 36,000 km, of which only
two-thirds are paved. Moreover, the overall design
is inadequate for the needs of an efficient market-
based economy. Port capacity in Yangon, a river port
32 km inland currently handling 80 percent of the
country’s trade, is likely to reach saturation soon.
Cargo throughput has grown fourfold over the past
decade and is slated to grow even faster going forward,
                                                          The Yangon-Mandalay road corridor is the country’s
                                                          main logistics backbone and could be prioritized
                                                          for upgrading. According to traffic projections by
                                                          JICA (2014), by 2017 heavy traffic along the AH1
                                                          will surpass the highway’s capacity. This could be
                                                          temporarily alleviated by allowing container trucks
                                                          to use the National Expressway between Yangon and
                                                          Mandalay with certain tariff rates, before the combined
                                                          capacity itself will become insufficient by around
                                                          2028. Therefore, opening the National Expressway
                                                          to container trucks seems inevitable (action E1). In
                                                          order to control road damage from heavy vehicles, axle
                                                          weights could be limited as a first step. Simultaneously,
                                                          the highway would benefit from major upgrading,
                                                          as it will deteriorate rapidly once heavy traffic is
                                                          allowed; such upgrading would be closer to a total

                                                          as today’s low traffic will be easier to divert onto the

Improving port efficiency and

for logistics efficiency in Myanmar
and improvements can be made
in a relatively short timeframe.

Around 80 percent of Myanmar’s trade is handled
by river ports in Yangon and Thilawa situated 32
km in-land. Cargo throughput (measured in TEU)
grew from 155,000 TEU in 2004/05 to more than
617,000 in 2013/14, a fourfold increase.


While extending the berthing area for vessels is one
option, this may not be an optimal strategy given that
berth productivity of Myanmar’s main port in Yangon
is still relatively low due to constraints on vessels
navigating the channel at night. Port congestion due
to the stacking of containers and local traffic in Yangon
city is contributing to a lack of reliability of logistics
services. Developing a deep-sea port with smooth
links to industrial zones and a transport network to
hinterland and border areas is desirable. However,
such a major investment will take time and the
following options may be considered in the interim:

•	 Upgrade/revamp night navigation on the
   Yangon River. In order to allow vessels to call
   at ports at night and help to increase utilization
   of the available capacity at Yangon’s ports, night
   navigation on the Yangon River needs to be
   upgraded. This action should also be accompanied
   by reviewing the tariff structure, including the low
   and flat fee for storing containers in port, to allow
   higher cargo turnaround (action F1).
•	 Facilitate the transport of containers from port
   to Yangon’s industrial areas using river barges
   (action F2). Increased traffic congestion around
   Yangon will increase time and reduce reliability
   for cargo arrivals. Myanmar’s authorities (MPA,
   Customs and the Ministry of Transport and
   Communications) could consider facilitating the
   transport of containers from ports to industrial
   areas around Yangon by using river barges as an
   alternative. Thilawa Port has this option already
   but in order to make it cost effective handling will
   have to be minimized and customs procedures

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




Having an enabling regulatory environment would
help Customs and other trade-related departments
to align their procedures with international
standard.To date Myanmar has been amending the
1878 Sea Customs Act to accommodate modernization
of customs and trade facilitation practices. Myanmar
may want to consider reviewing existing Customs and
other trade-related legislations and assist with writing a
new National Customs Code (action F7).

Making it easier to issue certificates of origin. One
of the key aspects for Myanmar’s exporters in utilizing
preferential tariffs in ASEAN is to use Form-D to
establish “origins of the product” according the rules
of origin (ROO). Currently, Myanmar is the ASEAN
member that least utilizes Form-D, so it may be
important to review current practices and encourage
automation in the issuance of certificates of origin
(action F8).

Finally, although sanctions have been largely lifted,
access to trade finance remains a key issue for
Myanmar’s traders. Many players in Myanmar have
little awareness of the potential benefits of trade-finance
instruments, and a communication and training effort
would help to raise awareness among business players
and in the banking sector (action F9). Domestic banks
have little capacity to process or provide trade finance
instruments, such as receivable financing or letters of
credit. They could be encouraged to make trade finance
available through the adoption of an appropriate legal
framework, technical assistance, and guarantee for
risk and liquidity. Finally, capacity-building could be
facilitated for more banks to open access to receivable
financing for Myanmar’s exporters.
