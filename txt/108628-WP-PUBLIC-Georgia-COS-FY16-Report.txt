I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Georgia perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Georgia
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Georgia
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From February to April 2016, 308 stakeholders of the WBG in Georgia were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/
contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral/
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/
private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 166 stakeholders participated in
the survey (54% response rate).

Respondents received and returned the questionnaires via courier or email. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Georgia; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Georgia; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 59%, N=162). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 93).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
         For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the Office of the
          President/Prime Minister were combined with respondents from the office of a
          minister; PMUs/consultants/contractors on WBG supported projects were combined
          with employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies;
          respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from
          private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs/community based organizations
          and trade unions were combined in the “CSO” category; and the few respondents
          from independent government institutions and the judiciary branch were included in
          the “Other” category. There were no respondents from private foundations, youth
          groups, and faith-based groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’13 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’16 = 7.0; weighted mean in FY’13 = 7.1)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Georgia, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Georgia, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Georgia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty five specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Georgia. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at law and justice; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Georgia, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework.

the following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Georgia? (Choose no more than TWO)

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year17
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 146  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 156

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
