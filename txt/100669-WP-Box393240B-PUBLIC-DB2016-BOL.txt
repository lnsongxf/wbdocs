THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 10,847,664

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 155*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        Request and obtain cadastre certificate

        To request the cadastre certificate, a form must be picked up at
        the Municipality (where stamps must be purchased) for a fee of
        BOB 70.00. The form must be completed by an architect
        recognized by the Municipality (the architect is assumed to be a
        BuildCo employee). Typically, such an architect would charge
        about BOB 200.00 to BOB 500.00. Finally, a topographic plot plan
        must be acquired and attached to the form. Such a plan costs
   1    about BOB 1,620.00.                                                       60 days              BOB 1,690

        Thus, the fees to be paid at the Municipality amount to BOB
        1,620.00 + BOB 70.00 = BOB 1,690.00.

      updated, comprehensive maps of some zones (particularly
      industrial zones). The current maps date back to 1986. This
      document defines the construction impact on adjacent zones.

      Due to the backlog of requests created by newly hired

      The actual cost is based on a table of fees determined by the
      Architects Association. Given the characteristics of the
      warehouse, the following cost formula applies: A * B * C = R,
      where
      A = Area of the terrain (expressed in square meters).
4     B = USD 2.76 (may vary, depending on the actual area of the          30 days      BOB 1,522

      BOB).

      Request construction permit

      To request a construction permit, BuildCo must submit the
      following documentation:
      • Written letter to the Municipality
      • Single registration form (formulario único de administración
      predial) (downloadable on the Municipality's website)
      • Cadastre certificate (Procedure 1)
      • Property title (copy)
      • Royal folio (Procedure 2)
      • Receipt of last five property tax payments
      • Identification card (copy)
      • Plans (original and copy)                                           1 day        no charge

      The municipality reviews the documents and enters the
      application data into the electronic system SITR@M. After 5
      business days, the architect in charge returns to the Municipality
      to arrange a date for the on-site inspection (preferably
      scheduled more than 2 business days later). In case of objections
      or observations, all documents are returned to the architect, and
      the rejection is documented on the single form (FUAP). After the
      inspection, the Municipality informs BuildCo of the fee assessed
      and fills out the single municipal form (formulario unico
      municipal). After the inspection, GENISIS (the computerized
      system) calculates the overall fees and produces the single
      municipal form (formulario unico municipal).

        The customer has to ensure that the internal wiring installations are in
        compliance with the relevant standards established by the Norma
        Boliviana 777 (“Diseño y construcción de las instalaciones eléctricas de
        interiores en baja tensión”) for low voltage internal wiring installations.
        To that end, the electrical engineer who is in charge of the internal
        installations has to submit the installations plans and an estimate of the

      * Receive external inspection by Delapaz

      DELAPAZ inspects the premises to establish the relevant connection
      point and to prepare a technical report on the material needed for the
      new connection. It is preferable that a representative of the customer is
      present at the time of the inspection. DELAPAZ will give technical
      instructions on the works that need to be carried out in order to ensure
      that the internal installations comply with the Norma Boliviana NB 777        7 calendar days        USD 0

      and the internal service regulations of DELAPAZ. If everything is in order
      the customer will receive right away the necessary specification for the
      materials that need to be bought and installed for the external
      connection.

      Agency: Delapaz S.A.



      Purchase material for connection

      The customer purchases the materials needed for the connection works
      in the local market (in case of electricity connections for residential and
4     apartment buildings, materials would be provided by the utility).             11 calendar days     USD 14,000

      Agency: Local business



      * Obtain excavation permit for laying underground cable

      The customer has to obtain an excavation permit from the Municipality
      for the opening of the road required to lay the underground cables. The
      permit is free of charge and can usually be obtained within 2 working         2 calendar days        BOB 0

        contract

        The customer submits the official application in writing, indicating that
        the preparatory works have been concluded. DELAPAZ will issue an
        application in the system. The client has to include in the application the
        future consumption profile, the peak demand (in kW) for the purpose of
        the billing. He also has to attach an identification document for the
        person signing the supply contract, a copy of his power of attorney for       2 calendar days     USD 21.11

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                              would continue until the assets used as collateral are sold and the debt is repaid.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
