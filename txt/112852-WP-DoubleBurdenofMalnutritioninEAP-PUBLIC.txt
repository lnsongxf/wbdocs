Abstract: Global trends indicate that overlapping burdens of undernutrition and
overnutrition—the double burden of malnutrition (DBM)—are the new normal (IFPRI
2014); indeed, most East Asia and Pacific (EAP) countries now have a DBM problem.
This report explores the nature of nutrition problems affecting EAP countries to
understand the sectoral and system-wide actions necessary for a coordinated approach
to improving nutrition.
The report (i) synthesizes evidence related to the burden of malnutrition in EAP, (ii)
identifies the rationale for a multisectoral approach to DBM practitioners working across
sectors in EAP, and (iii) provides an overview of the types of actions and interventions
needed to address the DBM in a coordinated fashion across the life course.
Actions across health and nonhealth sectors—ranging from implementation of national-
level policy measures and complemented by interventions at the community and
individual levels to support behavior change—are needed to prevent escalation of
overweight and obesity.
Among sectoral priority actions, the health sector plays an important role in monitoring
health and nutrition outcomes, preventing and treating infectious and noncommunicable
diseases associated with malnutrition, and providing interventions that affect individuals’
nutrient intakes. Similarly, nonhealth sectors have expertise and resources to deliver
interventions related to the underlying causes of malnutrition.
Further, systems-strengthening efforts are needed to support an environment that
addresses the DBM across the life course, including increasing DBM-sensitivity of policy
frameworks; leadership, coordination, and accountability; workforce capacity; and
knowledge and evidence.


                                              iv
Reducing the DBM is fundamental to sustainable development in EAP. EAP countries
must shift from dichotomized policies addressing either undernutrition or overnutrition
and develop coherent frameworks to address malnutrition in all forms for all life stages.
Integrated preventive and curative interventions for undernutrition and overnutrition—
implemented across the life course by multiple sectors—can forestall massive economic
and human development consequences for future generations.

During this last decade, there has been widespread agreement about the importance of
employing multisectoral approaches to improve nutrition outcomes. Global trends indicate that
overlapping burdens of undernutrition and overnutrition—often referred to as the double burden of
malnutrition (DBM)—are the new normal (IFPRI 2014); this pattern has been observed in the East Asia
and Pacific (EAP) region. However, documented experience of how multisector programs are
implemented is still quite rare, and the literature that does exist focuses almost exclusively on the
reduction of maternal and child undernutrition (MCU). The challenges for EAP to apply multisectoral
approaches to tackle malnutrition in all of its forms are therefore quite considerable. Fortunately, a
number of opportunities can and should be harnessed to minimize complexity of addressing the DBM at
various levels across multiple sectors.
This report explores the nature of the nutrition problems affecting EAP countries to understand
the sectoral and system-wide actions necessary for a coordinated approach to improving
nutrition. While nutritionists have a clear understanding of the need to take a multisectoral approach to
tackling nutrition problems, this perspective may not be so clear to others, whether they work in the
health sector, or in education, water and sanitation, agriculture, social protection, or any number of other
sectors. However, these sectors have expertise and resources that can help solve nutrition problems,
and they can, in turn, benefit from healthier, well-nourished populations. The report (i) synthesizes the
evidence related to the burden of malnutrition in the EAP, (ii) identifies the rationale for a multisectoral
approach to DBM practitioners working across sectors in the EAP region, and (iii) provides an overview of
the types of actions and interventions needed to address the DBM in a coordinated fashion across the life
course
In the EAP, overnutrition is rising faster than undernutrition is decreasing. The region’s strong
economic growth contributed to reductions in undernutrition in the 1990s, though the rate of reduction
waned after the turn of the 21st century. In the absence of effective, large-scale platforms to address the
immediate and underlying determinants of undernutrition, young child stunting (a form of chronic
undernutrition) and low birthweight persist: Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Vietnam are among
the 34 countries that account for 90 percent of the global burden of stunting (Black et al. 2013). Smaller
EAP countries have under-five stunting prevalence rates that are among the highest in the world,
including Cambodia (41 percent), Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) (44 percent), Papua
New Guinea (50 percent), and Timor-Leste (58 percent) (UNICEF 2015). On the other hand, overweight
and obesity are on the rise. China and Indonesia are among the 10 countries that make up over 50
percent of the global burden of obesity (Ng et al. 2014). Indonesia, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, and
Thailand have child obesity prevalence similar to many Eastern European countries (UNICEF 2015). The
Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) have adult obesity rates among the highest in the world
(Ng et al. 2014). Indeed, most EAP countries now have a DBM problem.
The causes of the DBM are multiple and stretch across the life course, with early undernutrition
causing increased risk of overnutrition later in the life course. Inadequate dietary intake and
infectious diseases among mothers and young children are the immediate causes of child stunting.
Across the EAP region, appropriate maternal, infant, and young child feeding remains an issue, and
improvements in this area—particularly as related to dietary diversity and nutrient quality—have strong
potential to reduce the burden of stunting. Underlying factors contributing to MCU in EAP include
inadequate caring practices and poor status of women, low quality and accessibility of health care


                                                     1
services, food insecurity and low food access, and unhygienic household environments. Food security
has improved across the region in the past decade and—aside from certain countries and
subpopulations—is generally believed to be less of a contributor to undernutrition in EAP than in Africa.
Improvements in health care services (especially antenatal care, immunization, and vitamin A
supplementation) in the region have helped reduce child mortality, yet disparities in access to health care
among rural and poor populations are common and particularly acute in the Philippines, Cambodia, and
Lao PDR (Acuin et al. 2011). Poor household hygiene across EAP countries continues to cause a high
burden of infectious diseases and impaired nutrient absorption. Although access to safe drinking water
exceeds access to improved sanitation in most countries, where improved facilities do exist, poor hygiene
and handwashing practices can still undermine child growth due to tropical enteropathy (decreased
nutrient absorption from repeated exposure to fecal pathogens). The majority of PICT populations use
inadequate sanitation facilities with no improvement in the last decade (UNICEF and WHO 2015). Even
in urban areas of EAP where the majority use improved sanitation facilities, less than 6 percent of the
wastewater is properly treated and thus contaminates the urban environment by polluting ground water
and rivers (World Bank and AUSAID 2013). Women’s empowerment has progressed faster in EAP than
in South Asia, yet maternal factors and gender empowerment remain an underlying cause of low
birthweight and stunting.
Though early life undernutrition contributes to increased risk of later life obesity, this factor alone
is insufficient to explain the rapid rise in overweight/obesity in the region. The “thrifty phenotype”
hypothesis posits that constrained fetal growth is associated with metabolic adaptation in preparation for
an adverse environment outside the womb (Gluckman et al. 2005). During the first three months of
pregnancy fetal growth is mostly by cell division; if growth is constrained, the cell nuclei are programmed
for a “scarce” environment after birth. Low birthweight is associated with higher risk of central obesity in
adults (Yang and Huffman 2013), and the process of young child stunting increases the susceptibility to
nutrition-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (Darnton-Hill et al. 2004). However, recent analysis
indicates that the prevalence of intra-person and intra-household DBM across eight Latin American
countries is lower than or equal to expected values, given the historically high prevalence of child
undernutrition (Rivera et al. 2014). These findings support the argument that metabolic adaptation should
be considered as one among many of the root causes of obesity. As summarized in the UK government’s
Foresight Obesity System Map, there may be as many as 100 variables that directly or indirectly affect
energy balance and obesity outcomes (Butland et al. 2007). These variables can be grouped into four
cross-cutting themes, namely: the biological/health environment, the economic/food environment, the
sociocultural environment, and the physical/built environment. Changes in metabolic regulation,
increased consumption of added sugar and highly processed foods, increased total caloric consumption,
decreased physical activity, and sociocultural norms are likely important contributors to the rise in
overnutrition in the EAP.
The consequences of the DBM will be catastrophic in EAP countries unless concerted action is
taken soon. It has been estimated that gross national product (GNP) losses for Asia due to low adult
height, driven by infant stunting, are 11 percent, year on year (Horton and Steckel 2013). Simultaneously,
the global economic impact of obesity has been estimated at roughly $2.0 trillion 1, or 2.8 percent of
global gross domestic product (GDP) (Dobbs et al. 2014). With urbanization and rising incomes, the

problem of diet and nutrition–related NCDs is escalating. Rapidly rising rates of diabetes, high blood
pressure, and high cholesterol that accompany overweight and obesity are now posing an enormous
threat to the economies of the PICTs and will do the same in East and Southeast Asian countries.
Tackling the problem is an urgent must, and will require that both preventive and curative measures be
taken across the life course by multiple sectors.
The first priority in tackling the DBM should be to ensure optimal young child growth from
conception to two years of age through the delivery of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive
actions to address the multiple determinants of MCU. Reducing MCU requires concerted efforts from
the health, education, agriculture, industry, social protection, and water and sanitation sectors; their
priority actions—while well-documented—deserve reiteration. The health sector can provide a package of
appropriately targeted micronutrient supplementation and maternal, infant, and young child feeding
counseling through quality antenatal, postnatal, and well child services to reduce low birthweight and
stunting. Furthermore, the health sector must contribute to the prevention and treatment of acute
malnutrition and infectious diseases. The education sector should ensure that adolescent girls remain in
school until 18 years, and should provide nutrition-specific interventions to improve their micronutrient
status, as well as promoting their health and nutrition literacy. The agriculture sector should look to
support women farmers, encouraging the production of nutrient-rich foods for home consumption as well
as for market. The industry and trade sectors can actively cooperate with efforts to improve fortification,
and the finance sector should consider the nutrition consequences of food subsidies. The social
protection sector should look to link cash transfers to poor households and young mothers—especially—
with nutrition, health, and education promotion, as feasible. The public works and urban/rural
development sectors should seek to improve access to clean water and reduce open defecation, thereby
controlling gastrointestinal and diarrheal diseases generally, and among young mothers and infants in
particular. The public information sector can contribute to improved infant and young child nutrition
practices through enforcement of the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the
Code).
Tackling stunting during the first 1,000 days of a child’s life is not sufficient to mitigate the DBM;
multisectoral actions are needed across the life course to prevent overweight and obesity from
escalating in adolescence and adulthood. These necessary actions range from implementing national-
level policy measures—such as taxation, regulation, and subsidization—complemented by interventions
at the community and individual levels to support behavior change. The health sector in EAP countries
needs to do more to deliver primary and secondary preventive services, including providing health
promotion messages and routine screening for overweight and nutrition-related NCD risk factors.
Carefully considered messaging is needed to promote optimum growth (especially linear growth) in
children under two years of age, and to avoid excessive weight gain subsequently. Public health efforts
need to be redoubled, not only to control the marketing of breastmilk substitutes but also to protect older
children from marketing of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages (Lobstein et al. 2015). The
education sector has an important role to play in nurturing the development of children, enabling them to
graduate from school with adequate life skills and appropriate nutrition knowledge and habits that help
them avoid risks of overweight/obesity and—consequently—NCDs in adulthood. The agriculture sector
can encourage increased local production focusing on nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, and other crops
and help to better understand the nutrition implications of staple food transformations in value chains.
The industry and trade sectors can support voluntary or mandatory food composition targets and portion
sizes for packaged and processed foods. The social protection sector can work with nutrition specialists
to understand the heterogeneity of nutrient gaps among target populations and design benefit packages



                                                    3
accordingly. The public works and transport sector can employ policies and design strategies that
increase access to activity-promoting environments. The public information sector can regulate and
enforce food labeling standards and the marketing of unhealthy foods to children. Finally, finance
ministries can explore opportunities to levy taxes on unhealthy foods and beverages and review the
effects of any food system subsidies on the DBM. Ultimately, these many sectors are needed to create
community environments in EAP that support healthy decisions as the default.
In considering these sectoral actions, a number of important themes emerge. The health sector has
an important role to play in monitoring health and nutrition outcomes, preventing and treating the
infectious and non-communicable diseases associated with malnutrition, and providing interventions that
can affect individuals’ nutrient intakes. However, the non-health sectors have an important role to play in
delivering interventions related to the underlying and basic causes of malnutrition. As the scope of
interventions broadens, a number of considerations can enhance the ability of nutrition-sensitive
programs to achieve impact on nutrition outcomes, including improved targeting; use of conditions to
improve participation; addition of strong nutrition goals, actions, and indicators; and prioritization of
women’s health, social status, access to resources and empowerment, and time allocation (Ruel et al.
2013). It also becomes clear that nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions aimed at
individuals and households are essential, but that there are policy levers that non-health sectors can
utilize to contribute to improved nutrition without directly intervening at the individual level.
In addition to these sectoral actions, systems-strengthening efforts are needed to support an enabling
environment to address the DBM across all stages of the life course. These include increasing DBM-
sensitivity of policy frameworks; leadership, coordination, and accountability; workforce capacity; and
knowledge and evidence. Together these can help to improve governance of efforts to tackle the double
burden of malnutrition, as shown in figure 0.1, which combines the sectoral actions and systems-
strengthening efforts needed to build a multisectoral response to the DBM in East Asia and the Pacific
region.
Coordinated policy frameworks are a demonstration of high-level political commitment and an
essential first step in addressing the DBM. Seven EAP countries have signed on to the Scaling Up
Nutrition (SUN) movement (Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines
and Vietnam), yet all countries seeking to develop multisectoral nutrition approaches should consider
adopting the SUN framework. Whether a part of SUN or not, many EAP countries have developed
national nutrition policies and plans of action that focus on MCU. A recent independent evaluation
suggested that the SUN movement should recognize that most low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs) have a DBM problem and begin to adapt accordingly from their exclusive focus on MCU (Mokoro
2015). In their next iterations, national nutrition policies must be revised to guide a response to
malnutrition that addresses all burdens of malnutrition, and encourages greater policy coherence on
nutrition across national poverty reduction; economic development; food security; water, sanitation, and
hygiene (WASH); and agricultural and rural development policies.
Coordination mechanisms are needed to guide the implementation of priority interventions and
can and should vary depending on the degree of national decentralization. A high-level coordinating
body, at the supra-ministerial level, is recommended for centralized countries to effectively implement
multisectoral programs (SUN 2010). Experience in developing such centralized approaches is already
available through the SUN movement, and many EAP countries are already collaborating in such efforts
to tackle young child stunting (MCU). In countries with more decentralized systems of government,
coordination mechanisms will be most effective at the district or community level, while national bodies

(for example, a nutrition institute) can provide strong technical and policy support. Particularly in
decentralized settings, strong civil society participation and advocacy can drive greater action and
accountability for improving nutrition.
Most EAP countries do not yet have the knowledge and evidence needed to effectively target
interventions and monitor progress toward reducing the DBM. The strong evidence demonstrating
the effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions—which served to mobilize the international community
to address undernutrition—does not yet exist for the majority of nutrition-sensitive interventions for MCU
delivered outside the health sector. Furthermore, no country in the world has successfully reduced
overweight/obesity, and there is a clear need to evaluate the impact of obesity interventions to strengthen
decision making. On the other hand, the double burden of malnutrition adds complexity to the work of
policy makers and program managers that cannot be addressed without adequate monitoring and
evaluation data. Responding to the DBM requires a better understanding of the nutritional gaps of more
localized populations. As practitioners begin to identify the existence of the DBM in the EAP region,
representative data (ideally at the district level) can help characterize the burdens of malnutrition and
their distribution at the national, household, and individual levels. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
systems should incorporate indicators of undernutrition and overnutrition outcomes (weight, height, waist
circumference, biomarkers of micronutrient status) and exposures (food consumption, health behaviors)
at the individual level. They should also be able to be linked to relevant indicators from concerned
nonhealth sectors to strengthen cross-sectoral integration. Furthermore, countries need to monitor
policies and programs that promote a healthy food environment. These M&E data will allow decision
makers to incorporate country-specific distributions of malnutrition into the design of nutrition
interventions and help advocate for increased national accountability.
In developing a multisectoral approach to the DBM in the EAP, efforts are needed to strengthen
human resource capacity to implement nutrition interventions for both under- and overnutrition;
sensitize nonhealth staff to the importance of nutrition; and plan for, design, and implement
initiatives at the local level. As financing to scale up nutrition interventions is made available, there is
increased need to expand human resources capacity to design, deliver, and manage large-scale nutrition
programs (Horton et al. 2010). The nutrition training of doctors, nurses, and midwives (as well as
dietitians in some countries), who make up the great majority of workers delivering nutrition interventions
globally, is characteristically poor. Country case studies in Asia concluded the nutritional knowledge of
health workers is outdated, their nutrition competencies limited to clinical and curative activities, and—for
nurses and midwives especially—their job descriptions do not include nutrition responsibilities (Shrimpton
et al. 2013). Very often, health staff are also inequitably distributed, and the dedicated workforce is not
available (in the health system especially) with the required competencies or time to provide the outreach
needed to facilitate community-based nutrition services. Furthermore, health professionals globally are ill-
equipped to treat obesity and associated chronic diseases. In many LMICs, education has focused on the
prevention of undernutrition, and there is need to strengthen the knowledge of health professionals
regarding the prevention and treatment of obesity (Dietz et al. 2015). In addition to their technical skills,
health and nutrition professionals require training in behavior change communication and motivational
interviewing to be able to effectively counsel individuals on the prevention of undernutrition and
overnutrition. Nutrition technical assistance is required to sensitize non-health staff to nutrition and can be
combined with careful consideration of the specific staff roles and responsibilities needed to maximize
supply-side capacity to deliver nutrition-sensitive interventions (Levinson and Balarajan 2013). Given the
many constraints to hiring and training government workers, the NGO community has an enormously
important role in taking proven nutrition actions to scale.

In taking on the DBM, engagement with the private sector cannot be avoided. Significant reductions
in undernutrition have been achieved with minimal interaction with the private sector. However, unlike
with undernutrition, priority interventions for improving diet and preventing obesity are not found in the
health sector. Food production, processing, labeling, marketing, and retailing are all key aspects of the
food environment dominated by the private sector. Actions in these areas, so urgently needed to mitigate
overnutrition, will not be possible without innovation in the approach to the private sector. Lessons
learned from tobacco regulation and early experiences with food industry regulation make it apparent that
efforts to regulate industry will not go unchallenged. In this light, the need for stronger evidence related to
causes and impacts of overnutrition becomes central. Working with the private sector can be a
particularly polarizing issue for many, yet it is clear that progress on the DBM will not go far without
serious discussion of the incentives, partnerships, regulations, and other mechanisms that can be
brought to the table to improve the nutritional value of available diets.
There are no proven country examples of coordinated multisectoral approaches to address the
DBM; multisectoral efforts to reduce overweight and obesity are still in their infancy. Latin
American countries have devoted considerably more time and attention to the nutrition transition and to
DBM than have countries of the EAP; however, recent experience indicates that public health nutritionists
in Latin America continue to struggle to coordinate existing MCU interventions with policies and programs
to curb overweight/obesity. Early experience from France suggests that issues of coordination are the
same when institutionalizing a multisectoral approach to overweight/obesity as the ones for MCU, and
that the most important level of coordination is that of local government. For many EAP countries,
external support will be necessary to build the local capacity to construct plans to tackle the problem.
Where undernutrition still persists, the first priority is tackling MCU during the critical 1,000-day period
from conception to two years of age. However, local plans should consider the importance of both types
of malnutrition within their own communities.
Reducing the DBM is fundamental to sustainable development in EAP. The “1,000 Days” slogan has
been critical in mobilizing civil society, governments, and funders to commit to reducing child stunting and
break the intergenerational cycle of undernutrition in the region. With the growing double burden of
malnutrition in the region, this call to action can be bolstered by a policy dialogue in which the first 1,000
days serves as a platform for comprehensive nutrition intervention, rather than the sole point of
intervention. Particularly in EAP, there is a need to shift from dichotomized policies addressing either
undernutrition or overnutrition and to develop coherent frameworks that promote healthy nutrition,
addressing malnutrition in all forms for all life stages. Delivering nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific
interventions to individuals will not be sufficient to mitigate the DBM; critical assessment and intervention
is needed to address the role that food and living environments play in shaping choices and nutritional
status. These actions on malnutrition are imperative; the consequences of this DBM will be catastrophic
in EAP countries unless concerted action is taken soon. Luckily, mitigating the problem is an urgent but
achievable task. Investing in the prevention of overnutrition and undernutrition is affordable and offers
high rates of return. Integrated preventive and curative interventions for undernutrition and overnutrition—
implemented across the life course by multiple sectors—can forestall massive economic and human
development consequences for future generations.

The purpose of this report is threefold: (i) to define the double burden of malnutrition
(DBM) in East Asia and Pacific region; (ii) to highlight the rationale for taking a
multisectoral approach to tackling the DBM; and (iii) to delineate what each sector can
contribute to the response. While nutritionists may understand why other sectors are needed
to help improve nutrition, this may not be so clear to those who work outside the health sector,
be it in education, water and sanitation, agriculture or social protection, for example. Due to the
multiple causality of malnutrition—both undernutrition and overnutrition—all of these sectors are
needed to solve nutrition problems. This report aims to explore the nature of the nutrition
problems affecting the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region countries as well as the most
effective response to those problems.
Unlike previous studies, this report seeks to operationalize the interface where different
sectors can work together to solve DBM problems in the EAP region. The existence of the
DBM problem in the region was first described by Gillespie and Haddad (2001), indicating the
costs as well as the evidence for solutions, which for overnutrition was still very limited. A
global-level review of the evidence for the causes, the consequences, and solutions of the DBM
(Shrimpton and Rokx 2012) was followed by an assessment of the DBM in Indonesia with a
view to better understanding the nature of the problem and the solutions needed in an Asian
context (Shrimpton and Rokx 2013). Most recently an analysis of DBM trends and their
consequences in nine countries in the region reviewed the drivers of the problem and the broad
policies needed to manage it (Haddad et al. 2014). An Action Plan to reduce the DBM in the
Western Pacific region (2015–2020) has now been developed by the Regional Office of WHO in
consultation with member states (WHO 2014a), and UNICEF has incorporated
overweight/obesity into its Approach to Nutrition Programming in the East Asia and Pacific
Region (2014–2025).
There is growing recognition within the World Bank that the goals of ending extreme
poverty and promoting shared prosperity in EAP cannot be achieved without a concerted
response to the DBM. Tackling malnutrition across the heterogeneous group of EAP countries
will require action beyond the health sector alone, and the World Bank has committed to taking
a multisectoral approach in its response (see box 1.1). This report aims to provide World Bank
staff working across EAP countries, as well as nutrition policy makers and planners in EAP
countries, ideas not only on what diverse sectors can do to enhance nutrition, but how these
efforts can become synergistic from the national to the local level.

  II. THE MAGNITUDE AND TRAJECTORY OF THE DOUBLE BURDEN
                      OF MALNUTRITION

The term “malnutrition” includes both undernutrition and overnutrition. Undernutrition is
commonly measured as inadequate weight-for-height (wasting), as well as inadequate
height-for-age (stunting), and as micronutrient deficiencies such as iron deficiency
anemia. At a population level, overnutrition is often measured as excessive weight-for-height
(overweight and obesity), though other measures of “fatness” do exist. Wasting is a prominent
risk factor for child mortality, yet child stunting is the type of undernutrition of most concern for



                                                  8
policy makers; height growth not achieved during the first 1,000 days from conception to two
years is largely irrecoverable, has measureable negative consequences across the life course
(Victora et al. 2010), and is highly predictive of economic outcomes (Horton and Hoddinot
2014). These two forms of malnutrition, that is, overnutrition and undernutrition, are increasingly
occurring together as a double burden of malnutrition (DBM), often in the same household and
even in the same individual (Shrimpton and Rokx 2012). The first Global Nutrition Report (IFPRI
2014) described the coexistence of different forms of malnutrition as the “new normal,” with
twenty-four countries having prevalence of all three forms of malnutrition (under-five stunting,
anemia among women of reproductive age, and adult overweight) of more than 20 percent.

 Box 1.1 World Bank East Asia and Pacific (EAP) Region: Multisectoral Strategy and Action Plan for the
 Double Burden of Malnutrition (2015–2020)
 To better respond to the diverse and rapidly evolving nutrition challenges facing EAP countries, the World Bank
 initiated a comprehensive regional effort to address the double burden of malnutrition. With generous support
 from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the World Bank team developed the East
 Asia and Pacific (EAP) Region: Multisectoral Engagement Strategy and Action Plan for the Double Burden of
 Malnutrition (2015–2020) with the objective of expanding “the scale, scope, and impact of the World Bank
 Group’s (WBG’s) regional work program on the double burden of malnutrition, through building commitment to
 and capacity for multisectoral interventions involving World Bank Group staff and external clients in EAP.”

 The strategy is built around the achievement of five key results, namely: (1) improved awareness and
 commitment of WBG staff and management to address malnutrition; (2) improved coordination of nutrition
 activities and analyses in EAP; (3) increased WBG funding and management of analytical work to identify and fill
 nutrition-related knowledge gaps; (4) increased lending for operations aimed at improving nutrition; and (5)
 successful WBG adoption of innovative, multisectoral approaches to address DBM.

Seventy-eight countries have two forms of malnutrition, and just eighteen countries have only
one form. The coexistence of overweight/obesity and iron deficiency in the same individual has
been shown in children (Pinhas-Hamel et al. 2003), in women in the United States (Neymotin
and Sen 2011), as well as in women in Vietnam (Laillou et al. 2014), but not consistently in
women in all developing countries (Aderibigbe et al. 2014).


Both overnutrition and undernutrition are of public health significance in many EAP
countries (table 1.1). In 2010, nearly one-quarter of all births in Southeast Asia and over one-
fifth of all births in Melanesia were small for gestational age, that is, smaller than normal for the
duration of the pregnancy (Black et al. 2013). In EAP, stunting has generally declined over the
past 30 years. However, time-series analysis demonstrates that the most rapid improvements in
stunting were observed in the 1980s and 1990s. Few EAP countries with sufficient data have
made marked improvements since 1996 (figure 1.1). Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and
Vietnam remain among the 34 countries that account for 90 percent of the global burden of
stunting. Smaller EAP countries have under-five stunting prevalence among the highest in the
world, for example: Lao PDR (44 percent), Papua New Guinea (50 percent), and Timor-Leste
(50 percent) (UNICEF, WHO, World Bank 2016). Though EAP countries with higher GDP tend
to have lower stunting prevalence, in most countries increasing national prosperity alone has
not translated into significant reductions in undernutrition prevalence (figure 1.2).
Equity is a key consideration in the reduction of undernutrition. Globally, stunting
prevalence in the poorest wealth quintile is nearly two and a half times that of individuals in the



                                                    9
highest (Black et al. 2013), a similar pattern to that of EAP countries. In the Philippines, child
stunting is between three to four times higher in the poorest households than in the richest
(FNRI 2008). Between 2007 and 2010 in Indonesia, stunting declined by 6 percent in the
highest wealth quintile but increased by 2 percent in the poorest wealth quintile (DEPKES
2010), yet, stunting still affected over one-fifth of the wealthiest children. National-level
estimates often mask significant disparities in progress on nutrition outcomes across
socioeconomic groups.

Micronutrient deficiencies are common across the EAP region. Traditionally, deficiencies of
vitamin A, iron, zinc, and iodine have been of greatest public health concern due to strong
associations with child mortality, mental impairment, poor health, and decreased productivity. In
China, Thailand, and many Pacific Island Countries (PICs)—where stunting and underweight
have receded—micronutrient deficiencies remain a lingering nutritional concern. Iron deficiency
is recognized as the leading cause of anemia. Nationally representative, pooled data indicate
that roughly one-quarter of pregnant and nonpregnant women in East and Southeast Asia 2 were
anemic; prevalence was higher in Papua New Guinea and the PICs, combined, where 43
percent of pregnant women and 28 percent of nonpregnant women were anemic (Stevens et al.
2013).
In many EAP countries, current estimates of adult, adolescent, and child
overweight/obesity exceed global averages. Among children and adolescents (less than 20
years of age) the global prevalence of overweight and obesity combined in 2013 was 24 percent
for boys and 23 percent for girls. In adults (over age 20), 37 percent of men and 38 percent
women were overweight and obese globally, with higher rates in developed than in developing
countries in all age groups. However, China and Indonesia are among the 10 countries that
account for over 50 percent of the global burden of obesity; overweight affects more than half of
adult women in a number of Pacific Island nations (88.9 percent in Samoa, 72.9 percent in Fiji,
and 50.3 percent in Papua New Guinea) (Ng et al. 2014). Even among children under-five,
overweight and obesity rates in Indonesia (12 percent), Mongolia (11 percent), Papua New

Guinea (14 percent), Thailand (11 percent), and Timor-Leste (6 percent) are comparable to or
exceed that of the United States (6 percent) (UNICEF 2015).
Globally, overnutrition is increasing faster than undernutrition is decreasing in LMICs,
and most EAP countries have a DBM problem. Between 1980 and 2013 the worldwide
prevalence of overweight and obesity combined rose by 27.5 percent in adults and 47.5 percent
in children and adolescents (Ng et al. 2014). The increase in prevalence is accelerating, with
over half of the rise occurring during the eight-year period from 2000 and 2008. Over the last
three decades the increase in prevalence of overweight and obesity in LMICs was greater than
in higher-income countries (HICs) (Finnucane et al. 2011). Obesity rates seem to have leveled
off in most HICs in the last decade (Rokholm et al. 2010), although the reasons for this are not
fully understood (Popkin et al. 2012). The increases in obesity prevalence are unlikely to
attenuate in developing countries (Ng et al. 2014). Between 1990 and 2011, young child
stunting decreased globally by 35 percent, while young child overweight increased by 54
percent (UNICEF, WHO, and World Bank 2012). Increasing child overweight has been noted in
most world regions, yet in EAP, the estimated regional prevalence of young child overweight
(5.5 percent) remained largely unchanged between 1990 and 2011. During the same period,
prevalence of overweight and obesity in women increased significantly, reaching more than 70
percent in Oceania and 25 percent in Asia 3 (Black et al. 2013). Table 1.2 categorizes a number
of EAP countries with overlapping burdens of malnutrition that exceed levels of public health
significance.

   III. CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE DOUBLE BURDEN OF
                        MALNUTRITION

                                        1. CAUSES OF THE DBM

The causes of undernutrition and overnutrition are conceptually distinct and concern
different growth processes. The most common and important type of undernutrition is
maternal and child undernutrition (MCU), which relates to the growth process of the fetus from
conception through two years of age. Overnutrition, though also related to tissue growth, is
regulated by the process of energy balance, and weight can be gained and/or lost. Growth of
the fetus in the first 1,000 days is a very different scenario: successful fetal and infant growth is
an either-or process, with little or no chance of recovery if growth is not achieved. Thus, two
separate conceptual frameworks are applied to assess these causes.
A. Undernutrition
MCU has multiple causes, which can be grouped as food-, health-, and care-related.
These determinants of undernutrition operate at three levels: immediate, underlying, and basic,
as first proposed by UNICEF (1990) for child undernutrition. Figure 1.2 adapts the UNICEF
conceptual framework for child malnutrition for young child stunting and includes the nutritional
status of the mother as well as her fetus and young child. This separation of the maternal and
child aspects of nutritional status is necessary as all too often the maternal dimensions of MCU
are largely ignored in nutrition policies and programs (Shrimpton 2012).
i. Immediate Factors
Immediate-level determinants of MCU include inadequate dietary intake and infectious
disease, and represent nutrient intake and nutrient needs. Across EAP, appropriate
maternal, infant, and young child feeding remains an issue; improvements in this area present
great opportunities for stunting reduction. See annex 1 for recent country-specific figures.

Poor maternal nutrition is an immediate cause of inadequate fetal growth and young
child stunting. Between one-third and one-half of the growth failure accrued by age two occurs
in uterus (Dewey and Huffman 2009). Over half of 22 EAP countries with data had low
birthweight rates of 10 percent or more, which is four times the normal rate. Food taboos,
particularly during pregnancy and immediately post-partum, lead to dietary restriction and are
one important cause of inadequate maternal nutrition in the region (Gillespie et al. 2004). Poor
dietary diversity persists during and beyond the complementary feeding period. A monotonous
diet, low in micronutrient content (for example, white rice, refined cereals, high sugar and high
fat snacks, together with few vegetables, fruits, animal source foods, and fortified foods) is also
common among adults in Southeast Asia (Bloem et al. 2013).
Early and exclusive breastfeeding up to six months is an important factor in promoting
adequate nutritional intake and decreasing susceptibility to infection, and improvements
in breastfeeding practices are needed. Among certain EAP countries, exclusive
breastfeeding among children under six months ranges from 17 percent in Vietnam to 74
percent in Cambodia. Additionally, complementary feeding practices appear to be suboptimal in
many EAP countries. Though complementary foods are more commonly introduced in a timely
fashion, the two countries with data (Indonesia and Cambodia) indicate that the overall
acceptability of children’s diets (a composite indicator of adequate frequency of feeding and
diversity of food groups consumed in children ages six months to two years), are remarkably
low. During the period of rapid growth and development between birth and 24 months of age, a
diverse diet is necessary to achieve adequate intakes of a wide variety of macronutrients and
micronutrients.

ii. Underlying Factors
Underlying factors contributing to MCU in EAP include household food insecurity or low
food access, inadequate care for women and children, low quality and accessibility of
health care services, and unhealthy household environments. In terms of availability, food
security has improved across the region in the past decade. Food balance sheets indicate
growing availability of calories at the population level. The percent undernourished 4 remains
highest in Timor-Leste (38 percent) and Lao PDR (27 percent), but ranges between 8 and 16
percent across other countries in the region (annex 1). Household food insecurity is generally
believed to be less of a contributor to undernutrition in EAP than in Africa. The drastic
reductions in child mortality achieved by Southeast Asia are in part attributable to improvements
to health care services (antenatal care, immunization, vitamin A supplementation) in the region.
However, disparities in access to health care among rural and poor populations are common
and particularly acute in the Philippines, Cambodia, and Lao PDR (Acuin et al. 2011).
Poor household hygiene and sanitation, as well as unsafe drinking water, contribute to
the burden of infectious diseases and are an underlying cause of child stunting.
Systematic reviews have consistently shown that handwashing can result in 30 to 40 percent
reductions in diarrhea in young children (Curtis and Cairncross 2003; Ejemot-Nwadiaro et al.
2012). Systematic reviews of the efficacy of hygiene and sanitation interventions on stunting
show much smaller effects, however (Bhutta et al. 2008; Dangour et al. 2013). This is most
probably because the modeling in these reviews is restricted to diarrhea episodes, and misses
the effect of tropical enteropathy / environmental enteric dysfunction (Lunn et al. 1991;
Humphrey 2009), whereby it is hypothesized that continuous ingestion of fecal bacteria causes
chronic stimulation of the immune and inflammatory systems, and damage to the small
intestine. The consequent malabsorption of nutrients and diversion of energy away from
promoting growth to maintaining the immune response, causes 40 percent of growth faltering in
children < 18 months in the Gambia, for example (Campbell et al. 2003). This helps explain why
observational studies find health benefits (including stunting reduction) from improved water,
occurring only when sanitation has improved, and with incremental improvements in sanitation
associated with less diarrhea and additional increases in weight and height of children (Esrey
1996; Checkley et al. 2008). Access to high-quality sanitation reduced the odds of diarrhea by
13 percent, of stunting by 27 percent, and of mortality by 23 percent (Fink et al. 2011).
Furthermore Spears (2013) has calculated that open defecation may explain up to 54 percent of
international variation in child height, while GDP explains only 29 percent.
Though there is considerable variation across EAP countries, inadequate sanitation and
hygiene persist at remarkably high levels. The East and Southeast Asian MDG regions have
met the MDG target of 88 percent coverage of improved drinking water. However, Papua New
Guinea was one of three countries in the world with less than 50 percent coverage of safe
drinking water. High stunting amid widespread access to improved water is not surprising given
the common practice of open defecation in the region. A 2013 review of 14 EAP countries found
that roughly 100 million people in the region practice open defecation, with country prevalence
ranging from 0 to 72 percent. Though Cambodia has reduced open defecation by nearly 42

percent (UNICEF and WHO 2015), it remained one of three EAP countries (also Indonesia and
China) on the list of the world’s 12 countries with the largest populations using open defecation
(UNICEF 2013). Across MDG regions, Oceania was the only region where coverage of
improved sanitation did not increase (remaining at 35 percent over the period 1990 to 2015).
Progress toward the MDG targets for water and sanitation was largely met without improving
access for the poorest: no EAP countries succeeded in halving the proportion of the poorest
with unimproved water in rural and urban areas; only Thailand achieved this target for sanitation
(UNICEF and WHO 2015).
Gender empowerment in EAP has progressed more rapidly than in South Asia, but a
number of areas remain where the status of women contributes to MCU. Girls’ secondary
school enrollments have converged with boys at the regional level, yet Cambodia, Lao PDR,
and Papua New Guinea have particularly low female-to-male enrollment ratios in secondary
school. Economic disadvantage and other forms of social exclusion, such as ethnic minority
status, exacerbate gender disparities. Furthermore, these gender gaps have closed primarily
among the young as compared to adult populations (World Bank 2012a). Low secondary school
attendance among females is associated with early age at marriage and at onset of
childbearing, as well as with the prevalence of low birthweight and stunting rates seen in EAP
countries (UNSCN 2010). Women have less access to productive resources—including
livestock holdings and agricultural extension—than men. In Timor-Leste, Indonesia, and
Vietnam, among other countries, female-headed households have less land than male-headed
ones. Indonesia, in particular, performs poorly on gender equity in economic activity (Haddad et
al. 2014).
iii. Basic Factors
The basic causes of MCU are generally related to poverty and lack of resources, and
broader political, sociocultural, economic, and environmental factors. Poverty is a key
factor underlying lack of dietary diversity and stunting in EAP. As demonstrated above, lower
socioeconomic status is associated with higher stunting prevalence in a number of EAP
countries. Agriculture is the foundation of income generation among the rural poor who are
particularly susceptible to MCU (Khor 2008). Even in rural areas, many smallholder farmers are
net buyers of food (FAO 2013), and low farm incomes result in fewer resources for food,
particularly non-grain and animal source foods. Though urbanization is associated with reduced
risk of undernutrition in EAP (Bloem et al. 2013), the causes of poverty and food insecurity
among the urban poor have more to do with lack of income-earning opportunities, low skills
development, and high food prices (Khor 2008).
B. Overnutrition
While the direct causes of overweight and obesity are an imbalance of energy intake and
energy expenditure, the root causes of the rising rates of obesity are highly complex.
Ultimately overweight and obesity reflects eating in excess of need, and the major areas for
intervention relate to reducing dietary intake and/or increasing energy expenditure. However,
there is growing recognition that there are complex interactions between society, the food
industry, and government that shape food environments and moderate the relationship between
individual factors and diet choices. These root causes of obesity span evolutionary, biological,
psychological, economic, and institutional factors, as summarized in figure 1.3. This causal map
of obesity was developed by the UK government Foresight research on obesity, which identified
more than 100 variables that directly or indirectly affect energy balance and obesity outcomes


                                               17
(Butland et al. 2007). These many variables can be grouped into four cross-cutting themes,
namely: the biological/health environment, the economic/food environment, the sociocultural
environment, and the physical/built environment.
i. The Biological/Health Environment
The biological/health environment can be thought of as an individual’s starting point,
which includes metabolic and genetic factors and how these interact with external
conditions. Although genetics may explain a large part of the intra-individual variation in
obesity, that is, the “thrifty genotype,” the sudden increase in obesity prevalence in most
countries during the last few decades cannot be accounted for by population genetic changes
(Swinburn et al. 2011). The “thrifty phenotype” hypothesis, on the other hand, posits that
constrained fetal growth is associated with adaptation or “fetal programming” in preparation for
an adverse environment outside the womb (Gluckman et al. 2005). Poor nutrition during
pregnancy can influence the development of the fetus both by changing its genetic make-up as
well as its composition. Epigenetic changes occur during the peri-conceptual period (often
before the mother even knows she is pregnant), causing modifications in gene expression.
Fetal growth is mostly by cell division during this first three months of pregnancy; if growth is
constrained, the cell nuclei are programmed for a “scarce” environment after birth. During the
latter part of pregnancy, growth is more by cellular enlargement; poor maternal nutrition here
changes the composition of the fetus being formed as well as the final birthweight, such that
babies are not only smaller, but have less lean body mass. Low birthweight is associated with
higher risk of central obesity in adults (Yang and Huffman 2013), and the process of young child
stunting increases the proportion of fat in the body as well as the susceptibility to nutrition-
related NCDs such as diabetes and high blood pressure later in the life course (Darnton-Hill et
al. 2004). The “optimal” birthweight—with least risk of dying in childhood as well as developing
diabetes and high blood pressure in adulthood—is around 3.5 kilograms, or roughly one
standard deviation above the mean of a normal population. In consequence, even small
improvements in mean birthweight can have enormous population benefits across the life
course (Shrimpton 2003; WHO 2006). This life course dimension of DBM is of special concern
for the EAP countries, which, despite having developed economically, still have high rates of low
birthweight and young child stunting. Evidence from Latin America indicates that the prevalence
of intra-person and intra-household DBM across eight countries analyzed is lower than or equal
to expected values given the historically high prevalence of child undernutrition (Rivera et al.
2014). These findings suggest that metabolic adaptation should be considered as one among
many of the root causes of obesity.

Diet-induced obesity is associated with a chronic low-grade systemic inflammatory state.
Inflammation, a part of the body’s normal response to an injury or an infection, enables it to
combat invading threats and repair damage. In obese individuals, the immune system is in a
state of continuous low-grade activation as if it is looking to fight an infection or repair some
tissue damage. The visceral fat deposits in the abdomen are involved in producing this
inflammatory response in addition to secreting hormones such as leptin that help regulate
feeding behavior and energy expenditure (Kwon and Pessin 2014). The metabolic abnormalities
of obesity, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, are related to this inflammatory state
(Gregor and Hotamisligil 2011; Canale et al. 2013). The exact causes of the low-grade systemic
inflammation of obesity are uncertain, though some think they are related to changes in gut
bacteria caused by a Western diet, high in fat and refined carbohydrates (Cox et al. 2014;
Nieuwdorp et al. 2014; Kotzampassi, et al. 2014).
ii. The Economic/Food Environment
Economic growth over the last half century has been accompanied by increases in
overweight/obesity. While the global population has increased sixfold since the industrial
revolution began in Europe just over a 100 years ago, per capita income has increased ninefold
(Sachs 2005). Within the EAP region, growth in GDP per capita averaged more than 6 percent
annually during the last 20 years (WDI 2015). Although inequality has increased both globally as
well as in most countries over the last 50 years, the bottom third are still significantly better-off
(Cornia et al. 2003). Obesity rates began to increase in higher-income countries in the 1960s,



                                                 19
associated with an energy balance “flipping point” (Swinburn et al. 2011). As national income
increases, the burden of obesity tends to shift toward lower socioeconomic groups, with this
shift occurring at a lower level of income for women than for men (Monteiro et al. 2004). The
crossover to higher rates of obesity than of underweight among women of low socioeconomic
status groups is found at a GNP per capita of about US$2,500, roughly the midpoint value for
lower-middle-income countries. The widespread availability of cheap, energy-dense foods
makes the food-insecure, urban poor in EAP particularly susceptible to overnutrition (Khor
2008).
Rising GDP has also spurred the growth of urban centers and the expansion of the
middle class in EAP, two trends strongly associated with changing dietary patterns in the
region. In 1950, 18 percent of Asia’s population was urban, compared with 44 percent in 2011
(United Nations 2012). Urban consumers spend a smaller share of their household expenditures
on food, but have greater purchases of higher-value foods, processed foods, and foods
consumed away from home (World Bank 2015). Across the region, the share of dietary energy
from cereals, roots, and tubers has declined over the past 30 years (figure 1.4), as wealthier
consumers increase consumption of animal proteins (meat, fish, milk, eggs), vegetables and
fruits, and added oils and sugars. At the same time, total per capita caloric availability has
increased across the region, with the greatest relative growth in caloric availability of noncereals
(FAOSTAT 2015).

Processed foods have become widely available, and their increased consumption is part
of the problem. Processed foods now account for 80 percent of global food sales (World Bank
2007). Although spending is still low in developing countries (US$143 per capita per year in
lower-middle-income countries and US$63 per capita in low-income countries), it is growing at
28 percent and 13 percent a year, respectively, in those country groups. Growth in retail sales of
packaged foods in the East Asia and Pacific region is second only to Western Europe. Evidence


                                                                 20
indicates that even the lowest-income consumers purchase processed and packaged foods in
supermarkets, but the global food processors have been able to integrate into traditional
markets in both urban and rural areas (FAO 2013). Ultra-processed foods seem to be a
particular problem (Monteiro 2010), as they have a high glycemic index (GI) score of over 70,
which means that blood sugar levels remain high for a long period after the food is eaten.
Examples of high GI foods include instant noodles, doughnuts, white bread, and soda. Low GI
diets can help to reduce body weight and improve blood lipid profiles (Thomas et al. 2007). All
over the world ultra-processed foods are displacing unprocessed foods in the diet; in Brazil, for
example, they contributed approximately a third of dietary energy in 2003 (Monteiro et al. 2011).
Although dietary intake data hardly exist for the PICTs, food balance sheets suggest that
imported foods have been added to the traditional fare rather than substituting for it (Hughes
2003).
Researchers increasingly question gluttony and excess caloric consumption as the sole
cause of overweight and obesity. Global food production has outpaced demand; average per
capita global food consumption increased 20 percent during the last 50 years, a period when
total global population doubled (FAO 2002). The traditional thinking that “eating too much” and
“moving too little” have caused the increases in obesity is coming under increasing scrutiny,
however (Speakman et al. 2011; Taubes 2013; Dhurandhar et al. 2014). “What” is eaten is
increasingly recognized to be as important as “how much” is eaten, as far as gaining weight is
concerned. The lack of consumption of vegetables, fruits, and grains, as well as
overconsumption of processed foods, especially those high in fat and sugar, seem to have a
major role in causing the increases in adult weight in the United States (Mozaffarian et al. 2011).
Many consider that obesity rates in the Pacific Island countries are due to the consumption of
cheap imported meats high in fat and salt, such as turkey tails and mutton flaps, that only began
to be imported in the early 1950s (Cassels 2006; Singer 2014).
There is growing evidence that increased sugar consumption is contributing to the
overweight and obesity problems. Dynamic time-series analysis using data from the United
States as well as 164 other countries suggests that increases in carbohydrates are most
strongly and positively associated with increases in obesity prevalence, even when controlling
for changes in total caloric intake and occupation-related physical activity (Rivera-Crichton and
Tefft 2014). In a 165-country analysis, per capita sugar consumption was found to be strongly
associated with the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, with the strongest association found in Asia
(Weeratunga et al. 2014). Various systemic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies provide evidence that consumption of
free sugars or sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) promotes weight gain in adults and children
(Malik et al. 2006; Te Morenga et al. 2013). There is now sufficient evidence that reducing the
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages will reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity-
related diseases (Hu 2013). The consumption of SSBs among adolescents in most PICTs and
many other EAP countries is high (Snowdon 2014), with 70 percent in Fiji consuming more than
two glasses on the last school day (Wate et al. 2013); similar rates of consumption are seen in
the Cook Islands and Niue, for example (See table 1A.2). The new WHO guideline confirms that
adults and children should maintain a reduced intake of free sugars over the life course and
recommends that intake be reduced to less than 10 percent of total energy intake. The guideline
further suggests as a conditional recommendation that free sugars be reduced to less than 5
percent of total energy intake (WHO 2015b). Translating this recommendation into action at the



                                                21
country level should spur substantial debate among the various stakeholders (Thow and
Hawkes 2014).
iii. The Physical/Built Environment
Physical activity is the major modifiable component of energy expenditure. The amount of
energy people expend on physical activity has undoubtedly decreased during the last few
decades, with changing activity environment including passive means of transport and
mechanization of work processes, for example. Daily energy expenditure was found to be 25
percent lower in urban adults than rural adults in the Cameroon (Assah et al. 2011). Daily
occupation-related energy expenditure decreased by more than 100 calories per day over the
last 50 years in the United States, accounting for a significant portion of the increase in mean
body weight for women and men (Church et al. 2011). Physical inactivity is very high in PICTs
and also common among Malaysians (60 percent) and Indonesians (30 percent) (Haddad et al.
2014). Though decreasing physical activity may be associated with increased body weight, the
options for reducing body weight through increased energy expenditure are limited, since, for
example, an extra 100 kcal of food intake requires 25 minutes of moderately fast walking by a
man of 82 kilograms.
Regular physical activity has many health benefits. Inactivity greatly contributes to global
mortality and morbidity, and regular physical activity is an important aspect of NCD prevention,
especially for cancer (Kruk 2008). High levels of fitness protects against mortality from
cardiovascular disease and diabetes at all levels of body mass index (BMI) (that is, even in
those who are overweight/obese). The global recommendation is for a total of one hour per day
of moderate-intensity activity, such as brisk walking, on most days of the week (WHO 2003).
This is different from the widely recognized public health recommendation of half an hour a day
of moderate physical activity (US Department of Health and Human Services 2008), which
reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, although it does not reduce risk for all the other
NCDs. Global estimates are that about a third of adults do not get enough exercise (Hallal et al.
2012). A review of the levels of physical activity in the EAP Region has found methodological
differences, such that comparisons across countries and time were not possible to make
(Macniven et al. 2012). The national health survey in Indonesia found that two-thirds of children
10 to 14 years of age, and a third of adults 45 to 54 years, were not achieving half an hour a day
of moderate physical activity (DEPKES 2007).
iv. The Sociocultural Environment
Human beings also have a psychological relationship with food that goes beyond a need
for basic sustenance. Indeed, many attribute rising rates of obesity to neuropsychological
disease (Jauch-Chara and Oltmanns 2014). Food is also often a way of relieving stress, with
certain foods being used as “comfort” foods—often these are sweet foods. Food is often used
as a reward, with children getting a “treat” if they behave, for example. Certain prestigious foods
confer elevated status to the consumer, such as eating meat and/or drinking fine wines. These
foods, which were eaten on high days and holidays in the past, are far more frequently eaten
today and by a larger proportion of society.
People´s eating habits as well as their attitude toward weight are highly influenced by
“social norms.” Advertising campaigns in the “media” that promote certain behaviors, and
especially the consumption of specific foods and drinks are displacing social norms that had
been culturally determined in the past. In the United States, the US$11.26 billion spent on



                                                22
advertising by the food, beverage, and restaurant industries in 2004 dwarfed the mere US$9.55
million spent on communications by the federal and the state government of California on “5 a
Day” (Consumers Union 2005). This situation is largely the same in most countries across the
globe (Hawkes 2007).

Box 1.2 Determinants of Overweight and Obesity in the Pacific Islands
While the East Asia and Pacific region consists of countries with considerable heterogeneity, the
Pacific Island Countries share a number of characteristics that make their populations particularly
susceptible to growing burdens of overweight/obesity and diet-related NCDs.
Health/Biological Environment
Across Pacific Island countries, multiple NCD risk factors coexist at elevated levels, with unhealthy
diets, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and alcohol misuse identified as the leading risk factors (SPC
2010). High prevalence of overweight/obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are contributing to
rising avoidable deaths and disabilities. Given the understanding of the early life origins of adult
disease, it is plausible that the high burden of NCDs among adults in the Pacific may be contributing to
an altered epigenetic profile and increased predisposition to weight gain and NCDs among the next
generation.
Physical/Built Environment
The physical environment in PICs naturally constrains food production and food security. Smaller
island nations, in particular, consist almost exclusively of atolls that are largely infertile and susceptible
to sea-level rise. Volcanic islands tend to be larger and mountainous, with more fertile soils and
mineral deposits, which make them better suited for agricultural production (Snowdon and Thow
2013). The physical/built environment of Pacific Island countries not only hinders food production, but
it also constrains the physical activity side of energy balance. Unsurprisingly, populations on remote
islands face unique geographic barriers to physical activity. Moreover, common environmental
conditions such as lack of footpaths and lighting, wet weather, and high temperatures create barriers
to physical activity even in better-connected and urban communities (Siefken et al. 2012).
Economic/Food Environment
Economies in the PICs tend to derive income primarily from tourism, remittances, fisheries, aid, and
agriculture (Barnett 2011), with the agriculture sector playing a relatively minor economic role. Food
production is commonly conducted for subsistence but also for domestic and international markets. On
the other hand, fisheries play a critical role in economic development, food supply, and diets (Barnett
2011). Most Pacific countries are food dependent (Hughes 2003), and leaving fisheries aside, the
value of agricultural imports tends to dwarf agricultural exports from PICs. Occurring iwith increasing
frequency and severity, climate events will continue to disrupt potential agricultural outputs and fishery
development. Additional forces, such as development of nonagricultural economic sectors and market
penetration of processed imported foods have served to weaken diverse, local production (Barnett
2011). While food insecurity in Southeast Asian countries is commonly associated with undernutrition,
food insecurity in PICs tends to drive consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods (Barnett
2011). Imported foods such as noodles, white bread and crackers, and fatty meats are now added to
the traditional diets, which consisted of large quantities of starchy roots and local fish (Hughes 2003).
Importantly, fat and calories from imported foods seem have added to, rather than replace, traditional
sources. Micronutrient deficiencies persist at high levels in the region precisely because these
commonly consumed foods lack essential vitamins and minerals.
Sociocultural Environment
In the Pacific, social structures, values, and beliefs affect food consumption, activity, and self-image
patterns and contribute to obesogeic behaviors among youth and adults. In a large, mixed-methods
study of adolescents drawn from Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand, and Australia, McCabe et al. (2011) found
an absence of stigma around overweight among adolescents. Families drive pressures to achieve a
particular larger body type, considered ideal for both male and female adolescents, with larger youth
believed to be well-respected and cared for. In Fijian and Tongan households, the best-quality, highly
valued foods (such as those that are imported and scarce), and highest volume of food is given to
those of relatively high status. Youth report receiving conflicting messages and engage in strategies

                                                     24
The widespread marketing of foods to children (overwhelmingly those high in fat, sugar,
and/or salt) is a particular concern. A multicountry survey of the influence of television
advertisements on children in Asia reported that advertising to children was widespread across
the countries surveyed, and that while all six countries surveyed (India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Korea) had common food-based messages in their national
nutrition guidelines, the diet actively being promoted on television in all countries ran counter to
these guidelines (Escalante Cruz et al. 2004). An audit of junk food advertising in Australia
(ADGP 2003) found that over 99 percent of food advertisements broadcast during children’s
television programming were for junk food. Furthermore, no contrasting healthy eating
messages were promoted on television. In May 2010, the World Health Assembly (WHA)
endorsed a resolution calling for national and international action to reduce the impact on
children of marketing of foods high in saturated fats, trans-fatty acids, free sugars, or salt (WHO
2010a), yet little is known about country compliance.


                                  2. CONSEQUENCES OF THE DBM

Maternal and child undernutrition (MCU) is of greatest concern as constrained growth of
the fetus and infant has lifelong consequences among those who survive. The
consequences of MCU include increased risks of child mortality and morbidity, and—in those
who survive—decreased learning capacity and school performance, and decreased work
capacity, productivity, and lifelong earnings (Victora et al. 2008). Maternal and child
undernutrition in the aggregate is a cause of 3.1 million child deaths annually or 45 percent of all
child deaths in 2011. Across EAP, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to communicable,
newborn, nutritional, and maternal causes are generally declining. However, substantial
burdens persist, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries. In the period 1990 to
2010, DALYs due to diarrheal disease and iron-deficiency anemia actually increased by 37
percent and 9 percent, respectively, in the Philippines (IHME et al. 2013). Estimates of GNP
losses for Asia due to low adult height driven by infant stunting are 11 percent, year on year
(Horton and Steckel 2013). The increased risk of obesity and NCDs in adulthood as a
consequence of MCU earlier in the life course is also now well recognized (Adair et al. 2013),
although costs across the life course have not been computed.
The health consequences of overweight and obesity in children and adults are many,
including increased risk of nutrition-related NCDs, all of which are increasing in the EAP
region. These conditions include diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, and cancer (WHO
2003). The metabolic syndrome, which comprises a group of risk factors for cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs), including abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and impaired
glucose tolerance, increases the risk of developing CVD twofold and type 2 diabetes threefold
(Eckel et al. 2010). The inflammatory state of obesity seems to play a key causal role in the
development of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes especially (Holvoet 2008; Shah et
al. 2008; Smith and Minson 2012). While systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased globally,
between 1980 and 2008, it rose in Oceania and East Asia (Danaei et al. 2011). Global mean
total cholesterol changed little between 1980 and 2008, but it increased in East and Southeast
Asia and Pacific regions while falling in the high-income region comprising Australasia, North
America, and Europe (Farzadfar et al. 2011). Globally, rates of diabetes in adults have been
steadily increasing since 1980 (Danaei et al. 2011), with Oceania having the largest rise, and


                                                25
the highest mean Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) and diabetes prevalence (about 15 percent) in
2008.
Diet and nutrition factors are making increasingly important contributions to the burden
of disease in EAP. As of 2010, dietary risks (including high sodium intake and lack of fruits,
nuts, seeds, and whole grains) were the leading risk factor and high BMI the sixth-leading risk
factor for DALYs in EAP (figure 1.4). In EAP, DALYs due to high BMI increased by 198 percent
between 1990 and 2010, nearly 2.5 times the global average. Over the same period, there was
nearly a 40 percent increase in the total number of DALYs caused by stroke, 75 percent
increase in the number of DALYs from ischemic heart disease, and 80 percent increase in
DALYs from diabetes (IHME et al. 2013). Some 83 million people in the Asia-Pacific region were
estimated to have type 2 diabetes, representing almost half of the 171 million people with
diabetes worldwide (Lee et al. 2007). In addition to NCDs and premature mortality, maternal
overweight and hypertension have been found (in other regions) to be associated with a host of
adverse outcomes for the offspring as an infant (including birthweight >4,000g, still birth, and
infant mortality) and in later life (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, insulin resistance, and
behavioral problems) (O’Reilly and Reynolds 2013).

Because the standard BMI cutoffs used to define overweight and obesity are probably
too large, the overnutrition problem in EAP is probably much greater than it appears. The
World Health Organization has recommended BMI cutoffs for overweight and obesity be 23
kg/m2 and 27 kg/m2, respectively, in Asia, lower than the cutoffs of 25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2 used
in Caucasian populations (WHO 2004). BMI is used for epidemiological purposes to assess
associations between BMI within and across populations, yet Asian populations have different
associations between BMI, percentage of body fat, and health risks than do European
populations. In Asian populations, the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is
substantial at BMIs lower than the existing WHO cutoff point for overweight (25 kg/m2). More
recent work has supported the use of BMI ≥25 as the cutoff for obesity in Asian populations
(Wen et al. 2008). Indeed the population attributable fractions for cardiovascular disease in the
EAP region were about three times greater using a BMI cutoff for overweight ≥21 (Lee et al.
2011). Another concern is that waste circumference (WC) seems to be increasing faster than
BMI in China (Du et al. 2013). Some suggest a combination of WC and BMI are better for
indicating health risks in Chinese adults (Hou et al. 2013) as BMI has greatest risk for
hypertension and WC is more closely linked to diabetes risk. These authors conclude that
central obesity, overweight, and obesity are epidemic in Chinese adults, and urgent measures
are needed to prevent it.
If unmitigated, the economic burden of obesity and NCDs in EAP will be massive. The
global economic impact of obesity has been estimated at roughly US$2.0 trillion, or 2.8 percent
of global GDP (Dobbs et al. 2014). Over the next 20 years, the cost of treating NCDs and
cumulative output losses globally are likely to be at least US$30 trillion and $47 trillion,
respectively, representing 48 percent and 75 percent, respectively, of global GDP in 2010
(Bloom et al. 2011). Annual overweight and obesity costs in the United States were recently
estimated to be US$147 billion, or 9 percent of health care expenditures (Finkelstein et al.
2009). The total annual direct cost of overweight and obesity in Australia in 2005 was $A21
billion, with indirect costs of $35.6 billion per year, resulting in an overall total annual cost of
$56.6 billion (Colagiuri et al. 2010). The out-of-pocket expenses and indirect burden of three
NCDs (heart problems, hypertension, and diabetes) in Indonesia is estimated to be $4.02 billion,
with heart problems exerting the greatest economic burden on households ($1.56 billion),
followed by hypertension ($1.36 billion), diabetes ($0.81 billion), and stroke ($0.29 billion). In
2020 these conditions are projected to impose an economic burden of $5.80 billion (Finkelstein
et al. 2014) 5. The economic consequences of NCDs are already substantial and increasing in
the PICTs (Anderson 2012), where they are the leading cause of death in 12 of the countries for
which data are available, frequently accounting for 70 percent of all deaths. As described above,
the Pacific now has some of the highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the world. This is
particularly important since the government is already the main provider and financier of health
services, and is fiscally constrained in how much more it can provide to the health system.

  IV. ACCELERATING PROGRESS IN PREVENTING AND MITIGATING
                         THE DBM

Tackling the DBM requires a multisectoral approach to address the multiple determinants
of malnutrition across the life course. Though multisectoral planning for nutrition dates back
to the 1970s (Levinson and Balarajan 2013; Levinson and McLachlan 1999), the importance of
employing multisectoral policies and interventions for improving nutrition outcomes has been
widely agreed during this last decade (World Bank 2006; SUN 2010; Alderman et al. 2012;
European Commission 2012). For reducing MCU, the nutrition-specific interventions (Bhutta et
al. 2013) directed at immediate levels of causality are delivered mostly through the health
sector, while nutrition-sensitive interventions directed at the underlying and basic levels of
causality (Ruel et al. 2013) are often delivered through other sectors, such as education,
agriculture, water and sanitation, and social welfare.
While intervening in the first 1,000 days is critical, addressing the double burden of
malnutrition requires expanding the focus of nutrition interventions to cover the rest of
the life course into adulthood. Indeed these nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive
interventions need to be continued across the school years into adulthood and the workplace
(Shrimpton and Rokx 2012). Moreover, a range of policy interventions and programs are
needed to address the overall food environment. The WHO recommendations for childhood
obesity prevention programs include key points that have population-wide relevance. These
recommendations include the following: use a mixture of “top-down” and community-based
actions, employ a range of policy instruments, establish cross-sectoral platforms and a
multisectoral approach; promote interventions across a range of settings, including early
childcare settings, schools, workplaces, and community organizations; and leverage legislative
and financial tools to ensure availability and affordability of healthy foods and physical activity
opportunities (WHO 2012).
Renewed and strong international commitment to address malnutrition in all its forms
can be leveraged to build national commitment. For example, the Comprehensive
Implementation Plan (CIP) on Maternal, Infant, and Young Child Nutrition (MIYCN), endorsed by
the 65th World Health Assembly in May 2012, has six global nutrition targets to be reached by
2025 (table 1.3). The ICN2 Rome Declaration on Nutrition and Framework for Action (FAO
2014b) has further endorsed the CIP as well as the political declaration adopted at the UN High-
Level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable
Diseases in September 2011. International and civil society organizations can use these global
nutrition targets as a platform from which to hold member states accountable for building
national commitment and strengthening action.
Table 1.3 The Six World Health Assembly (WHA) Global Nutrition Targets
 WHA targets
 Reduce the number of children <5 who are stunted, by 40 percent
 Reduce anemia in women of reproductive age, by 50 percent
 Reduce low birthweight by 30 percent
 No increase in childhood overweight
 Increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months up to at least 50 percent
 Reduce and maintain childhood wasting to less than 5 percent



                                                                28

These global nutrition targets and health goals can only be reached through scaled-up
delivery of nutrition interventions across many sectors. Scaling up the priority nutrition-
specific interventions through the health sector to cover 90 percent of the population in the 36
countries with 80 percent of the global stunted children will only reduce stunting by 20 percent
(Bhutta et al. 2013), still short of the WHO CIP target for 2025. Scaling up the nutrition-sensitive
interventions through other sectors is therefore required to achieve these MCU targets and
perhaps as important to do so in a sustainable way. Although the evidence base doesn’t yet
permit precise estimation of the contribution of nutrition-sensitive interventions to stunting
reduction, early indications are that social protection, agriculture, water and environment, and
public health can all greatly contribute to the acceleration (Fanzo et al. 2014).
Interventions in multiple sectors and at multiple levels are also needed to reduce obesity
and achieve diets and lifestyles conducive to healthy weight. The McKinsey Global Institute
(MGI) used the Foresight model (figure 1.3 above) to model the impact of interventions for
reducing obesity for the United Kingdom (Dobbs et al. 2014). The MGI report concluded that
any single intervention is likely to have only a small overall impact on its own; rather, a systemic,
sustained portfolio of initiatives, delivered at scale, is needed to address the health burden. The
report concluded that a total of 74 interventions falling into 18 groups were cost-effective for
society, and could reverse rising obesity and save $1.2 billion a year for the National Health
Service. While the results are restricted to the United Kingdom, the authors considered the
results of the analysis could be extrapolated to other less developed economies. Modeling
exercises have also demonstrated the cost effectiveness of tackling unhealthy diets, physical
inactivity, and obesity in LMICs (Cecchini et al. 2010), and demonstrated that achieving the
NCD 25 percent mortality reduction target by 2025 was feasible if the targets for the underlying
risk factors were met (Kontis et al. 2014).
The following sections enumerate the actions that each sector can take to contribute
toward reductions in the DBM. We draw upon the evidence base, including the 2008 and
2013 Lancet series on nutrition, the Lancet 2010 priority interventions for the prevention of
NCDs, WHO Global NCD Action Plan (2013–2020), and World Cancer Research Fund’s
NOURISHING framework (see details in annex 2), and aggregate interventions by sector to
promote ease of operationalization. We begin with those sectors most frequently identified for
the delivery of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions and then discuss the role of
additional sectors and highlight their role in promoting environments where nutrition-promoting
behaviors are the default (Dobbs et al. 2014).


                                              1. HEALTH

The health sector plays a central role in preventing and mitigating MCU. Reductions in
MCU can be achieved largely by scaling up health sector delivery of the Lancet Series (2013)
package of nutrition-specific interventions targeted at women of reproductive age, pregnant and
lactating women, and young children, including micronutrient supplementation; protein-
energy/complementary food supplementation for targeted populations; counseling on
appropriate MIYCN; and appropriate care for acute malnutrition (Bhutta et al. 2013) (details in
table 1A.3). There is a growing body of evidence that points to the importance of utilizing


                                                 29
existing maternal and child health services to provide comprehensive (including nutrition)
support for young children as well as their parents and caregivers to ensure optimal child
development (Britto et al. 2016). Improving the accessibility and delivery of quality health
services—such as reproductive health and family planning, skilled birth attendance, antenatal
and postnatal care, maternal mental health services, and parenting support—can contribute to
improvements in the immediate and underlying determinants of MCU.
In addition to providing basic nutrition services, the health sector maintains
responsibility for provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) messages that are
necessary to reduce infection and undernutrition. Optimal handwashing should form an
essential component of MIYCN messages. Furthermore, health workers at community level who
are trained in nutrition behavior change can also deliver messages on sanitation/feces
management, treatment and safe water storage, and food hygiene. Within the Ministry of
Health, intra-agency collaboration between public health, environmental health, and nutrition
divisions is necessary to promote consistency and complementarity of policies, programs, and
messages related to the interface between WASH and nutrition (USAID 2013).
The health sector must also take the lead in advocacy and action to prevent and treat
overnutrition and NCDs. Primary and secondary prevention measures through the health
system present the most affordable, realistic option for EAP countries. Growth monitoring—
including stature—can allow for assessment of BMI and early identification of childhood
overweight/obesity. Nutrition education interventions for improving diet in overweight/obese
adults—including pregnant women—can be effective, especially if the health care providers are
trained to measure BMI and/or waist circumference (Pignone et al. 2003; Ammerman et al.
2008). Lack of patient awareness of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes is common, and
routine check-ups with health education can also help control these problems. Once an
individual is overweight or obese, clinical intervention using multiple therapeutic modalities
(behavioral therapy to reduce caloric intake and increase physical activity; pharmacotherapy,
and surgical treatments) for weight reduction are needed. There is moderate quality evidence
that behavioral (diet, exercise, lifestyle) and pharmacological treatments for overweight and
obesity in adults lead to clinically important reductions in weight and in incidence of type 2
diabetes (Peirson et al. 2014). Dramatic declines in coronary heart disease mortality of 70 to 80
percent have been reported in Nordic countries such as Iceland (Aspelund et al. 2010) and
Finland (Laatikainen et al. 2005), a quarter of which were due to pharmacological treatments.
While the health system should aim to achieve 80 percent coverage in the cost-effective
technologies and essential medicines for the control of NCDs (WHO 2013b), these treatment
strategies should not substitute for investment in prevention.
Interventions to prevent undernutrition through the health system have some potential of
exacerbating overweight/obesity. Providing additional food—in the form of balanced
energy/protein food supplements—to undernourished mothers during pregnancy and their
children under two years of age has no danger of increasing the risks of overnutrition later in the
life course. However, promoting rapid weight gain after this critical window has been associated
strongly with the risk of NCDs in adulthood (Victora et al. 2008). In settings where treatment of
undernutrition has been the norm, there is a need for nutrition and health professionals to
recognize that protein and caloric requirements for healthy children and mothers are
significantly lower than those established for malnourished individuals. Carefully considered
messaging is needed from health staff in particular (Dietz et al. 2015) to promote optimum


                                                30
growth (especially linear growth) in children under two years of age, and to avoid excessive
weight gain after that. Public health efforts need to be redoubled, not only to control the
marketing of breastmilk substitutes, but also to protect older children from increasingly
sophisticated marketing of sedentary activities and energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and
beverages (Lobstein et al. 2015).

Agriculture programs have a role to play in reducing malnutrition through access to
sufficient, diverse, and nutrient-rich diets. In EAP, agriculture policies and programs tend to
focus on food security through the production of cereals/staple foods (see box 1.3) and income
generation through high-value export crops. While enhanced staple food productivity and
agricultural incomes are necessary to meet the caloric needs of growing populations, there is a
need for programs and interventions to explicitly address factors along the pathways between
agricultural production and optimal nutrition 6 (Ruel et al. 2013). Examples of nutrition-sensitive
agriculture interventions for MCU include promoting production of nutrient-rich crop varieties;
improving diverse homestead food production; and incorporating nutrition considerations into
agricultural extension programs; and increasing women’s access to land, productive resources,
and agricultural extension services. In terms of production diversification, there is strong
evidence for the potential of biofortification to improve nutrition, but important gaps remain
related to cost-effectiveness, bioavailability of micronutrients, cultural appropriateness, and
accessibility and affordability for the poor (Kohr 2008). Biofortification should be seen as one
component of a comprehensive strategy to increase micronutrient intake in the EAP. Further

                                                                    31
agricultural innovation, such as diversification of smallholder rice-based farming systems, can
have a substantial impact on availability of diverse foods and—ideally—nutrition in the region
(ACDI/VOCA 2012). Female-led enterprises have traditionally experienced low productivity due
to their unequal access to agricultural information, training, extension services, and inputs
(World Bank 2012a). Increasing women’s access to productive resources can translate into their
control over income and decision-making power related to intra-household allocation of food,
health, and care (Ruel et al. 2013).
There is growing recognition of the untapped potential for analysis and intervention in
agricultural value chains to improve nutrition, though these approaches are in the
nascent stages (Hawkes and Ruel 2011). Increased production of nutritious foods may have
some independent impact on dietary consumption and on improving micronutrient status;
evidence shows that nutrition education around those foods strongly enhances the effect (Berti
et al. 2004). Overall, evidence for the efficacy of nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions for
improving MCU is considered weak (Masset et al. 2011), yet this may largely be due to the lack
of suitability of these interventions for randomized controlled trials. However, there is still much
that we know and that can be done to improve nutrition though agriculture (Pinstrup-Andersen
2013), and ongoing projects are utilizing rigorous program evaluations to better understand the
agriculture-nutrition pathways.

 Box 1.3 Food Security and “Cereals Fundamentalism” in East and Southeast Asia
 According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) definition, “food security exists
 when all people at all times have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food
 to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active, healthy life,” (FAO 2013). Food security is
 commonly understood to have four dimensions: availability, accessibility, affordability, and stability.
 Traditionally, food security in many EAP countries has been defined in terms of self-sufficiency in staple
 grains (primarily rice) with food policy driven by “cereals fundamentalism.” Consequently, substantial public
 resources have been dedicated toward investments in technologies, irrigation, infrastructure, and subsidies
 to support staple grain production. Furthermore, governments have actively sought to manage the availability
 and price of rice in domestic markets and through international trade (World Bank 2015). However, food
 demand is shifting, with lower demand for cereals for direct consumption and more for nutrient-rich foods,
 including meats, fruits, and vegetables. Over time, credits, price support, and subsidies of rice and other
 staple foods have crowded out production of nonstaples, distorting supply and driving up price of
 micronutrient-rich nonstaples relative to staples (Pingali 2015). These investments are costly, and overall
 increases in agricultural spending in Asia can largely be accounted for as growth in spending on rice
 programs (Zorya and Santos 2014). At the same time, rice-centric policies have failed to address fully the
 environmental, natural resources, nutrition, food safety, and food consumption considerations inherent in
 feeding and in providing adequate nutrition to growing and increasingly urbanized populations.
 A recent World Bank report (2015) urged governments in the region to adapt their approach to food security
 and rethink the strategic prioritization of rice at the expense of all other food commodities. Ministries of
 Agriculture have been slow to facilitate the changes needed for agri-food systems to adapt to modern
 demand. There is an urgent need to “rebalance” food security policies to fully consider agricultural
 productivity and diversification, food and feed trade facilitation; food safety management; multisectoral
 approaches to nutrition; and safety nets. EAP countries will need to critically and innovatively assess how
 price, income, and other agricultural supports can shift from producing ever more staple grains toward
 nutrition-sensitive and climate-smart agriculture aimed at eradicating poverty and food insecurity (World
 Bank 2015) and addressing coexisting burdens of overnutrition and undernutrition.




                                                    32
There is additional potential to leverage agricultural production and value chains to
reduce overweight and obesity. Table 1.5 highlights priority actions in agriculture to promote
optimal nutrition and reduce the DBM. Local production and year-round availability nutrient-rich
foods, such as fruits and vegetables, can improve dietary diversity, potentially decreasing risk of
overweight and obesity. Increasing staple food production plays an important role in ensuring
the caloric sufficiency of populations; however, in many EAP countries this narrow agricultural
focus may have unintended consequences. To address both sides of the DBM, interventions to
enhance agricultural productivity are also needed for nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, and pulses.
In the United States for example, it was estimated that fruit production would have to rise 117
percent and vegetable production by 137 percent to meet the domestic requirements set out in
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (USDA 2006). As EAP countries develop and implement
their own dietary guidelines, further analytical work in the agriculture sector can help to identify
gaps in the availability and accessibility of nonstaple foods and subsequently expand research,
input, and subsidies to include these commodities. Milled cereals are critical inputs in the
production of highly processed foods, and nutrition-sensitive value-chain analyses can be used
to identify the value-chain transformations of domestic staple foods and their role in the rise of
obesity (Hawkes and Ruel 2011; FAO 2013; Ruel et al. 2013). 7 The Global Panel on Agriculture
and Food Systems for Nutrition (2014) highlights that food choices—framed by the local context
of food availability, accessibility, affordability, and appeal—have a fundamental role in
determining the quality of diets and nutritional status. Agriculture and health policies have the
potential to become better aligned to promote both food and nutrition security.
Agriculture policies and programs can be linked with social safety net programs (see
section IV, 3) to enhance nutrition. Food-based safety net programs can ensure livelihoods,
by increasing purchasing power, or relieve deprivation. Examples of food-based safety nets
include providing employment through food-for work schemes; providing food stamps, coupons,
or vouchers for food purchases; or directly providing food to households and individuals (Bora
and Zorya 2014). These forms of food-based social safety nets have not gained widespread
popularity in Asia, where the predominant form of food-based safety net assistance has been
through rice subsidies (see section IV, 6). In the United States, a federal initiative provides direct
technical support to rural communities to help them increase the supply of locally produced
foods and build strong local food systems as part of their community's economic action plans
(USDA 2014). The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food
stamps, helped approximately 47.6 million low-income individuals put food on the table by
providing an average monthly benefit of $133 per person in 2013. While there is evidence that
linking the provision of food stamps to the purchase of fruits and vegetables in local markets
leads to improved quality diets in participants (Kropf et al. 2007), evidence of improved nutrition
outcomes is still weak (McCormack et al. 2010). In LMICs, homegrown school feeding (HGSF)




7. Ruel et al. 2013 describe three factors that make value chains a promising approach for tackling both sides of the
DBM: (1) they focus on coordination between actors; (2) they are analytical, versatile, and solution-oriented and can
be used to assess and address the bottlenecks that affect availability, affordability, acceptability, or quality of
nutritious foods in a given context; and (3) they focus on the addition of economic value and can identify points
before, during, and after production where nutritional and economic value can be added, or losses in nutrients
prevented.


                                                          33
programs have been championed by the World Food Programme and implemented in a number
of African countries. HGSF delivers cost-effective, government-led school feeding programs
using food produced by local smallholders. These programs can contribute to reliable local
agricultural livelihoods, improved school attendance for children, and increased access to food,
but there is no evidence of differential nutritional impact between HGSF and traditional school
feeding programs.

                                                   3. SOCIAL PROTECTION

Incorporating priority nutrition actions into social protection programs can reduce MCU
and enhance these programs’ ability to mitigate the intergenerational transmission of
poverty. Social protection mechanisms such as cash and in-kind transfers, public works,
insurance, and microfinance can be made nutrition-sensitive (Marini et al. 2013). Conditional
cash transfers (CCTs) are often used as the delivery mechanism to link income to co-
responsibilities related to consumption of health and nutrition services. The CCT program
Oportunidades (formerly Progresa) in Mexico has achieved reductions in stunting (Hoddinot and
Basset 2009) and anemia (Rivera et al. 2004), and the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
program in the United States has improved birth outcomes (Foster et al. 2010). Though
evidence of a nutritional impact beyond the Americas had been weak (Lagarde et al. 2009;
Manley et al. 2012), recent impact evaluation of the Pantawid CCT in Philippines demonstrated
a strong, positive reduction in severe stunting (HAZ <-3) in children age 6-36 months (Kandpal
et al. 2016). In the absence of hard conditions/co-responsibilities, unconditional transfers
(UCTs) and other social protection programs can complement income support with the provision
of ‘accompanying measures’ which provide nutrition education, behavior change
communication, and/or ‘nudges’ to change nutrition practices. There is the potential in EAP
publicly funded social safety net programs to play an important role in improving access to
special complementary foods (Bloem et al. 2013) and fortified foods for the poor. In EAP
countries where rice is the primary staple food, mandatory rice fortification may not be feasible
due to the constraints of rice fortification technology; however, social safety net programs that
distribute fortified rice can provide a means of reaching the poor and those at greatest nutritional
risk (Codling, Fabrizio, and Rosenzweig 2015).
Cash and in-kind transfers intended to reduce undernutrition must be further refined to
prevent unintended effects on overnutrition. Cash transfer programs have been found to
contribute to increased overweight and obesity in mothers in Mexico (Leroy et al. 2013) and


                                                               34
Colombia (Forde et al. 2012) as well as in young children in Mexico (Leroy et al. 2010) and the
United States (Akee et al. 2013). A variety of program design choices can help to mitigate these
risks. In Mexico, ongoing program evaluations allowed for the characterization of the
heterogeneity of the beneficiary population in terms of nutritional risk. Ultimately, the benefit
package of supplements and counseling was modified to respond to the different nutrient gaps
of urban and rural populations (Neufeld et al. 2011). Fortified milk distribution continued in
remote communities with low access to services; where risk of overnutrition was high, food
supplements were modified to reduce calories but retain micronutrients. Additionally, individual
counseling sessions are being scaled up to promote breastfeeding, healthy complementary
feeding, and the avoidance of excess weight gain in preschool-age children (Kroker-Lobos et al.
2014). Similar program modifications can be particularly relevant in middle-income countries
where the double burden is now well established. Table 1.6 presents priority actions for the
social protection sector to contribute to reductions in the DBM.
Many studies show that the double burden of malnutrition at the household and
individual levels has poverty as a common denominator. In the United States and
increasingly in middle-income countries such as Mexico, obesity is more common among the
poor (Drenowski and Darmon 2005; Kroker-Lobos et al. 2014). As poor households gain access
to sufficient food to meet energy requirements, poverty alleviation programs need to adapt to
concerns of overnutrition. One mechanism to achieve these outcomes is through linkages
between the provision of cash transfers and the purchase of nutrient-dense food, such as fruits
and vegetables, which can be sold by small-scale local farmers through local farmers’ markets.
In the United States, the USDA nutrition assistance programs provided about US$10 billion in
support of fruit and vegetable consumption in 2005 (USDA 2008). These funds supported
USDA’s purchase and distribution of fruits and vegetables to schools, food banks, and other
program providers through the Child Nutrition Programs, and participants’ purchases in the
marketplace through SNAP, WIC, and the Farmers’ Market Nutrition Programs (FMNPs).

                                           4. EDUCATION
The relationship between good nutrition and education is a reciprocal one. Higher
maternal education is associated with less maternal obesity and less stunting in her child
(Lakshman et al. 2013; Leroy et al. 2014), and less-stunted children are more likely to have
better cognitive function and increased educational achievements (Victora et al. 2008). Girls’
completion of primary and secondary education has been shown to be one of the greatest


                                                                35
contributors to stunting reduction in Bangladesh and Indonesia (Semba et al. 2008), as well as
in Nepal (Crum et al. 2012). Though mechanisms for these relationships are unclear (Wachs
2008), it may be that keeping girls in schools contributes to increasing economic opportunity,
reducing teenage pregnancy rates, and/or improving the nutritional status of adolescents prior to
marriage, all of which contribute to improved birthweights (UNSCN 2010).
The education sector can contribute to reductions in MCU through holistic early child
development. Integrating early child care and development (ECCD) and nutrition programming
may contribute to improved short-term and long-term gains in child development and nutrition.
These programs could combine psychosocial stimulation, parenting skills, nutrition interventions
focusing on micronutrients, healthy diets, and obesity prevention targeted not only at children in
the 1,000 days window but into the preschool years (Ruel et al. 2013). Furthermore, recent
evidence highlights the links between WASH and ECD to suggest that poor hygiene and
sanitation in the physical environment may contribute to impaired nutrient absorption and
inflammation, affecting linear growth, iron status, and brain development (Ngure et al. 2014).
Effective coordination among researchers and program designers is needed to better establish
the evidence for effective intervention in these overlapping areas.


Schools also provide a platform for the delivery of nutrition-specific and nutrition-
sensitive interventions. School-going adolescent girls have been successfully enlisted to
provide outreach to girls in their community who are no longer in school. In India, the provision
of weekly iron–folic acid tablets together with deworming tablets every six months to 150,700
adolescent schoolgirls and non-schoolgirls reduced the overall prevalence of anemia of
adolescent girls in a district from 73.3 percent to 25.4 percent in four years at a cost of US$0.36
per beneficiary per year (Vir et al. 2008). This model was subsequently scaled up to reach 27.6
million adolescent girls in 13 states, including 16.3 million schoolgirls and 11.3 million out-of-
school girls by 2011 (Aguayo et al. 2013). School feeding is a common social safety net
program implemented through the education sector and are often implemented to stimulate
school attendance and alleviate short-term hunger. Though often not sufficiently designed to be
a nutrition intervention per se, these programs can serve as a platform for nutrition promotion
and may improve children’s micronutrient status, growth, and cognition if properly designed.
Systematic review of various school feeding programs demonstrated positive effects on
schooling: children who were fed at school attended four to six more days of school per year per
child and performed better in math (Kristjansson et al. 2009); however, effects on growth (in
height and weight) are inconclusive. Further refining program design to include animal-source
foods, fortified foods, and micronutrient powders or supplements can be effective in reducing
micronutrient deficiencies (Jomaa et al. 2011). Impacts of school feeding can be enhanced if
combined with complementary interventions to the quality of the school and home environment.

Schools can also serve as settings for promoting healthy nutrition behaviors, preventing
child obesity (Waters et al. 2011) and reducing other chronic disease risk factors and
improving fitness (Flynn et al. 2006; Ho et al. 2012). Schools can become nutrition-sensitive
through a number of priority actions (table 1.7 above). It is recommended that schools in the
United States provide quality physical education and ensure strong nutritional standards for all
foods and beverages sold in or provided by the schools, as well as ensure that food literacy and
nutrition skill development is part of the curriculum (Institute of Medicine 2012). WHO has
developed a “Nutrition Friendly Schools Initiative” (WHO 2007; Chiabi and Obama 2009) that
includes five main components 8 and has been piloted in West Africa (Delisle et al. 2013). With
children spending a significant portion of their time in schools, the foods that are available there
play an important role in shaping children’s food environments and can contribute to either the
prevention or promotion of obesity. Most US states have adopted laws that regulate the
availability of sugar-sweetened beverages in school settings (Mello et al. 2008), and in France
and the United Kingdom vending machines have either been banned in schools or are no longer
filled with sugar-sweetened beverages or processed snack foods. School feeding programs are
invariably associated with increased energy intake, and must be designed carefully to meet
nutrient needs of participants. These programs tend to promote faster gains in weight than in
linear growth: intervention children experienced an average weight gain of 0.39 kilograms more
than controls over 19 months (Kristjansson et al. 2009). Recent evidence from Latin America
indicates that nontherapeutic programs in LMICs aimed at promoting weight gain in children
after age two may do more harm than good (Victora and Rivera 2014). On the other side of the
energy balance equation, scaling up school-based physical activity interventions for improved
health outcomes and obesity mitigation among adolescents is important but difficult (Dobbins et
al. 2013; van Nassau et al. 2014). Despite numerous programs, no significant changes in
obesity prevalence occurred in youth or adults in the United States between 2003 and 2004 and
between 2011 and 2012 (Ogden et al. 2014).
                                        5. PUBLIC INFORMATION
No single ministry is usually responsible for all aspects of public information on food
and nutrition. At the international level, the Codex Alimentarius Commission, established by
FAO and WHO in 1963, develops harmonized international food standards, and guidelines and
codes of practice to protect the health of consumers and ensure fair practices in the food trade.
At the national level, regulatory control will be with an agency such as the Food and Drug




8. The Nutrition-Friendly Schools Initiative (NFSI) five components include a written school policy on nutrition;
awareness and capacity strengthening of the school community; curriculum development and modifications; creation
of a supportive school environment for optimal nutrition and health; and school nutrition and health services.

Administration (FDA) in the United States, for example. Table 1.8 describes priority actions to
reduce the DBM through public information.
The promotion of breastfeeding is the single most important area of public information
for MCU. Public information campaigns to promote optimal maternal, infant, and young child
nutrition (MIYCN) have the potential to improve population behaviors. Though the Lancet 2008
series found mass media campaigns promoting breastfeeding to have “little or no evidence” for
effectiveness (Bhutta et al. 2008), the reviewed studies predate the widespread adoption of
many information and communications technologies in LMICs. After conducting substantial
formative research to support the approach, large-scale public information campaigns promoting
MIYCN behavior change were implemented and are under evaluation in Vietnam and
Bangladesh (Sanghvi et al. 2013). These campaigns have used channels such as television,
print, audio messages, Internet, and social media messages and have the potential to improve
behavioral determinants of MCU. Early evidence shows that the delivery of nutrition messages
using mass media can be complemented by nutrition education and outreach to be most
effective (Saha et al. 2013).
Food labeling provides important nutrition information to consumers and can help to
reduce overweight and obesity. Labels that describe the nutrition content of foods can, in
theory, permit the discerning consumer to make more informed purchases. Evidence for the
effectiveness of “front of pack” labeling is still weak, however (Campos et al. 2011). Labels are
most used by educated and wealthier segments of the population. But as described in a review
of the global regulatory environment, there is considerable variation of approaches and
regulations in countries around the world (Hawkes 2004). WHO provides guidance in
developing or adapting nutrient profile models, and based on these nutrient profiles, claims such
as “low fat” or “healthy choice” on food labels and in marketing can be regulated by national
food standards authorities (WHO 2011b). In all countries of Southeast Asia except Malaysia,
nutrition labeling is voluntary unless nutritional claims are made (Kasapilla and Shaarani 2011).
As individuals in EAP countries begin eating outside the home in greater numbers,
municipalities may consider extending nutrition labeling to restaurants and ready-to-eat food
retailers.

                                            6. FINANCE
Fiscal policies such as subsidies and taxes can either stimulate or reduce consumption
of foods and drinks. In the case of MCU, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of
staple food subsidy interventions in reducing undernutrition (Jensen and Miller 2011).
Indonesia has spent large sums subsidizing rice through the Raskin program, making it one of
the largest forms of social assistance. However, critics attack staple food subsidies on the


                                                              38
grounds that they distort market signals, lead to shortages, promote smuggling and black
market activity, or in practice are poorly targeted and disproportionately benefit the least poor
(Kochar 2005). World Bank public expenditure review of Raskin corroborated these criticisms
and documented that half or less of rice purchased for Raskin reaches households, and that the
program was targeted so that poor households received only 25 percent of total subsidies
(World Bank 2012b). Similarly, in 2005-6 only 21 percent of the subsidy through the Philippines
National Food Authority rice subsidy program reached the poor (Bora and Zorya 2014). Brazil
abandoned food subsidies used in the 1980s with World Bank support, largely due to lack of
documented evidence of impact due to “leakage” (Musgrove 1990). The Philippines has also
largely moved from poorly targeted food subsidies to more targeted cash transfer programs
(Bora and Zorya 2014).

Researchers and policy makers are devoting considerable and growing attention to the
potential of fiscal policies to impact dietary habits and curb obesity. Several reviews
suggest that sufficiently large taxes (from 10 to 20 percent) on high sugar, salt, and fat foods
can reduce consumption, with potential to not only reduce obesity but also raise revenues
(Powell et al. 2013; Thow et al. 2014.). In Poland, for example, reduced subsidies on lard and
butter soon after the transition to a democratic government resulted in a rapid increase in the
consumption of cheaper nonhydrogenated vegetable fat. In consequence, the ratio of dietary
polyunsaturated to saturated fat increased from 0.33 in 1990 to 0.56 in 1999, and mortality from
coronary artery disease dropped 28 percent (Zatonski et al. 1998). Four countries in the Pacific
(Fiji, French Polynesia, Nauru, and Samoa) have imposed increased taxes or import levies on
sugary soft drinks, with varying results (Thow et al. 2010). International agencies are providing
support for countries considering taxation. A guide on how to develop fiscal policies for foods in
relation to free market issues and the WTO in the Asian region has been developed by the
regional WHO office (Lawrence 2005). The Pacific Islands regional office of FAO has also made
recommendations recently that include both food taxes, as well as subsidies and facilitated
credit mechanism to local farmers to improve local vegetable and fruit production (FAO 2014c).
The World Bank NCD Roadmap Report lays out key considerations for Ministries of Finance
seeking to undertake taxation measures and suggests that earmarking tax revenues for health
promotion purposes can strengthen public support for unpopular taxation measures (2014). In
addition to subsidizing production of fruits and vegetables, subsidies have been shown to be a
promising measure to incentivize consumption of healthy foods. A systematic review of the use
of fiscal policies found that all reviewed subsidies on healthy food (ranging between 1.8 percent
and 50.0 percent) led to an increase in consumption of the targeted foods equal to at least half
of the applied subsidy (Thow et al. 2014). The fiscal policies that can reduce the DBM are
presented in table 1.9 above.
               7. TRANSPORT, PUBLIC WORKS, AND URBAN AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
Investments in water and sanitation services—as well as rural roads, markets, and
electrification—have an important role to play in reducing undernutrition in LMICs.
Improving access to water and sanitation can make a critical contribution toward achieving the



                                                                 39
WHA target for stunting reduction (Smith and Haddad 2014). Community-Led Total Sanitation
(CLTS), a behavior change approach that mobilizes communities to undertake their own
appraisal and analysis and take their own actions to become open defecation free (ODF) is
being implemented in 12 countries across the region with considerable success in Indonesia,
Cambodia, and Timor-Leste (UNICEF 2013). And while interventions targeting communities
and households are urgently needed, coordination between public works and other sectors is
necessary to ensure that improved WASH services, such as basic water, sanitation, and
hygiene are also available at the institutional level. Among surveyed health facilities in
Southeast Asia, 22 percent lack improved water sources in close proximity, 42 percent lack
improved sanitation, and 20 percent lack soap for handwashing (UNICEF and WHO 2015).
Investments in safe water and toilet facilities must also be accompanied by behavioral change
communication, including for the cessation of open defecation, safe disposal of feces (especially
children’s), and appropriate handwashing with soap. In the Philippines, specifically, and EAP,
generally, the safe disposal of children’s feces is a neglected area of policy and programmatic
intervention. Even among households with improved sanitation facilities, 73 percent reported
unsafe disposal practices. Behavior change strategies should incorporate messages related to
proper sanitation for children, and these themes can be integrated into ODF protocol (UNICEF
et al. 2015). As the population in EAP grows and urbanizes, further investments in roads linking
rural and urban areas can open up market opportunities, maximizing the benefits of good health
and nutrition across geographic and economic groups (Fan et al. 2012). Rural electrification
plays an important role in increasing control over productive and leisure time, especially among
women (World Bank 2012a).

Transport policy and environmental design have fundamental effects on the
determinants of physical activity and therefore influence the risk of obesity and other
chronic diseases. Investments in roads can be harnessed as an opportunity to reduce
overnutrition through inclusion of pedestrian and bike spaces in the design. Walking and biking
can be encouraged by creating special bike lanes, as well as by making town centers
pedestrian-only precincts. Increasing the space available for leisure activities, such as playing
fields, parks, and public gardens, will also encourage more walking, running, and sports
(McCreedy and Leslie 2009; Beceerra et al. 2013). Improving access to and supply of healthy
foods such as fruits and vegetables through local farmers’ markets also requires the
construction of roads and provision of irrigation for the small-scale farms and homesteads so
they can produce these foods, as well as get them to market. Furthermore, zoning and other
incentives can help encourage access to healthy foods in underserved areas and limit access to




                                                                40
unhealthy foods, particularly for school children. Priority actions to address both undernutrition
and overnutrition through these sectors are presented in table 1.10 above.
                                 8. INDUSTRY, TRADE, AND COMMERCE
The food industry itself can contribute to reducing undernutrition through the
fortification of foods, while enhanced industry regulation can contribute to improved
infant and young child nutrition. Salt iodization is perhaps one of the greatest fortification
successes, with some 70 percent of households worldwide now having access to iodized salt
(Zimmerman 2013), and therefore being largely protected against iodine deficiency. Public-
private partnerships have the ability to incentivize food manufacturers to develop more nutritious
foods and enhance their distribution (World Economic Forum 2009). Through public-private
partnerships, fortified vegetable oil and wheat flour are now reaching over 70 percent of the
population in West Africa, for example (Sablah et al. 2013). The SUN Business Network
provides a toolkit for countries seeking to engage private sector stakeholders in national efforts
to reduce MCU (Scaling Up Nutrition Business Network 2014). Though voluntary measures may
have more political appeal, regulatory measures can be taken to promote breastfeeding. The
International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the Code) adopted by the World
Health Assembly in 1981 as a “minimum requirement” to be enacted in its entirety in all
countries, aims to promote safe and adequate nutrition for infants by protecting breastfeeding
and ensuring appropriate marketing of breastmilk substitutes. The Code bans all advertising of
breastmilk substitutes, as well as the provision of samples and gifts to mothers and health
workers, and the use of health care systems to promote breastmilk substitutes. Thirty years
after its endorsement, only 37 out of 199 countries reporting (19 percent) have passed laws
reflecting all recommendations of the Code (WHO 2011a).

Private sector actors play a central role in efforts to mitigate overweight and obesity and
must be engaged through voluntary and regulatory measures. The McKinsey Global
Institute (MGI) report identified portion control as the intervention with the highest potential
impact on those it modeled for obesity control (Dobbs et al. 2014). The report concluded that
new collaborations are needed within the food and beverage industry and between industry and
government, and that there is no straightforward and simple road map for delivering industry
levers. Some could be delivered through industry self-regulation, but in some cases industry
cannot or will not change without government regulation. To date, public regulation and market
intervention are the only evidence-based mechanisms proven to prevent harm caused by
unhealthy commodity industries (Moodie et al. 2013). Food composition targets for salt, trans


                                                                 41
fats, saturated fats, and sugar can be developed for both packaged and processed foods and
food service retailers. The WHO has identified regulations to reduce trans fats as a “best buy” to
prevent NCDs at the population level, and such regulatory strategies have been employed at
the municipal (New York City) and national (Argentina, Peru, Denmark) levels. New York City
employed a phased approach to trans fat limitations, first urging restaurants and food suppliers
to voluntarily eliminate foods high in trans fats before enacting the regulatory mandate (Trezza
and Bonilla-Chacin 2014). Government regulation should be considered particularly in the case
of marketing unhealthy foods to children, and additional efforts are needed to enforce these
measures. An accountability framework has been proposed to guide government and food
industry engagement to address unhealthy food environments as part of a broader government-
led strategy to address obesity and diet-related NCDs (Kraak et al. 2014). For governments
pursuing fortification strategies for undernutrition, it is worth noting that increased adiposity (or
fatness) is associated with a reduced response to iron fortification in women and children from
countries experiencing the nutrition transition (Zimmerman et al. 2008). Table 1.11 presents
priority actions for engaging the private sector to reduce the DBM.

   V. CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN THE APPLICATION OF
       MULTISECTORAL APPROACHES TO TACKLE THE DBM

The challenges of applying multisectoral approaches to tackle the DBM are considerable.
While the importance of employing multisectoral approaches for improving nutrition outcomes
has been widely agreed during this last decade, documented experience of how multisector
programs are implemented is still quite rare, (Shekar et al. 2012; Garret and Natalicchio 2011;
Levinson and Balarajan 2013) and what exists has focused on MCU. However, a number of
opportunities can and should be harnessed to address the complexity of addressing the DBM at
multiple levels across multiple sectors.
                                    1. STRENGTHENING SYSTEMS
In scaling up the delivery of DBM interventions, systems-strengthening efforts are need
to integrate the full spectrum of public health nutrition concerns into policies and
programs. In addition to developing appropriate institutional arrangements and sectoral
interventions, undernutrition and overnutrition considerations must be incorporated into
systems-wide efforts related to policy frameworks; leadership, coordination, and accountability;
workforce capacity; and knowledge and evidence.
A. Policy Frameworks
An overarching policy framework is needed to promote policy coherence for nutrition
across sectors. The Global Nutrition Policy Review conducted in 2009–10 indicated that
countries in the Southeast Asia region had national policies that most frequently addressed
undernutrition rather than obesity and diet-related NCDs. Experience from implementing the
National Plans of Action for Nutrition (NPAN), which stemmed from the first International
Conference on Nutrition (ICN), suggested that strategies from different sectors could be best
grouped into the four pillars: Sustainable Food Security, Food Safety, Healthy Lifestyle, and
Nutrition (Nishida et al. 2003). However, recent experience implementing this overarching DBM
policy framework found national innovation was limited due to the development of food-centric
(as opposed to nutrition-centric) plans. Furthermore, development of a national plan of action
does not guarantee financial commitment to nutrition. While many countries report having


                                                 42
national multisectoral nutrition plans, it seems that very few of these are actually being
implemented at any scale (WHO 2013a).
Developing an overarching national nutrition plan is both a challenge and an opportunity.
The principle of “plan multisectorally, implement sectorally, and review multisectorally” is one
that is supported by all reviews and guidance on multisectoral approaches. Developing a
national plan can help build a common sense of purpose, a crucial step underlying more
effective and efficient coordination. It can help create a common language for discussion, an
understanding of the points of view of other partners, shared interpretations of the evidence,
and often trust among professionals from different agencies. Advocates that work to build such
a shared vision need not be limited to the most senior decision makers but can include upper-
and middle-level managers (program or unit directors), as well as academics and advisers who
can facilitate developing such a plan. Their role is to put forth the vision and devote the effort,
energy, and creativity that are necessary to get partners to work together. Following plan
development, periodic joint progress review of implementation national nutrition plans can
further engender a shared sense of purpose and strengthen common vision.
B. Leadership, Coordination, and Accountability
Accelerating progress in nutrition through multisectoral approaches will require building
leadership at the national and local levels. Nutrition has been identified as a “chosen issue,”
meaning that champions are required to put it on the policy agenda (Garret et al. 2011).
Moreover, the implementation of multisectoral approaches for MCU improvement demands
strong and sustained support from high levels of government (Levinson and Balarajan 2013),
and this is no different for overnutrition. Giving high-profile leaders—such as prime ministers
and mayors—a central role in driving initiatives has been shown to be a key factor in bringing
different actors together to collaborate toward NCD prevention goals (Meiro-Lorenzo et al.
2011).
Creating the right institutional arrangements is both a challenge and an opportunity.
Working multisectorally can require fairly profound organizational changes to the ways sectors
work (Levinson and Balarajan 2013). This effort goes beyond simple coordination: it implies that
the institutions involved will change their ways of operating and linking with others, as well as
how they think and work together. Although this may require some extra effort up front, with the
right facilitation and creation of a joint vision and understanding, the results are well worth it. It is
widely agreed that it is most critical that cross-sector planning be done together so that
implementation can be done better separately. When considering how to approach the DBM,
EAP countries can draw upon the experience of countries that have joined the SUN movement.
The SUN framework (SUN 2010) calls on all partners to scale up efforts against malnutrition, by,
among other things: (1) developing a coordinated, multistakeholder approach, mobilizing key
stakeholders to generate inclusive country ownership; and (2) using the “Three Ones” (that is,
one agreed overarching policy framework, one national coordinating authority, one agreed
national monitoring and evaluation system). Seven EAP countries are involved in SUN
(Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Vietnam), all
countries seeking to develop multisectoral nutrition approaches should consider adopting the
SUN principles. Although focused on MCU, the recent SUN evaluation suggested that the SUN
movement should recognize that most LMICs have a DBM problem and begin to adapt
accordingly (Mokoro 2015).

Coordination mechanisms are needed to guide the implementation of priority
interventions and can and should vary depending on the degree of national
decentralization. A high-level coordinating body, at the supra-ministerial level, is recommended
for centralized countries to effectively implement multisectoral programs (SUN 2010).
Experience in developing such centralized approaches is already available through the SUN
movement, and many EAP countries are already collaborating in such efforts to tackle young
child stunting (MCU). In countries with more decentralized systems of government, coordination
mechanisms will be most effective at the district or community level, and national bodies (that is,
nutrition institutes) can provide strong technical and policy support.
Convergence of interventions across sectors serves to target the same geographic
populations with a diverse package of nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific
interventions without the need for complex integration. The impact of the various packages
of interventions assumes that all are delivered together. Rather than joint program
implementation, the various sectors converge their program interventions to be delivered
together as a package. This process helps ensure that impacts are adding together to greater
effect for target populations (Levinson and Balarajan 2013). In this regard, community-based
programs may be of particular importance, especially if they have the essential elements of
community ownership, adequate population coverage, targeting, and central support for
supplies and training (Mason et al. 2006). In a typical community-based program, community
“mobilizers” take on the task of looking after households in their neighborhood, allowing whole
communities to be mapped and covered. Well-run community-based nutrition programs costing
about $5 per household per year can achieve an annual reduction of child undernutrition rates
of 1.5ppts a year. To ensure such impact, a certain level of intensity of effort has to be ensured,
with optimal ratios of not more than 20 mobilizers per facilitator, and not more than 20
households per mobilizer. If these levels of intensity of effort are not ensured with a sufficiently
wide coverage, it should be expected that no impact will be seen at the population level, and the
resources invested will be largely lost.
A key challenge for scaling up such community-based programs lies in institutionalizing
and mainstreaming community participation (Lehmann and Sanders 2007). The most
difficult aspect is ensuring the ongoing supportive supervision of the community mobilizers by
health staff that carry out the outreach and facilitate their work (Hill et al. 2014). To date, the
largest and most successful such program is the Brazilian Family Health Program, which has
integrated 250,000 community health workers into its health services and institutionalized
community health committees as part of municipal health services (Harris and Haines 2010).
Community-based approaches are now being seen as the way forward for tackling obesity and
NCD-related health issues in the United States (Institute of Medicine 2012) and beyond
(Gaziano et el 2015).
The first Global Nutrition Report presents a strong case for greater accountability for
nutrition. Of the 99 countries that have data on all four of the six WHA CIP target indicators
(stunting, wasting, overweight, and anemia), only one—Colombia—is on track to meet all four
targets by 2025. The report also has a section on the coverage of five nutrition-specific

 Box 1.4 Community-Driven Development for Improved Nutrition in East Asia and Pacific
 What is CDD?
 Community-driven development (CDD) is an approach that emphasizes community control over planning
 decisions and investment resources and has a key operational strategy for the delivery of services (Wong 2012).
 CDD operates on the philosophy that community participation in local development upholds basic citizen’s rights
 and can often lead to better use of resources to meet the needs of local communities. Communities and local
 institutions are empowered to take the lead in identifying and managing community investments in small
 infrastructure or service delivery. When operating well, CDD programs provide a platform that can improve
 targeting, cost efficiency, service quality, transparency, and accountability of sector programs.
 Where has a CDD approach been used to address malnutrition?
 In Indonesia, the National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri) has been supported by the
 World Bank for over a decade and benefits over 45 million poor people. The program provides performance-
 based block grant funds to support communities in reaching 12 targets related to health and education. The
 PNPM Generasi Program, operating in rural areas, focuses on many of the same targets as traditional cash
 transfer programs with the village as the recipient of the funds. Villagers are empowered to own and manage the
 monitoring of program indicators and can receive performance bonuses based on their progress toward
 improving health and education indicators relative to other subdistricts within the same district. In an impact
 evaluation conducted between 2007 and 2010, the program had a statistically significant impact on child (zero to
 three years) underweight, with a 10 percent reduction from baseline levels (Olken et al. 2011).
 What makes CDD a promising approach to address the DBM?
 CDD operations inevitably require an approach combining multiple disciplines and sectors. CDD programs draw
 on expertise from the national to the subdistrict level. Community members are mobilized to identify the key
 context-specific determinants of malnutrition and intervene appropriately. Through their participatory nature,
 CDD projects foster social inclusion and provide women the opportunity to engage in decision making at the
 local level.

evaluation aspects of policies and programs for undernutrition and overnutrition can foster
national responsibility for improving nutrition and strengthen the international community to
hold governments accountable to improve nutrition.
The potential for achieving results is even greater when civil society organizations and
communities themselves are integrated into national plans to scale up nutrition. These
groups play a pivotal role in mobilizing community members and strengthening government
accountability to address the double burden of malnutrition. Due to their familiarity with the
needs and realities of communities affected by malnutrition, civil society organizations play an
important role in advocating for policies and programs that align with local needs. These
organizations have access to communities and grassroots networks that are able to raise




9. The five nutrition-specific interventions covered are as follows: (1) early initiation of breastfeeding; (2) exclusive
breastfeeding of infants under six months; (3) continued breastfeeding up to 12 months; (4) vitamin A
supplementation of preschool-age children; and (5) iron–folic acid supplementation of pregnant women for more than
90 days.

awareness of nutrition within the country. Furthermore, access to data and strong local
programs can galvanize community efforts to hold their governments accountable. In East Asia
and the Pacific, a number of countries have decentralized the delivery of health and nutrition
services (the Philippines, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, for example). Decentralized service delivery
can be coupled with community-driven development approaches to improve nutrition (see box
1.4). Civil society organizations can play an important role in providing support in the
implementation of local programs or connecting target populations with services. The SUN
movement, in particular, recognizes the key role of civil society in building public will and
accountability to achieve nutrition goals; these organizations can be key allies due to their
function outside the political system.
C. Workforce Capacity
Strengthening nutrition capacity is perhaps the greatest and most urgent challenge. As
financing to scale up nutrition is made available, there is increased need to expand the human
resources capacity to design, deliver, and manage large-scale nutrition programs (Horton et al.
2010). Doctors, nurses, and midwives (as well as dietitians in some countries) make up the
great majority of workers currently entrusted to deliver nutrition interventions globally. In West
Africa the nutrition training of these health professionals was found to be particularly poor
(Sodjinou et al. 2014), and a similar situation is likely to exist in most LMICs. Country case
studies in Asia concluded the nutritional knowledge of health workers is outdated, their nutrition
competencies limited to clinical and curative activities, and—for nurses and midwives
especially—their job descriptions do not include nutrition responsibilities (Shrimpton et al. 2013).
Such a situation is hardly a surprise, however: even in the United States and the United
Kingdom the nutrition content of nurses’ and medical doctors’ training is considered outdated
and inadequate. Very often, health staff are also inequitably distributed; shortages and
inappropriate skill-mixes are especially common at lower levels of the system. In most countries
studied, there isn’t the dedicated workforce available (in the health system especially) with the
required competencies or time to provide the outreach needed to facilitate community-based
nutrition services. Indeed, most donor-funded efforts to support community-based nutrition
programs use NGOs rather than formal health system capacity to reach their short-term
objectives. Given the many constraints to hiring and training government workers, the NGO
community has an important role in taking proven nutrition actions to scale.
Efforts to improve nutrition capacity need to provide support to frontline health workers
and volunteers who encounter the DBM at the individual and household level. Globally,
health professionals are ill equipped to treat obesity and associated chronic diseases. In many
LMICs, education has focused on the prevention of undernutrition, and there is a need to
strengthen the knowledge of health professionals regarding the prevention and treatment of
obesity (Dietz et al. 2015). Nearly a decade ago, Dewey (2006) presented to the UN Standing
Committee on Nutrition, recommendations on actions needed at the individual and family levels
to mitigate the DBM. 10 Strengthening DBM capacity will require increased investments in the




10. The key actions include (1) prioritize food and care for pregnant and lactating women and their infants; (2)
breastfeed exclusively for six months and continue breastfeeding for two years or more; (3) follow guidelines for
complementary feeding and care practices for infants and young children; and (4) emphasize food group diversity,
responsive feeding and eating, and adequate physical activity throughout the life cycle.


                                                        46
curricula of national nutrition institutes to allow them the flexibility to adapt their professional
training to include shifting nutrition burdens. Across all cadres, DBM messages needed to be
integrated into on-the-job and workforce development trainings to refresh the skills of current
practitioners. Frontline community health workers (CHWs) have the potential to improve
population health, extend the reach of health systems, and address both sides of the DBM.
CHWs have been shown to contribute to improved child nutrition, promotion of breastfeeding,
care for acutely malnourished children, reduction of micronutrient deficiencies, and improved
control and reduction of noncommunicable diseases (Perry et al. 2014). In addition to their
technical skills, health and nutrition professionals and volunteers require training in behavior
change communication and motivational interviewing to be able to effectively counsel
individuals on the prevention of overnutrition (Dietz et al. 2015) and undernutrition.
In developing multisectoral approaches to the DBM, countries should not necessarily
seek to develop cadres of nutrition specialists outside the health sector. Championing
nutrition is an unappealing value proposition when nonhealth ministries are asked to invest their
own limited human resources to become technical nutrition specialists. Strong nutrition technical
assistance is required to sensitize nonhealth staff to nutrition and can be combined with careful
consideration of the specific staff roles and responsibilities needed to maximize supply-side
capacity to deliver nutrition-sensitive interventions (Levinson and Balarajan 2013). This issue
has perhaps been most widely considered with regard to the growing demand for nutrition-
sensitive agriculture extension services. Integrating nutrition into agriculture extension and
advisory services has important training and resource considerations in the areas of higher
education, specialist development, and sectoral burden (Fanzo et al. 2013). Countries will have
to assess the existing resources in each sector and harness these appropriately. In Zambia, for
example, the focus of district-level agriculture and nutrition staff cross-trainings are to improve
localized, cross-sectoral understanding and coordination between government agriculture and
health staff, rather than ask these ministries to deliver the other’s specific messages (IFPRI and
Concern Worldwide 2011).
D. Knowledge and Evidence
Enhancing monitoring and evaluation and adapting to the DBM is an enormous priority
and a great opportunity. With the rise of the double burden of malnutrition, program
implementers must do a better job of monitoring changes in nutritional epidemiology and
working with technical advisors to adapt programs accordingly (Garmendia et al. 2013). Nearly
all global nutrition commitments give priority to M&E, albeit with little orientation about how to do
it. Although monitoring and evaluation of undernutrition programs are carried out at different
frequencies and use varied data collection methods, they must all have the same overall logic
(UNICEF 1991). Monitoring checks whether interventions are being implemented properly, it
informs planning and programming, is typically concerned with “inputs” and “outputs” and is
done frequently. Evaluation, on the other hand, identifies if interventions are having the desired
effect and looks at “outcomes” and “impact.” Evaluation is conducted far less frequently,
perhaps once every three to five years. Impact indicators are increasingly included in national
surveys, such as the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS), and to date have mostly considered
MCU risk factors, outcomes, and impacts.
For monitoring and evaluating multisectoral approaches to DBM, overnutrition outcome
and impact indicators and cross-sectoral indicators will need to be included in nutrition
surveys. Indicators of overnutrition, including BMI, waist circumference, adiposity, and


                                                  47
potentially other metabolic syndrome indicators such a blood lipids and blood pressure should
be incorporated, as appropriate. Furthermore, incorporating risk factors for overweight and
obesity—such as those found in the US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the
WHO STEPS—into national household surveys, such as DHS, will allow program managers
and policy makers to better understand country-specific causes of and risk factors for obesity at
the individual level. This information is of growing availability in the PICs but is relatively scarce
in other countries across the region. In working with other sectors, the relevant indicators used
can be incorporated into M&E systems to ensure coherence across sectors (WHO 2013a).
Evaluations of the effectiveness of large-scale nutrition programs are very few and
mostly of poor quality. From the 61 identified large-scale nutrition projects developed in the
last 30 years, just 32 had evaluations that could be extracted, allowing case studies to be
developed for 21 (Mason et al. 2013). Just 11 of these allowed an analysis of the relationships
between outcomes measured (yearly rate of reduction in child underweight), coverage of
interventions, and intensity of resources. The relative effects of individual component
interventions could not be assessed with the data available. Strengthening collaborations
between donors, researchers, and program implementers from the implementation phase can
improve documentation of the impact and effectiveness of large-scale programs.
There is an increasing recognition of the need to shift from an emphasis on monitoring
inputs and outputs (“traditional M&E”) to monitoring outcomes (Adhikari and Bredenkamp
2009). Monitoring outcomes can allow nutrition program managers to understand if their
investments are achieving the expected results. Inputs, outputs and intermediate, real-time
outcomes should be monitored regularly, that is, monthly through supervision at individual or
clinic level. Moving up the system, monitoring becomes more aggregated and less frequent, for
example, quarterly review at the district level, semi-annual review at the regional level, and
yearly at national level. Most often, monitoring data come from the routine reporting via health
monitoring and information systems, drawn from individual health records in the health sector.
To verify this “patient” database, it is common to do cluster surveys at the district level, usually
using randomly chosen clusters of households to interview community members in their
households. These are used almost universally for checking young child immunization rates,
but these cluster surveys—conducted annually at district level—can provide complementary
sources of nutrition outcome and impact information.
To mitigate overweight and obesity, additional tools are needed to monitor the food
environment and promote national accountability. Traditional M&E indicators related to
input, output, outcomes, and impact at the individual level are required. However, tracking
progress on overweight/obesity calls for additional assessments of the policy and infrastructure
components of healthy food environments. A global network of public interest advocates and
researchers, called INFORMAS, has been established (Swinburn et al. 2013) to monitor,
benchmark, and support public and private sector actions to create healthy food environments
and reduce obesity, NCDs, and their related inequalities. INFORMAS has created a framework
(figure 1.6) and tool that can be used to evaluate national implementation of best practices and
provide practical, prioritized recommendations for further government action. These
measurements are needed to establish risk factors for overweight and obesity that move
beyond individual-level food consumption and physical activity choices and include a broad
range of environmental exposures.

A proposal has been developed for a Global Monitoring Framework (GMF) for the
Comprehensive Implementation Plan (CIP) on Maternal, Infant, and Young Child Nutrition
(MIYCN) (WHO 2014c). The GMF has a core set of indicators to be reported on by all countries,
and an extended set of indicators countries can draw upon to design national nutrition surveillance
systems fitting their specific epidemiological patterns and program decisions. Four types of
indicators allow the GMF to monitor the results’ pathway toward the global nutrition targets: (1)
primary outcome indicators that measure progress toward the six global nutrition targets; (2)
intermediate outcome indicators that monitor how specific diseases and conditions on the causal
pathways affect countries’ trends toward the six targets; (3) process indicators that monitor
program- and situation-specific progress; and (4) policy environment and capacity indicators that
measure the political economy and capacity within a country. The GMF contains a wide suite of
indicators for undernutrition, yet the outcome and process indicators for overweight/obesity are
less well defined.

                                    2. SCALING UP INTERVENTIONS
The interventions to tackle the DBM can only achieve impact if they reach scale—a
particular challenge given the dearth of guidance. A 30-year old seminal paper by Myers
(1984) offers the greatest insight, especially in its description of three mechanisms of going to
scale: explosion, association, and expansion. The most effective approach to “scale up” nutrition
interventions (be they nutrition-sensitive or nutrition-specific) to achieve full coverage will
depend on the complexity of delivery of the various interventions.
Scaling up through explosion is for the least complex interventions. This mechanism often
bypasses the pilot stage and goes to scale immediately with one intervention model. This model
can then try to adapt and accommodate to local situations as best possible, but is essentially a
“top-down” process of implementation. Perhaps the best example is mass distribution of vitamin
A capsules during semi-annual child health days, achieving over 80 percent coverage almost
immediately.
Scaling up by association is more linear, and achieved by adding the coverage of several
similar intervention approaches in different areas, gradually modifying or improving
them toward the desired intervention model. More complex nutrition-specific interventions
should be scaled through this more gradual approach. For example, breastfeeding promotion
and counseling for complementary feeding can be improved through the use of standardized
protocols in all health facilities and by improved management, supportive supervision, and
regular refresher training. League tables can be constructed to rank facilities by performance
indicators and can be reviewed at periodic regional meetings. The best-performing facilities can
serve as models, where staff from other facilities can receive refresher courses. Such an
approach can be implemented in all districts simultaneously, although it will require some time
before results are visible.
Going to scale through expansion is best suited to the most complex interventions, often
involving various sectors acting together. This typically involves starting small in a pilot
project and building the intervention model based on local conditions and then growing
incrementally, learning by doing, and adjusting as expanding, The nutrition-sensitive
interventions developed through agriculture, education, and social protection sectors are likely
to be the most complex, especially if they are to be coordinated with other sector interventions
at the district level and below. For this reason, these integrated multisectoral approaches are
better scaled up slowly to begin with, and should be monitored and evaluated very closely.
The Nepal Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Plan (MSNP) provides an example of how to scale up
multisectoral nutrition programs through these three approaches (Shrimpton et al. 2014).
The various sectoral packages of interventions provided through health, WASH, agriculture, and
education are all being taken to scale independently in a top-down fashion in each sector, with
varying numbers of districts. Six districts have been chosen for the initial process of
convergence; over five years, the number of districts will be expanded to reach 72 total districts.

The Ministry of Home Affairs, which provides support to local governments, is responsible for
bringing together the sectoral inputs.
                                  3. PROMOTING BEHAVIOR CHANGE
Changing behaviors is critical for nutrition improvement (for both undernutrition and
overnutrition) and an opportunity for meaningful cross-sectoral collaboration. The
traditional approaches to behavior change have relied predominantly on conscious mechanisms
such as education and personal responsibility. The sector concerned provides the information,
be it through posters or labels on food packages, and relies on the public to internalize the
information and make their own personal choices. These choices vary widely across the
spectrum of over- and undernutrition, including, for example, for a mother to exclusively
breastfeed a newborn baby; for a child not to drink sugary soft drinks; or for an adult to take a
brisk walk for 20 minutes each day.
The MGI report (Dobbs et al. 2014) developed a behavioral change framework with four
types of mechanisms: inform, enable, motivate, and influence.
   •   The inform mechanism not only deals with the availability of information, but also its
       “architecture” or how it is made available. Food labels, for example, can be color-coded
       like traffic signals to ease comprehension, and medical doctors can make it clear to their
       patients that unless weight is lost, the risks of diabetes or a heart attack are greatly
       increased.
   •   The enable component relates to ensuring options for behavior change are available.
       “Enabling” can refer to practices such as providing healthy food options on a canteen
       menu, and enacting the practice of “rooming in” in maternity homes—allowing newborn
       babies to stay with their mothers so they are breastfed and not bottle fed by a nurse.
       Another example is making available spaces to walk or take exercise, such as a park or a
       gymnasium.
   •   The motivate component concerns encouraging individuals to consciously change their
       behavior, be it by setting personal goals or through group commitments (such as in Weight
       Watchers), and even through material incentives from employers for adopting healthy
       behaviors.
   •   The influence component encompasses the choice architecture, which includes changing
       (or reducing) portion sizes of unhealthy foods and relative pricing (taxes) on such foods.
       The practice of “priming” is a part of “influence.” Priming includes associating certain foods
       with children’s favorite cartoon characters and creating “social norms” whereby certain
       behavioral choices are portrayed as being “cool” by famous sport stars and celebrities, for
       example.

                                    VI. CASE STUDIES

There are no case studies of “successful” multisectoral programs that have prevented or
mitigated the DBM. Latin American countries have devoted considerably more time and
attention to the nutrition transition and the DBM than those in EAP; however, a recent
symposium on the DBM in Latin American indicates that those responsible for public health
nutrition continue to struggle to coordinate existing MCU interventions with policies and
programs to curb overweight/obesity (Rivera et al. 2014).


                                                51
Prior studies of malnutrition and multisectorality cover distinct facets of these issues.
Nearly a decade ago, FAO (2006) pioneered case studies of the DBM in six developing
countries (China, Egypt, India, Mexico, the Philippines, and South Africa). These case studies
described the problem but not programs to tackle DBM. The World Bank carried out an
assessment of the DBM in Indonesia (Shrimpton and Rokx 2013), as well as a study of the
successful Thailand National Nutrition Programme (Heaver and Kachondam 2002). Studies of
multisectoral nutrition approaches for tackling MCU have included case studies from Senegal
and Colombia (Garret and Natalicchio 2011) as well as Peru, Brazil, and Bangladesh (Levinson
and Balarajan 2012). The description of population-based approaches to childhood obesity
prevention (WHO 2012) featured a childhood obesity prevention approach from France.
This section draws on various sources to construct a picture of how different sectors
have contributed to resolving nutrition problems in specific country situations. The
development of multisectoral nutrition approaches in four countries is summarized in table 1.12.
Three of these (Indonesia, Thailand, and Brazil) have large-scale multisectoral nutrition
programs that have been constructed over the last few decades to tackle MCU principally, while
the fourth country (France) is the first example of a country that is taking to scale a multisectoral
approach to tackling overweight and obesity.

                                             A. INDONESIA
The “National Movement to Accelerate the Reduction in Undernutrition in Indonesia
during the First 1,000 Days of Life” (1,000 HPK), is the SUN movement in Indonesia and
was launched by the president in 2013. The goals of the 1,000 HPK are the six CIP targets
for 2025. Nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions are delivered by health,
education, social welfare, family planning, and public works sectors, among others, under the
guidance of the national social sector coordinating body (Menko Kesra) and national Ministry of
Planning (Bappenas). Guided by a policy framework (Menko Kesra 2012) and implementation
guidelines, the 1,000 HPK articulates the broad roles of key sectors and stakeholders in the
nationwide effort to improve maternal and child nutrition. Capacity and coordination
mechanisms of nutrition programs at district level are weak, especially since the responsibility
for delivery of social services was decentralized to the district level in 2000 (WHO 2010b). In
consequence, although the provinces and districts are encouraged to ensure that their food and
nutrition plans reflect the contributions of all key sectors to stunting reduction, and all 33
provinces have food and nutrition plans, only 10 percent of districts have done so.
The principal delivery platform of the 1,000 HPK is the Posyandu: the community health
and nutrition post. The Family Welfare Movement, Pemberdayaan Kesejahteraan Keluarga,
(PKK), sponsored by the Ministry of Home Affairs through the village council, runs the
Posyandu. The Posyandu cadre was initially developed by the Family Nutrition Improvement
Program (UPGK) implemented from 1975 to 1990 across Indonesia. Using 56,000 Posyandu
posts, this program reached some 17 million children (80 percent) (Jennings et al. 1991). The
UPGK saw the virtual elimination of severe protein-energy malnutrition (as it was then called).
After 1990, the Community Health and Nutrition (CHN) program changed the orientation of
Posyandu to nutrition counseling instead of growth monitoring to detect severe undernutrition.
CHN received World Bank funding but was only developed in five focus provinces; it struggled
with issues of decentralization, and couldn’t be properly evaluated (World Bank 2001).
The first National Action Plan for Food and Nutrition (RANPG) was developed for 2001–05
to meet Indonesia’s national commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)


                                                                             54
and especially the MDG for poverty reduction, which included nutrition targets. RANPG
conceptualization included five pillars (community nutrition, food access, food safety and quality,
clean and healthy behaviors, and food and nutrition institutions) largely following the structure
for national nutrition programs as agreed at the First International Conference on Nutrition
(ICN1) in Rome (WHO and FAO 1992). The RANPG 2011–2015 contains a situation analysis
that is organized according to the five pillars of ICN1, which are also the five strategies of the
plan. An analysis of the proposed activities shows just how “food-biased” the plan is. Of
approximately 100 indicators listed for the various activities, community nutrition has 18 percent,
food access has 59 percent, food quality and safety 11 percent, and clean and healthy lifestyles
also 11 percent, and food and nutrition institutions 9 percent.
Since 2000, central ministerial-level and donor support has largely focused on selected
districts. The 1,000 HPK is now concentrating in 64 districts in 11 provinces. In these districts,
the Health, Family Planning, Social Welfare, Home Affairs, Public Works, and Agriculture
Ministries are collaborating in a variety of ways through district-level local governments. The
Ministry of Health is supporting the delivery of counseling on maternal, infant, and young child
feeding, both by PKK volunteers at Posyandu as well as in health clinics, together with the
delivery of vitamin A capsules, iron tablets, Sprinkles, and deworming. Conditional cash
transfers are being tested in two districts of two provinces, targeted at the poorest households
and linked to education and health service conditionality (World Bank 2012c). Block grants are
being provided to village councils in the rural areas of five provinces through the National
Community Empowerment Program—Health and Smart Generation (PNPM Generasi). The
Generasi program uses a facilitated community decision-making process to allocate block grant
funds to target 12 health and education indicators. Communities work with facilitators, as well as
health and education service providers, to improve access to and use of health and education
services.
Although national stunting levels are hardly decreasing, with about a third of young
children affected, there is evidence of greater improvements in the selected areas of
1,000 HPK. After 30 months of implementation, Generasi had a positive impact on all 12 health
and education indicators it was designed to address. Moreover, the program has reduced
stunting by 10 percent compared to controls (Olken et al. 2011). Generasi has the potential to
become even more effective with the likely inclusion of water and sanitation targets in the
expansion of Generasi community block grants program, currently supported in the 64 districts
through Millennium Challenge Corporation funding. Some attention to the problem of young
child overweight and obesity is needed, however, as the prevalence in children under-five is
already 12 percent (DEPKES 2013), which is greater than many developed countries.
                                           B. THAILAND
Since its inception in the early 1990s, the National Nutrition Programme (NNP) was
framed as part of the National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP). The
NESDP aimed at ensuring “basic minimum needs” (BMN) were met for all of the population, and
a set of indicators for seven basic sets of needs (including Food and Nutrition, Health and
Education, Housing and Sanitation, Family Planning, and Participation) was used to link national
financial commitments to improvement in these indicators. Nutrition was thus made a
development priority and an investment in the country’s future rather than just a welfare
expenditure. No single agency was the lead for the NNP, and a National Nutrition Committee



                                                55
chaired by the deputy prime minister was established. In addition, a National Nutrition Institute
was created in the University of Mahidol (INMU) to act as technical support and to facilitate
capacity building (Heaver and Kachondam 2002). Managing the NNP through a series of
committees rather than by a single agency encouraged a wide variety of interest groups to feel
that nutrition was their business. Even the National Nutrition Committee moved between
departments without affecting the program. Using national nutrition investment plans (rather
than policy statements unlinked to resource commitments) helped generate a national vision of
what needed to be done, with each implementing agency fully aware of its responsibilities.
Key sectors included the Ministries of Health, Education, Agriculture, and Interior, and
the University Bureau. Through the Ministries of Health and Interior there was massive
community mobilization across the country as part of the primary health care program, which
involved three pillars, namely community manpower, organization, and financing (Jennings et al.
1991; Tontisirin and Winichagoon 1999). Communities were involved in assessing BMN, as well
as planning to improve these by committing their own resources to supplement earmarked
central government funds. Poverty alleviation funds were also targeted at the poorest areas in
the form of income and employment generation projects. Community manpower was provided
through a nationwide system of village health communicators (VHCs) and village health
volunteers (VHVs), with ratios of 1 VHC to 100 to 200 households, and 1 VHV to 10 VHCs.
Local government personnel—from the health or agriculture sector—used centrally produced
materials to train volunteers on a yearly basis. Community volunteer activities included growth
monitoring and promotion, with quarterly sessions linked with mass distribution of vitamin A
capsules and deworming. Children with inadequate growth were given supplementary feeding,
including food coupons. The volunteers also encouraged mothers to receive regular antenatal
check-ups and promoted health and nutrition behaviors such as adequate breastfeeding and
complementary feeding, children immunization, as well as use of oral rehydration salts. In
addition to the primary health care program, local authorities also had to plan to improve primary
and secondary education coverage as well as clean water and sanitation coverage. The school
nutrition program included school lunches, food production, nutrition education, and maternal
literacy campaigns. Home and community food production was also supported and linked to
improving the complementary feeding practices.
The NNP was very successful at improving child undernutrition, such that severe
malnutrition was eliminated and underweight in preschool children reduced from 51
percent in 1980 to 20 percent in 1990, and below 10 percent in 2006 (Chavasit et al. 2013).
There were no formal evaluations of the NNP, so it is neither possible to attribute impact nor
identify program components as most important, yet there is no doubt of its important
contribution to success. The management information system of the NNP was based on the
successive aggregation of the BMN package of indicators from village to district to province
level (Tontisirin and Winichagoon 1999). Central resource allocation was linked to provincial-
level BMN indicators, which included nutrition. Provincial committees chaired by governors and
consisting of sectoral representatives convened meetings for the annual planning of each
province based on BMN indicators. Thailand now has a DBM problem, however, as
undernutrition hasn’t been completely dealt with and overnutrition has become established
(Winichagoon 2014). While low birthweight and stunting rates are lower than in the past, they
still are at approximately 10 percent; issues related to teenage pregnancy, micronutrient
deficiencies (iron and iodine), and insufficient breastfeeding are likely causes. Obesity and

overweight are already affecting about 33 percent of adults and nearly 10 percent of young
children.
Obesity and NCDs were included in the 10th NESDP in 2009. In 2010, the National Food
Committee, chaired by the prime minister, developed the Strategic Framework for Food
Management in Thailand (SFFM). The SFFM is currently implemented through three
committees: (1) Food Security throughout the Food Chain; (2) Food Quality and Safety; and (3)
Linking Food, Nutrition, and Health. This last committee addresses NCDs as a priority issue.
The current strategies under the National Food Committee are comprehensive. They focus on
the links among agriculture, food, nutrition, and health with the ultimate goal of achieving food
and nutrition security and prosperity for the country. It is early to say whether there are any
positive results of these initiatives, but efforts to control marketing of processed foods, for
example, have not yet been effective, and food labeling is not well established. Added sugar
was found to be 13.8 percent of total dietary energy intake among Thai adolescents, and 60
percent of this came from sugar-sweetened beverages (Promdee et al. 2007). Thai Health
Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth) has also begun to focus on food and nutrition issues.
ThaiHealth is funded entirely from a dedicated 2 percent additional tax on the sale of tobacco
and alcohol. ThaiHealth’s main focus has been on reducing alcohol and tobacco consumption
as well as reducing road accidents, while additional activities include the promotion of exercise
and efforts to reduce dietary health risks. ThaiHealth has worked in cooperation with the Office
of the Basic Education Commission to inform participating schools that abstaining from one
bottle of carbonated beverage a day for one month would reduce a child’s weight by one
kilogram. Other evidence shows that schools that did not sell carbonated beverages reduced
consumption of carbonated beverages per child sevenfold, compared to schools that sold
carbonated beverages. The campaign was effective, and in 2008 all schools became
carbonated beverage free (Galbally et al. 2012).
                                                C. BRAZIL
The Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP) is part of the Brazilian National Food and Nutrition
Security System (SISAN), which has evolved over the last two decades to become a very
effective large-scale multisectoral nutrition program. The principal sectors participating in
SISAN include the Ministries of Social Development, Health, and Education. At national level
SISAN is overseen by the National Council on Food and Nutrition Security (CONSEA).
CONSEA is a deliberative body that is linked to the President’s Office; two-thirds of its members
represent civil society. Coordination and implementation of SISAN is carried out by an
interministerial chamber on food and nutrition security (CAISAN), which is located in the Ministry
of Social Development (Chmielewska and Souza 2011). The BFP targets mothers and children
of poor families across Brazil, and had some 12 million families and 48 million beneficiaries in
2010 (Lindert et al. 2007). BFP conditionalities stipulate either school attendance for children
age 5 to 18 or regular health check-ups for mothers and their children under five years of age.
At the municipal level, councils and committees oversee the conditionality requirements of BFP,
with the creation of registries of poor families (“cadastro unico”), which is required for a family to
become BFP beneficiaries.
The delivery platforms at the municipal level are family grants that are dispensed through
the banking system, based on the family’s participation in the cadastro unico. The
conditionality of the BFP as related to the health system includes regular pre- and postnatal
care, growth monitoring, immunization, and participation in nutrition education seminars. These



                                                 57
services are provided largely through the Family Health Programme (Programa de Saude da
Famila or PSF) of the Ministry of Health. Together, a doctor, nurse, nurse auxiliary, and four to
six community health workers (CHWs) comprise a multidisciplinary family health support team
working in health units in defined geographic areas covering no more than 5000 residents
(Harris and Haines 2010). There are some 250,000 CHWs. These CHWs must live in the area
where they work, are responsible for up to 120 families in a defined area, and conduct home
visits to each family once a month. The PSF provides primary care services in 95 percent of all
5,564 municipalities, covering 55 percent of the population or some 85 million people. Coverage
of PSF is not universal as it targets poorer areas. Most recently the PSF has included a
nutritionist in the family health support teams to strengthen nutrition capacity (Jaime et al. 2011).
SISAN also includes the school meal program (Programa Nacional de Alimentaçâo Escolar or
PNAE) through the Ministry of Education, and the Food Acquisition Programme (FAP) through
the Ministry of Social Development. There is a requirement that 30 percent of food used in
schools be locally produced; the Ministry of Agriculture oversees the production, with funds
transferred to municipal governments. The FAP focuses primarily on small farm families, gives
special attention to native fruits, and places a high premium on diversified production and
consumption by small producer families. School meals are required to be healthy, incorporating
fruits and vegetables produced by local farmers, and minimizing the use of ultra-processed
foods.
The interventions delivered through the various delivery platforms of SISAN including
the BFP, PSF, FAP, and PNAE are largely targeted at mothers and their children in poor
families. The BFP monthly cash transfers range from US$7 to US$45 per family depending on
eligibility (very poor or moderately poor). The health conditionality means that BFP beneficiaries
will most likely be PSF clients. The PSF CHWs’ primary concern is maternal and child health:
they provide counseling on maternal, infant, and young child feeding; ensure adherence to
micronutrient supplementation and immunization; and provide guidance on oral rehydration in
the treatment of diarrhea. Increasingly CHWs are involved in curative care, triage, referral to the
health unit, and health promotion for chronic diseases.
Impact of the various component parts of SISAN has been quite remarkable in the last
decade. The BFP contributed to poverty reduction with those on less than US$1.25 a day
falling from 25.6 percent in 1990 to 4.8 percent in 2008. Estimates are that BFP contributed
about 35 percent in the reduction of the extreme poverty gap. Although there is limited rigorous
evidence that BFP improved nutrition outcomes (Martins et al. 2013), there is considerable
ecological evidence that BFP contributed to national-level reductions. National stunting rates in
young children fell from 37.1 percent in 1974–75 to 7.1 percent in 2006–07, with the steepest
decline in the last 10 years of that period (Monteiro et al. 2010). In the northeast of Brazil, the
prevalence of child undernutrition fell by one-third between 1986 and 1996 and by three-
quarters between 1996 and 2006 (Lima et al. 2010). The improvements in the first period were
associated largely with improvements in maternal schooling and in water and sanitation
coverage, whereas in the second period increasing purchasing power of poorer families as well
as maternal schooling were the strongest associations. Quite remarkably the median duration of
breastfeeding in Brazil increased from 2.5 months in 1970 to 14.0 months in 2006–07 (Victora et
al. 2011). Furthermore, it seems likely that PSF has also contributed to the dramatic decreases
in Brazil’s infant mortality in the last few decades (Aquino et al. 2009).




                                                 58
The challenge facing SISAN now is to control increases in overweight and obesity. Half of
the adult population is overweight and obese, and the prevalence of excess weight is now three
times greater than that of undernutrition (Conde and Monteiro 2014). An intersectoral strategy
for obesity prevention and control has been developed (CAISAN 2014), and municipalities will
be progressively supported to implement these interventions through the component parts of
SISAN. The strategy has six components, namely: (1) increasing the availability and access to
appropriate healthy food (fruits and vegetables); (2) education, communication, and information,
with a “Reference Framework for Food and Nutrition Education” and a “Food Guide” providing
guidance; (3) promotion of healthy lifestyles though schools or the workplace, with healthy
menus and opportunities for physical exercise; (4) food and nutrition surveillance; (5)
comprehensive health care for the obese and overweight; and (6) regulation and control of food
quality and safety, including marketing. It is still early to know whether the strategy will be
effective, but there is already evidence that the PSF is contributing to the control of
cerebrovascular and heart diseases (Rasella et al. 2014).




                                           D. FRANCE
The “Ensemble Prévenons l'Obésité Des Enfants” (EPODE) was first developed in France
in 2003 to reduce the prevalence of obesity in children under 12 years of age. The
institutional arrangements in EPODE include central coordination in the Ministry of Health in
Paris, which liaises with the office of the Mayor in the participating cities and includes a local
project manager and a collaborating local steering committee. EPODE is a large-scale,
coordinated, capacity-building approach for communities to implement effective and sustainable
strategies to prevent childhood obesity (Borys et al. 2011).
EPODE is designed to involve all relevant local stakeholders in an integrated and
concrete prevention program that facilitates the adoption of healthier lifestyles in
everyday life (Van Koperen et al. 2013). The delivery platforms include local crèches, health
clinics, sports facilities, cultural associations, supermarkets, restaurants, school catering
services, school recreation facilities, and local parks and gymnasiums. The activities developed
and supported include advocacy and social mobilization through local media campaigns, and
capacity building and coaching of local actors, as well as monitoring and evaluation of these
activities.
The sale of sugary soft drinks and vending machines were also banned in all schools
across France. A tax on sugary soft drinks was introduced in 2012, leading companies to make
demands at the EU for evidence of the impact of such taxes. The resulting study found that food
taxes achieve a reduction in the consumption of the taxed products and, in some cases, product
reformulation to reduce sugar, salt, and fat levels of the product. The study also found that
product substitution takes place, both through an increase in the consumption of cheaper
brands as well as of nontaxed or less-taxed product substitutes. However, the extent to which
such changes in consumption lead to public health improvements is still considered inconclusive
(Ecorys 2014).

The initial evaluations of the first 10 EPODE cities have produced encouraging results
with 10 to 20 percent reductions in child obesity prevalence (Romon et al. 2009). EPODE
now extends to nearly 1.8 million inhabitants in 167 French cities, 20 cities in Spain, and 8 cities
in Belgium. In June the first EPODE Mayors’ Club European Congress was held. Success to
date is measured by a large field mobilization in the pilot cities and by the encouraging evolution
of the BMI of children in pilot cities in France (European Public Health Alliance 2014).

                VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The countries within the EAP region are extremely heterogeneous with regard to both the
causes of malnutrition, as well as the specific burdens of malnutrition which
predominate at the population level. The particularities spurring the rise of the DBM in EAP
are largely the same as those in other regions, but they also vary considerably across EAP
countries. Gender roles seem important in many countries, with low completion of secondary
school by girls as well as high teenage pregnancy rates in many Pacific as well as East Asian
countries. Many of the Pacific Island countries are small island states with good income from
tourism industries, but very little local food production, leaving them dependent on imported
foods, which is usually cheap due to subsidies in the country of origin. But many other causes
are also surprisingly high, including open defecation in many East Asia and Pacific countries.
One common issue affecting all EAP countries is a total lack of recognition of the problem.
Malnutrition is understood as acute malnutrition (kwashiorkor or marasmus), which has largely
receded, but there is little or no apprehension of the importance of stunting, much less that the
harmful effects of overweight and obesity are already present with BMI >22. Thus the DBM is
largely an unperceived problem. There are very few countries globally that have established
effective interventions either for overweight alone or the DBM, and as such lessons learned will
need to be constructed locally, drawing on global policy guidance and lessons from global
literature as it emerges.
The double burden of malnutrition (DBM) is increasingly affecting EAP, with overnutrition
increasing faster than undernutrition is decreasing. The region’s strong economic growth
contributed to reductions in undernutrition that were largely unmaintained after the turn of the
21st century. Without targeted, large-scale platforms to address the immediate and underlying
determinants of undernutrition, young child stunting and/or low birthweight persist, commonly
affecting between 10 and 40 percent of young children. On the other hand, overweight and
obesity are affecting over half of adults in a number of countries. Thus, most EAP countries now
have a DBM problem. The causes of this DBM are multiple and stretch across the life course,
with early undernutrition causing increased risk of overnutrition later in the life course. Infections
and food shortages, poor caring practices and unequal access to health services, low maternal
health and early childbearing, and poor hygiene and sanitation services contribute to the burden
of MCU. Simultaneously, unhealthy and processed foods pervade food environments across the
region, contributing to an overnutrition burden caused as much by inadequate quality of diets as
excess consumption and insufficient physical activity later in the life course.
These multifaceted determinants indicate that tackling the DBM problem demands a
multisectoral response involving many sectors beyond health. The first priority should be
to ensure optimal young child growth from conception to two years of age. This requires
concerted effort from the health, education, agriculture, industry, social protection, and water
and sanitation sectors; their priority actions—while well-documented—deserve reiteration. The
health sector must ensure that low birthweight rates are brought down by improved antenatal
care and that infant feeding practices are improved through better postnatal and well-child care.
The education sector should ensure that adolescent girls remain in school until 18 years and are
prepared for parenthood prior to leaving school. The agriculture sector should support women
farmers, encouraging the production of nutrient-rich foods for home consumption as well as for
market. The water and sanitation sector should seek to control gastrointestinal and diarrheal


                                                 61
diseases especially, and among young mothers and their infants in particular. The social
protection sector should look to link cash transfers to household with poor families and young
mothers especially, with health and education promotion where feasible.
However, tackling stunting during the first 1,000 days is not enough to mitigate the DBM:
much must also be done across the life course to prevent overweight and obesity from
escalating before and into adulthood. As no single sector alone can solve the problem of
undernutrition, neither can health-centric interventions reverse the growing trend of
overnutrition. Multiple sector contributions are needed, and necessary actions range from
higher-level policies to creating supportive community environments and supporting individuals
to change their behaviors. National-level political support—through taxation, regulation, and/or
subsidization—is necessary to ensure social environments that support healthy decisions as the
default. Interventions are needed beyond the realms of “self will” to ensure that physical activity
is facilitated and easily available and access to quality diets is affordable, and that unhealthy
products and habits are not promoted through the media. The education sector has an
important role to play in nurturing the development of children who graduate from school with
adequate life skills and appropriate habits that help them avoid these risks in adulthood. The
health sector, particularly in EAP countries, needs to do more to deliver the messages and
screening that can contribute to primary and secondary prevention, particularly for adults.
In considering these sectoral actions, a number of important themes emerge. The health
sector has an important role to play in monitoring health and nutrition outcomes, preventing and
treating the infectious and noncommunicable diseases associated with malnutrition, and
providing interventions that can affect individuals’ nutrient intakes. However, the nonhealth
sectors play an important role in delivering interventions related to the underlying and basic
causes of malnutrition. As the scope of interventions broadens, a number of considerations can
enhance the ability of nutrition-sensitive interventions to achieve impact on nutrition outcomes.
These include improved targeting, use of conditions to improve participation; addition of strong
nutrition goals, actions, and indicators; and prioritization of women’s health, social status,
access to resources and empowerment, and time allocation (Ruel et al. 2013). It also becomes
clear that nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions aimed at individuals and
households are essential, but that there are policy levers that nonhealth sectors can utilize to
contribute to improved nutrition without directly intervening at the individual level.

To achieve these interventions across the life course, multisectoral approaches with
effective coordination and accountability mechanisms are needed. Many EAP countries
have developed national nutrition policies and plans of action that focus on MCU. In their next
iterations, these policies must be leveraged to guide a response to malnutrition that is
coordinated not only across sectors, but also in response to both burdens of malnutrition. In a
centralized sectoral system, this coordination should be at the supra-ministerial level, guided by
an agreed multisectoral framework for action, and with high-level political support. In the
growing number of decentralized government systems in the region, coordination mechanisms
need to be created at the local government level, and local mayors or chiefs encouraged to
become champions. Experience in developing such centralized approaches is already available
through the SUN movement, and many EAP countries are already collaborating in such efforts
to tackle young child stunting (MCU). Where appropriate, the plans and interventions need to be
broadened to include overweight/obesity. Coordination is especially important for planning and



                                                62
committing funds, so that sectors can get on with implementation to achieve their agreed
sectoral responsibilities. Both Brazil and Thailand controlled MCU with their own national
funding rather than by relying on donor support.


Efforts to create such multisectoral approaches to tackle MCU should initially be focused
and convergent in a few selected districts with encouragement for local leaders to take
up the challenge. Convergence requires special effort at the local government level.
Considerable external support will be needed initially for capacity building and to construct
monitoring and evaluation tools; experience, once it is gained, can be spread—again with
considerable external support. Experience from Brazil and Thailand showed that linking the
transfer of earmarked sectoral funds from central to local government level for sectors to
implement, together with local government funds, helped ensure local-level implementation.
Linking social protection through conditional cash transfers together with primary health care
through community-based workers, and education completion in local schools helped ensure
the convergence of effort and acceleration of impact. Targeting the most poverty-affected
districts and households meant that universal convergence of all sector inputs is not needed, so
effort and resources can be economized.
Multisectoral approaches for tackling the overweight and obesity dimensions of the DBM
are still in their infancy, but early experience from France suggests that issues of
coordination are the same, and that local government plays a critical role in driving
efficiency and results. For many EAP countries, external support will be necessary to build
local capacity to construct plans that tackle the problem. Where undernutrition still persists, the
first priority is tackling MCU during the critical 1,000-day period from conception to two years of
age. However, local plans need to consider the importance of both sides of malnutrition within
the community; where community nutrition outreach exists, these efforts can become more
relevant to the DBM by strengthening the delivery of nutrition messages across the life course.
The Thai Ministry of Health is expanding a successful initiative to employ community volunteers
to address MCU so that their work includes collaboration with subdistrict hospitals to promote
health and nutrition extending from antenatal care to elderly populations. But tackling
overweight and obesity essentially requires prevention during childhood and adolescence, and
for this the school is the priority setting. Ensuring that all school meals are healthy, and that
children learn the importance of healthy eating and good nutrition in the classroom while also
getting sufficient exercise has to become universalized across communities.
The double burden of malnutrition adds complexity to the work of public health nutrition
researchers, policy makers, and program designers, which cannot be addressed without
adequate monitoring, evaluation, and effectiveness data. As practitioners begin to identify
the existence of the DBM in EAP, representative data (ideally at the district level) will allow
characterization of the burdens of malnutrition and their distribution at the national, household,
and/or individual levels. Understanding the shifting burdens of malnutrition will require that
monitoring and evaluation systems adapt to capture indicators of programmatic impact on both
undernutrition and overnutrition at the individual level. Furthermore, countries need to monitor
policies and programs that promote a healthy food environment. These M&E systems are
desperately needed and will allow decision makers to incorporate country-specific distributions
into the design of nutrition interventions. To that end, further research is needed (1) to identify



                                                63
efficacious interventions that promote healthy (linear) growth without exacerbating
overweight/obesity, and (2) to conduct large-scale evaluations of the programs and policies that
incorporate these approaches to determine effectiveness. Providing evidence on the costs and
benefits of malnutrition and associated interventions will facilitate policy makers’ ability to
prioritize nutrition intervention.
In taking on the DBM, engagement with the private sector cannot be avoided. Significant
reductions in undernutrition have been achieved with minimal interaction with the private sector.
Unlike undernutrition, the priority interventions for improving diet and preventing obesity are not
found in the health sector. Food production, processing, labeling, marketing, and retailing are all
key aspects of the food environment, which the private sector dominates. Actions in these
areas, so urgently needed to mitigate overnutrition at the population level, will not be possible
without innovation in the approach to the private sector. Private sector preferences for voluntary
measures or self-regulation must be balanced against the need to monitor compliance and use
sanctions to achieve impact. Lessons learned from tobacco regulation and early experiences
with food industry regulation make it apparent that efforts to regulate industry will not go
unchallenged. Working with the private sector can be a particularly polarizing issue for many,
yet it is clear that progress on the DBM will not go far without serious discussion of the
incentives, partnerships, regulations, and other mechanisms that can be brought to the table to
improve the nutritional value of available diets. A proposal for a new Global Convention to
Protect and Promote Healthy Diets was made in May 2014 by Consumers International and the
World Obesity Federation. Its objective is to "protect current and future generations from
avoidable, diet-related ill health by providing a health promoting food environment through a
framework of dietary protection and promotion measures to reduce continually and substantially
the prevalence of diet-related disease.” By committing states to adopt comprehensive food
policies that result in a healthy food environment, the convention would improve transparency in
decision making and favor a greater involvement of people in shaping the food systems they
depend on (De Schutter 2015).
Reducing the DBM is fundamental to sustainable development in EAP. The “1,000 Days”
slogan has been critical in mobilizing civil society, governments, and funders to commit to
reducing child stunting and break the intergenerational cycle of undernutrition in the region. With
the growing double burden of malnutrition in the region, this call to action can be bolstered by a
policy dialogue in which the first 1,000 days serves as a platform for comprehensive nutrition
intervention, rather than the sole point of intervention. Particularly in EAP, there is a need to
shift away from dichotomized policies addressing either undernutrition or overnutrition, and to
develop coherent policies that promote healthy nutrition, addressing malnutrition in all forms for
all life stages. Delivering nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions to individuals will
not be sufficient to mitigate the DBM; critical assessment and intervention is needed to address
the role that food and living environments play in shaping choices and nutritional status.
Breaking the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition is fundamental to sustainable
development in EAP. Good nutrition is fundamentally self-sustaining, with benefits flowing
across one’s own life course and on to the next generation (IFPRI 2014). Action on malnutrition
is imperative: the consequences of this DBM will be catastrophic in EAP countries unless
concerted action is taken soon. Overnutrition threatens to compound the already-significant
social and economic burden of undernutrition. With increasing urbanization and incomes, diet-
and nutrition-related NCDs are escalating, and rates of diabetes, high blood pressure, and high


                                                  64
cholesterol that accompany overweight and obesity are on the rise. Mitigating the problem is an
urgent—but achievable—task. Investing in the prevention of overnutrition and undernutrition is
affordable and offers high rates of return. Failure to develop integrated preventive and curative
interventions for undernutrition and overnutrition—implemented across the life course by
multiple sectors—will place an enormous economic burden on EAP countries and thwart the
potential and prosperity of future generations.

Global trends indicate that overlapping burdens of undernutrition and overnutrition—the double burden of
malnutrition (DBM)—are the new normal (IFPRI 2014); indeed, most East Asia and Pacific (EAP) countries
now have a DBM problem. This report explores the nature of nutrition problems affecting EAP countries to
understand the sectoral and system-wide actions necessary for a coordinated approach to improving
nutrition. The report (i) synthesizes evidence related to the burden of malnutrition in EAP, (ii) identifies the
rationale for a multisectoral approach to DBM practitioners working across sectors in EAP, and (iii) provides
an overview of the types of actions and interventions needed to address the DBM in a coordinated fashion
across the life course. Actions across health and nonhealth sectors—ranging from implementation of
national-level policy measures and complemented by interventions at the community and individual levels to
support behavior change—are needed to prevent escalation of overweight and obesity. Among sectoral
priority actions, the health sector plays an important role in monitoring health and nutrition outcomes,
preventing and treating infectious and noncommunicable diseases associated with malnutrition, and
providing interventions that affect individuals’ nutrient intakes. Similarly nonhealth sectors have expertise and
resources to deliver interventions related to the underlying causes of malnutrition. Further, systems-
strengthening efforts are needed to support an environment that addresses the DBM across the life course,
including increasing DBM-sensitivity of policy frameworks; leadership, coordination, and accountability;
workforce capacity; and knowledge and evidence. Reducing the DBM is fundamental to sustainable
development in EAP. EAP countries must shift from dichotomized policies addressing either undernutrition or
overnutrition and develop coherent frameworks to address malnutrition in all forms for all life stages.
Integrated preventive and curative interventions for undernutrition and overnutrition—implemented across the
life course by multiple sectors—can forestall massive economic and human development consequences for
future generations.
