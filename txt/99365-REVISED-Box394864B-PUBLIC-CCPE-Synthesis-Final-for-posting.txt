The Clustered Country Program Evaluation (Clustered CPE) is a new product
prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) that includes this synthesis
report and four separate country program evaluations of World Bank Group
engagement in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and
Zambia.

This Clustered CPE was led by Konstantin Atanesyan, and was conducted under the
guidance and supervision of Geeta Batra (Manager) and Nick York (Director) and
the overall direction of Caroline Heider (Director-General, Evaluation). Country
program evaluation teams were led by Konstantin Atanesyan (Kazakhstan),
Florence Charlier (Mongolia), Jiro Tominaga (Zambia), and Xiaolun Sun (Bolivia).

Core team members for this synthesis report were Lev Freinkman, Shoghik
Hovhannisyan, Takatoshi Kamezawa, Basil Kavalsky, Andres Liebenthal, Marcelo
Selowsky, Inder Sud, Steven Webb, and Kendra White. Barbara Balaj edited the
report. Corky de Asis and Yasmin Angeles provided administrative support.
William Ascher (Claremont McKenna College), Alan Gelb (Center for Global
Development), and Andrew Warner (International Monetary Fund) were the peer
reviewers for this report.

IEG is grateful to the numerous representatives of the government, private sector
entities, and nongovernmental organizations in Bolivia, Botswana, Chile,

Management Response
World Bank Group Management welcomes this opportunity to respond to the report of
the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) on the Clustered Country Program Evaluation
for Resource-Rich Developing Countries: The Cases of the Plurinational State of
Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Zambia. This clustered country program
evaluation (CCPE)—a new IEG instrument—offers an opportunity to learn lessons from
a group of resource-rich developing countries (RRDC) facing “common challenges” on
how to effectively manage and use natural resources for development.

Bank Group Management appreciates IEG’s undertaking and the general conclusion
that the Bank Group is well positioned and technically equipped to effectively assist
those countries in implementing policies and strengthening institutions for prudent
management of natural resources and revenues derived from their exploitation. The
report recognizes that the focus on revenue management, the broader “resource curse,”
and the volatility of external and internal balances must take precedence.

The CCPE’s comparative perspective provided by this new approach permits
discussions on a diversity of experiences. With respect to all the differences among the
countries included in the cluster, the evaluation provides an opportunity to learn from
each other drawing on parallels in the four countries.

Nevertheless, the countries are so diverse that the findings and lessons learned from
each country’s unique circumstances cannot easily be applied elsewhere. The fact that
each of the four programs evolved in unique ways, despite all being resource-rich
countries, indicates the flexibility of Bank Group programs to tailor support based on
the opportunities and constraints in each country. Although these countries share some
common issues and characteristics, a one-size-fits-all approach does not work. In
general, having a consistent framework for engagement does not imply that similar
solutions can be applied everywhere.

When analyzing the Bank Group strategy in a country, it is always useful to put it in the
context of the client’s own development strategies and priorities as well as political
economy of the country. Country’s ownership and commitment are paramount for
Bank Group engagements to be effective and impactful on the ground. The Bank
Group’s new country engagement framework through the Systematic Country
Diagnostic (SCD) and the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) builds on the Bank
Group’s country-led approach in a more systematic and rigorous manner.

The traditional, individual CPE reports contain valuable insights that may inform the
future partnership frameworks in the four countries. While Bank Group Management

                                                                                           xi
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

recognizes that IEG no longer undertakes single-country CPEs, it believes that dropping
the old CPEs in favor of new CCPE reports in its current form are unlikely to yield the
benefits intended, while leaving a vacuum. The traditional CPEs were perhaps one of
the most-used IEG products among staff and have had significant input into strategic
thinking for new country programs. The intention to extract collective lessons from a
group of countries with common challenges seems to be undermined by the sheer
volume (700 plus pages) of the report, as each country team’s attention is diverted
toward more detailed country reports.

Regarding the report’s assessment that Bank Group coordination between the Bank and
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) was not systematic in the extractive
industry, Management would like to note that the Bank and IFC maintained a joint IFC–
Bank department focusing on extractive industries (known as the “Global Product
Group” department) throughout the majority of the review period. Areas of continued
cooperation have included the multi-donor Extractive Industry Technical Assistance
Facility, external and management reporting functions, regular meetings at the manager
level to align work programs, sector discussions for country diagnostics and strategy
formulation, and pursuit of collaboration across public and private sector stakeholders
in the area of extractive-related infrastructure. On the ground, as described in the
report, Bank Group cooperation has been quite effective—for instance in Mongolia
among the countries reviewed. In the context of the emerging “solutions bank,”
Management expects Bank Group collaboration to continue to strengthen, especially in
the extractive industry.

The report points out that RRDC governments are often pressured to distribute their
resources through broad-based cash transfer programs, which in turn undermines fiscal
sustainability, and thus there is a need for a sustained focus on the poor and vulnerable.
An absence of targeting does not necessarily threaten fiscal sustainability. Broad-based
and nontargeted social protection instruments can be sustainable provided they are
well designed. The Bank is engaged in capacity building in many countries for just this
type of responsible, evidence-based management of universal, social protection
programs. Such policies prevent those who are not poor from slipping into poverty in
the event of balance of payments and other shocks. Hence, reducing the policy advice to
targeted social transfers distorts the true meaning of social protection and the Bank’s
role.

The report could have given attention to the resource dimensions of mining and to
heavy water consumption in the sector. Recent evidence suggests that the mining sector
is among the top five consumers of water. Acknowledging the need for prudent
management of this scarce and valuable resource would be useful, especially in
countries classified as water stressed.

The report suggests that IFC does not have a Resource-Rich Developing Country
strategy. IFC’s approach to RRDCs is guided by the principles from the World Bank
Group Extractive Industries Review (EIR) and is tailored to individual countries
through country strategies. The EIR provides an operating framework for IFC and Bank
Group engagement in RRDCs, with a particular focus on areas such as shared benefits,
transparency and accountability, stakeholder consultation, and environmental and
social safeguards. This was highlighted in a technical briefing to Board members in
FY15.

The IEG report indicates that IFC considers the extractive industry a low-volume
business. The corporation does not view the business in this way as a matter of
principle. While the extractives business in the IFC is lower-volume than financial
markets or other real sector commitments like core infrastructure, the reasons for a
comparatively smaller portfolio include the lumpiness in the business cycle, the high
degree of selectivity in developing client partnerships, and the intensity of resources
required to deliver sustainable and developmental large-scale projects. Over the last
five years, between FY10 and FY14, IFC directly invested $4.2 billion in the extractive
industry, including core mobilization, averaging $835 million financing annually.

The report concludes that IFC generally struggled to do business beyond its main
business line of banking and the financial sector. However, IFC engagement was not
insignificant. Management appreciates IEG’s recognition of IFC’s strong support for the
banking and financial sectors in the four countries. Through these efforts, IFC
strategically and effectively reached diverse real sectors, including smaller players it
otherwise may not have been able to support. IFC also did make investments in
infrastructure in all the four countries, as well as in agribusiness, manufacturing, and
services, whose contributions especially to economic diversification are well captured in
the individual CPEs and were often complemented by advisory projects. In addition,
Management would like to note that IFC’s engagement in the extractive sector is
carefully calibrated to match the risk profile of the countries and projects it invests to
achieve sustainable development. This may preclude it from doing business in certain
environments at particular moments in time.

While the report makes very limited reference to the IFC’s assistance for the Extractive
Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), Management notes that IFC supports the EITI
and promotes the principles of EITI in its projects through the corporation’s
requirements for enhanced transparency and disclosure. As captured in the IFC’s
Sustainability Policy, clients are required to publish payments to government as well as
contracts or material terms governing the development and extraction of resources (a
condition that no other development finance institution has yet adopted). IFC takes into
consideration a country’s engagement in EITI as a proxy for commitment to governance


                                                                                          xiii
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

improvements in a country where it considers investments. Management would like to
note that in post-conflict countries, IFC attaches particular importance to demonstrated
efforts and engagement in EITI as part of IFC’s investment decision.

As the report points out, direct employment generated by the extractive industry is
typically limited. However, indirect and induced job creation can be significant.
Research studies show that mining can stimulate 10 additional jobs for every mining job
created. Also, it is possible to leverage extractive sector investments to create
significantly more jobs in the economy through various interventions. To this end, a key
part of IFC’s strategy for extractive industry projects is to maximize local employment
as well as other socioeconomic benefits. For instance, a 2011 external study on
socioeconomic impact of the IFC-supported Newmont gold mining project in Ghana
found that inter alia, for each direct job created in the mine, another 28 jobs were
supported throughout the economy through direct, indirect, and induced effects. In
Guinea, IFC is currently supporting local supply chain development around a
significant iron ore project development.

Overall, Management finds the report important and useful also in relation to the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and is in broad agreement with the
findings and assessments related to MIGA guarantee investments in the four countries.
In all cases, MIGA-supported projects were consistent with the strategic priorities of the
countries. In particular, MIGA played a key role in the successful privatization of the
largest bank in Mongolia that was fully aligned with the government’s priorities for the
financial sector. MIGA’s involvement and close coordination with other international
development and financial institutions contributed to the success. The Bank’s
successful, pioneering participation in the international capital market had a
demonstrative effect as well as being replicated by two other Mongolian companies.


Country-Specific Comments
PLURINATIONAL STATE OF BOLIVIA CPE (FY05–13)
Given the evolving nature of the World Bank program in Bolivia and the shifting global
trends in terms of oil prices, this CPE is both timely and necessary (World Bank 2015a).
Management agrees with the general economic and political storyline of the report,
particularly on the evolving role of the Bank and with the recommendations on the
need to scale up good practices, particularly in agriculture. Management concurs with
the team’s view that this sector will be one of the important underpinnings to
diversified growth in Bolivia. Overall, the report will provide critical input into the
upcoming CPF preparations in FY16.

                                                                       MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

While the report suggests that inequality of income distribution in Bolivia has not
changed throughout the last decade, the Gini coefficient had declined between circa
2004 and the latest official estimate, from 60 percent in 2002 to 49 percent in 2013.
Contrary to the suggestion in the report, social transfers have had a role, albeit limited,
in the reduction of monetary poverty, in addition to a positive impact in access to
essential health and education services.

While the emphasis of continued support in rural areas with its poor majority is
welcome, the importance of urban development should not be overlooked. The rapid
urbanization in Bolivia should be seen as both an opportunity—as a way out of
poverty—and a challenge because of increasing pressure to deliver quality basic
services in the city.

The role of other international donor agencies seems to be completely absent from the
report. They are key players that define the context of Bank engagements. In this sense,
the ability to expand the advisory services and analytics portfolio, including in less
traditional areas (such as supporting the development of alternative measures of well-
being, rooted in ancestral beliefs), has helped rebuild the relationship with the client,
demonstrating that the Bank can be broader than usually perceived and, eventually,
engage in more politically sensitive domains.

Management agrees with the report on the need to better adapt to the country reality.
During the last 18 to 24 months, IFC has changed the team on the ground and refocused
its strategy, which is showing positive results. Regarding the report’s recommendation
for direct engagement with small and medium enterprises (SMEs), IFC’s experience is
that in most instances small enterprises can be most effectively reached through
financial institutions. This is a model that has proved to be successful in many
countries. As the report states in an appendix, direct SME engagement tends to limit
overall impact because of the lack of scaling up. However, there are cases where direct
engagement with SMEs is warranted, when direct investment is an important means to
spur private sector development. Therefore, IFC does have instruments to provide
small investments such as through SME Ventures and other private equity funds and
selected direct work with small companies. In FY13–14, IFC provided more than 20
such small investments in countries such as Georgia, Haiti, Mongolia, Nepal, Senegal,
Timor-Leste, and Vietnam.

KAZAKHSTAN CPE (FY04–13)
Management notes the report’s timeliness, especially in light of falling oil prices
worldwide and its effect on Kazakhstan’s heavy dependence on hydrocarbon prices.
The analysis is well balanced, and the report fairly acknowledges the achievements that
Kazakhstan has made as well as challenges and limitations of Bank Group engagement


                                                                                          xv

during the reporting period (World Bank 2015b). More explicit recommendations
would have been useful on how to deal with vulnerability of the extractive industries to
external shocks and the consequences of increased vulnerability of the population,
particularly in the most lagging regions.

The report acknowledges that the quality of Bank Group engagement in Kazakhstan is
high. The engagements are also demand driven, characterized by a somewhat unique
scenario where the client has had a history of not borrowing from international financial
institutions for several years. Kazakhstan has become one of the Bank’s largest
borrowers (particularly in the Europe and Central Asia Region) with a potential for
further significant increase.

The report correctly advises strengthening engagement with the client around a
strategic framework for analytical products such as the Joint Economic Research
Program (JERP) but also beyond this demand-driven Reimbursable Advisory Services
(RAS). For example, the EITI can be an important strategy for building partnerships
beyond executive branches of government as a means to include a diverse group of
stakeholders, including civil society, and setting the basis for transparency and
accountability to combat vested interests and corruption.

The report recommends that the Bank should engage civil society and broaden public
understanding of the policies that it promotes. It is important to point out that over the
last couple of years, the Bank has put greater emphasis on citizen engagement activities,
where not only direct beneficiaries are reached but a broader community is involved
and becomes an integral part of project design and implementation. Such an approach
helps build stronger ownership in the community, which consequently contributes to
its greater sustainability.

The references to social protection and labor program in Kazakhstan did not include the
most critical elements of the social protection engagement. The only discussion of social
protection in Kazakhstan is on pensions where it acknowledges that JERP was the basis
for involvement. There are no references to the 2009 Poverty Assessment (in fact the
report says there has been no poverty assessment since 2004); the Social Protection
Conditional Cash Transfer JERP, whereby a whole new safety net (Orleu) is being
established; or the BOTA project, which established the BOTA Foundation to improve
the welfare of poor and vulnerable children and youth. BOTA is a good example of
engaging local partners and civil society since all of its programs had tremendous
public outreach.

It is important to recognize the specific nature of RAS and the different client
relationships under RAS as compared to the Bank-financed advisory services and
analytics. While Management agrees that it would be desirable to promote and support

                                                                       MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

open access to data and knowledge products, an approach to disclose all the policy
recommendations provided under the RAS engagements is not feasible. As demand-
driven activities paid for by the client, RAS products are owned by the client and their
disclosure is subject to the client’s consent. Decisions on disclosure are taken on a case-
by-case basis and are highly dependent on the sensitivity of the recommendations
provided. In the context of a demand-driven partnership in an upper-middle-income
country, it is not always possible to link every JERP activity with a follow-up lending
operation.

Management welcomes IEG’s recognition that IFC’s program has been timely and that
it has delivered on the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) objectives in the financial
and the real sectors. However, Management feels the ratings of areas involving IFC do
not fully reflect this. In the financial sector, IFC during the crisis (2008) responded
vigorously with long-term lending targeted at SMEs. In the real sector, IFC provided
support with advisory services in many sectors of the economy. The effort resulted in
some business mandates to work on project analysis. In parallel, IFC actively explored
investment operations in an environment where suitable sponsors were scarce and the
economy dominated by state interests—many attempted projects did not proceed—
mostly because of sponsor issues, high leverage, and low competitiveness. Since 2009,
IFC has significantly increased investment activities in select sectors consistent with its
strategic priorities.

MONGOLIA CPE (FY05–13)
The CPE contains a range of valuable insights and contributes to the guidance of future
programs in Mongolia, including the next Country Partnership Framework (World
Bank 2015c). The Bank’s work on urban poverty, service delivery, land management,
and municipal finance has laid the foundation for a meaningful and potentially
transformative engagement.

Management does not agree with the recommendation to scale back support to the
urban sector. There are few donors actively involved in Mongolia. Some have
significantly scaled down or even closed operations, and others are focused on
investments in limited sectors (for example, transport, roads, and basic infrastructure).

The majority of the population now lives in Ulaanbaatar, and effective governance and
management of the city is a huge challenge of national importance. Moreover,
inequality is growing, and there are also pockets of urban poverty and inequality in
Ulaanbaatar. Recent analysis on household socioeconomic data showed that the Gini
coefficient for Ulaanbaatar is 47.5 percent, highest among all provinces and as high as
the overall national Gini coefficient. Urban governance and management will continue
to face challenges, particularly since the city government is ill-equipped to handle the

rapid expansion that has taken place. Management believes that the upcoming SCD is
the appropriate vehicle for identifying challenges for the Bank Group goals of poverty
reduction and shared prosperity, and the best configuration of Bank support to
Mongolia will be defined in the CPF.

Management welcomes recognition in the CPE of the strong role IFC played in the
financial sector and private sector development. In particular, IFC made significant
efforts to support the banking sector during and post crisis. All the banks IFC-
supported survived the crisis and became top systemic banks post-crisis. With respect
to private sector development, the primary strategy was to increase available access to
finance for the micro, small, and medium enterprise sector, which consists of diverse
industries and is a strong contributor to employment and diversification. Moreover,
over the CPE period, IFC expanded financing to real sectors—targeting projects with
high technology and standards—such as dairy, renewal energy, middle-income
housing, and hotel. As recognized in the report, the Bank Group support helped
forestall system-wide stress in some of the country’s major banks; and in the area of
private sector development, the Bank Group contributed to improved business-
enabling environment as shown in indicators. As the report notes, there is also strong
Bank Group collaboration in the mining sector, which is expected to continue providing
a boost to growth.

ZAMBIA CPE (FY04–13)
Management recognizes that the timely CPE will inform the Performance and Learning
Review and the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) under preparation for Zambia
(World Bank 2015d).

Growth in Zambia has been driven primarily by capital-intensive sectors such as
mining, transport, and construction. This is typical of resource-rich countries especially
during a period of commodity boom. These sectors are focused on productivity growth
(as opposed to employment growth). The lack of growth in labor-intensive sectors such
as manufacturing or agriculture lies at the core of the development challenges in the
country. Productivity improvements in agriculture, diversification into labor-intensive
sectors like manufacturing, and targeted social transfers for the poor remains
fundamental to reducing poverty and addressing inequality in Zambia. During the
evaluation period, the Bank’s engagement in these areas has increased considerably.

The report pays some attention to the Bank’s analytical work and policy dialogue in
these areas. This area has seen a rapid growth during the evaluation period and will
continue to be important going forward. It is true that, despite wide dissemination of
the Bank’s 2012 analytic work on poverty, the poverty assessment has had little traction
(World Bank 2012). Policies get shaped inter alia by a complex interplay of political

                                                                       MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

economy, societal pressures, and fiscal space issues. It would require consistent and
ongoing analysis and dialogue to shape change and one report by itself would not drive
meaningful change. The Bank has followed up the poverty report with further work,
including a poverty mapping exercise, which provides a spatial picture of poverty—this
is likely to generate greater public interest. The Central Statistical Office in Zambia will
continue to be the key partner to monitor poverty in the country, and this engagement
is reflected in Bank support to the latest household survey in Zambia for collecting
poverty data.

The Bank Group’s engagement in Zambia’s mining sector has a long history, which the
report captures to a large extent. What is not sufficiently captured is the progress that
has been made in building trust and moving to a stronger partnership with the client,
which has already started showing benefits in the policy framework for the mining
sector.

Management agrees with IEG that poor design of social transfers can present a
challenge. The recent collaboration between the Bank’s Poverty and Social Protection
teams on better ways of targeting the poor demonstrated the importance of safety nets
reaching those who need them most. The Bank also did a major analytical piece on
social protection and the subsequent dialogue, involving a South–South knowledge
exchange, has been an important factor in the significant increase in budget allocations
for social transfers.

Regarding the evaluation framework for the diversification pillar, Management would
like to clarify that the country assistance strategies for FY04–07 and FY08–12 were not
joint. Especially early in the period, because of limitations in the investment climate, IFC
did not expect to have a very large program in the country. In later years, however, IFC
began to increase its activities. The CPS for FY13–16 is joint for the Bank Group and
covers the last year of the evaluated period.

The report indicates that IFC had no engagements in infrastructure in the country
except public-private partnership advisory work for the Kafue Gorge hydropower
project. Management wishes to clarify that IFC made a long-term investment in a
telecommunications company and invested in a regional agribusiness company that
planned to build commodity warehouses in Zambia. IFC also had two portfolio projects
in the sector during the period. IFC explored other public-private partnership
infrastructure opportunities, but these did not close due to a lack of readiness from the
government and a challenging political environment.

Management believes there was greater Bank Group support for private sector
development in Zambia than acknowledged in the IEG report. IFC and World Bank
work to improve the investment climate significantly reduced the number of business

license requirements and eliminated minimum capital requirements. IFC’s support for
access by micro, small, and medium enterprises to finance included the legal
framework for a new secured transactions law, a web-based registry for movable
property security interests, microfinance support for unbanked borrowers with less
burdensome collateral requirements, and trade finance lines for SMEs via a local bank.
In addition, IFC is working with a mobile network operator to increase access to finance
through mobile financial services.

IFC’s overall strategy in the nonextractive sectors sought to increase support to local
industries, SMEs, farmers, and agricultural infrastructure, and included establishing
partnerships with financial institutions. In agribusiness, IFC assisted Zambeef with two
investments along with an advisory engagement in biosecurity. IFC also worked on a
successful program to support entrepreneurial farmers (which may expand beyond
Zambia), supported regional sponsors that invested in Zambia, and recently closed
another agribusiness transaction. Among other important nonextractive sectors, IFC has
been active in tourism, with four active portfolio projects.

Chairperson’s Summary: Committee on
Development Effectiveness
The Subcommittee welcomed the clustered country program evaluation (CCPE) on
resource-rich developing countries (RRDCs) by the Independent Evaluation Group
and broadly concurred with the evaluation’s conclusions. Members noted the
importance of taking into account the heterogeneity and uniqueness of each
individual country’s development initiatives. They expressed concern with the
conclusion that the demand-driven nature of World Bank Group programs in
RRDCs and client-led selectivity can impose limitations to fulfilling the Bank
Group’s mandate. Members underscored the need for the Bank Group to remain
flexible enough to allow for support to be provided based on opportunities,
constraints, and changing circumstances of each country. They highlighted the
relevance of country ownership and that selectivity should remain country driven.
They stressed the need for a well-balanced use of nonlending and lending
instruments in these countries as well as targeted interventions based on the
countries' capabilities and investment needs in key sectors. Members appreciated
IEG’s clarification that the report does not undermine the demand-driven approach,
but that its purpose is to bring lessons and experiences from other countries, in a
more systematic way, into the country engagement process.

Members noted that the CCPE could strengthen and inform individual Systematic
Country Diagnostics and Country Partnership Frameworks by providing a different
lens and new perspectives through its comparative analysis. They encouraged IEG
and Management to maintain close coordination and communication in order to
make this new learning exercise more effective. Members stressed that the synthesis
report is a useful learning product and could be used for analytical purposes. They
noted that it could help the Bank Group develop new products and a more coherent
strategy to assist RRDCs improve resource mobilization; revenue management;
enhance private sector development; and foster growth and employment in
nonextractive sectors. The Committee highlighted the need for the Bank Group to
strengthen its partnerships with client countries and for the International Finance
Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency to work closer with
the World Bank to achieve a better development impact and improve the Bank
Group’s data metrics and Results Frameworks. They supported the emphasis on
capacity building and sovereign wealth fund creation, but noted that more needed
to be done in the area of benefits’ sharing, particularly in the context of inclusive

Speakers acknowledged the challenges the Bank Group faces to stay relevant and
competitive in RRDCs since the value proposition is no longer financing but rather
knowledge and global experience. They reiterated that if the Bank Group wants to
remain engaged in these countries, it has to respect the country’s selectivity and
ownership. Over time, this may allow the Bank Group to work with client countries
to develop projects and programs that can lead to serve the Bank Group’s goals, as
successfully proven in the case of Kazakhstan. A few observed that for CCPEs to
have value, IEG needs to be very careful about the underlying framework,
cautioning that different starting points lead to possibly different conclusions and
noted that this particular exercise could have benefited from possibly including
more than one factor (other than being resource rich) and/or have more countries in
the cluster. IEG clarified that each country program evaluation was evaluated
individually paying due attention to country specificities and that the framework for
the synthesis analysis was spelled out in the approach paper approved by CODE.

1. Introduction
Background and Context
This synthesis report draws conclusions and summarizes the first Clustered Country
Program Evaluation (clustered CPE) undertaken by the Independent Evaluation Group.
In addition to this overview report, the clustered CPE includes four individual country
program evaluations (CPEs) for Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Zambia, covering
eight to ten years of World Bank Group engagement in these countries. The purpose of
the clustered CPE is to exploit the learning potential of looking across a group of
countries that have one common characteristic (in this case, rich endowment with and
dependence on the extraction of non-renewable natural resources), but that are
otherwise a fairly heterogeneous group in terms of geographic location, income levels,
and depth of dialogue with the World Bank Group. The synthesis report summarizes
the experiences and draws broader lessons across the four countries and the different
models of Bank Group engagement therein. The heterogeneity of the group is
intentional and aims to maximize the learning value of the evaluation product. This
exercise does not intend to compare or benchmark the performance of these four
countries against each other.

A clustered CPE is not a thematic evaluation, and there are important differences
between the two. Whereas the clustered CPE is designed to draw lessons across
countries, it remains an instrument for establishing Bank Group accountability and for
learning from its experience by monitoring the impact of its programs within these
countries. Each CPE in the cluster is a free-standing product that derives lessons for the
coming country strategies, and provides Bank Group shareholders with an independent
assessment of the relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency of Bank Group country
programs. By contrast, a thematic evaluation would normally look at a larger and more
representative sample, and would be intended to illuminate the Bank Group’s global
impact on a particular theme. For thematic evaluations, the country case studies carried
out for this purpose are generally not designed to be independent products.

The effective management and use of natural resources for development has important
impacts on a significant group of Bank Group clients. It relates closely to the Bank
Group’s twin goals of eradicating poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Therefore,
the overarching question that all CPEs included in the cluster were designed to
answer—“How effective and relevant was Bank assistance in helping the countries take
advantage of their endowment with natural resources in a most effective and efficient
manner?”—is relevant for a much larger group of Bank clients. In addition, this is an
issue of great interest to Bank Group shareholders: for instance, the document on


                                                                                         1
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
Special Themes for International Development Association (IDA)-17 stated that:
“Natural resource wealth has the potential to be a game-changer for accelerating
development in IDA countries, although when not well managed it can be a significant
economic stress factor for conflict.”

The World Bank Group does not have a standard definition for resource-richness.
Traditional measures included the share of natural resource exports to gross domestic
product (GDP) and production flows (mostly, oil and mineral extraction). A distinction
is often made between “resource-rich” and “resource-dependent” countries. The term
resource-rich normally refers to available deposits of oil, gas, and minerals below the
ground, which are finite and can be exhausted; whereas the concept of a resource-
dependent country captures the extent to which a country’s economy relies on resource
rents—usually measured in proportion to GDP, exports, or government revenues. For
the purposes of this evaluation, the term resource-rich developing countries (RRDCs)
will refer to the countries that are both endowed with abundant non-renewable natural
resources (hydrocarbons and minerals) and are resource-dependent, that is, they derive
a significant share of their gross national product, exports, and government revenues
from exhaustible resources.


Country Selection
This clustered CPE includes four countries, covering more or less the same period (from
2004–05 to 2012–13), and uses a common analytical framework. The process of country
selection included several stages, and began with an analysis of the full set of RRDCs
(about 50 countries) included in relevant World Bank Group and International
Monetary Fund (IMF) documents. The task team then applied additional criteria, 1
mainly related to the availability of evaluative evidence (presence of a Bank Group
program in the last seven to ten years) and potential value for cross-country learning.
This analysis led to the selection of Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Zambia, and
included the drawing of lessons from the experience in the widely recognized “good
practice” cases of Chile and Botswana.

This selection places a deliberate emphasis on country diversity, aimed at reinforcing
the learning value of this cross-country review, and reflecting on how the Bank
programs in these countries incorporated the particular needs of the clients and helped
them find country-specific solutions to broadly similar challenges. Therefore, additional
parameters applied for the final selection included: (a) global coverage—aiming to
cover as many Bank regions as possible; (b) type of natural resource—including
coverage of mineral-producing countries (Mongolia and Zambia) as well as oil and gas
exporters (Bolivia and Kazakhstan); (c) income diversity—including a broad range of

upper-middle-income (Kazakhstan) economies; IDA, blend, 2 and International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development borrowers; (d) including a combination of varying
degrees of depth of dialogue and engagement modalities with the clients (lending,
technical assistance (TA), reimbursable advisory services, and combinations thereof);
and (e) availability of evaluative material—including fairly recent Country Partnership
Strategy and Completion Reports and project-level evaluations that indicated potential
issues for more in-depth assessments as well as ensuring that there are no overlapping

Analytical Framework and Work Plan
The four CPEs follow a similar organizing framework based on a set of challenges that
arise from high dependency on natural resources, and adjusted to particular features of
the Bank Group program in each country. This synthesis report follows a similar
structure based on this framework and a corresponding set of evaluation questions,
grouping them into the following three categories:


                                                                                                                              3

INTRODUCTION
    •   Management of resources, including addressing risks to macroeconomic and
        fiscal sustainability; and improving governance and institutions for the effective
        use of resources.
    •   Economic diversification and nonextractive growth, including promoting
        growth, job creation, and the entry of the private sector into nonextractive
        sectors.
    •   Inclusive growth, including using revenues from natural resources to reduce
        poverty, build human capital, and address environmental challenges.

The evaluation work was completed in five main phases: (i) concept development,
including a literature review; preparation of the approach paper; thematic and country
desk reviews; (ii) headquarters-based interviews and discussions with Bank staff and
external experts; (iii) field work, including country visits to Bolivia, Botswana, Chile,
Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Zambia; (iv) preparation and internal review of country
reports; and (v) preparation of the consolidated synthesis report.


Report Structure
This report has six chapters including this introductory chapter. Chapter 2 reviews the
World Bank Group strategic approach based on the experience in the four CPE
countries; chapters 3, 4, and 5 summarize the main findings of the evaluative work,
organized around the three themes/pillars as described previously. Chapter 6
summarizes the most important findings derived from the four CPEs.


1The final selection was done on the basis of the following criteria: (i) high levels of resource
dependence for exports or revenues (threshold of 50 percent); (ii) the presence of a diverse Bank
Group program of lending, technical assistance, and analytic work; and (iii) regional
representation and balance.

2. World Bank Group Strategic Approach
Reflecting resource-dependence in World Bank Group country strategies: All four
countries included in this Clustered Country Program Evaluation (clustered CPE)
depend heavily on the extraction of nonrenewable natural resources, and extractive
sectors play a major role in their economies and public finances. Nevertheless, Bank
Group strategies in these countries usually did not focus explicitly on the challenges
more typical for resource-rich developing countries (RRDCs), including the role of
natural resource revenues as a potential driving force for development and poverty
reduction. A notable exception is the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Mongolia,
which—albeit somewhat belatedly—made the country’s endowment with abundant
mining resources the centerpiece of Bank Group strategic engagement. Mongolia also
stands out in this cluster evaluation as the only country in which the Bank Group
actually maintains direct engagement in the extractive sector through lending, analytic
and advisory activities (AAA), and International Finance Corporation (IFC)
investments. In the rest of the cluster, the Bank Group has been either effectively cut out
of the sector, or was never involved in the first place. 1

At the same time, Bank Group de facto engagement in the country program evaluation
(CPE) countries, if viewed at the project and AAA levels, did offer solutions to the
relevant challenges in the areas where the Bank Group has a comparative advantage,
that is, macroeconomic management, infrastructure investment, human development,
and so on. Oftentimes, the Bank Group used openings offered through successful AAA
to introduce lending and project implementation support.

The country context dictated the prominence of issues related to resource use in the
Bank’s strategy. The visibility and prominence of the natural resource factor in country
strategy documents generally reflected the quality and depth of overall dialogue with
the respective government authorities. For example, Bolivia’s policy in the hydrocarbon
sector, including the 2005 Hydrocarbon Law and the nationalization in 2006, proceeded
independently of Bank Group advice. The 2006 policy notes prepared by the Bank
Group argued against the direction in which Bolivia’s natural gas policy had gone and
was about to go even more extremely. As a result, since 2006 the government has not
sought any help from the World Bank Group on hydrocarbon sector issues. The Bank
Group strategy in Zambia implicitly recognized the challenge of extremely high
dependency on natural resources, and especially the country’s vulnerability to the
effects of copper price volatility, which made macroeconomic and fiscal management
extremely challenging. However, in the Zambian context many of the questions related
to the use of resource revenues had little relevance. Instead, the key question was



                                                                                          5
CHAPTER 2
WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGIC APPROACH
whether the Bank could have done more to assist the government in maximizing
revenues, specifically: copper accounted for about 80 percent of exports, but only 4
percent of fiscal revenue. The Bank faced a dilemma: whether to support the
renegotiation of the mining contracts or maximize revenue collection within the limits
of the existing contracts. The issue was highly sensitive as the Bank did share some
responsibility for the contracts negotiated with the privatized mines. These contracts
did not include a provision for capturing windfall profits in the event of a rise in copper
prices. In hindsight, the Bank could have made an earlier start (in a much more
favorable country dialogue climate) on the current agenda to strengthen the capacity of
the Ministry of Finance to analyze company accounts and to identify inappropriate use
of transfer pricing, write-offs, and depreciation allowances.

IFC does not have an explicit strategy for its operations in RRDCs. Instead, it has a
sector strategy for engagement with extractive industries. Despite attractive investment
returns, IFC considers extractive industry a “high-risk” business. Due to the
combination of high risk and fairly intensive staff needs to structure a transaction, IFC
also considers the extractive industry a low-volume business in which it should be
highly selective and seeks to optimize both development and financial results.
Considering the potential reputational risk for IFC, governance is one of the most
important risk factors. For higher risk countries that do not have an established track
record of regulatory oversight for the sector, IFC’s strategy is to work closely with the
World Bank. However, this evaluation found that coordination between the Bank and
IFC was ad-hoc and not systematic. CPSs seem to be joint in name only, with weak
sector analysis. Both the Bank and IFC generally failed to establish a long-term sector
engagement and effective implementation strategy for joint contributions to the CPS
and sector objectives. Apart from some pockets of success, IFC struggled to do business
in the four CPE countries beyond its main business line of banking and the financial
sector. In the four CPE countries, IFC had rather limited engagement in infrastructure,
where it has a comparative advantage and global expertise in providing long-term
financing and advice on public-private partnerships. 2 In Bolivia, despite a growing
economy supported by a booming small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, IFC
experienced difficulties in finding long-term investment opportunities in general.

Quality of dialogue: RRDCs have substantial resources to fund government programs,
and are therefore less dependent on donor funding. Their willingness to engage in a
dialogue is often dependent on the establishment of a shared vision and mutual trust.
Bank Group strategies generally aligned with the governments’ development plans.
However, very often the overarching objective was to build (or, at times, re-build) a
strategic relationship with the authorities. Dramatic positive changes in the
macroeconomic situation due to commodity price booms, and the governments’ often
critical view of the international financial institutions negatively affected the extent and

form of Bank Group engagement in Bolivia, and to a lesser extent in Zambia. In this
context, the Bank Group often chose to “re-invent itself” and offer unconventional
mechanisms of cooperation—albeit with varying success. The Bank Group had more
success with this approach in Kazakhstan where, after a considerable hiatus in its
program, it developed two effective mechanisms of dialogue. These included the
regular rounds of cabinet-level “brainstorming sessions” prepared and led by the Bank
and chaired by the Prime Minister, and the Joint Economic Research Program (JERP).
The JERP was a demand-driven, co-funded program of analytical studies and policy
notes on specific sector topics. Implementation of the JERP in Kazakhstan offers some
interesting lessons: while it became a powerful tool for strengthening the partnership,
advancing the reform agenda and a gradual build-up of the lending program, the fully
demand-driven nature of the program imposed limitations on the Bank in defining
strategic priorities in its advisory work, disseminating AAA findings, and engaging
with local partners.

Tension between the Bank’s mandate and the government’s preferences with regard to
the Bank’s assistance program was a common characteristic for resource-rich countries
in which the clients did not need the Bank’s financial support. Thus, they could afford
to be very selective, including in the use of Bank policy advice. In Bolivia, following the
transition to the Morales government in 2005–06, the Bank lost its traditional influence
on policy, and worked hard to “stay engaged,” exploring entries for dialogue with a
publically antagonistic client. The Morales government has been largely uninterested in
the Bank’s advice on macroeconomic policy, governance, and resource extraction. In
this context, the Bank chose to focus on other areas of engagement. The program
became increasingly opportunistic and narrow in scope, reflecting an engagement with
areas of support selected by the government, but not necessarily coherent or suitable for
achieving the intended results. While possibly appropriate for a transitional period, this
strategy may no longer be viable as the Bank could incur reputational risk.

Pro-active engagement with legislatures proved quite useful, especially in countries
with growing traditions of parliamentary democracy, such as in Mongolia. In
Mongolia, the Bank crafted an outreach effort to engage members of parliament in order
to build majority support around policy reforms, strengthen the management of the
mining sector, and target social welfare reforms. This helped the Bank to stay engaged
in dialogue in a society prone to drastic political changes after each electoral cycle that,
in turn, led to deep divisions on important issues, thereby imposing challenges to
implementing a sustainable reform agenda. Increased country and sector presence was
another positive factor: the establishment of a country director-led office in Lusaka,
Zambia demonstrated the Bank’s commitment to building a robust relationship with
Zambian authorities. The placement of a senior mining specialist in Ulan Bator helped
to strengthen engagement in this critically important sector for Mongolia. In Zambia

and Bolivia, the lack of dedicated IFC staff resources and presence in the country
hindered effective cooperation between the Bank and IFC.

In countries with active electoral politics, and thus frequent and unpredictable changes
of government, the interaction of politics and mineral cycles can lead to systematic
problems that spill over into country–Bank relations. At times when a country has few
mineral revenues coming in—either because world prices are low or the minerals are
not yet being exported—then the country is in a weak position vis-à-vis international oil
and mining firms. Such firms can drive a hard bargain in contracting for exploration
and extraction. Also, at these times the government is likely to depend on the Bank’s
blessing to obtain financing, leading to “close collaboration” in policy dialogue. In the
next phase of the commodity price cycle, with extraction investments already in place
and buoyant world prices, it often looks like the exploration and extraction contracts
were bad deals for the country. The Bank can be portrayed as the advisor that led the
previous government to give away too much. That happened in Bolivia and to a lesser
extent in Zambia and Mongolia.

Political economy analysis: In all of the reviewed countries, a good understanding of
the political economy of natural resources was absolutely critical. Governments tend to
use mineral resources as tools in promoting their respective political agendas. The
discovery of large mineral resources often contributes to more fiercely contested
elections and unstable governments, and attendant highly populist decision making
aimed at winning constituencies through distribution of the new wealth (World Bank
2012). The Bank’s ability to take a longer view, to maintain a consistent presence, and to
exploit the synergies between its various operations is important to be able to mitigate
the populism that dominates decision making in many RRDCs. With this perspective,
the Bank could be an important contributor if and when economic populism ceases to
dominate policy making. In Mongolia, Bank-sponsored political economy analysis
proved to be a key input in identifying the constraints to adopting policies for the
effective management of revenues from the mining boom (World Bank 2009). The
findings of the political economy analysis showed the importance of enhancing
information and stimulating multi-stakeholder debates about the governance of the
mining sector. The analysis helped identify the key actors, notably the powerful
political factions that advocated or opposed different facets of the reform program.
Because resource cycles can precipitate the decision-making process without sound
analysis, the country team devised a comprehensive outreach effort to engage
stakeholders in government, the parliament, and civil society. In Zambia, the Bank
produced a study on revenues from mining (2011) and a political economy analysis
that, among other things, warned against industrial policy approaches to diversification
and against repeating the experience of creating parastatals in the 1970s and 80s.

                                                      WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGIC APPROACH
Increased role of AAA: Rapidly decreasing demand for Bank Group financing in most
RRDCs during the review period accorded a more prominent role to the Bank Group’s
AAA work. In Bolivia, the number of AAA products delivered during the period more
than doubled compared to the preceding decade. Analytic work became an increasingly
convenient tool to stay current on developments in many areas and to respond to the
government’s requests for assistance on specific topics. Kazakhstan’s JERP is a good
example of a well-established and effective mechanism in this regard. At the same time,
the overall effectiveness of the JERP did suffer from the absence of an explicit results
framework and the lack of detailed evidence on how much and what kind of Bank
policy recommendations resulted in policy changes. The Bank rarely monitored the
results of its recommendations, while the government’s own monitoring was sporadic
and not regularly shared with the Bank. In Zambia, this evaluation found much
stronger interest in the Bank’s analytic work than had appeared from earlier
assessments (2004). A series of semiannual Country Economic Briefs in Zambia were a
very useful innovation and an instrument of choice to which officials, academics, think
tanks and civil society organizations looked to obtain objective analysis of the current
economic situation. The Bank’s periodic economic reports in Mongolia became a
cornerstone of the Bank’s communication policy, helping to raise awareness about
economic trends and providing the opportunity to discuss frankly the risks posed by
countercyclical government policies.

Capacity building: While capacity building is a common and generic “buzzword”
across the whole range of Bank clientele, RRDCs have a few special needs in this regard.
Negotiating capacity is one of them. Botswana is an excellent example of the
importance of investing in this function, as the outcomes of its long-term deal with the
country’s main investor (De Beers) clearly show. By all accounts, the country did not
spare efforts and resources to build an equally qualified team on the other side of the
negotiating table, and this investment had a high payoff. 3 One of the key lessons that
emerges from the Bank’s support in Zambia is the importance of ensuring that the
country has the right expertise available at the negotiation stage of mineral contracts
and privatization. The failure to look at other fiscal regimes and obtain expertise on
appropriate taxation arrangements has had negative consequences for that country. In
Kazakhstan, building local analytical capacity was a dimension that did not live up to
its potential. The JERP very rarely (if at all) engaged local partners in program delivery.
As such, the 10–year old program of analytical studies contributed surprisingly little to
the build-up of local analytical capacity. In Bolivia, the Morales government thought
that the Bank had been complicit in the favorable deals that international oil companies
had negotiated with previous governments. Consequently, it sought non-Bank expertise
to design the new hydrocarbon law, which was less favorable to the international firms.

CHAPTER 2
WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGIC APPROACH
Partnerships and the demand side of reforms: Experience in all countries proves the
importance and crucial role of building and nurturing long-term partnerships and
communication with all major stakeholders, also moving beyond the usual and main
counterparts of the executive branch of government. This should include the legislature,
private sector, civil society, academia, and donor partners. The Bank’s early (pre-2005)
engagement in Bolivia focused on working with the government and overlooked
building partnerships with other stakeholders. This later backfired, leading to animosity
toward and distrust of the Bank by many Bolivians, including the Morales government.
The Bank Group’s subsequent and recent approach of not antagonizing the current
administration in any way has also been criticized as evading its role as an unbiased
source of knowledge and a trusted development partner. By contrast, in Mongolia, the
Bank used the recommendations of political economy analysis, and came up with a
comprehensive program of outreach and capacity building with the media, parliament,
and civil society. The effectiveness of the Bank’s program in Kazakhstan was reduced
by the lack of attention to demands from civil society and the private sector. The Bank’s
policy dialogue focused exclusively on the government at the cost of not
communicating with other local stakeholders. Most importantly, limited disclosure kept
important policy recommendations out of the general public’s reach, thus constraining
demand for reforms, and adversely affecting the political economy of governance
reforms in the country.

Selectivity: In the context of RRDCs and shrinking demand for Bank services in some
sectors, selectivity becomes an obvious strategic imperative in order to stay current and
relevant. This refers particularly to the Bank Group’s loans and investments. Bank
Group strategies do recognize this and, indeed, call for increased selectivity and focus
in Bank Group interventions—although in many cases selectivity has been defined by
the authorities. While this is generally natural and logical, and all development
initiatives should be client-driven and owned, there is one major caveat. In some
countries, this client-led selectivity has led to the Bank’s de facto withdrawal from
providing impartial advice on important but politically sensitive areas, such as poverty
diagnostics, macro-fiscal management, and governance. In these cases, the Bank should
stay cognizant of its mandate as a global development agency and the immediate risks
facing many RRDCs, such as the looming deterioration of fiscal balances (already
happening in Zambia and Mongolia) amid falling commodity prices that will create
serious risks for countries dependent on mineral exports.

Flexibility: Flexibility is especially important in resource-dependent countries, given
the potential for price shocks and the ensuing variability in revenue. Bank strategy was
generally flexible in design and practice in all countries. The increasing prominence of
technical assistance in the overall program was an important contributing factor in this
regard, as it enhanced Bank capacity to adjust to quickly evolving priorities. In

                                                              WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGIC APPROACH
Mongolia, the Bank team reacted promptly to realign the Bank portfolio to help the
government cope with the global economic crisis in 2008–09. It did so by shifting the
majority of new International Development Association resources to development
policy credits, and intensifying the AAA emphasis on real-time policy advice. The Bank
Group’s “open-ended” 2004 CPS in Kazakhstan was designed as a flexible strategy
instrument that would allow for quick mid-course correction—which, indeed,
happened at the time of economic and financial crises. However, flexibility of the
program should not explain and justify the absence of concrete and measurable
performance indicators that limited the ability to measure actual progress and
achievements.

Overall, looking at the four resource-rich countries in this evaluation, one does not see
the World Bank Group as having a consistent framework or core set of issues to include
in the dialogue with resource-rich countries. Each of the four stories evolved in a
unique way that depended on how the country team at the time decided to react to
differing country circumstances. The Bank’s responses did not seem to derive from any
Bank-wide approach to working with RRDCs. The mineral wealth affected country
dialogues as the Bank Group adapted its strategy to the situation, but this was usually
more in a negative way of limiting the issues that entered into the dialogue. At the same
time, this evaluation argues that despite all the differences between the countries
included in the cluster, there were common challenges and opportunities where the
Bank Group and its clients can learn across countries and Regions, and come up with
solutions to some of the toughest development challenges facing this particular group
of Bank Group client countries.

3. Management of Resources
Resource-rich developing countries (RRDCs) have traditionally faced macroeconomic
and fiscal management challenges because of the volatility and concentration of their
income flows, and the limited linkages from the extractive sectors to the rest of the
economy. These problems, if unaddressed, tend to undermine macroeconomic stability
and weaken institutions for government accountability. The peculiar nature of resource
rent inflows—dubbed the “resource curse”—constitutes a main determinant of the most
typical governance failures in RRDCs. Respective development challenges have been
well identified in the literature (IMF 2012; World Bank 2012) and could be briefly
summarized as follows.

Risks to macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability. Dependence on natural resources
with historically volatile prices exposes countries to a risk of revenue disruptions and,
hence, adversely affects welfare in the absence of precautionary savings. At the same
time, the exhaustibility of non-renewable resources poses difficult choices over the
consumption-savings ratio needed to ensure long-term sustainability and
intergenerational equity. Moreover, the expansionary fiscal policies during boom
periods tend to stimulate domestic demand beyond the existing absorptive capacity in
the economy, which often leads to inflationary pressures and real exchange rate
appreciation. This, in turn, could adversely affect the non-resource tradable sectors by
making domestic production more expensive and non-competitive, a phenomenon
known as the “Dutch Disease.” The economic theory has long advocated that to address
this challenge, resource-rich countries have to set up special fiscal institutions for saving
a portion of their resource revenues over the price cycle, thus buffering their fiscal
policies from commodity price fluctuations. Several countries, such as Chile, have a
positive experience with using such saving mechanisms. Still, many RRDCs continue to
follow pro-cyclical fiscal policies that impose costly adjustments in times of revenue
busts, as observed during the 2008–09 global financial and economic crises. In this
context, the World Bank is expected to support countries in developing robust fiscal
policies and institutions that would help turn resource wealth into a steady stream of
public revenues, and are capable of supporting longer-term macroeconomic
sustainability. The Bank, together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), can play
a role in supporting orderly macroeconomic and fiscal adjustment, including at times of
fiscal surpluses accumulated during boom cycles.

Weaknesses in the national systems for public financial management (PFM).
Historically, many RRDCs could not transform their resource revenues into an
adequate flow of public goods and services due to capacity constraints and distortive



                                                                                           13
CHAPTER 3
MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES
incentive regimes. This failure has often been at the heart of the “resource curse.” Thus,
the PFM agenda was expected to be a central part of the Bank’s strategies in the RRDCs.
National resource rent management systems have three core PFM blocks and generally
one would expect the Bank to support all of them, including: (a) raising resource
revenues—advising on an extractives tax regime, capacity building in tax
administration, and supporting governments in the course of their negotiations with
major private investors; (b) upgrading national PFM institutions and systems—
strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for PFM, building capabilities for
adequate implementation of national PFM regulations, especially in the areas of budget
formulation and planning, accounting, monitoring, reporting, and evaluation; and (c)
improving policy advice in defining the public expenditure envelope and providing
sector-level support to help improve the expenditure allocation.

Inadequate governance and accountability arrangements. The RRDCs also face two
additional governance/political economy risks. First, there is a risk of distributional
conflict over the resource rent control and distribution. Second, these countries could be
affected by disproportionate and unsustainable expansion of their public sectors,
funded by the often temporarily high level of government revenues. The latter instance
may lead to an excessive role of the government in the economy (large, ineffective, and
interventionist government administration operating in an environment of low
institutional capacity). In addition, many RRDCs have been struggling to establish
proper accountability systems. In this context, the Bank has a particular expertise in
supporting countries to address issues of checks and balances, to improve public
administration capacity, and to promote the broader agenda for anticorruption and
deregulation. In the context of RRDCs, the Bank is also well-positioned to lead in
advancing global initiatives, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI).


World Bank Group Strategies
The prominence and design of the resource management (RM) pillar in country
partnership strategies (CPSs) varied significantly across the four country program
evaluation (CPE) countries. These differences are driven by three interrelated variable
factors: (i) the level of economic and institutional development; (ii) dependence on
external financing; and (iii) reform priorities. The Bank’s strategies have differed greatly
in both their scope (variety of Bank instruments, number of self-standing projects) and
depth (intensity and quality of the policy dialogue). In Mongolia and Zambia, the Bank
has had broad programs to support resource management (RM), with significant
amounts of lending and advisory services, driven primarily by high financing needs.
This was the case especially early in the review period, and by the established tradition

                                                                   MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES
of the high-level policy dialogue with the Bank. The Bank’s program in Kazakhstan
included intensive policy advisory work. There were also opportunities to communicate
this advice effectively to senior policymakers. However, until very recently, Kazakhstan
has been very selective in borrowing from the Bank. In contrast to Mongolia and
Zambia, Kazakhstan did not borrow for capacity building in PFM, which contributed to
a gap between the depth of the Bank’s policy advice and the pace of actual change in
PFM practices. In Bolivia, the RM component has mostly dropped out of Bank
programs since 2006. Although the new administration of President Evo Morales
adopted conservative fiscal policies, it did not express interest in promoting
institutional reforms to secure their longer-term sustainability. Issues such as
anticorruption were not high on the Bolivian government’s priority list. Further, the
authorities made it clear that they were not interested in the Bank’s assistance in this
area.


Outcomes and World Bank Group Contribution
SUPPORT FOR MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
The area of macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability was initially among the top
priorities identified within World Bank Group assistance strategies in all four countries,
although the intensity of subsequent engagement and progress have varied widely—
driven by differences in the respective degree of commitment to fiscal discipline. In
Kazakhstan, the government’s reform effort resulted in the most visible progress in
setting up and then strengthening the rules governing the use of oil earnings.
Establishing conservative fiscal rules to govern the annual oil revenue transfer from the
country’s national fund (i.e., National Fund for the Republic of Kazakhstan) to the
budget represents a major achievement. Kazakhstan is the only country in the sample
that has an established track record of counter-cyclical policy. 1 The Bank contributed to
these outcomes through policy dialogue, direct budget support, and a massive amount
of analytical work. Two Bank products were especially important. First, the large and
ambitious Development Policy Loan (DPL) (2009, $1 billion) used the window of
opportunity during the 2009 crisis to accelerate reforms promoting fiscal sustainability.
Apart from specific achievements, such as reduction in budget subsidies to the real
sector (while protecting social spending), and rationalization of the use of the National
Fund’s savings, the DPL helped to cement the government commitment to responsible
public resource management, which has continued after the crisis. Second, a Bank
report entitled Oil Rules. Kazakhstan’s Policy Options in a Downturn (2013) contained an
assessment of Kazakhstan’s current oil rules against possible alternatives (as informed
by best international practices) using the results of modeling of various crisis scenarios.
It concluded that Kazakhstan’s fiscal rules perform well under different types of

MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES
external shocks, they are simple and practical, and do not need to be replaced by more
sophisticated arrangements.

In contrast, in Mongolia, fiscal management arrangements failed the test of the
commodity boom of 2003–07. The government followed a pro-cyclical policy in 2006–08
when commodity prices hit record levels, which then had unfortunate consequences
when the prices collapsed. During the crisis, the government attempted a fiscal
adjustment, supported by the Bank’s Development Policy Credits and technical
assistance (TA). However, it proved to be unsustainable. After the crisis was over, the
government’s reform effort lost momentum, the newly adopted fiscal reform laws were
never fully implemented, and actual budgeting rapidly shifted back to pro-cyclical
patterns. For the same reason, the Bank’s support to design the Sovereign Wealth Fund
(SWF) did not bring any tangible results even though it was technically solid. So far, no
consensus exists within the political class of Mongolia around the need for a more
responsible fiscal policy. Short-term political priorities have overwhelmed the efforts of
Ministry of Finance officials and other reform champions to support prudent fiscal
management. According to the recent IMF assessment, budgeting is still pro-cyclical
and Mongolia’s fiscal framework remains unsustainable (IMF 2012). By contrast, the
experience of Chile (see box 3.1) emphasized the critical role of the consensus among
the political elites with respect to the importance of saving resource rents.

Compared to Kazakhstan and Mongolia, the macroeconomic and fiscal performance of
Zambia has been less affected by the latest commodity price cycle. For most of the
review period, the budget benefitted only marginally from copper price gains because
of the prevailing contractual arrangements with mining companies. Zambia did not
enjoy much relaxation of its budget constraints, but instead (in the early part of the last
decade) became a beneficiary of debt relief (the Highly-Indebted Poor Countries [HIPC]
and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative), which introduced a framework for
subsequent fiscal adjustment, as well as giving an additional impulse to PFM reforms.
Following the HIPC completion, Zambia steadily improved its overall fiscal balance
and reduced its domestic borrowing requirements between 2005 and 2012. However,
the specific fiscal adjustments targets, supported by the Bank, were only partially
achieved. Moreover, after the completion of the series of budget support operations
(Poverty Reduction Support Credits, 2008–10), the trend toward a decline in budget
arrears has reversed, raising concerns about the sustainability of the earlier adjustment.
The expansion of Zambia’s fiscal envelope, driven by the recovery in copper prices and
changes to the taxation regime, has been accompanied by signs of weakening fiscal
discipline, for example, significant external borrowing on commercial terms; a tripling
of the share of public investments in relation to gross domestic product (GDP); and a
significant increase in government salaries. Although the Bank shifted the focus of its
program away from fiscal sustainability, it still proposed guidelines for the use of

additional resource flows from mining, and advocated the creation of a sovereign
wealth fund. This reflected the government’s intention at the time to put in place a
windfall profit tax and unilaterally abrogate the agreements with the mining
companies. The government subsequently reversed its strategy, and revenues from
mining expanded only modestly, thus diminishing political support for the
establishment of a SWF. Recent growth in mining revenues and the government’s plans
for budget expansion suggest the need for the Bank to resume its advocacy for a rules-
based framework for managing resource flows in Zambia.


 Box 3.1. Consensus Matters: The Evolution of Chile’s Fiscal Rule
 Throughout its history, Chile witnessed significant episodes of macroeconomic instability and high
 levels of inflation due to its vulnerability to external shocks. These past developments gradually
 created a consensus for conservative macroeconomic and fiscal policies among the main elements of
 the political spectrum, and have positioned Chile as a role model for macroeconomic management and
 sound fiscal discipline.
 In the mid-1980s, Chile created the Copper Stabilization Fund to limit public spending at levels
 determined by what was considered to be the long-term price of copper. The Copper Fund served the
 country well during the 1997–98 Asian Financial Crisis, when the authorities withdrew $200 million
 from the fund to finance some counter-cyclical expenditures. In 2001–02, President Ricardo Lagos put
 forward a self-imposed fiscal rule (not initially enshrined in law), to demonstrate that a left-center
 socialist government could be fiscally responsible. The fiscal rule was based on a structural balance
 rule with the objective of designing a fiscal policy with a medium-term perspective that would also
 isolate government revenues from copper price fluctuations, from fluctuations in activity due to the
 business cycle, or any other fluctuation in aggregate demand that would lower the level of activity
 below potential output. The rule set public expenditures in accordance with the long-term revenue
 projections based on the expected world prices of copper.
 The fiscal rule later incorporated an adjustment to account not only for the price of copper, but also for
 tax revenues as influenced by fluctuations in overall GDP with respect to a trend GDP (to incorporate
 non-copper taxes). The fiscal rule was formalized in 2006 through a Fiscal Responsibility Law, creating
 two independent sovereign wealth funds: the Pension Fund (to cover increased liabilities expected for
 old-age benefits) and the Stabilization Fund (to accumulate resources when copper prices were above
 the trend and allow for a counter-cyclical fiscal policy when prices fell below the trend).
 Chiles’s fiscal rule performed an important function during the 2000s. The sharp increase in world
 copper prices generated an enormous fiscal surplus that accumulated in the sovereign funds (the
 surplus was 7.5 percent of GDP in both 2007 and 2008). In 2008, the world price of copper hit an all-
 time high and, at the same time, the popularity of then-President Michele Bachelet hit a low of around
 40 percent. The main reason was that she did not spend the income pouring into the country from
 commodity exports as many Chilean citizens wanted. One year later the global recession arrived and
 copper prices crashed. However, funds saved during the good times provided the cushion needed to
 maintain a steady fiscal policy that tempered the downturn. Bachelet’s popularity rose to nearly 80
 percent. The savings generated during that period allowed the government to implement a strong
 counter-cyclical fiscal policy at a later point during the global crises of 2009. A large part of the
 resources drawn from the Stabilization Fund allowed financing of bonuses (direct unconditional
 transfers) for the bottom 40 percent of the population. It also helped to contain any pressures for an
 overshooting of the exchange rate during the crisis.

MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES
 Since the global crises, the formula and the system have become more refined in terms of how
 domestic taxes can influence the rule, as reflected in increased transparency of the governance of the
 funds ( for example, by using both domestic and external advisors), and the eventual establishment of
 an Advisory Fiscal Council. The primary function of the council is to advise, assess, and evaluate the
 fiscal stance in both the short- and long term and oversee the execution of the fiscal rule. The legal
 status of the council is still under discussion.
 An interesting finding in relation to the fiscal rule and its utility in other contexts came out in
 interviews conducted by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). In terms of transferring the Chilean
 experience with its fiscal rule elsewhere, many interviewees believed that for the rule to be credible it is
 necessary for a country to have had a prior positive track record of good fiscal behavior (several years
 of sound budget accounts) prior to its legal imposition. A much less successful experience with the
 fiscal rule in Mongolia (adopted by the Parliament, but never really followed) supports this point.

The Bank’s macroeconomic dialogue with the government of Bolivia has been limited.
The government of Bolivia managed the latest commodity cycle very successfully by
following a conservative and largely counter-cyclical macroeconomic policy, with
minimal input from the Bank. Since 2006, the government has followed policies of fiscal
restraint and unhurried extraction of mineral wealth. The country achieved solid fiscal
and current account surpluses, growing international reserves, and reduced public
debt. Growth in budget spending was considerable, but generally well controlled in
light of major increases in budget revenues. As a result, as noted by the recent IMF
Article IV report, Bolivia’s macroeconomic situation has become robust and it is well
positioned to withstand short-term economic shocks. From this perspective, Bolivia
could be compared to Kazakhstan. The main difference is that Bolivia’s policies were
designed by the government, with limited advice from international development
institutions, including the Bank. Further, its policies were not anchored in formal
institutions (such as fiscal rules and a Stabilization Fund) that could help to ensure
longer-term sustainability. Recent fiscal restraint seems to depend on the discretion of
the top leadership (President and Minister of Finance). Moreover, there has been a
concern regarding growing fiscal pressures as the government’s traditional allies,
including labor and indigenous groups, have been pushing for larger participation in
gas proceeds, increases in pensions, fuel subsidies, and so on. In this context, a relevant
lesson from the Botswana experience is that, absent formal restraints, the discipline in
fiscal policy-making tends to soften over time at both the project (costing of projects)
and the macro (commitment to fiscal rules) levels (World Bank 2010). Botswana has also
experienced the erosion of the Ministry of Finance’s authority in coordinating the
budget process. Over the longer term, diamond rents have led to an over-expansion of
the government. This is particularly apparent in terms of its distortive effect on the
labor market. The government’s wage bill is high by international standards and,
combined with subsidies and transfers, accounts for about 50 percent of total

expenditures, thereby limiting room for fiscal policy flexibility and pushing up labor
costs for the private sector.

REFORMING PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT
Strong macroeconomic and fiscal discipline does not necessarily guarantee efficient use
of budget resources at the level of public service delivery. This underlines the need to
develop good national systems of expenditure allocation and use. For example,
Botswana’s failure to modernize its PFM system in line with changing country needs
has been the primary cause of declining productivity of public investments over the
past 20 years, resulting in a disparity between budget spending and development
outcomes. While public spending in Botswana is high for a middle-income country
(MIC), the country ranks below other MICs in social indicators. Nearly a quarter of
Botswana’s public spending goes to education—significantly more than in comparator
countries, yet with similar, or even worse results.

During the review period, the Bank made a significant and consistent effort to help all
four CPE countries to improve their PFM practices. The Bank’s strategies consistently
emphasized the strengthening of the legal and institutional framework for PFM,
improving budget accounting and reporting, introducing a medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF), advancing procurement reforms, rationalizing expenditure
allocation, and modernizing debt management and internal control and audit. The
Bank’s core analytical work (Public Expenditure Review, Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability Review, and Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability) was of high quality. However, the actual follow-up on Bank
policy recommendations in the PFM area was rather selective, and the reforms initiated
with the Bank’s assistance often remained incomplete.

There is clearly a positive trend toward strengthening national PFM systems, but more
remains to be done. The PFM systems in Mongolia and Zambia remain weak despite
many years of engagement, as is domestic ownership for further reforms. Moreover, in
all cases, and especially in Kazakhstan and Mongolia, progress on the legislative and
regulatory side has been stronger than actual policy adjustments. Some of the recent
capability improvements remain underused, and those improvements have not yet
brought many tangible benefits.

Individual achievements in Zambia have not resulted in an effective modernization of
the entire PFM system. The government moved selectively, and mainly in the areas that
do not challenge strong vested interests. Whenever a change posed a risk to the status
quo, the implementation slowed down (Integrated Financial Management and
Information System) or stopped completely (decentralization). The absence of
commitment to comprehensive PFM reform means that even if there is progress under


                                                                                         19

MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES
one PFM component, inefficiency and rent-seeking gravitate to other parts of the
government program. It is therefore likely that in the event of a sizeable increase in
government revenues in Zambia, their productive use will be hampered by the current
institutional arrangements and incentives.

In the area of PFM legislation, the Bank has made a major contribution to a complete
overhaul of the legal and regulatory framework for budgeting and expenditure
management in Mongolia. However, implementation of these laws has lagged in many
areas, such as controlling the pace of budget expansion and increasing the transparency
of spending.

In the area of revenue management, including tax and customs administration, the
Bank’s program in Kazakhstan has been an important success story. In 2007–09, the
government implemented most of the changes recommended by the Bank on both tax
policy and administration. This was accompanied by a significant improvement in
revenue performance, boosted by higher oil revenues. Kazakhstan’s progress on tax
administration was even more impressive. 2 There was an important synergy in this
area, where high-quality analytical work was complemented by successful investment
projects in tax and custom administration. However, except for Mongolia, none of the
four CPE countries engaged with the Bank on the core policy choices about commodity
taxation (oil, gas, copper). Instead, they sought advisory support elsewhere, including
from the private sector.

The Bank remained largely disengaged in the dialogue on tax policy and administration
in Zambia, where public revenues underperformed during the price boom relative to
most other mining exporter countries. The Bank team decided not to advocate adjusting
the existing mining agreements that had become increasingly inadequate as copper
prices reached record highs after 2004. In retrospect, the Bank could have done more to
promote a consensus between the government and industry regarding a coordinated
shift towards higher taxation levels and better public services, regulation, and
infrastructure for investors. Moreover, the Bank could have started earlier in
strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Finance to analyze mining company
accounts and identify the inappropriate use of transfer pricing and depreciation
allowances.

In the area of budget formulation and planning, the Bank emphasized relatively
advanced concepts such as results-based budgeting (RBB) and a medium-term
expenditure framework. Their implementation proved difficult, even in the relatively
high-capacity public sector environment of Kazakhstan. Despite various improvements
in the legal framework for RBB in Kazakhstan, the government budget planning
practices remain excessively complex, with too many simultaneous plans required at

                                                                  MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES
each level. In Mongolia and Zambia there was also only partial progress with MTEF
implementation (as could be seen by the drastic expansion of fiscal envelopes in both
countries recently), notwithstanding much effort by the Bank and its donor partners.

In the area of budget execution, accounting and reporting progress has been slow and
often disappointing in both Mongolia and Zambia. However, more than a decade of
efforts has started to show results. The modern government financial management
information systems (GFMIS) have been at the center of their programs. In Mongolia,
the rollout of the GFMIS to all local governments represented the single most important
achievement of PFM reforms to date. In Zambia, the GFMIS, supported by the Bank’s
public sector management projects, also became an institutional platform for
strengthening government capacity in budget control and execution, and in public
access to information.

In Kazakhstan, following Bank advice, the government upgraded its capacity for public
debt management, including the development of the Government Debt Management
Strategy. At the same time, progress on strengthening the oversight of state-owned
enterprise debt in Kazakhstan has been lagging. In Bolivia, the Bank also provided
advice on the public debt management system when the government made the
transition to a blend International Development Association (IDA)/International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development status.

While each individual PFM project in this group was only modestly successful at best,
the strategy of long-term engagement has been gradually bearing fruit. IEG project-
level reviews questioned the appropriateness of the Bank’s approach to PFM-related
lending in both Mongolia and Zambia, arguing that the systems that were supported
were too complex and ambitious, and that an alternative strategy of consolidating the
“basic” systems first could have been more appropriate in a low-capacity environment
(Wescott 2008). When viewed over a decade, however, one can see how the
accumulation of small, gradual changes has brought about substantial achievements by
greatly expanding the capabilities of respective government agencies. The strategy of
long-term sustained engagement has paid off in the end, albeit somewhat later than
expected.

STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARRANGEMENTS
The governance and accountability agenda has been high on the list of Bank program
priorities in all four countries. The most popular themes included: (i) support for broad
anticorruption initiatives; (ii) strengthening external audit and parliamentary oversight;
and (iii) supporting the EITI. Actual progress has been rather limited and slow,
compared to the fiscal sustainability and PFM subsectors. Despite regular issuance of
high-level statements, none of the four countries has pursued an ambitious program of

weak.

A general measure of institutional quality, the Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment rating for the quality of public sector management and institutions, did not
show any real improvement between 2006 and 2012 in Bolivia, Mongolia, and Zambia
(figure 3.1). 3 While their ratings are higher than the average for the peer group of 11
resource-rich IDA recipients, in absolute terms, the ratings remain quite low, that is,
below 3.5 on the 6–point scale. These three countries, however, have done better on the
Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI). Their CPI ratings
improved over the last decade, especially after 2011 (figure 3.2), albeit from a low level.
The “corruption perception gap,” relative to countries with stronger institutions, such
as Botswana and Chile, remains significant. According to Transparency International,
much of these recent improvements should be attributed to the strengthened legal
framework and capabilities to investigate and prosecute corruption cases. Much less
progress was recorded with respect to strengthening government accountability
institutions. In Kazakhstan, in contrast to the other three countries, corruption
perceptions did not improve at all between 2006 and 2013, and remain poor—at a
position of 140 out of 177 countries rated.

EITI (see box 3.2) has been used by the Bank Group as an important instrument for
improving governance and institutions in the extractives sector in three countries—
Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Zambia (see table 3.1).


 Box 3.2. World Bank Group Engagement with the EITI
 In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was an increased interest and debate around the
 “resource curse.” There was recognition that the huge potential benefits of oil, gas, and
 mining were not being realized in many developing countries, and were instead linked with
 increased poverty, conflict, and corruption.
 The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) was launched in 2002 at the World
 Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. It is a multi-stakeholder initiative to
 encourage governments, companies, international organizations, civil society organizations
 (CSOs), and others to work together voluntarily to develop a framework to promote the
 transparency of payments and revenues. The initiative was grounded in a shared belief that
 the EITI could help address the paradox that two-thirds of the world’s poorest people live in
 countries that are rich in natural resources, that is, they are impacted by the resource curse.
 The World Bank endorsed the EITI and established the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for
 EITI in 2004 as a global partnership to harness donor resources to develop and broaden the
 EITI process. The objective of the MDTF–EITI was to increase the transparency of payments
 made by industry and revenues received by host governments from oil, gas, and mining
 production. The underlying rationale was that it would help reduce poverty in resource-
 dependent countries by addressing the resource curse. To date, the MDTF has disbursed
 around $60 million in technical and financial assistance to EITI programs in 37 countries.

Kazakhstan became fully EITI compliant in 2013, Mongolia in 2010, and Zambia in 2012. The EITI process
has been quite successful, especially in Kazakhstan and Mongolia, where it has helped to set up new
national standards for accountability and disclosure of resource-related revenues, and served as an
instrument of empowerment for local civil society groups. In Bolivia the government showed no interest
in EITI, despite several overtures from the Bank.

In Kazakhstan, the Bank’s technical assistance for EITI was seen as a critical input for
building local capacity and enhancing the credibility needed to sustain a multi-
stakeholder process. It has begun to broaden citizen participation in governance issues
at both the national and local levels. The EITI process may have encouraged the
Ministry of Finance to improve the disclosure and accessibility of budget information.
Indeed, Kazakhstan’s Open Budget Index has improved from 35 (below average) in
2008 to 48 in 2012, which is higher than the average for the 100 countries surveyed. By
many accounts, even prior to Kazakhstan’s achievement of EITI compliance, the EITI
process enabled more concrete and practical debates between CSOs, government, and
industry around various important hot topics. Similarly in Mongolia, the EITI program
contributed to revenue management by improving the mining industry’s compliance
with applicable taxes. It demonstrated the feasibility of the multi-stakeholder approach
to promoting a public policy agenda and facilitated opportunities for CSOs to get
involved in other priority areas, such as budget monitoring and environmental

management. In Zambia, Bank support to EITI helped to broaden public access to
information on mining revenue flows and strengthened the demand side of reforms by
building a local nongovernmental organization (NGO) coalition, but the benefits of this
have been less than expected. Although the EITI process in Zambia produced
considerable evidence of mining companies being systematically under-taxed, the
government was slow to act on these findings.

Outside of the EITI, the Bank’s efforts to promote accountability and stronger
governance were rather fragmented, often explained by insufficient interest from the
clients. In Kazakhstan, the Bank provided TA in specific technical areas (Accounting
Committee, transition to International Public Sector Accounting Standards, and so on).
However, there is no evidence of a comprehensive anticorruption program, which was
one of the CPS targets. Similarly, in Bolivia, supporting governance and public
institutions was a key component of Bank Group strategies throughout the evaluation
period, but with sharply declining intensity of engagement because of a lack of interest
from the authorities. Since 2008, the Bank drastically downsized its involvement in the
governance area in Bolivia. In Mongolia, the Bank’s primary vehicle to pursue
accountability objectives was investment lending to strengthen PFM, as discussed in the
previous section. Bank projects also supported reforms in public sector accounting,
auditing, and budget monitoring—but all remain far from complete. For instance,
whereas the timing of external budget audits has improved, the findings are not
regularly made public. Moreover, the recent quasi-fiscal programs administered by the
newly established Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) have raised concerns about
extra-budgetary spending. The DBM disbursed large amounts of project financing with
limited parliamentary oversight, and without being subject to regular government
procurement procedures. In Zambia, the Bank’s strategy was similar to Mongolia, with
a significant emphasis on improved functionality and coverage of GFMIS and
associated benefits. In addition, the Bank’s interventions may have helped empower
new constituencies to push for further reforms in budget transparency and
accountability, such as the Office of the Auditor General and the NGO community.
However, inadequate ownership of reforms is constraining full use of newly upgraded
capabilities. For instance, the improved quality of the annual budget audit did not bring
tangible accountability benefits, as there was little interest among the political elite to
act on the findings of the Auditor General’s reports.

Stimulating local demand for stronger government accountability was a particular area
of weakness in the Bank’s programs under review. This was especially the case in
Kazakhstan (outside of the EITI process) and Bolivia, where the Bank has tried to
position itself as a trusted advisor to the government, while limiting its engagement
with nongovernmental groups. The Zambia program achieved the most traction in this
area, but even there the Bank was slow to start supporting demand-side interventions.

MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES
In Mongolia, the Bank has gradually expanded its efforts to reach out to parliament and
civil society organizations to broaden the understanding of risks associated with
mineral resource revenues and to support public demand for good governance.


Conclusions
The World Bank is well-positioned to assist RRDCs in implementing policies and
institutions that promote macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability, as well as in helping
these countries establish a track-record of counter-cyclical policies. Further, it would be
important to undertake an analysis to develop realistic contingency plans for dealing
with price downturns. Fiscal rules proved to be useful in this regard. However, even in
the absence of such rules, the Bank could systematically monitor and analyze
performance and provide governments and the public with this information, as well as
with information on the performance of key comparator countries.

Policy consensus across the political spectrum, including full recognition of the need to
save part of resource rents over the commodity cycle, is a critical ingredient for success
in the sustainable management of commodity revenues. When such consensus is
lacking (for example, in Mongolia and Zambia), the countries will remain exposed to
the risks of the resource curse, despite efforts by the Bank Group and development
partners. Wide dissemination of the Bank’s analytical work findings and engagement of
local players in their preparation can be powerful tools for strengthening local
ownership of reforms. Bank Group support for the EITI process in three of the countries
was an effective demand side instrument, and a visible platform for CSOs to discuss
and demand transparency and accountability from government and industry officials.

Bank instruments for delivery of PFM support were largely adequate. There has been
an important synergy in promoting key program objectives through the simultaneous
and complimentary use of budget support and investment lending backed by up by
high-quality analytical work. In Mongolia and Zambia (and to a lesser extent in
Bolivia), the Bank delivered the core part of its capacity building support through a
programmatic approach. Although individual TA projects within these programs have
been seen as only modestly successful (largely due to their overambitious design) over
the whole period of 10+ years, these programs managed to deliver significant
improvements in core RM capabilities. This underlines a clear benefit associated with
continuity and consistency of engagement with clients on PFM reform issues. The
policy areas that may require further attention include: taxation of resource rents;
stimulating local demand for PFM reforms; and country-specific sequencing of
interventions in the core PFM systems so as to reflect more accurately the prevailing
capacity constraints.

1Over the period of 2002–08, Kazakhstan ran budget surpluses averaging 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product. During the 2008–09 crises, the government used oil savings to finance a
program of fiscal and monetary stimuli estimated at $17 billion. This helped to smooth the
overall effect of the global crisis on the Kazakh economy and supported rapid recovery in 2010–
11. The program of budget support was duly downsized as soon as the worst of the crisis was
over. As of early 2014, the government has accumulated savings of over $40 billion in its oil

4. Economic Diversification and Nonextractive
Growth
Diversification of the economy and broad-based economic development are critical for
the long-term sustainable development in resource-rich developing countries (RRDCs)
for two reasons. First, the high level of export concentration makes these economies
vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations (figure 4.1) that can result in abrupt
contraction of public resources and/or create a negative spillover effect in the rest of the
economy. Second, extractive sectors are generally capital intensive, have weak links to
the rest of the economy, and, as a rule, do not generate much employment. Therefore,
investments in these sectors and their expansion have a low impact on the growth and
productivity of other industries leading to a high concentration of gross domestic
product (GDP) and a low impact on job creation.

Resource-dependent countries, however, face a number of challenges in achieving
economic diversification. Fast growth in export revenues from resource extraction is
invariably accompanied by exchange rate appreciation pressures, or the so-called Dutch
Disease, that reduces competitiveness of other traded sectors of the economy (figure
4.2). Three of the four case study countries suffered from this phenomenon over the last
decade, albeit to a varying degree and with fluctuations linked to resource revenues. To
counteract the Dutch Disease, countries need to increase productivity and promote
investment in nonextractive sectors to spur their growth.

There is no clear consensus about measures that are necessary to achieve economic
diversification, but a few general principles are widely accepted. First, investments in
infrastructure—for instance, improving a poor road network and lack of access to
power—are often the most critical constraints for growth in many developing countries.
These investments are important for reducing the cost of doing business and improving
competitiveness. Second, support for agriculture: despite increasing reliance on
resource rents, agriculture is often still the sector that employs the largest share of the
labor force (32 to 40 percent in Bolivia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan, and a reported high
of 72 percent in Zambia). It faces pressures both from the exchange rate appreciation as
well as from increasing mechanization as wages are pushed up. Improving agricultural
productivity and commercialization, and linking producers to markets are among some
of the important measures in this regard. Examples of countries such as Chile and
Malaysia confirm the proposition that a healthy rural economy is also important for
industrialization because of the linkages between the two. Third, it is important to
promote private investment in the nonextractive sectors through improving the
business and regulatory environment, providing better access to finance, and
supporting entrepreneurship and skill development (see box 4.1). Many governments
have also attempted a proactive industrial policy through a system of targeted subsidies
and incentives. The efficacy of such measures has generally not proven to be high. Chile

ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONEXTRACTIVE GROWTH
provides a good example, whereby the government—while being very particular about
the fundamentals (macroeconomic stability, fiscal discipline and business climate
conducive for investment)—did not pursue an “industrial policy” approach. Rather, it
encouraged a wide array of small-scale experimentation, with broad participation of
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector (box 4.1).


 Box 4.1. Chile’s Innovation and Entrepreneurial Ecosystem
 Background: Although copper remains the main export item (47 percent of total exports amounting to 12
 percent of GDP), and an important source of revenue in Chile, non-copper exports have expanded
 significantly, particularly in renewable natural resources (for example, fisheries, forestry, and
 agriculture). This expansion is generally attributed to favorable exchange rates in the 1970s and 1980s,
 and improved policies (open trade, an increased use of Free Trade Agreements, and expansion of public
 infrastructure). The introduction of the fiscal rule has had a positive influence on these exports by
 providing a minimal predictability of the exchange rate path, in spite of fluctuations in the price of
 copper. It has been a critical factor because of the long maturation period for many of these exports
 (agriculture). Chile has also diversified its export markets to reach East Asia and Europe. Overall, there
 is an increased awareness of the importance of innovation to growth and a desire to move toward a
 more diversified and knowledge-based economy.
 Chile’s National Innovation System: The institutional set up for promoting innovation is rather simple and
 includes two main government bodies. The National Council on Innovation for Competitiveness
 (CNIC) advises the President on innovation policies, including the education of specialized human
 resources and development, and the transfer and diffusion of technology. It produced a strategy
 entitled “Towards National Innovation” (2007) which identified wide–ranging reforms and initiatives to
 be financed with the funds from copper royalties. The Ministerial Committee on Innovation is a policy-
 making body, which further articulates the innovation policies established by the CNIC, and executes
 and monitors their implementation. The budget of the National Innovation System grew from $437
 million in 2007 to $1.037 billion in 2013.
 Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Chile’s success as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship in South
 America has been aided by its business-friendly environment, and a large number of schemes and
 funds made available by the government, universities, foundations, NGOs, and others to encourage
 innovative and experimental activities in the non-mineral sectors. Many innovation efforts have used a
 “clustered,” sector-specific approach, targeting vertical programs. During the mission to Chile, the
 evaluation team found that although there is broader support for horizontal programs, a few experts
 felt that the cluster approach should also be considered, at least at the experimental level, to the extent
 that such pilots are based on limited fiscal funding and co-financing from the private sector.
 Interestingly, so far, the most active and promising programs in this area were the ones supporting links
 to the copper sector, including suppliers (machinery and other technology) and consulting services.
 Simultaneously, various other initiatives used horizontal approaches that try to encourage research and
 development (R&D) and commercialization independently of specific sectors. For example, there is an
 R&D tax credit for in-house projects. In 2013, the Ministry of Economy launched a portal that allows
 businesses to incorporate online in just one day. One of the most successful initiatives creating
 headlines all over the world and promoting awareness of Chile’s own “Chilecon Valley” is the Start-Up
 Chile Program, launched in 2010 to attract e-commerce and information technology software ventures.
 With this program, the government provides a co-financing grant and a one-year visa to entrepreneurs
 from all over the world to develop their projects in Chile. Although the program is open to Chileans,
 most of the start-ups come from abroad. As of 2013, Chile has paid 1,567 entrepreneurs from 65
 countries to launch 732 startups. The Chile–California Program was an important example of a

                                                   ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONEXTRACTIVE GROWTH
 successful mechanism for the transfer of “know-how” in agriculture. Through this program, the Ford
 Foundation funded the training of Chilean agronomists at the University of California-Davis. This led to
 a number of successful initiatives, such as the introduction of new varieties of crops (for example,
 yellow corn) with the participation of university research centers.
 Lessons Learned. The Chilean experience with developing nonextractive, export-oriented sectors
 proves that it can be a very long process that requires a long-term commitment to the fundamentals,
 such as maintaining a predictable and open trade regime, providing necessary public infrastructure, as
 well as being open-minded about experimenting, albeit on a small scale. The most visible success stories
 (wine, fruit, and salmon) are often country-specific and driven by sui generis geographic and historical
 factors, and hence hard, if not impossible, to replicate. At the same time, the Chilean experience shows
 that horizontal policies for promoting innovation and nonextractive growth—ensuring an even playing
 field, improving the business environment, providing non-distortionary incentives and
 complementarities, investing (small scale) in R&D together with the private sector, encouraging and
 facilitating links between various industries, including the extractives sector—can be quite effective.
 Such policies also may not require large fiscal commitments. In fact, the key word in Chile seemed to be
 “innovation” rather than “diversification.” Many initiatives on “innovation” were actually feeding off
 of the booming mining industry, providing services and technological solutions. Securing co-financing
 from the private sector was considered critical, and equivalent to passing the “market test.”
 Three factors consistently emerge as key to promoting growth and innovation in nonextractives: (i)
 getting the fundamentals right (macroeconomic stability; control of inflation; an open trade policy;
 transparency and good governance; a conservative and countercyclical fiscal policy; a healthy banking
 sector; and an independent Central Bank); (ii) investing in basic infrastructure—roads, communication,
 and access to electricity and water; and (iii) investing in people, especially in education at all levels.

World Bank Group Strategies
The Bank Group strategy in two of the four case study countries—Kazakhstan and
Zambia—explicitly had economic diversification as one of the key objectives.
Diversification did not feature prominently in any of the country partnership strategies
(CPSs) for Bolivia, but was implicit in the objective of “productive development and job
creation.” In Mongolia, given its relatively recent arrival in the group of resource-rich
countries, earlier strategies (2004–10) did not emphasize diversification and job creation;
rather, the focus was on developing a suitable Bank Group engagement strategy in a
rapidly changing macroeconomic situation linked to an envisaged significant increase
in mineral revenues. The most recent CPS (World Bank 2012) has building a
“sustainable and diversified basis for economic growth and employment in urban and
rural areas” as one of its three objectives.

In each of the four countries, the approach to diversification largely followed the three-
pronged strategy mentioned above, but with a significant variation in emphasis among
the different components. The CPSs for Kazakhstan and Zambia had the most
comprehensive approach in this area, and Mongolia the least. In none of the countries,



                                                                                                        31
CHAPTER 4
ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONEXTRACTIVE GROWTH
however, was the objective quantified in the results framework, nor were there any
mechanisms in place to monitor diversification. In essence, the strategies broke down
along conventional sector engagements: infrastructure, agriculture, and private sector
development.


Outcomes and World Bank Group Contribution
The assessment of Bank Group programs in support of diversification is particularly
challenging as none of the CPSs defined diversification beyond general statements or
specified any indicators to monitor progress. Most indicators in the results frameworks
tended to be at the micro level and had little relevance for measuring progress on the
overarching objective.

The individual country program evaluations (CPEs) in this cluster tried (to the extent
possible) using various other metrics for diversification—with all of them painting a
somewhat negative picture. Using the share of extractives in GDP as the measure,
indicates that economies of three out of the four countries are even more concentrated
now than they were 10 years ago (figure 4.3). Zambia is an exception, but then mining
and quarrying is still a much smaller part of its economy compared to the others.
However, this measure could be misleading because with favorable price and volume
trends, it may be inevitable that the share of extractives in GDP has increased.

Another perspective is provided by using the export diversification index. A commonly
used measure is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) 1 that measures the extent of
diversification of exports across industries. The lower the number, the less concentrated
the exports. By this measure, the concentration of exports in all four case study
countries either remained the same or increased over the last 10 years (figure 4.4).

This too could be an incomplete or misleading measure. Export concentration could
become higher despite growth in other exports if extractive industries are growing
particularly rapidly, or because of growth in other extractive-related industries
(Zambia) or sectors that are not labor-intensive (all four countries). Therefore, it does
not address the issue of job creation outside of the extractive industries that most policy
makers prioritize and to which the Bank CPSs give most importance. In this case, it
might be useful to look at diversification across the key sectors—mining and quarrying,
agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and services. Again using the HHI as the
measure, Bolivia and Zambia showed increased diversification since 2000 (figure 4.5).
However, this measure also has a limitation in that there is no presumption that the
composition of sectors in GDP is ideal. It could show improvement, for example, if the
nontradable sectors are buoyant even while manufacturing and agriculture are
stagnant.

Another possible measure is to look at growth over time in sectors that have the
potential for job creation, including agriculture, services, construction, and
manufacturing. The objective could be to aim for growth that is not too far below the
overall GDP growth. This measure gives a slightly more nuanced picture (figure 4.6). In
all four countries, GDP growth is driven largely by the extractives sector. Construction
also experienced significant growth, probably linked to increased construction activity
resulting from increased public and private investment in real estate. However, growth
in manufacturing was anemic in most cases, with a mixed picture in agriculture.

Ultimately, whatever the metric used, progress in economic diversification and growth
in nonextractive sectors was limited during the review period. This has often spurred
policy makers to pursue proactive promotional measures that can be costly, but whose
efficacy has not been established.

Although diversification is widely seen as an important objective by the governments of
resource-rich countries (and endorsed by the Bank in its country strategies), there is no
full consensus on the subject in the literature. A recent Bank study (Gill and others 2014)
argues that based on historical evidence from industrialized countries, diversification is
neither necessary nor sufficient for economic development. Instead, it notes that the
strategy for resource-rich countries should not be to aim for economic diversification,
but rather to efficiently convert resource rents into physical, human, and institutional
capital. However, in another recent Bank economic report for Kazakhstan (World Bank
2013), a “positive association between rising diversification and rising per capita
incomes for countries which have per capita income of up to $20,000” was noted.
Nevertheless, its policy recommendations are consistent with those in the above-
mentioned study. The Bank’s de-facto focus on infrastructure, agriculture, and private
investments is consistent with this approach, and appears to be generally relevant.
However, this review of the four case study countries also provides several nuanced
lessons in each of the three areas that could be considered in the future design of
country strategies for resource-dependent countries.

CHAPTER 4
ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONEXTRACTIVE GROWTH

Sector-Level Outcomes and World Bank Group Contribution
INFRASTRUCTURE
Infrastructure features as a high priority in the development plans of all four countries.
In part, this is because deficiencies in infrastructure were often cited as a major
impediment to growth. In addition, infrastructure improvements are also often seen as
a way for governments to demonstrate the tangible benefits of resource rents to their
people. This approach was evident in Bank Group strategies in all four countries, with
the greatest emphasis in Zambia and Kazakhstan and to a more limited extent in
Bolivia and Mongolia, where infrastructure investments were framed more from
equity rather than a growth perspective. Bank Group support was primarily for roads
and power, the two infrastructure subsectors that are often the highest priority, with
generally satisfactory outcomes (with the exception of the road subsector in Mongolia).
Bank Group support was primarily in the form of World Bank lending and (limited)
non-lending services. Except for some infrastructure-related investments in sectors such
as telecom and gas, and a few aborted attempts to develop public-private partnership
projects in Zambia and Kazakhstan, the role of the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) in providing advisory services or offering long-term financing in infrastructure
projects was minimal.

Roads. Within infrastructure, roads received the greatest focus, both for upgrading and
expanding the network and for ensuring adequate institutional mechanisms for
sustainable financing. The road sector was a major and sustained focus of Bank support
in Zambia and Kazakhstan, providing examples of effective Bank interventions. Both
countries have ambitious programs of upgrading and expanding their road networks.
In Zambia, the Bank (jointly with other donors) helped finance road investments and
the establishment of new institutions. Today, the sector structure is solid, even from an
international perspective, although its efficacy in recent years has come under threat as
the government faces increased political pressure to expand the network beyond what
is considered to be economical and sustainable. In Kazakhstan, with funding of more
than $3 billion since 2009, the Bank is the single largest donor for the government’s
program to upgrade the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation corridors that
pass through the country. Although Kazakhstan has ample resources of its own to
finance the program, it invited the Bank to ensure sound program planning and
execution. Bank involvement helped introduce stronger fiduciary and governance
standards, upgrade the capacity of local contractors, and begin the modern maintenance
practice of outsource contracting. The Bank also provided significant support for policy
and institutional development in the sector.

Power. Increasing access to power was an important goal in all four countries, and all
four faced the need for additional investments in power generation with the attendant

                                                                                     CHAPTER 4
                                            ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONEXTRACTIVE GROWTH
growth of their economies. Like roads, power was a significant focus of World Bank
programs in Zambia and Kazakhstan, with more limited support in Bolivia and
Mongolia. The Bank promoted the conventional policy and institutional reform agenda:
increasing access, improving operational and financial performance of sector entities,
establishing tariff-setting mechanisms, and promoting competition. Overall, the CPEs
assessed outcomes in all four countries as moderately satisfactory, but the impact of the
Bank on the subsector was limited. In none of the countries was the Bank’s role central
to sector development. Bank support was more opportunistic than based on a medium-
to long-term sector strategy.

IFC was largely absent from the sector, in part because of a lack of interest from the
governments to promote private power on terms that would be attractive to potential
investors. Similar to the road sector, there is a strong rationale for the Bank to support
the power sector, given its critical importance. In this context, the Bank also has an
established sector policy of promoting commercial operations and private participation.
However, Bank support for the sector was not central in any of the case study countries,
indicating the need to find ways to broaden and deepen its support on a sustained
basis. Unlike the roads sector, the power sector appears to elicit significant interest from
other donors and private players.

AGRICULTURE
All four reviewed countries had an established tradition of and an untapped potential
for agricultural development. The sector received significant support in all four
countries through projects designed to improve rural farm and non-farm incomes,
promote value added through agro-processing, and the creation of non-farm
employment. However, the Bank’s impact in agriculture was limited because it lacked a
strategic approach based on sector policy dialogue, and it missed opportunities for
scaling up individual project interventions. The outcomes of Bank programs were rated
unsatisfactory in Zambia and Kazakhstan and satisfactory in Bolivia and Mongolia.
However, the Bank’s main focus in both Bolivia and Mongolia was much more on
livelihoods and rural poverty alleviation rather than on commercialization and export
agriculture—areas most relevant to diversification. In Zambia, despite significant
potential in agriculture, the Bank initially did not give priority to the sector, although
the pace of Bank support picked up in the second half of the evaluation period. IFC has
only one investment—in the country’s largest agro-processing company (Zambeef), and
it did not pursue an active policy of promoting agribusiness more generally. Bank
experience in Mongolia and Bolivia points to the complementarity of rural poverty
alleviation and diversification, although a more explicit consideration of these two goals
could have provided alternative designs for the interventions. IFC’s work in Bolivia
stands out as one of the few examples of a proactive IFC role in agriculture.

CHAPTER 4
ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONEXTRACTIVE GROWTH
Overall, Bank support for agriculture did not have much impact in the sector for several
reasons, including: complex project designs; insufficient sector work; and disparate
projects in different areas that lacked synergies. Most importantly, individual projects
reflected opportunistic financing rather than being based on a well-considered and
agreed sector strategy.

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
In all RRDCs, the primary target of private investors quite naturally is the extractives
sector. However, the extractive sectors rarely generate much employment. Dutch
Disease, combined with the typical obstacles to doing business act as barriers to
attracting investments in nonextractive sectors. In addition, there are often insufficient
linkages by extractive sectors with domestic industry in terms of supply chains and sub-
contracting. Thus, making nonextractive sectors attractive to private investors has been
an important part of the Bank Group strategy in all four countries.

Private sector development (PSD) was a specific area of Bank Group programs in all
CPE countries, but with significant variation in emphasis with regard to the
components. The Bank Group approach to PSD in all four countries can be divided into
three components: (i) improving the business environment; (ii) promoting access to
finance, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and (iii) directing
investments in sectors with greater employment potential. Within this broad
framework, this was an area of shared responsibility between the Bank and IFC, with
the Bank generally focusing on the business environment and IFC on investments.
Regarding access to finance, the Bank generally focused on the broader financial sector
issues, and IFC on making finance accessible to SMEs.

All four CPEs rated outcomes for PSD negatively. Two common reasons stand out in all
countries: limited strategic thinking on PSD in general, and insufficient collaboration
between the Bank and IFC, with often parallel and uncoordinated efforts, lacking
consideration of relative comparative advantage and synergies. Instruments such as
risk-sharing, guarantees, credit information, and so on, did not receive the attention
necessary when the credit risk seemed to have been a bigger constraint than the
availability of finance. IFC had a rather limited net effect in promoting investments in
the nonextractive industries even though it made relevant efforts.

Business environment. Improving the business environment was a specific area of Bank
focus in Bolivia and Zambia. In both countries, the Bank carried out significant analytic
and advisory activities (AAA) work to influence government policies, but with little
impact. In Zambia, the Bank funded a number of studies dealing with competitiveness
issues. Based on extensive consultations with the public and private sectors, the studies
identified the critical policy and institutional constraints to attracting private

                                                                                   CHAPTER 4
                                          ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONEXTRACTIVE GROWTH
investments in specific subsectors. The studies, however, did not find much traction in
the government, in part because each had a long list of similar recommendations
without adequate assessment of sequencing and implementation. They also lacked
ownership within the government. Further, there are questions about the utility of
subsector analysis without addressing the broader issues of competitiveness affecting
the entire economy. IFC’s limited involvement in the sector studies was a missed
opportunity: its experience in dealing with potential investors could have provided
valuable inputs, and the Bank’s work could have been exploited by IFC in its
investment promotion efforts. IFC’s work on the business environment was primarily
related to regular updates of the Doing Business (DB) indicators. Despite formal
improvement in DB indicators in three of the four case study countries, the Independent
Evaluation Group observed a clear disconnect between the rankings and the actual
perceptions of main participants and observers on the ground, including IFC staff,
about the state of the business environment.

Access to finance by SMEs is often a challenge, and the four CPE countries were no
exception. However, the financial sector in RRDCs did not have a liquidity problem,
given the growing revenues from extractive industries. The main constraint to SME
finance was not availability of financing, but access. The Bank’s role, as noted, was to
ensure the soundness of the financial sector, and the joint Bank–IMF Financial Sector
Assessment Program proved to be a valuable instrument in this regard in all four
countries. In Kazakhstan and Mongolia, the financial sector faced serious issues of
significant non-performing loans (NPLs), 2 mainly caused by the construction and real
estate bubbles generated during the commodity price boom years. In both countries, the
Bank supported reforms in the financial sector through development policy loans that
allowed the government to restructure and capitalize the troubled banks. It also
provided technical assistance and policy advice to design and implement the reform
programs. Bank policy advice was sound, but the problem of NPLs continues to linger.

In Kazakhstan, IFC supported the financial sector during the financial crisis in 2008
through the re-capitalization of the systemic banks, providing higher risk financial
instruments of equity and subordinated loans to improve the capital adequacy of client
banks. In other CPE countries, IFC focused on loans or short-term trade finance
guarantees to commercial banks for on-lending to SMEs and agribusiness, as well as
support for leasing. Experience with these IFC loans, however, was mixed. In some
cases, there was insufficient demand for IFC funds, often because the participating
banks had access to other sources of funds at more favorable terms (Zambia), or
because there was little impact beyond the benefits of the IFC financing itself
(Mongolia). The banks in Zambia cited the issue of SME creditworthiness as the
constraint, something IFC’s financing alone does not address. To complement its loan
operations, IFC also proactively supported various advisory services to SMEs, including


                                                                                         39
CHAPTER 4
ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONEXTRACTIVE GROWTH
some innovative pilot programs to work with grassroots organizations. Most of these
programs, however, have remained at the pilot level, and have not been scaled up.

The episodes of financial crises in Kazakhstan and Mongolia point to broader financial
sector issues in resource-rich countries. Increasing liquidity in the banking sector
because of growing resource rents often carries the risk of questionable investments (for
example, in real estate). This raises the question of whether the financial sector should
have been an area of Bank focus from the outset.

Promoting private investment in nonextractive sectors. IFC’s investments in
nonextractive sectors in all four countries were limited, and were generally
concentrated in the financial sector. In Bolivia, IFC made several efforts at engagement,
but the business environment was not conducive to foreign investment. The
nationalization of several IFC-financed companies in the last few years has no-doubt
left a negative perception of country risk both in the markets and within IFC. In
Zambia, IFC accomplished little beyond its investment in Zambeef and a few lines of
credit. More recently, IFC issued a Kwacha bond ($28.4 million) to deepen Zambia’s
capital market. While it has no short-term impact on private investment, it could prove
to be an important instrument in developing Zambia’s domestic capital market.
Similarly, in Kazakhstan, during the whole period reviewed, IFC made only 10
investments in non-financial sectors (including cement, tourism, furniture, health
insurance, transport, and agribusiness).


Conclusions
Economic diversification and growth of nonextractive sectors has been, and is likely to
be, an important developmental objective in resource-dependent countries and the
Bank Group strategies therein. At the same time, Bank Group strategies and studies do
not have a common definition of diversification, as well metrics to measure it. There is,
nevertheless, a common understanding that the basic policy tenet is that of using
resource rents to build up other diversified assets. The most compelling conclusion
based on recent studies, and confirmed by the practical experience of most successful
countries such as Chile, is that the most important step a government can take is to
focus on the fundamentals, that is: maintain macroeconomic stability, invest in
infrastructure, improve the business climate, encourage private investment and invest
in people. 3 In this regard, the Bank Group’s broad implicit strategy of focusing on
infrastructure, agriculture, and private sector development is relevant—although this
evaluation observed a wide variation in performance and results in each area. In this
context, the Bank Group could also help clients define a realistic diversification strategy,
taking into account constraints and opportunities in each of the three component parts,

and advised by analytical work. This review highlights a few lessons that could provide
future guidance for Bank Group support in resource-dependent countries in specific
areas.

Moving forward, it is important that the Bank define some suitable metrics that can
help guide policy discussions on the effectiveness of these interventions. As discussed,
various measures that have traditionally been used to measure diversification have
limitations. Therefore, it may be useful to have a combination of various metrics that,
taken together, can shed light on the effectiveness of the programs. These may also need
to be combined with broad measures of sector-level performance.

Infrastructure is a sector in which the Bank Group needs to maintain and expand its
presence. Most countries have growing needs in this area, and the Bank has an
advantage in providing a combined approach to both the physical and institutional
dimensions of sector development. Bank experience in infrastructure was generally
positive in all four countries reviewed. Transport (roads) and power are the most
important subsectors that have a direct bearing on private investment. However, there
is a risk of countries pursuing sub-optimal investments in response to political and
popular pressures. Thus, the focus of the Bank should continue to be on ensuring the
economic efficiency of investments and on institutional development. Other subsectors
(water and sanitation, urban services, and so on) are unlikely to feature prominently in
investor perceptions. Bank support in these areas could be primarily viewed from the
lens of social development.

Agriculture is an important sector that needs to be supported by significantly more
analytical work. Despite the well-recognized importance of the sector and its high
potential in all four CPE countries, the outcomes of Bank programs have been generally
poor. The Bank has often lacked a coherent strategic approach to the sector around
which different interventions could then be designed. In most cases, there was little
synergy between the Bank’s individual projects, thus severely diminishing their
sustainability. Agriculture is a sector in which the economic diversification objective
overlaps with rural poverty alleviation. In RRDCs, both perspectives need to be kept in
mind in the design of strategies and interventions.

The PSD strategies of the Bank and IFC need to be joint not only in their titles. The Bank
and IFC will have to formulate a coherent and actionable approach to PSD. All four
observed country strategies did not present much evidence of any real coordination or
cooperation between the two institutions. This has often meant missed opportunities,
possibly a waste of resources, and, at times, inappropriate interventions. IFC could
become more proactive in seeking out potential investors in nonextractive sectors, and
particularly in labor-intensive sectors.

5. Inclusive Growth
Inclusive growth encompasses both the Bank’s focus on its twin goals of poverty
reduction and sharing the benefits of growth, as well as the set of program
interventions that contribute to achieving these goals in a sustainable fashion. These
include: (i) the provision of social welfare and social safety nets that protect the poor
and vulnerable; (ii) human development through education to raise the productivity of
the poor and middle-income groups and health services; (iii) spatial programs of rural
and urban development that focus on enhancing the quality of life and providing
livelihoods opportunities for those who live in rural areas and urban slums; and (iv) the
promotion of environmental sustainability.

The strategies adopted in the four review countries vary in the extent to which they
have clearly internalized this set of challenges and made an informed choice about
where to focus the Bank’s efforts. The Bank program in Mongolia would seem to be a
good practice example, with a strategic approach that is targeted to poverty reduction
and shared growth; it very explicitly selects areas that will have the maximum impact.
In other countries, Bank selectivity seems more arbitrary. In Bolivia and Kazakhstan,
this seems to reflect the lack of interest of the government in Bank support in particular
areas, whereas in Zambia it is mainly the lack of traction of particular programs that the
Bank has supported in the past. In these countries however, there is a need to put the
Bank program in this pillar into a clearer strategic framework to demonstrate the likely
impact of the Bank’s interventions on the achievement of the twin goals.

The implications of resource revenues for poverty reduction and social development in
resource-rich developing countries (RRDCs) are not qualitatively different than the
challenges that all developing countries face in promoting inclusive growth. However,
the analysis of the four cluster Country Program Evaluations (CPEs) suggests the
following five areas where the Bank needs to focus more intensively in RRDCs than in
many other borrowing countries. The first area relates to the setting of the objectives,
while the others are the four key program areas needed to address the objectives in
RRDCs.

(a) Poverty focus. In the upward swing of the resource cycle, RRDC governments can
become complacent about whether the benefits of growth are reaching the poor. Vested
interests in sectors such as contracting and commercial transport become powerful and
pressure the governments to undertake the kind of public construction works (airports,
major highways, public buildings, and so on) which may have limited impact on
poverty reduction over the medium- and even the long term. In this context, the Bank



43
CHAPTER 5
INCLUSIVE GROWTH
needs to build on its diagnostic work to monitor progress and to advocate for a
continued focus on poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

(b) Social transfers. RRDC governments are likely to be under more pressure than
others to support cash transfers that allow the public at large to feel that they are
deriving their share of the benefits that flow from resource exploitation. The risk is that
these transfers are often poorly designed and do not meet their objectives. The Bank has
an important role to play in helping governments design and implement cash transfer
programs that are fiscally sustainable and that address the most urgent needs of the
poor. This becomes particularly important during the downward part of the resource
cycle when budgetary expenditures come under pressure. At such times, the Bank
needs to advocate, and may need to provide direct support, for ensuring that the safety
net for the most vulnerable is adequately funded and reaching those who are most in
need.

(c) Education and skills development. Sustained poverty reduction requires
investment in human development to build the skills and capacity needed to raise
productivity and stay competitive. The availability of substantial revenues from
mineral, oil, and gas resources in RRDCs has helped many of their governments achieve
the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of universal education coverage. Although
the importance of this should not be underestimated, there needs to be more emphasis
on enhanced education quality and skills development if the investment in human
development is to have a significant impact on productivity, competitiveness, and
poverty reduction. In this situation, the Bank needs to focus on and support
improvement in the quality of the education system and put into place an effective
monitoring system to assess quality issues.

(d) Reaching the rural poor. In many RRDCs, one sees the evolution of two different
economies—a relatively prosperous, rapidly-growing urban economy with an
expanding population, infrastructure, and large amounts of both public and private
investment on the one hand, and a rural economy that is a backwater with stagnant
productivity and little investment (other than for a primary school classroom) on the
other. Most of the poverty is concentrated in the rural sector, where governments often
lack the structures and instruments for reaching the rural poor. To support inclusive
growth, the Bank needs to provide a focus on rural poverty, including piloting
approaches for reaching the rural poor, and supporting the scaling up of successful
approaches.

(e) Environmental impact. In many RRDCs, the extractive sectors are often a direct
cause of environmental degradation, which needs to be addressed through effective
regulations and monitoring. The Bank therefore needs to supplement its regular

Outcomes and World Bank Group Contribution
POVERTY FOCUS
The evaluation period covers the upswing of the price cycle between 2004 and 2013
(except for the global crises in the years 2008–09), when buoyant prices for oil, gas, and
minerals not only led to increased production, but also to exploration and development
of new sources. Rapid expansion and growth in the extractive sectors contributed to
relatively fast rates of growth in all four CPE countries, which led to significant poverty
reduction and improvement in most human development indicators (table 5.1). The
only area in which there was limited progress was made was inequality.

INCLUSIVE GROWTH
three of the MDGs (reduction of poverty by half; universal primary education; and
gender equality in education). Poverty data show a very impressive decline from 34 to 3
percent, 1 although the numbers are hard to confirm as the Bank’s last poverty
assessment in the country was conducted in 2004. In Mongolia, the decline in poverty
was most impressive between 2010 and 2012, falling by an average of 5 percentage
points per year. Whereas poverty has declined, the gap between rich and poor in
Mongolia has widened, with the gains in income for the better-off outstripping the
impact of rapid growth on the poor. Bolivia has seen the most impressive reduction in
extreme poverty, despite slightly lower growth rates compared to the other three
countries. This could be explained by the expansion of small businesses; growing
employment in the services sector; direct transfers to the poor from an increased share
of rents from natural gas; and shifts in the terms of trade in favor of agricultural
products from which many of the rural poor derive their income. The outlier in this
group is Zambia, where despite growth, poverty incidence remains very high. Rural
poverty, at 74 percent, is more than double the level in urban areas. There was a steady
increase in inequality over the review period, reflecting a high concentration of growth
in urban areas and among the large commercial farmers and entrepreneurial and
professional groups.

In Bolivia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan, a number of factors contributed to poverty
reduction, including a combination of: cash transfers; growth of employment in the
services sector (urban poverty); and a sustained program of outreach to rural areas with
the promotion of education, health, infrastructure, and support for livelihoods.
Productivity improvements did not seem to have played a significant role. The story in
Zambia is a complex one. Although the government did not derive much in the way of
revenues from copper mines, a great deal of additional fiscal space was created through
the country’s Highly-Indebted Poor Countries completion in 2005, as well as higher
revenues through the growth of the urban economy and commercial agriculture. While
initially there was a major expansion of expenditures on health and education, in more
recent years, resources have been used for a substantial increase in public sector salaries
and for expanding the country’s physical infrastructure. Very little growth has reached
the small farmers in rural Zambia as government expenditures have targeted mainly
the urban core of the country. As a consequence, the rural poverty headcount has
increased with population growth.

As experience in the four CPE countries shows, the direct impact of growth in extractive
industries through employment generation (directly, or indirectly, through demand for
inputs, or development of downstream processing) could be rather limited: for
example, the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia, one of the largest in the world, is
expected to cost about $20 billion to develop (until 2019). It is expected to account for
about 30 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) at full production, but

                                                                                      CHAPTER 5
                                                                              INCLUSIVE GROWTH
will have only 3,000 to 4,000 employees at that point. In addition, in most RRDCs, the
extractive industries have made little use of tradable domestic inputs, or led to the
development of downstream processing. 2 The multinational companies that develop
these resources generally have facilities elsewhere that they use for the sourcing of
inputs or processing of outputs.

The limited spill-over from extractive industries puts most of the weight on
governments to meet the expectations of the public at large. During periods of new oil,
gas, or mining development, there is increasing buildup of political pressure on
governments to meet expectations that the resources will translate rapidly into higher
incomes and provision of more and better public services. In Mongolia and Zambia,
this has made it difficult to resist populist calls for the pro-cyclical use of resources. In
both countries, governments have amplified the impact of the resource boom by
running up sizeable budget deficits, using expansionary monetary policies, and
borrowing abroad. The Bank’s role in this situation is to ensure that government
revenues derived from natural resources are used in ways that maximize their impact
for achieving sustainable poverty reduction.

Effective advocacy requires both analytic work and policy dialogue on poverty
reduction. Yet these have not been a prominent feature of the Bank program in most
reviewed countries. In Zambia, where the issue is most urgent, the Bank’s analytic
work on poverty culminated in the 2012 Poverty Assessment entitled Stagnant Poverty
and Inequality in a Natural Resource-Based Economy. In spite of wide dissemination, the
report seems to have had little traction. In the other three countries, some work was
done at the beginning of the evaluation period. However, there has been no subsequent
poverty analysis. The last two strategies of the Bank Group in Kazakhstan do not
mention poverty reduction as an explicit objective, nor do they track poverty indicators.

Effective poverty analysis requires reliable data on poverty, and this, in turn, implies
arrangements for monitoring through regular surveys. The Bank has been active in both
Zambia and Mongolia on supporting arrangements for collecting better poverty data,
and aligning the surveys supported by the Bank with those of the national statistics
bureaus. In Mongolia, this led to the adoption of a new methodology in 2012 to make a
quantitative assessment of poverty rates and assess poverty dynamics. This is a
noteworthy achievement compared to the mid-2000s, when the official poverty
numbers were estimated using inconsistent poverty lines—and drawing erroneous
conclusions on poverty trends over time.

SOCIAL TRANSFERS
Developing country governments provide cash transfers in several ways, among them:
(i) the pension system to the elderly; (ii) unconditional cash transfers (which can be


                                                                                            47
CHAPTER 5
INCLUSIVE GROWTH
universal, but are usually social welfare payments to vulnerable groups); and (iii)
conditional cash transfers that promote the achievement of various educational- or
health-related goals.

The Bank has been actively engaged in policy advice and analysis on pensions in three
of the four countries reviewed. Advice on pension reform was an important part of the
Bank’s policy dialogue in Kazakhstan, driven by strong demand from the government. 3
The Bank also conducted timely analytical work at the request of the Mongolian
government to evaluate the pension scheme and propose policy reforms.

In addition to pensions, countries need to put into place comprehensive social safety
nets. This is becoming an increasingly urgent issue in many RRDCs, where
governments are under growing pressure to spread the natural resource wealth in the
most direct and efficient manner. A key element in the Bank approach has been to
advocate for programs targeted to the poor. This reflects the evidence that universal
programs have substantial leakages of funds to the non-poor and are likely to be fiscally
unsustainable. Moreover, targeted programs are difficult to administer, require
information on incomes, and are subject to elite capture and diversion of resources. In
addition to policy advice, this has meant that governments would need to put in place
the administrative capacity for effective implementation.

The difficulty of moving in this direction is evidenced by the Bank’s engagement with
the Mongolian government over its universal Child Money Program (CMP). In 2005,
the CMP was introduced on a targeted basis, and in 2006, it was expanded to universal
coverage. The Bank’s analytical work clarified for policy makers the limited impact of
the universal program on poverty reduction—and its fiscally high and unsustainable
cost. As a result, the government adopted the Social Welfare Law (SWL) in 2012 to
overhaul the system through the introduction of the Poverty Targeted Benefit (based on
a proxy means test), and a substantial consolidation of benefit programs. However, this
became a contentious issue in the subsequent election and, to date, the law has still not
been implemented.

Given its importance for both fiscal stability and poverty reduction, the Bank needs to
be involved in supporting the design of appropriately scaled and efficient cash transfers
in RRDCs. Politically, it is often difficult to withdraw a benefit once it has been given.
Therefore, it is important that the Bank engage with governments during the early
phases of resource exploitation when significant revenues begin to flow into the budget.
In this way, it can help governments design a modular approach that can be expanded
over time in relation to fiscal affordability. In addition, the Bank needs to assist
governments in carrying out periodic monitoring and evaluation regarding the poverty
impact of fiscal transfers. Bank engagement in this area with RRDCs is especially

important given the inherent instability of mineral and oil resource revenues, and the
likelihood that when price or production shocks occur, poorly designed transfer
programs will not be sustainable. 4

EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
All of the CPE countries were making substantial progress toward achieving the access
to education objectives of the MDGs. The growing concern (especially in the poorer
countries) was that the system was not meeting the needs of the labor market
(producing the new skills that a rapidly growing and diversifying economy was likely
to require) and achieving the productivity gains necessary to escape poverty and reduce
vulnerability. Bank programs in all countries concentrated on improving education
quality, mainly primary and secondary. However, there were very few attempts to
address skills development and vocational training. 5

In spite of a relatively limited role for the Bank in Kazakhstan, it has had a visible
impact in basic education, where it focused on supporting the government’s efforts to
improve quality. The Bank’s contribution is widely credited by the Independent
Evaluation Group’s interlocutors in introducing universal pre-school education. The
Bank has made a major contribution to enhancing the quality of primary education in
Mongolia through policy dialogue and its lending program. Bank projects introduced
reforms in rural primary schools that are now being scaled up at the national level
through government policies. In Bolivia, the Bank had traditionally successfully
supported primary education reform, as well as education decentralization. During the
evaluation period, the Bank shifted its support from national reforms to smaller scale
municipal pilots, as the then new government showed little interest in policy reform
and Bank assistance. The possibility of the pilot programs to serve as a testing ground
for broader reforms has not materialized, as the government has not been interested in
sectorwide reforms.

The Bank’s involvement in improving the quality of education has achieved an
important first step of building awareness, but it now needs to move to a second stage.
The Bank is playing an important role in keeping the focus on quality and on helping
governments develop programs in this area. This would seem to be a major
comparative advantage of the Bank. However, to move beyond advocacy, the Bank
needs to strengthen its analytic work to identify the steps needed for better quality and
curriculum reform, help put monitoring systems in place, and evaluate the structure of
secondary and tertiary educational institutions and the policy framework for skills
development.

CHAPTER 5
INCLUSIVE GROWTH
REACHING THE RURAL POOR
In most of the reviewed countries, poverty is becoming more and more concentrated in
the rural areas. The key cities and mining towns benefit more directly from the earnings
from natural resources. Their incomes rise with the demand for labor in construction
and services. The traditional farming population is often poorly placed to meet the
additional demand for more and better quality foodstuffs and other crops. As a
consequence, they benefit little from this growth, except through labor migration and
remittances. The evidence suggests that an active program of rural development and
the promotion of agricultural value chains is needed to achieve a significant impact on
rural poverty.

The most striking example of Bank support for rural development comes from
Mongolia, where rural living conditions have dramatically changed for the better since
the mid-2000s. The Bank’s program covers several activities that seem well coordinated
on the ground and have jointly produced important learning and synergies. Mission
evidence suggests that the rural program as a whole merits recognition as best practice.
Bank-supported projects created synergies that reinforced support for higher living
standards for herder households, and the adaptation of the traditional nomadic way of
life in a modern, growing economy. 6

Some important lessons for future livelihood support can be derived from these country
studies. The Mongolia experience shows the impact that the Bank can have through a
holistic approach to rural development, capturing the synergies from a number of
separate programs focused on rural development. The Bank is following a similar
approach in its program in Bolivia. The poverty assessment in Zambia takes the
opposite line, arguing that: “marginal improvements in economic and social indicators
can be accomplished through targeted interventions in the rural economy, but
enduring, structural income growth and the widespread reduction of poverty will only
be achievable through broad-based employment creation in the urban industrial and
service sectors.” The cross-country view which this cluster CPE enables, would strongly
support the argument that this is not an either/or proposition. An entirely urban-
focused program would leave a large reservoir of rural poverty in countries such as
Zambia, and some of the newly-emerging RRDCs for many years into the future.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
The four countries in the cluster have all been richly endowed with natural resources,
including land, forests, water, and biodiversity. In every case, their rich natural
endowment has been gradually degrading under a variety of pressures arising from
their unregulated economic development, ranging from overgrazing and the expansion
of the agricultural frontier, to the growth of air and water pollution from industrial and

                                                                          INCLUSIVE GROWTH
extractive activities. Some of these pressures have been aggravated by the countries’
vulnerability to climate change, with the attendant increase in the frequency of extreme
weather events. In every case, the countries’ response had been limited by inadequate
policy frameworks and weak institutional capacity to enforce the applicable
environmental laws and regulations. Underlying these common elements, each country
was facing a set of very specific challenges.

The mitigation of extractive industry environmental impacts was a major focus in
Zambia and Mongolia, and was addressed through safeguards in Kazakhstan. In
Zambia, the Copperbelt Environment Project mitigated environmental liabilities to
facilitate the privatization of the copper industry. However, continuing reports about
mining sector chemical spills have raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of
the benefits. In Mongolia, a wide array of complementary components in various
projects have helped to deepen the understanding of the potential impacts of mining
development, strengthen the policy and institutional framework, and prepare the
infrastructure for managing the environmental and social impacts of mining. In
addition, the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) involvement with Mongolia’s
two largest mining projects provides comfort that their environmental and social
management provisions are in line with international norms. In Kazakhstan, the Bank
and IFC’s early petroleum projects helped to: successfully update enterprise
environmental and social policies and procedures; introduced sophisticated pollution
abatement technologies; and cleaned up past damage.

The strengthening of the institutional and policy framework for the environment was
part of every Bank intervention. In Bolivia, the Bank helped create institutions and
organizations needed to manage and conserve biodiversity. In Zambia, Bank projects
helped strengthen national park management and environmental control capacity.
Nevertheless, the long-term sustainability of these projects’ achievements has been
affected by a lack of general support from the government for policy, legal, and
institutional reforms. In Mongolia, the Bank directly contributed to the expansion of the
Ministry of Environment’s mandate and power, and helped promote the development
of a vibrant civil society constituency. In Kazakhstan, the successful remediation of past
legacy issues 7 helped strengthen the capacity of key environmental agencies. Indeed,
their continuing sustainability appears assured by their very visible success and
continuing government support.


Conclusions
In all four RRDCs, the commodity price boom and economic growth led to broad
improvements in poverty and human development indicators, but also led to a

INCLUSIVE GROWTH
widening income gap and rising inequality. The outcomes of Bank Group activities
aimed at helping countries share the benefits of growth with the wider population and
improve human development outcomes were generally positive (with the exception of
Bolivia, because of a fundamental mismatch with the interests of the line ministries).
This occurred despite the generally small (and declining) size of Bank programs in these
areas and the diminishing interest of the authorities. The reasons for a given country’s
lack of enthusiasm varied from general skepticism about the utility of Bank advice on
poverty and education to the unwillingness to acknowledge the persistent poverty
problem for political reasons. However, the high impact of Bank activities in these areas
relative to their size serves as proof of the Bank’s comparative advantage and global
expertise. Further, it also underlines the importance of this aspect of the Bank’s mandate
as a global development institution. The following findings emerge from the experience
in the four countries reviewed:

     •   There is a need to design a program of advocacy for poverty reduction and better
         sharing of the benefits of growth. It should be based on poverty analysis, support
         for improved data collection, and poverty monitoring.
     •   Early and sustained engagement in the design of targeted cash transfers is
         necessary. The Bank has sometimes been reluctant to intervene in this area
         because it tends to be highly politicized. Subsequently, when the fiscal situation
         deteriorates, the International Monetary Fund and the Bank have little choice
         except to condition support on a government’s agreement to change the system
         of poorly-designed transfers.
     •   There is a need to emphasize education quality and skills development as a key
         factor in raising the productivity of the poor. Although governments in all of the
         reviewed countries are putting substantial resources into the education sector,
         the benefits are less clear at this stage. 8 The Bank’s focus on quality is well
         founded. An effective start has been made through creating a consensus around
         the need for quality improvements. These efforts need to be taken to the next
         stage through broad-based programs that start with good analytic work and
         better monitoring of education outcomes. Good practice interventions such as the
         Rural Education and Development (READ) project in Mongolia should be widely
         disseminated.
     •   A well-designed rural development program should be a key feature of Bank
         involvement in RRDCs. Whereas the growth generated by extractive industries
         development generally reaches the urban areas through demand for construction
         workers and the services sector, it does not trickle down to the rural economy at
         a pace that is likely to impact poverty and living standards. Bank programs can
         help steer government expenditures and focus toward the rural economy. What
         is particularly encouraging is how successful many of the Bank rural

        development interventions have been. The Mongolian rural program is a major
        achievement and merits wider dissemination in the Bank and other countries.
    •   Continued support for the mitigating environmental impacts of extractive
        industries and dealing with past legacy issues is important. This has been an area
        of satisfactory Bank Group interventions, as it had successfully brought both the
        public and private sectors to a realization of the costs of neglect—as well as the
        impact of a better environment on the population’s quality of life.


1The poverty line in Kazakhstan is set at $2.25 per day, which is considered very low for an
upper-middle-income country (approaching a high-income country threshold).
2An exception is Botswana, where the government has required De Beers to move its
headquarters, and a significant proportion of diamond cutting and polishing, to the capital of
Gaborone.
3A report of the World Bank offered guidance on tackling the issue of income adequacy for
future pensioners in a sustainable way. It was used by the Bank and the government to inform a
high-level brainstorming session in 2012 on the topic of pension reform.
4 Chile is an example of a resource-rich country that has set aside funds generated by the sale of
natural resources to act as a hedge against the fluctuations of global commodity prices and
provide a buffer to economic crises. During the global crises of 2008–09, a large part of the
resources drawn from the Stabilization Fund allowed financing of bonus (direct unconditional
transfers) for the bottom 40 percent of the population.
5There was only one Bank project on technical and vocational training and it was in
Kazakhstan. The Technical and Vocational Education Modernization Project (FY10: ongoing,
expected to close in 2015) was too early to evaluate.
6 The Bank’s projects have changed the way herders provide for livestock pasture and fodder
needs; have access to the closest source of water; receive warnings about bad weather; buy
livestock insurance; benefit from improved primary education for their children; receive better
medical services; participate in local planning and investment decisions; and use energy to
watch television, store food, and communicate with their families by mobile telephones.
7The most famous one is the partial restoration of the Northern Aral Sea that transformed a
massive region that had become uninhabitable into one where people are returning and
restoring their livelihoods.
8In Botswana, the Finance Ministry has become increasingly frustrated by the lack of
improvement in education quality outcomes despite steady increases in expenditures in the
sector. It has decided to stop increasing outlays until the Ministry of Education can demonstrate
better quality outcomes.

6. Main Findings
This review concludes that although the challenges identified in resource-rich
developing countries (RRDCs) are not unique, they manifest themselves with particular
intensity in three closely interrelated areas: (i) management of revenues from an
exhaustible resource; (ii) growth and employment in the nonextractive sectors; and (iii)
inclusive growth and reduction of poverty. The close links between these areas need to
be defined and structured as a coherent strategy, emphasizing the areas important in a
particular country context, with a set of measurable progress indicators. 1

The over-arching strategic role of the Bank Group in RRDCs is to assist them in using
the revenues generated from natural resources efficiently, effectively, and sustainably in
support of poverty reduction and shared growth. In the four countries reviewed in this
clustered Country Program Evaluation (CPE), the Bank Group did not use a consistent
basis for choosing the issues to include in the dialogue with resource rich countries.
Each of the four stories played out in a unique way that depended on how the country
team at the time decided to react to differing country circumstances. They did not seem
to derive from any Bank-wide approach to working with RRDCs. The mineral wealth
affected country dialogues as the Bank Group adapted its strategy to the situation.
However, this was usually more in a negative way of limiting the issues that entered
into the dialogue.

The main challenge for the Bank Group in most RRDCs today is how to stay relevant
and competitive. As all of these countries are now able to raise funds from alternative
sources, including from private capital markets, the Bank Group may not have the same
ability to influence as many sectors as before. As their incomes rise, all RRDCs tend to
become more demanding clients, requiring the Bank to be prepared to develop highly
selective and flexible programs, follow strategies with a long-term horizon, and act
decisively when there is a window of opportunity. There needs to be recognition that
the Bank Group’s value proposition is no longer just its financial resources, but the
knowledge and global experience it can share with the authorities and private sector
clients, whether provided through lending, investment, or analytic and advisory work.
This may call for a more modest scope of interventions, keeping the focus on the key
challenges.

The Bank Group dialogue in RRDCs has seen intense highs and lows, yielding lessons
for a more mature relationship in the future. In some countries, there is the legacy of a
difficult past relationship and the Bank needs to overcome a residual lack of trust. As all
four countries advance on most of the development indicators and rely less on external
resources to meet their financing needs, there is an opportunity for the Bank to

                                                                                  CHAPTER 6
                                                                               MAIN FINDINGS
construct a new type of partnership based on shared goals and mutual commitment.
This partnership, however, should still allow for a collegial and candid discussion of
areas where views on policy priorities may differ.

The increasingly demand-driven nature of Bank Group programs in RRDCs and client-
led selectivity can impose limitations on fulfilling the Bank’s mandate as a global
development institution, leaving some gaps, including an insufficient amount of
attention to poverty analysis. The Bank’s programs often lacked attention to the
demand side of reforms for the sake of pleasing the client. In the future, the Bank could
be more proactive in engaging local partners to advance transparency and
accountability, as well as in contributing to the building of local capacity.

The quality of the Bank’s increasingly intensive analytic and advisory activities (AAA)
work has been consistently high, but its effectiveness has been uneven, if measured by
actual follow-up on policy advice, which was sporadic. Demand-driven, knowledge-
based programs can be useful instruments for strengthening partnerships. However,
their effectiveness can be limited by an inadequate monitoring and evaluation
framework, a lack of disclosure of policy recommendations, and insufficient
engagement by local partners.


Management of Resources
The Bank Group is well-positioned and technically equipped to effectively assist the
RRDCs in implementing policies and strengthening institutions that promote the
prudent management of natural resources. The Bank, jointly with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), should maintain a dialogue on macroeconomic and fiscal
policies and help countries build fiscal buffers during the upswing phase of commodity
prices. It should be prepared to step in with exceptional budget support in case of an
abrupt downturn in prices. Further, it would be important to undertake analysis to
develop realistic contingency plans for dealing with price downturns. Fiscal rules
proved to be useful in this regard. However, even in the absence of such rules, the Bank
could systematically monitor and analyze performance and provide governments and
the public with this information, as well as information on the performance of key
comparator countries.

Policy consensus across the political spectrum is a critical ingredient for success in the
sustainable management of natural resource revenues. The Bank can contribute to
promoting this consensus by building relationships of personal trust and capacity
building at key government agencies. It also can encourage public demand for reforms

CHAPTER 6
MAIN FINDINGS
through the engagement of local stakeholders and a wide dissemination of policy
advice.

Bank Group support for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process
was an effective demand-side instrument, and a visible platform for civil society to
discuss and demand more transparency and accountability. Experience with the EITI
confirms its usefulness as an effective instrument for promoting transparency and
accountability, even beyond the extractives sector.


Economic Diversification and Nonextractive Growth
Economic diversification and the growth of nonextractive, labor-intensive sectors
proved to be an elusive target in all of the countries reviewed. Bank Group strategies
and analytical products acknowledged the importance of economic diversification away
from extractive industries, but struggled to define diversification as a specific objective,
as well as to specify any outcome measures/indicators for it in results frameworks.
Based on the experience in these CPE countries, as well as more successful cases such as
Chile, the most important steps a government can take are focusing on the
fundamentals: maintaining macroeconomic stability, investing in infrastructure,
improving the business climate, and encouraging private investment. The Bank Group’s
implicit strategy of focusing on infrastructure, agriculture, and private sector
development was relevant. However, the effectiveness of separate elements of the Bank
Group program in these areas was highly uneven, and the impact of these interventions
in terms of achieving diversification was not evident.

All observed Bank Group country strategies did not present much evidence of any real
coordination or cooperation between the Bank and the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) on promoting economic diversification in RRDCs. This has often
meant missed opportunities for taking advantage of synergies. IFC has generally
struggled to structure investment transactions, except for the financial sector. In most
RRDCs, IFC is now one of the many funding sources available, and its value
proposition was not always clearly articulated to private companies. In the future, IFC
should take a longer-term view for its engagement in RRDCs, working with the Bank. It
should consider originating new investment transactions and advisory service projects,
in particular for infrastructure and agribusiness, where IFC has a comparative
advantage and global expertise.

                                                                                           MAIN FINDINGS

Inclusive Growth
All countries included in this cluster CPE were able to benefit from the commodity
boom of the last decade. High rates of economic growth were accompanied by
significant progress on poverty reduction and most social development indicators. At
the same time, all countries continued to grapple with growing inequality and an
increasing gap between urban and rural incomes.

To help RRDCs in promoting more inclusive growth by sharing the wealth generated
from natural resource extraction, the Bank would need to stay actively engaged in
advocacy for poverty reduction and the monitoring of its outcomes, consistent with its
mandate as a global development institution. In terms of operational engagement and
areas of advisory work, the Bank’s support to RRDCs should focus on: the design of
social transfers that are fiscally sustainable and targeted to the poor; support for better
quality education to raise productivity of the poor and develop skills; rural
development programs designed to reach those left out by extractive industry growth;
and mitigation of any adverse environmental impact of extractive industries.
