The World Bank’s biannual Mozambique Economic Update
(MEU) series is designed to present timely, concise assessments
of current economic trends in Mozambique in light of the
country’s broader development challenges. Each edition includes
a section on recent economic developments and a discussion of
Mozambique’s economic outlook, followed by focus section(s)
analyzing issues of particular importance. The focus sections
for this edition address debt, inflation and fiscal risk from public
corporations. The MEU series seeks both to inform discussions
within the Bank and to contribute to a robust debate among
government officials, the country’s international development
partners, and civil society regarding Mozambique’s economic
performance and key macroeconomic policy challenges.

The cut-off date for the current edition of the MEU is 20th of
November 2016.

The Banco de Moçambique stepped-up its
monetary tightening regime with eight consecutive

and credit levels show signs of adjustment. Goods
imports are expected to decline by 33 percent in

Nacional de Moçambique (RENAMO), has erupted owing to disagreements about the results of the 2014 general elections. The

In effect, since the CPI represents the average
consumer, it underreports the impact of higher
prices on the poor when food inflation is the
driving element. A simple restructuring of the
index is indicative in this regard. Adjusting the
weight of food products that have a significant
share of expenditure for the bottom 40 percent
provides a broad estimate of food inflation for
the poor.28 Increasing the overall weight of

28 Weights for select food items in the CPI’s food group (with an expenditure share above 5 percent) were adjusted using expenditure
weights for a computed national food bundle, based on 13 poverty food bundles.
29 The increase in weight on the food poverty index mirrors the significance of food expenditure for the bottom 40 percent.
Weights for remaining CPI categories have been adjusted but proportions to overall non-food weight are kept constant.
