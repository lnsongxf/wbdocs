We express deep gratitude to the participants of the Impact Evaluation endline surveys, and extend sincere thanks to the
country principal investigators and the research teams in Peru, Senegal, and Vietnam for operationalizing the data collection
efforts. Many thanks to Amy Pickering and Craig Kullmann for their thoughtful reviews of earlier drafts of this document.

Global Scaling Up Handwashing is a project by the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) focused on applying innovative
behavior change approaches to improve handwashing with soap behavior among women of reproductive age (ages 15–49)
and primary school-age children (ages 5–9). It was implemented by local and national governments with technical support
from WSP in four countries: Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. For more information, please visit www.wsp.org/

WSP is a multidonor partnership created in 1978 and administered by the World Bank to support poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and
sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSP’s donors include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank.

Annex 1: Supplemental Tables

 TABLE S1: DEFINITIONS OF HANDWASHING MEASURES

 Presence of Soap Anywhere in the Home

 • The indicator is defined as presence of at least one type of soap observed by the enumerator anywhere in the home.

 • Following observations of handwashing places, enumerators asked the household respondent to show soap typically
    used for washing hands, irrespective of where it was located in the home. All households that allowed observation of soap
    anywhere in the home are included in this analysis.

 Presence of Soap and Water at a Fixed Handwashing Place Used Post-Defecation

 • The indicator is defined as the presence of at least one type of soap observed by the enumerator at the handwashing place
    reportedly used after defecation.

 • Questions to describe the location of the handwashing place and materials observed at that place followed an introductory
    question regarding whether hands are usually washed after defecation. Households in which the respondents indicated
    washing hands after defecation, and where respondents allowed observation of the location of the handwashing place and
    the presence of soap and water at that place, were eligible for analysis.

 • Enumerators recorded whether the handwashing place was inside the toilet or cooking place, or elsewhere in the yard. In Peru
    and Senegal, if the handwashing place was located elsewhere in the yard, the distance from the toilet was recorded (< 3 feet
    from the toilet, 3 to 10 feet from the toilet, more than 10 feet from the toilet). In Vietnam, if the handwashing place was located
    elsewhere in the yard, enumerators recorded distance in meters, but the precoded categories approximated the ones used in
    Peru and Senegal. Enumerators recorded the type of soap present at the handwashing place. In Peru and Senegal, the types
    of soap observed were beauty bar soap, multipurpose bar soap, and powder/detergent soap. In Vietnam, the types of soap
    observed were liquid soap, multipurpose bar soap, and powder/detergent soap. For the indicator, a household was considered
    as having soap at the handwashing place if at least one type of soap, irrespective of type, was present at the handwashing
    place. The presence of water was recorded at the handwashing place, irrespective of the type of device located therein.

 Presence of Soap and Water at a Fixed Handwashing Place Used before Food Preparation

 • The indicator is defined as the presence of at least one type of soap observed by the enumerator at the handwashing place
    reportedly used before food preparation.

 • Questions to describe the location of the handwashing place and materials observed at that place followed an introductory
    question regarding whether hands are usually washed before food preparation. Observations of soap and water were carried
    out if the handwashing place used before food preparation differed from the handwashing place used after defecation.

 • Households identified as eligible for this analysis were, first, those that showed a handwashing place used before food
    preparation that was distinct from the handwashing place used after defecation, and for which observation of the location,
    soap, and water were all completed. Also included in the analysis were those households in which the handwashing place
    used after defecation was located in the kitchen and was the same place used to wash hands before food preparation.
    Households in which the respondent indicated not usually washing hands before food preparation, or that had no specific
    place for washing hands before food preparation, were also added.
                                                                                                                              (continued)

      TABLE S1: (Continued)

      Presence of Soap and Water at a Fixed Handwashing Place Used before Food Preparation

      • Questions to describe the location of the handwashing place and materials observed at that place followed an introductory
         question regarding whether hands are usually washed before food preparation. All households in which the respondents
         indicated washing hands before food preparation were eligible for analysis, and where respondents allowed observation of
         the location of the handwashing place and the presence of soap and water at that place.

      • Enumerators recorded whether the handwashing place was inside the toilet or cooking place, or elsewhere in the yard.
         The distance of the handwashing place from the cooking place was recorded similarly to the distance from the toilet, as
         described above for the postdefecation handwashing place. Soap and water observations were also recorded similarly.

      Cleanliness Index of Caregiver Hands (Index Based on Observation of Nails, Palms, and Fingerpads)

      • This is a nine-point index based on the enumerator’s observation of the cleanliness of the nails, palms, and fingerpads of
         individual caregivers. Each aspect of the hand was rated on a three-point scale, ranging from one point for visible dirt to
         three points for clean appearance. These points were totaled to compute the hand cleanliness index.

      • Caregivers who did not allow observation of one or more aspects of the hand were not included in the analysis of the
         cleanliness index. The distribution of the index scores among caregivers in the control arm is reported below. Caregivers
         were also dichotomized according to cleanliness, with an index of 7 or higher denoting “clean hands,” and an index score
         less than 7 denoting “unclean hands.”

      Self-Reported Handwashing with Soap at Critical Times during Previous Day

      • The indicator is defined as self-reported handwashing with soap at one of the four critical times during the previous day.

      • Individual caregivers were asked whether they had washed hands with soap at least once during the previous day (since the
         same time the day before the enumerator’s visit). If they reported washing hands, they were asked in an unprompted fashion
         about the context of when hands were washed with soap and all other times that hands were washed with soap during the
         previous day. Although information about a number of critical times was captured, those of principal interest are as follows:
         after fecal contact, before food preparation or cooking food, before eating, or before feeding a child.

      • Caregivers described as being alone at the time of the interview were included in the analysis, because the presence of
         others may have influenced caregivers’ responses to handwashing questions.

      Observed Handwashing with Soap at Critical Times

      • Structured observation data can be analyzed and reported in numerous ways. Here, handwashing behavior was analyzed
         at the caregiver level, rather than at the household level. Observed handwashing behavior is reported below for each event,
         overall and by type of critical event observed. The events of interest were the same as those for self-reported handwashing
         behavior: after fecal contact, before food preparation, before eating, and before feeding a child. In particular, behavior as
         measured among primary caregivers is reported.
