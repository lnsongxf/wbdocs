THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      registration of the company with the Oman Chamber of Commerce and
      Industry.

      To register with the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the
      applicant submits a completed application form, along with the
      company statutes and pays the relevant fees depending on the grade of
      the company. The payable fees are as follows:
      - For a company of Excellent grade, i.e. startup capital of OMR 250,000
      or more, the registration fees are OMR 585 and the annual renewal fees
      are OMR 279.
      - For a company of First grade, i.e. startup capital between OMR
      100,000 and 249,000, the registration fees are OMR 225 and the annual
      renewal fees are OMR 108.
      - For a company of Second grade, i.e. startup capital between OMR
      50,000 to 99,000, the registration fees are OMR 128 and the annual
      renewal fees are OMR 73.
      - For a company of Third grade, i.e. startup capital between OMR
      25,000 to 49,000, the registration fees are OMR 78 and the annual
      renewal fees are OMR 45.
      - For a company of Fourth grade, i.e. startup capital between OMR
      3,000 to 24,000, the registration fees are OMR 33 and the annual
      renewal fees are OMR 25.

      The company must then obtain the license from the Municipality of
      Muscat before commencing business operations and pay the fees of
      OMR 15. To do so, the applicant must submit a completed application
      form, along with the following documents:

        The client submits (initial) application for electricity connection and
        awaits estimate of connection fees from Muscat Electricity
        Distribution Company (MEDC)

        Along with the application form, the client needs to submit the following
        documents to Muscat Electricity Distribution Company (MEDC):
        • Copy of ID card
        • Company registration number
        • Title deed (proof of ownership)
        • Building permit
        • Zoning plan at scale 1:2500
        • Details of the load requested
        • Copy of the license of the electrician in charge of the internal wiring
        • No Objection Letter from Muscat Municipality (needed for final
   1    connection, so can be obtained simultaneously with the rest of the        10 calendar days             OMR 0
        process)

        In this case, it is a simple, large-load connection, so there is no need to
        upgrade the system.
        The utility then inspects the site and prepares an estimate of the
        connection fees. The inspectors will ensure the safety of the internal
        wiring and determine the best way to connect the building to the main
        distribution lines.

        After that, an account is opened for the client for billing and referral
        reasons and a payment voucher is issued that is to be paid at the bank
        for the connection charges that the client will need to pay. The client will
        then need to show a copy of the receipt to the utility so that works can
        start.

      The utility’s area inspectors will visit the concerned site to inspect the
      internal wiring and propose the best possible way to connect the
      building to the main distribution lines.
      If the network is not available in the area, then MEDC will need to obtain
      the necessary approvals to get the network close to the warehouse. This       1 calendar day      OMR 1,600
