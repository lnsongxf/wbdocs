BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Sindh is the second most populated province of Pakistan. Over 60 percent of the population live in rural areas, and their main source of livelihood is agriculture. Sindh
has over 5.8 million hectares of irrigated land, and over 800,000 farms. The average farm size is small, and over 93 percent have less than seven ha corresponding to
64 percent of total farm area. The progressive development of irrigated agriculture since 1960 allowed the country to support its growing population because of the
impressive achievements in turning dry arid lands into intensively cultivated and settled areas. In a context of urbanization, climate change, and a growing population,
competition for water between hydropower, industry, domestic use, the environment and other uses is intensifying. While the need for more efficient water use applies
to all sectors of the economy, it applies to agriculture in particular because the sector consumes 95 percent of the country’s water resources. Currently, in the canal-
irrigated areas, the average delivery efficiency is 35 to 40 percent from the canal head to the root zone – much of the losses (68%) happening at farm level.

The objective of the Project is to improve irrigation water management at tertiary and field levels in Sindh. Key outcome indicators are:
■■   Improve watercourse conveyance efficiency
■■   Improve field application of water
■■   Improve cropping intensity
■■   Improve yields
■■

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   Over 500 watercourses are under various stages of construction/rehabilitation out of the total target of 5,500
■■   To save lives and livelihoods, 380 flood risk mitigation platforms have been planned. Of this 67 have been identified and 21 have been cleared for construction.
■■   Under High Efficient Irrigation Systems installation 22 applications have been received against the target of 2,600 for 35,000 acres. Similarly for the target of 48
     HEIS Demonstrations 31 applications have been received.
■■   For a total of 11,000 laser land levelers, 1,590 eligible applications have been received and 322 awards have been made.
■■   Of the 3 Consultant teams, 2 are on board.
■■   Most of the counterpart staff are in place and PIU and field offices are operational

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
A major part of Sindh’s population lives in rural areas, where poverty is pervasive. The rural poor tend to be employed mostly as agriculture wage workers. Irrigation and
drainage are crucial to Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture, without which the countryside would be desert or salt fields. The Indus Basin Irrigation System is now the largest
integrated irrigation network in the world. Returns to irrigation are high in Pakistan but investment for the last 30 years has been weak. Despite the large need to expand water
supplies, improve water management and control, and to upgrade and modernize the century old irrigation system, investment has not been forthcoming and the network
has deteriorated. The government must maintain a minimum level of spending on the sector to avoid total collapse of its irrigation and drainage systems, which would return
the countryside to desert that would be hard, if not impossible, to ever reclaim. The Water Sector Improvement Phase-I Project would make a start through a mix of institutional
strengthening, capacity building and investments in the irrigation sector. This project consolidates the irrigation reforms program and makes it sustainable through participatory
irrigation management practices.
The project development objective is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of irrigation water distribution, particularly with respect to reliability, equity and user satisfaction
in three Area Water Boards namely: Ghotki Canal, Left Bank Canals and Nara Canal. The project covers about 1.8 million hectares, or more than 30 percent of the irrigated area
in Sindh, one of the poorest regions of the country. Main components:
■■   Finances capacity building for the Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority (SIDA), Area Water Boards, and Farmer Organizations, enabling them to perform their responsi-
     bilities according to the Sind Water Management Ordinance of 2002.
■■   Finances rehabilitation of main and branch canals, secondary level canals and drainage system. Improved and modern water measurement and accounting system
     installed throughout the canal systems in Ghotki, Nara, and Left Bank canals.
■■   Finances a feasibility study for rehabilitation of the Gudu Barrage, and assistance to prepare studies for rehabilitation of Sukkur and Kotri barrages; preparing a regional
     master plan to deal with floods and drainage issues on the left bank of the Indus river; and designing a measure to improve the Indus delta and the coastal zone

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Agricultural productivity has increased on a total of 1.17 million hectares, benefiting over 380,000 farm-families.
■■   Better irrigation helped farmers shift to higher-value crops such as orchard and vegetables.
■■   Works on the two large ICB civil works contract are completed. All major hydraulic structures have been commissioned. The overall quality of structures and mechanical
     works seen during the recent supervision mission are commendable, the earthworks on embankments are satisfactory, and the quality of construction is high.
■■   Farmer organization training in operational areas. Women’s participation in farmer’s organizations enhanced.
■■   During the past 12 months procurement of three large ICB contracts has been completed (total contracts cost of US$90 million). The rehabilitation of three main canals is
     ongoing:
■■   The implementation of the Ghotki main canal contract (completion February 2018) is expected to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of irrigation water supplies on
     890,000 acres benefiting 120,000 farming households.
■■   The implementation of the Fulleli main canal contract (completion March 2018) is expected to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of irrigation water supplies on 1.1
     million acres benefiting 140,000 farming households.
■■   The implementation of the Mitharo main canal contract (completion May 2018) is expected to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of irrigation water supplies on
     667,000 acres benefiting 87,000 farming households.
■■   Overall progress of the other components is on track, and the Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority (SIDA), Area Water Boards (AWBs) and field offices are staffed and
     have the necessary funding. Logistical support is in place to support the formation and capacity building of the three AWBs and Farmers Organizations (FOs). Abiana (=ir-
     rigation water fees) recovery rates are steadily increasing and there is strong ownership among the farmers. FOs have received training in operation and maintenance, and
     abiana assessment and collection.
■■   Disbursement of the second credit (additional financing) is 15% as per the forecast for FY16.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Pakistan is becoming water-scarce with a growing gap between demand and supply. The future impacts of climate change will pose not just an environmental
challenge but also a fundamental threat to economic development and the fight against poverty. Continuing business-as-usual is likely to contribute to Pakistan’s
economic woes. To close the gap between water supply and water demand, Pakistan is placing emphasis on modernizing its ageing hydraulic infrastructure and
improving water resources management.
Barrages are strategic assets of Sindh and millions of people depend on the water that is controlled, diverted, and managed by them. Their continued operation and
management require specific expertise, experience, decision making, and continuity. Three large barrages were built between 1932 and 1962 on the Indus River in
Sindh Province. The northern one, Guddu barrage, has developed major safety issues. This project will finance rehabilitation of the Guddu barrage. The Guddu barrage
constitutes the most strategic component of the large Indus Basin Irrigation System. The effective operations and structural stability are important for agricultural
production and for averting potential disaster during floods. Climate variability will further add risks by changing the frequency and intensity of extreme events such
as floods and droughts. There are serious operational difficulties and safety issues. The most severe problems include: (a) up to 60 percent of the steel used for the 65
gates on the main barrage are badly rusted; and (b) the lifting mechanisms are badly corroded, with a strong possibility of failure. Since the rate of corrosion cannot be
slowed it is considered likely that the gates will fail during normal operation. There is already a risk now that the gates may fail during a flood event that necessitates
opening and closing. Such a failure will progressively affect water supplies to all the irrigated areas supplied by the barrage. Structural and operational interventions
are therefore required to manage flows to the off-taking canals. The project is fully aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which has the overarching goal
of helping Pakistan accelerate poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The major expected impact of the project will be sustained agricultural production and farm
incomes in the barrage command area.
The project objective are to improve the reliability and safety of the Guddu barrage and strengthen the Sindh Irrigation Department’s capacity to operate and manage
the barrage. The primary beneficiaries include (a) over 2.6 million people, across 1.2 million ha who will receive reliable supply of water and (b) local communities in
flood-vulnerable areas who will benefit from improvement in flood management and reduction in risks of embankment breaches; since the capacity of the barrage to
pass flood waters will be improved.

Component A: Rehabilitation of the Guddu Barrage. This component will support rehabilitation of the barrage and its associated structures. Component B: Improved
Barrage Operation. Component C: Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project became effective in November 2015 and is still in an early phase of implementation. Most of the results will be achieved by 2020. The project includes
three civil works contracts: two large ICB contracts (G2 for replacement of barrage gates, mechanical and electrical equipment, repair works on main barrage structure
and construction of divide wall; G3 for River Training Works) and one NCB contract (G1 rehabilitation and construction of operation and maintenance offices and staff
colony). For the G1 contract only one bid was received and this bid was canceled. This contract will be merged into the G2 contract. Three bids were received for the
largest ICB contract (G2) on 25 August and evaluation of the bids is ongoing.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     BThe development objective of the Sindh Agricultural Growth Project for Pakistan is to improve the productivity and market access of small and medium producers in
     important commodity value chains. This is to be achieved by:
     ■■   Investing in knowledge and technology for producers, sub-sectors of crops and livestock
     ■■   Strengthening public sector institutions to enhance the enabling environment for sustained sectoral growth.
     High demand is demonstrated for the project from Sindh farmers because it prioritizes small producers with commercial potential. The SAGP will focus on horticulture—
     particularly chilies (92 percent of national production), onions (33 percent), and dates (about 50 percent)—and milk production because they have a small farmer focus,
     have significant involvement of women in production and processing, and, from a national perspective, Sindh enjoys the greatest competitive advantage in these
     pro-poor production value chains.

     EXPECTED RESULTS:
     Though the project was slow to start, there has been steady progress in project implementation. The Government of Sindh has taken a number of actions to address the
     project management issues that were holding back project performance, including initiating the process of formulating the Sindh Policy and Strategy for Agriculture
     Sector, which is a key activity of the project.
     The IP and PDO ratings are Moderately Satisfactory.
     ■■   20% increase in yields for selected commodities (dates, onions, chilies)
     ■■   20% increase in aggregate sales of selected commodities for targeted beneficiaries

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Punjab Public Management Reform Program (PPMRP) is the first Program-for-Results (P4R) in Pakistan and the first in public sector governance in the South Asia
region. The Program Development Objective is to improve transparency and resource management of targeted departments of the province of Punjab. The project has
the following three result areas:
■■   Transparency and access to services to improve citizens’ access to information provided by targeted departments and facilitate access to key services.
■■   Monitoring of service delivery to support performance management and make performance information available to decision-makers.
■■   Resource mobilization and value for money to improve the province’s capacity to mobilize resources through better urban immovable property tax collection and
     to better manage expenditure through procurement reforms.
Key interventions include the following:
■■   Promoting proactive disclosure of information required under the Punjab Right to Information Act (RTI Act) on government websites. Facilitating access to infor-
     mation about public services through call centers.
■■   Monitoring the performance of public service providers through smart phones and real-time data analysis through management dashboards.
■■   Building a digital property tax data base and introducing a procurement management information system.
■■   Making public procurement more efficient through systematic tracking and analysis of all procurement processes in a Management Information System

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
All of the Program’s targets for the Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs) for the first two years of implementation have been achieved or exceeded, as confirmed by
Third Party Validation (TPV) reports. According to data to be verified by the next TPV report, the DLI targets for the third year, which ended on June 30, 2016, were also
achieved. Progress towards the Program’s Development Objective is on track. Key results to date:
■■   Webpages for 53 government organizations have been created and have been publishing accurate institutional information
■■   A Citizen Contact Center is established and provides information by phone and email to citizens’ enquiries on 27 public services.
■■   The delivery of four public services provided by the education, health, and livestock departments is being tracked in real time thanks to data collected through
     smartphones from all 36 districts and reported on management dashboards. Another two services, including agriculture extension, were added during the third
     year of the program, bringing the total to six services.
■■   The urban property records of six districts, where the province’s largest cities are located, have been digitized and over 300,000 additional properties have been
     included. This enabled the Government to issue automated invoices for the Urban Immovable Property Tax (UIPT) for the first time in 2015 and contributed to an
     increase in UIPT receipts of more than two thirds over the past three years. The digitization of urban property records in the remaining 30 districts is expected to
     be completed in the current (fourth) year of implementation.
■■   A public procurement Management Information System has been developed and is used by 65 government departments to track their procurement activities.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     This operation combines a single-tranche stand-alone IDA DPC of US$ 500 million and an IBRD policy-based guarantee (PBG) in the amount of US$ 420 million
     to support commercial financing by Pakistan. The operation has two development objectives: (i) improving the business environment and (ii) enhancing fiscal
     management by improving revenue management and making public spending more pro-poor. After successfully restoring macroeconomic stability, supported by
     the previous FSIG DPC series, the Government of Pakistan is stepping up efforts through deeper reforms and an accelerated pace of implementation. Implementation
     continues in important areas that have been supported by previous operations, such as the removal of discriminatory tax exemptions and efforts to improve the
     business environment. Reform efforts are becoming more granular and focusing on more difficult aspects. For example in order to expand the tax base and improve
     tax compliance, FBR is reforming its approach to audits and is increasing its focus on large taxpayers. Efforts to reform SOEs are going beyond privatization transactions
     and focusing on reforming whole sectors and improving the information base for both privatization and SOE reform.

     The operation supported a significant overhaul of the legislative and institutional framework of the financial sector. The Government has adopted a revised poverty
     line, which increases the poverty headcount from below 10 percent to almost 30 percent. The WBG will support the country’s efforts to develop the financial sector and
     facilitate Pakistan’s access to international markets. The operation and the choice of instruments are well-aligned with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing
     for Development adopted in July 2015, with a strong focus on domestic resource mobilization as well as the use of multilateral development finance to leverage
     additional resources from the private sector.

     EXPECTED RESULTS:
     To measure results, the following outcome indicators will be used:
     ■■   In the Doing Business 2018 report, the Distance to Frontier Indicator for Getting Credit will have increased to 50.
     ■■   By March 2017, the number of taxpayers who submit a tax return online will have increased to 773,000.
     ■■   By June 2017, listed capital in capital market will have increased by 15 percent to PKR 1.46 trillion
     ■■   By 2017, housing finance market will have increased to 2 percent as a percentage of private sector credit.
     ■■   By 2016, consolidated SOE financial information will be available to the public.
     ■■   By end June 2016, State Life Insurance Corporation will be subject to the same rules as other corporate insurance companies by complying with Companies
          Ordinance 1984.
     ■■   By June 2017, the overall tax collection is at least 12.2 percent of GDP.
     ■■   By June 2017, the share of foreign debt as a percentage of total public debt is between 20-35 percent, in line with the Medium-Term Debt Strategy.
     ■■   By June 2017, the number of households with updated poverty scorecard information registered in the National Socio-Economic Registry will have reached 2.5
          million.
     ■■   By June 2016, the Government of Pakistan will have published a new poverty rate using the latest data (2013/14) along with trends in poverty on old line.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Punjab, with 60 percent of the total population, holds the key to Pakistan’s progress towards attaining the MDGs. Punjab’s overall health outcomes are comparable
to the national average or slightly better than other provinces, but the pace of change remains slow and uneven with significant disparities among regions, rural and
urban areas, and by economic status. The quality of care in government facilities is sub-optimal, resulting in low use of health services provided by the public sector. The
Government of Punjab has prepared the Punjab Health Sector Strategy (HSS) 2012-2020, based on the health system framework, outlining a clear strategic direction
focused on results. The project envisages supporting implementation of the reforms and strengthening the health system to undertaking stewardship functions
devolved under the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.
The project development objective is to support implementation of the Punjab Health Sector Strategy by focusing on improving coverage and use of quality essential
health services, particularly in low performing districts of Punjab. The project focuses on building the capacity and systems to strengthen accountability and stewardship
in the Department of Health (DoH), and uses a results-based approach (DLIs). The project is also supported by $20 million from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund
and $1.5 million for impact evaluation of the pilots. The project has four components:
■■   To enhance coverage and quality of and access to an essential package of health care services, including outreach and community-level interventions for primary
     health care (PHC). The Bank’s technical engagement and monitoring will focus on the following thematic areas: integrated management of maternal, neonatal
     and child health and lady health worker programs, nutrition services, and HIV/AIDS preventive services.
■■   To enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the health system by strengthening ongoing initiatives with a focus on management and accountability and improving
     quality of care through regulations and standardization of services (PHC contracting out, results-based district management contract, governance and account-
     ability mechanisms).
■■   To strengthen and reorganize the current DoH management system to improve stewardship, fiduciary, and monitoring functions.
■■   To support innovative pilots to guide policy development in results-based financing and alternate financing approaches.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
The success of the project is measured by the following indicators:
■■   Fully immunized children 12-23 months of age; Births attended by skilled health personnel; Modern contraceptive prevalence rate; Children 0-24 months of
     age receiving basic package of nutrition services;
■■   Issuance of a certificate of registration for public and private health facilities
■■   Community satisfaction.
Based on available data, the progress on all project development objective indicators is either fully meeting or exceeding the second year provincial level targets.
Progress by district will be analyzed when the latest Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey becomes available.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Pakistan’s maternal and child health indicators have improved, but significant challenges remain. Pakistan has made minimal progress in improving nutritional
     outcomes of children and mothers over the last four decades and has high rates of child malnutrition, with 44 percent of children being stunted and 22 percent
     severely stunted. One in five children is born with low birth weight. Micronutrient deficiencies are widespread – with high rates of iron-deficiency anemia, zinc, iodine
     folic acid and vitamin A deficiencies having a particularly damaging impact on the survival, growth, development, and productivity of pre-school children and pregnant
     women. The project development objective is to increase the coverage of interventions that are known to improve the nutritional status of children under 2, and of
     pregnant and lactating women. IDA credit of $36.24 million will finance Sindh, co-financed by a grant provided through the programmatic trust fund for the Pakistan
     Partnership for Improved Nutrition (PPIN), administered by the Bank, for Balochistan in an amount of $11.71 million. PPIN also has a commitment of 39 million
     Australian dollars from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of the Australian Government. The PPIN Trust Fund also will finance nutrition interventions
     in the province of KP. The project has four components:
     ■■   To support key nutrition interventions that address general malnutrition, mainly in pregnant and lactating women and children less than 2.. This component
          addresses: infant and young child feeding (IYCF); community management of acute malnutrition; and maternal malnutrition.
     ■■   To support vitamin and mineral interventions for women and young children. The focus is on delivery of key micronutrient supplementation (vitamin A, iron,
          iodine, folic acid and zinc) and, in Balochistan, on developing the legislative/enforcement mechanisms for food fortification.
     ■■   Pursue three types of cross-cutting communications activities that will support all the other project interventions – advocacy, mass media campaigns for behavior
          change, and inter-personal communications.
     ■■   Strengthen existing institutional capacity for nutrition at the provincial and district levels. Specifically, this component will address the following areas: staff
          complement; accountability for results; capacity building; technical assistance for service delivery; monitoring and evaluation; social accountability, and multi-
          sectoral coordination.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:
     Results will be tracked by the following indicators:
     ■■   Overall access to basic nutrition services in project areas for target beneficiaries;
     ■■   Percentage of children 6-23 months fed in accordance with all three IYCF practices;
     ■■   Percentage of pregnant women and of lactating women receiving iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
In response to militancy, in June 2014 the Pakistan Army launched a second security operation in five FATA Agencies (North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Orakzai,
Kurram and Khyber) displacing approximately 340,000 families and necessitating a safety net response. With success of military operations in most areas, the
Government has started the TDPs repatriation process. The World Bank has provided support to the Government of Pakistan (GoP) through the FATA Temporarily
Displaced Persons Emergency Recovery Project (TDP ERP) to support early recovery of families affected by the militancy crisis, promote child health, and strengthen
emergency response safety net delivery systems in affected areas of FATA. The project has two main components:
■■   Early Recovery Grant (ERG) and Livelihood Support Grant (LSG). This component will aim to support the early recovery of approximately 120,000 TDP families from
     FATA through two unconditional cash grants; (i) a one-time Early Recovery Grant (ERG) of $350 per family and; (ii) a Livelihood Support Grant (LSG) of $160 per
     family in four monthly installments of $40. The LSG will be delivered through One-Stop-Shop (OSS) registration and delivery centers to be set up in FATA through
     a phased rollout.
■■   Promoting child health in selected areas of FATA. Under this component, a conditional cash grant shall be provided with intent to promote uptake of child health
     services offered to families with children aged 0-24 months through four pilot OSSs. Registration of eligible families and periodic attendance of awareness ses-
     sions at OSS will be accompanied by a Child Wellness Grant (CWG). The grant amounts to $75 provided in three installments of $25 each for promoting positive
     health seeking behavior of families for their children and World Bank support is budgeted to support 64,000 beneficiaries. Based on the learning and outcomes
     from the initial phase of testing the component in 4 OSS, the Government will decide on the roll out to other areas.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   The first six One-Stop-Shops (OSS) have been deployed in Spinwam, Razmak (North Waziristan), Sarwekai, Sararogha (South Waziristan), Milward and Dogra
     (Khyber). A total of fifteen OSS shall be established in the five affected agencies of FATA.
■■   This is the first project globally to have attained readiness under STEP. All procurement activities are now being managed through the online procurement system.
■■   The project has achieved 25 percent of targets within 4 months of the establishment of the first OSS with 30,000 TDPs served through OSS and 5,000 beneficiaries
     for the CWG (As of September 2, 2016).
■■   Initial data from the field shows that despite the use of soft conditionality (self-election of beneficiaries for use of Child Wellness Package after receiving under
     CWG), over 65 percent of beneficiaries opt to use the Package.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Government of Pakistan established the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) in 2008 to help the poor cope with income shocks by providing them with
     monthly cash transfers and other complementary programs to enhance human development and income-generating opportunities. BISP was set up as an autonomous
     institution, unanimously approved by parliament in August 2012. Over the last six years, the program has evolved into a modern social safety net system. In 2009,
     capitalizing on analytical and operational work in the country, the Bank supported strengthening BISP through a Social Protection Development Policy Credit ($150
     million) together with a Social Safety Net Technical Assistance Project ($60 million). This support enabled the government to establish appropriate institutional,
     governance, and accountability arrangements for providing targeted safety nets to the poor. The TA project, among others, supported the national roll out of a targeting
     system using the Proxy Means Test-based Poverty Scorecard via a door-to-door census. The project also helped the government create a National Socio-Economic
     Registry comprising information on more than 27 million households (approximately 170 million people) – identifying 6.4 million eligible families (bottom 20
     percent of population). It provided payments to more than 5.3 million families, of which more than 95 percent receive payments through modern technology based
     mechanisms. To expand coverage of safety net cash transfers and to support in setting up conditional cash transfers linked to primary education, the project was
     restructured with additional financing ($150 million) in March 2012. The restructured project has supported expansion and strengthening of the country’s safety net,
     with particular focus on the Education CCT. The project components are:
     ■■   Establish a National Targeting System and Expand Coverage of the Basic Safety Net System.
     ■■   Strengthen Safety Net Operation: Supports institutional development and implementation of the communication strategy, grievance redressal for cash transfers,
          strengthening payment and reconciliation mechanisms, and the design and roll out of Co-responsibility Cash Transfers linked to primary education of beneficia-
          ries’ children.
     ■■   Enhance Safety Net Program Management, Accountability, and Evaluation: Supports setting up program control and accountability mechanisms through a man-
          agement information system, third party monitoring and evaluations, and use of technology for program administration, especially for payments and grievance
          redressal.
     ■■   Develop the Social Protection and Strategy Monitoring: Supports the design of the institutional and legal framework for executing the National Social Protection
          Policy, and design and implementation of monitoring mechanisms for federal and provincial social protection programs.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   70 percent of cash transfers received by beneficiaries in bottom quintiles 1 and 2 (against 46 percent baseline, 70 percent target).
     ■■   Poverty scorecard applied to 27 million households (target achieved).
     ■■   87 percent of beneficiaries satisfied with program implementation (target of 70 percent achieved).
     ■■   Impact Evaluations attribute a 9% increase in children’s enrollment to the Education CCT
     ■■   IE also show reasonable increase in consumption and strong evidence of women empowerment including increased mobility and decision-making with the
          household.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Sindh, the most industrialized and second largest province with an estimated population of 42 million, is facing important development challenges and has yet to
     realize its full potential. Improving revenue mobilization and expenditure management performance is necessary to shift upwards the provincial curve of economic
     and social growth. While federal transfers, which constitute 70 percent of the revenues of the province, provide a significant base for provincial expenditure, federal
     transfer revenues are not adequate to finance the existing infrastructure and social development needs. The development objective of the project is to strengthen
     public-sector performance in Sindh through improved revenue generation and expenditure management. The project has two components:
     ■■   Results-based financing to provide an incentive for achieving selected public sector management (PSM) reforms ($40 million). This includes four focus areas:
          increasing tax revenue mobilization; enhancing performance of PFM systems; strengthening of public procurement performance; and improving management
          of the development portfolio.
     ■■   Technical assistance to support capacity building and institutional strengthening associated with achievement of eligible PSM reforms ($10 million). This will be
          used to support achievement of results in all the above eligible PSM reform areas. The TA component supports capacity building and institutional strengthening
          activities related to improvement of tax collection, PFM, and procurement.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   The success of the project is to be measured by: improved collection of sales tax on services; improved credibility of budget execution; and increased timeliness
          of contract execution.
     ■■   Sindh Tax Reform Strategy and Public Financial Management Strategies have been approved.
     ■■   The Sindh Sales Tax to Services targets for 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 were achieved.
     ■■   Finance Department has completed reconciliation of Sindh debt portfolio in January 2016 and prepared sensitive analysis of debt servicing with respect to
          exchange rate and interest rate.
     ■■   Internal Audit Charter has been approved and pilot audit of Finance Division payroll conducted. Hiring of Internal Audit Director is ongoing with priority to
          prepare a risk-based audit plan.
     ■■   Transparency in budget formulation, allocation and execution is improving with Budget Strategy paper. Similarly, quarterly budget execution reports are up-
          loaded on FD website after submission to the Provincial Assembly.
     ■■   The government has developed a prototype dashboard for monitoring of development schemes that can serve as a strategic tool for improved monitoring of the
          development portfolio.
     ■■   Finance Department, Excise and Taxation Department and Board of Revenue have piloted the proactive feedback mechanisms. Trainings are being conducted and
          reporting formats established for further roll-out.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Karachi Port’s Eastern Wharf is extremely restricted in its operational capacity. Vessels carrying heavier bulk like cement and rice have to be lightened at deep-water
berths outside the port in order to reduce draught and proceed to resume operations at berths located inside the port with lesser draft. There is increasing congestion
and delays to vessel operations. The project involves dredging and creating a larger apron area with new bollards and a wide paved area, as well as a uniform quay wall.
The new facility will also provide an ample backyard area, permitting flexible management of the new port infrastructure.
The project development objective is to replace the lost port capacity and reduce shipping costs to the Pakistan economy through the reconstruction of the failed
berths at Karachi port, and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of port operations, while enhancing environmental sustainability. The project has two components:
■■   Financing reconstruction of berths 15 to 17A on the East Wharf at Karachi Port.
■■   Preparing a five-year business plan and vision document that covers capital investments, operations, human resource development, land management, informa-
     tion technology and port user representation.
■■   Strengthening port environmental management to eventually comply with ISO international standards.
■■   Improving financial management and planning to meet IFRS accounting standards and effectively utilize port revenues, and install an Enterprise Resource Plan-
     ning (ERP) System.

RESULTS ACHIEVED:
■■   Reduction in the ship-waiting-to-service time ratio for the project berths.
■■   Improvement in occupancy and rate of cargo handling at the project berths..
■■   The civil work for reconstruction is progressing well, with the contractor achieving nearly 95 percent progress by the end of August 2016. Three berths (15 to 17)
     completed and handed over to Operations Division in December 2014.
■■   The Karachi Port Strategic Development Plan and Business Plan has been prepared.
■■   Development and implementation of an environmental management system. Consultant firm has completed all tasks. Only internal audit and final certification
     audit remains, which is expected to be complete by April 2017.
■■   KPT’s financial audits fully compliant with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). KPT has fulfilled the requirement to move towards IFRS-compliant
     accounts well before the target date.
■■   Procurement underway to implement an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System in KPT.
■■   Procurement underway to hire consultant firm to conduct an asset verification and revaluation study.
■■   KPT has initiated a request to seek extension in project closing date by one year i.e. till December 31, 2017.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Pakistan’s performance in school participation has been poor in absolute terms, relative to other countries in the region, and relative to developing countries at its level
of per capita income. Sindh is one of the four provinces of Pakistan where the education indicators remain low. In 2010/11, NERs at the primary (ages 6–10, grades
1–5), middle (ages 11–13, grades 6–8), and high school (ages 14–15, grades 9–10) levels in the province were 62 percent, 36 percent, and 23 percent, respectively.
Evidence suggests that children from poor households and girls in rural areas experience the largest participation shortfalls. There are also significant differences in
school participation rates across the province’s 23 districts.
In FY2007/2008, the Sindh government initiated a multifaceted, medium-term sector reform program for primary and secondary education called the Sindh Education
Sector Reform Program (SERP). The Bank provided financial support to SERP through the Sindh Education Sector Development Policy Credit (SEDPC) in FY2007/2008
and the Sindh Education Sector Project (SESP) between FY2008/2009–FY2011/2012.

SERP II is an evolutionary next step by the government, shaped by the lessons learned in the previous programs. Under SERP II, the government plans to maximize
school reform efforts by simultaneously improving governance and management of service delivery. The project development objective is to raise school participation
by improving sector governance and accountability, strengthening administrative systems and measuring student achievement.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
Sindh has successfully established a system for conducting universal grade 5 and 8 level assessments and has completed 3 rounds of student assessments in all
public schools in the province More than 3,000 schools have been consolidated into 1,065 campus schools across the province. All operational school management
committees in the province are receiving school grants and school specific non salary budgets.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Government of Pakistan joined the Global Partnership for Education in 2012 and an allocation of $100 million has been made available for Pakistan. The provinces
     of Sindh ($66 million) and Balochistan ($34 million) were shortlisted to receive the financial grant after detailed discussions between the development partners and
     the Government of Pakistan. The World Bank has agreed to be the supervising entity for the proposed grant; UNICEF is the coordinating agency for the grant. The
     project development objective is to increase school enrollment and retention in project-supported schools, with a special focus on girls’ participation, and to develop
     mechanisms for information collection and use for improved management of education. The project will benefit four groups.
     ■■   Children who will enroll in the newly established schools and those already enrolled in government schools (grades K through 10) will benefit from improved
          school environments and access to teaching learning materials.
     ■■   Girls who did not have the opportunity to enroll in higher grades will benefit from an opportunity through up gradation of girls schools.
     ■■   Teachers and education managers will benefit from professional development, provision of teaching learning material, and capacity-building programs.
     ■■   Communities who receive project interventions, especially the parents of the children enrolled in schools, are expected to benefit from access to better quality
          education.


     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     The project was signed on March 25, 2015, and has made a good start. The project has set up a transparent and detailed system of school site identification for
     establishment of new schools and upgradation of schools, approved by the Government. Teacher recruitment for the project specific government schools is being done
     through a test based and merit based system. School designs have been approved and construction work will be initiated in the next few months.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
This project recognizes: the Government of Sindh’s strong interest in strengthening technical and vocational education and training (TVET); that the labor force’s lack
of skills poses significant constraints; and that the TVET sector faces substantial challenges. Project design takes into account the need for both structural reforms to
strengthen the quality and relevance of TVET, and short-term improvements in the provision of training .
The project development objective is to support the Government of Sindh in strengthening its training programs to improve the skills and employability of trainees.
The project includes three components:
■■   Supporting the provision and relevance of short-term vocational training to 45,000 targeted trainees through private and public training providers selected
     through a competitive process.
■■   Results-based support for competitively selected programs and training providers to develop market-driven training with a focus on curriculum development
     and equipment provision. (19 percent of funding)
■■   Technical assistance to strengthen capacity of the Sindh Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (STEVTA) to implement component two activities


KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   Seventy training programs competitively selected. Institute Management Committees with private-sector representation have been established in each of the
     selected training institutes.
■■   STEVTA has completed the procurement of most of the equipment for the 70 programs selected under the competitive fund mechanism More than 67000 youth
     trained and an additional 15000 will be trained by the close of the project (utilizing project savings).
■■   50 percent of the participants’ trained/beneficiaries were female which is beyond the target of 28 percent.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The proposed project (S-GPE) is additional to the Second Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP II). The state government reform program has received strong support
     from development partners, including the World Bank and the EU. The World Bank continues its support to the state’s reform program through SEP II, a $400 million
     IDA Credit, which became effective in March 19, 2014. It aims to raise school participation by improving sector governance and accountability, and strengthening
     administrative systems, and to measure student achievement. The S-GPE and SEP II are complementary and mutually enforcing; in particular, S-GPE interventions are
     expected to enhance the impact of key reforms supported under SEP II as well as the SESP. S-GPE implementation will be consistent with SEP II in terms of using the
     results-based disbursement modality and sharing the same implementing entity.

     The project supports the implementation of the SESP. The project development objective is to strengthen the institutional capacity to generate, disseminate, and use
     information to support the implementation of key reforms under SESP. Progress towards the achievement of the project development objective will be measured by
     the following indicators:
     ■■   Number of districts for which monitoring data of at least 70 percent of schools is collected by Director General Monitoring and Evaluation.
     ■■   Number of districts for which monitoring data is analyzed and disseminated to Education and Literacy Department (ELD) management and district administrators.
     ■■   Number of districts that submitted Human Resource and Management Information System (HRMIS) reports to ELD. The project supports the implementation of
          the SESP.


     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     The Education department has established a monthly monitoring system for schools in 15 out of 29 districts, resulting in improvements in school data analysis and
     teacher presence in the schools. Education Department has collected biometric information with details of service information from all teaching and non-teaching
     employees from approximately 40, 000 schools across Sindh. The employee information is being matched with the payroll information to remove any discrepancies
     in the system. A basic HRMIS system is in the process of being established to manage the education employees in the system, addressing a key governance issue in
     the province

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Slow progress on improvements in human development indicators undermines Pakistan’s, and hence the Punjab’s, competitiveness, economic growth, and efforts
to alleviate poverty. While Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, still provides the largest share in terms of GDP, it has experienced a sharp decline in economic
growth since 2004/2005, remaining under 4 percent in each of the last four years. To address constraints to growth in the province, the Government of the Punjab has
prepared an ambitious 2015-2018 growth strategy that identifies skills development as one of the key pillars of growth. The main challenges in the skills development
sector of Punjab include: a limited supply of skilled workers; a weak institutional framework; a lack of evidence-based policy making; low quality and relevance of
training; market failures in industry-provision of training; and low access to skills training. The project aims to support the state government’s reform agenda in the
skills sector by improving training provision of existing public-training providers with a focus on employability, as well as encouraging private-sector provision of
training.
The project development objective is to improve the quality and labor market relevance of skills training programs in priority sectors in the Punjab, as well as access
to those programs. The project:
■■   Uses results-based financing to support the achievement of the government’s Growth Strategy and the Punjab’s Skills Development Strategy and Vision 2018
     objectives through five sub-components along three strategic lines: strengthening the skills training system, improving the quality and relevance of skills training
     and increasing access to market-relevant trades. For each sub-component, a DLI has been identified with time-bound targets.
■■   Provides technical assistance and capacity building required to enable the achievement of the DLIs, and to manage project implementation, using a traditional
     disbursement mode based on unaudited interim financial reports.


KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project became effective on July 4, 2015, and has achieced the following:
■■   Roll out of Competency Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) Packages
■■   Initiated Functional Review of TTB, PBTE and P-TEVTA (in progress)
■■   Partnership Framework developed and used to seal four partnership agreements which were signed with industry for strengthening collaboration between train-
     ing providers and employers to improve quality and relevance of training delivery
■■   85 percent of students enrolled in market relevant courses passed these courses.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The tertiary education sector in Pakistan has suffered from many years of neglect, resulting in poor performance and results compared to countries with similar
     development and income levels. This is one of the factors affecting Pakistan’s competitiveness, economic growth, and poverty reduction objectives. To address
     challenges in higher education, the government has developed a higher education development program (outlined in the second Medium Term Development
     Framework for Higher Education for 2011-2015 (MDTF-HE II)). The project is a response to the government’s request for continued financial support by the Bank to
     implement its tertiary education reform program, building on the experience of the Bank-financed Higher Education Support Project. It supports the implementation
     of the first phase of the government’s higher education development program outlined in the MTDF-HE II and uses results-based financing. The project objective is to
     improve teaching, learning, and research conditions to enhance access to and the quality and relevance of tertiary education. It supports government reform in tertiary
     education under two components:
     ■■     Program Financing. This consists of four elements: improved fiscal sustainability and expenditure effectiveness; enhanced quality and relevance of teaching and
            research; improved equitable access; and strengthened governance and management.
     ■■     Capacity Building, Policy Design, and Monitoring and Evaluation
     The project was restructured in January 2014. The objective of the restructuring was to improve implementation performance, which had suffered from the start of the
     project due to uncertainty regarding the proposed devolution of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) following the 18th Amendment and changes in the HEC
     senior management. The restructuring, which was successful in jump-starting project implementation, included the cancellation of $77.82 million and the revision
     of selected DLIs.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     1,500 additional faculty members recruited on the Tenure Track System.
     ■■     Over 817,218 additional students in public and private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).
     ■■     80 Quality Enhancement Cells (QECs) performing satisfactorily in HEIs. QECs are a focal point to improve academic, teaching, and learning standards.
     ■■     15 additional Offices of Research, Innovation, and Commercialization (ORICs) performing satisfactorily in HEIs. The main objective of the ORICs is to promote
            public-private partnerships in research, including commercializing the products of university research.
     ■■     Business plans prepared by 70 public universities to improve strategic management, planning, and accountability.
     ■■     More than 900 new postgraduate foreign scholarships awarded

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Pakistan’s performance in education has generally been poor relative to other countries in South Asia, and relative to other developing countries at its level of per
capita income. Shortfalls persist in school participation, attainment, and student achievement in Punjab province. In 2010/2011, NERs at the primary, middle, and
high school levels were 70 percent, 37 percent, and 25 percent, respectively. The main concern is for children who never go to school: in 2010/2011, 27 percent of
6-10 year olds, and 19 percent of 11-15 year olds, had never been to school. The Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) has been underway since 2003.
Building on its results, the provincial government developed its next medium-term reform program, the Second Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP II)
to accelerate the pace of progress towards its education sector goals. The project development objective of PERSP II is to support the education sector reform program
of the Government of Punjab to increase child school participation at multiple levels, as well as student achievement. The project includes:
■■   Promoting better student outcomes, as well as teacher quality and performance, by introducing test-based teacher recruitment; strengthening the system of
     field-based advisory support to teachers in low-achieving poor schools; fixing and reallocating teaching posts and teachers at the school level; and offering
     supplemental cash transfers tied to attendance in rural districts where there has been poor secondary school attendance for girls.
■■   Technical Assistance: Financing essential advisory, technical, and capacity-building support.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   Regular funds are transferred to schools in all 36 districts to meet non-salary related spending (e.g., teaching and learning materials and school maintenance)
     with autonomy over spending. School Councils revitalized with responsibility for management of non-salary budgets.
■■   Successful leveraging of the private sector through a restructured Punjab Education Foundation (PEF) with more than 1.6 million students enrolled in low-cost
     private schools supported by public financing.
■■   Strong accountability regime has been established for PPP through PEF. In addition, 293,000 tuition-replacement vouchers given to poor children in urban slum
     areas to access private schools.
■■   Establishment of independent monitoring system that collects monthly data on school performance indicators
■■   District and school performance report cards distributed to all schools in the province for better accountability.
■■   A test-based teacher recruitment system has been established.
■■   Helped to establish a student assessment system to test about five million students in grades 5 and 8 annually.
■■   More than 400,000 girls are receiving cash stipends for attending middle and high schools in the worst performing districts of the province.
■■   Teacher performance bonus program piloted and evaluated for impact on key outcomes.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Dasu Hydropower Project (DHP) is part of the Indus Cascade and is also a part of a least-cost solution to mitigate power shortfall and reduce cost of generation in the
     country. It is a run-of-river greenfield project about 240 km upstream from Tarbela Dam. The total size of the project is 4,320 megawatt (MW). However, it is optimal to
     develop the project in two stages of 2,160 MW each. DHP Stage 1, including six generating units of 360 MW each and 350-km, high-voltage transmission line from
     Dasu to Islamabad, would cost $4.24 billion and its estimated economic rate of return is 25 percent. In June 2014, World Bank approved $588.4 million primarily
     for the preparatory works and resettlement and an IDA Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) in the amount of $460 million to mobilize commercial financing and time it in
     a manner that funds are available at the time of award of three major contracts civil works (MW-01 and MW-02) and electro-mechanical (EM-01). Bids of MW-01 and
     MW-02 have been received and EM-01 is at the pre-qualification stage. Simultaneously, about $1,440 million equivalent in local currency is being arranged through
     a consortium of local banks to cover the local cost component and $800-1,000 million will be raised in a combination of loan and/or bond structure supported by IDA
     PCG.

     The overall project development objective is to facilitate the expansion of electricity supply of hydro-power in Pakistan. The project would trigger the development of
     Indus Cascade that will change the energy landscape in the country which presently relies on expensive thermal generation based on imported fuels. The financing
     model uses an innovative approach in which instead of an upfront financial close funds are being mobilized to match the investment needs thus minimizing the
     project’s financing cost. Additional financing will be processed to cover any gap after the design of the transmission line is complete, all costs are known through a
     competitive bidding process, and sources of other available funds have been finalized. The project is a “high-risk-high-reward” operation aimed at providing low cost
     non-carbon renewable energy.

     EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   DHP-I will supply 12,225 gigawatt hours (GWh) annually (~12 percent of total existing supply) at a very low cost.
     ■■   It will improve socio-economic services in the project area directly benefit more than 20,000 people.
     ■■   The project will also strengthen WAPDA to develop other large hydropower projects.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Pakistan’s electricity sector faces a large gap between supply and demand. Widespread load shedding – disconnecting the electric current when demand is greater than
supply – is prevalent, affecting economic growth. A shift over the past decade towards expensive fuel oil has also increased the cost of electricity generation. Expanding
hydropower generation is therefore fundamental to address Pakistan’s long-term energy issues. The project is an important element of the Bank’s energy sector
strategy of supporting strategic investment projects in generation and transmission infrastructure that contribute to the structural shift to a low-cost, low-carbon fuel
mix. The project involves constructing a power house, modifying a tunnel, and installing three 470 megawatt (MW) power units on an existing Tarbela Dam located
60 km north-west of Islamabad on the River Indus.

The dam was constructed as part of the Indus Basin Project following the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan in 1960. The dam has five tunnels and
two spillways and the hydropower units are installed on Tunnels 1 to 3 (3,478 MW). Tarbela Fourth Extension Project (T4HP) involves construction of a power house,
modification of tunnel and installation of power units on tunnel number 4 at a total revised cost of $ 788 million. Project became effective in April 2012 and is expected
to be completed by June 2018 to generate 3,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) during the high-flow season that coincides with peak demand summer period. Two major
contracts (i) construction of power house by M/s Sinohydro (civil works) and (ii) installation of turbines and equipment by M/s Voith (electro-mechanical) were awarded
in Sep 2013 and Feb 2014 respectively. Physical progress is about 70 percent.

Additional Financing (AF) of $ 300 million for another 1,410 MW on tunnel number 5 (T5HP) has been negotiated with the Government of Pakistan and will be
presented to the World Bank Board on Sep 20, 2016. The total cost of AF is $ 823.5 million - Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will be co-financing $ 390
million and remaining $ 133.5 million will be the equity share of the implementing entities/government.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Increase in electricity supply – 3,000 GWh (T4HP) and 1,800 GWh (AF/T5HP);
■■   Availability of additional generation capacity during summer months – 1,410 MW each from T4 & T5;
■■   Reduction in overall production cost of energy by 2.4 percent from PKR 7.02 to 6.85 per kWh; and
■■   Successful pilot of installing floating solar plant leading to expansion of solar generation from Tarbela.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Floods hit parts of Pakistan in early September 2014, including Punjab and the State having jurisdiction over the eight districts of Neelum, Hattian, Bagh, Poonch,
     Haveli, Kotli, Bhimber and Muzaffarabad. The disaster caused 367 deaths, mostly in Punjab province, in addition to damages to houses, agriculture, transport, irrigation
     and communications infrastructure. It is estimated by the NDMA that the floods affected over 2.5 million people in both rural and urban areas. The federal and
     provincial governments were proactive in relief operations in the immediate aftermath of the floods. Following the conclusion of the relief phase, the government
     moved towards medium- and longer-term planning for recovery, reconstruction, and increasing resilience. The Disaster and Climate Resilience Improvement Project
     was prepared in response to the government’s request for assistance in responding to the floods of 2014.

     The project development objective is to support restoration of flood protection infrastructure and strengthen government capacity to manage disasters and climate
     variability. The project comprises four components:
     ■■   Restoring Flood Protection Infrastructure and Upgrading Flood Management Systems ($100 million): to enhance physical resilience through the restoration,
          rehabilitation, and improvement of critical flood protection infrastructure.
     ■■   Managing Disasters and Climate Variability ($17 million): to strengthen the government’s capacity to better manage disasters. It would finance risk identification,
          institutional strengthening for improved management of disasters and enhancing fiscal resilience.
     ■■   Project Management ($8 million): will be implemented through mandated government departments including Punjab Irrigation Department, Punjab Disaster
          Management Authority, and the State planning and development department. It will support engagement of additional resources at project implementation
          units within these departments.
     ■■   Contingent Emergency Response Component: In the event of a natural disaster, critical emergency response and recovery costs in the province may be supported
          through this component upon activation.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   Project Implementation Units are functional and preparatory steps to start reconstruction of damaged flood protection infrastructure are under way, including
          approval of PC-1s, advanced state of readiness of infrastructure designs and procurement documents
     ■■   Six consultancies related to various areas of Disaster Risk Management are under way in the State

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Sindh Resilience Project (SRP) will focus on improving institutional capacities, performance, and preparedness at key agencies responsible for managing disaster
risk in Sindh. In addition, the Project will further contribute toward enhancing resilience to hydro-meteorological disasters including floods and drought through
physical infrastructure investments. The dialogue with Government of Sindh has established floods and droughts as the highest priority areas, owing to high frequency
and impact. The dialogue has further identified critical needs in these areas, along with an estimate of resources needed to address these priorities.

The project development objectives are to mitigate flood and drought risks in selected areas and to strengthen Sindh’s capacity to manage natural disasters. The project
comprises three components:
■■   Strengthening Disaster and Climate Risk Management (USD 23.75 million): To primarily focus on key disaster management institutions in terms of strengthen-
     ing operational systems and capacities at the provincial and district levels. In addition, it will support the Government of Sindh to develop greater ‘fiscal resilience’
     through strengthening financial capacity and risk financing mechanisms, and mainstream disaster risk reduction in development planning and budgeting
     processes.
■■   Improving Infrastructure and Systems for Resilience (USD 96 million): This will primarily support restoration and improvement of embankments at high risk sites
     along the Indus for protection against riverine floods as well as construction of small rainwater-fed recharge dams in drought prone regions in Sindh. It will also
     assist the Sindh Irrigation Department towards implementing project interventions and increasing operational efficiency.
■■   Contingent Emergency Response: In the event of a natural disaster, critical emergency response and recovery costs in the province may be supported through
     this component upon activation.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   The project was signed on August 31, 2016.
■■   The project operations manual is being developed
■■   The procurement process for three investments related to flood protection infrastructure has been initiated

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project is designed to support the rehabilitation and modernization of the Jinnah Barrage on the Indus River system, while reinforcing ongoing reform to the
     water, irrigation, and drainage sector through support and the monitoring of progress. Jinnah Barrage is one of the most important structures in Pakistan’s irrigation
     system, handling all the Indus River’s water. It provides water to the Thal Canal, which covers an area of 2.1 million acres in a zone of arid desert, where crop production
     is only feasible with irrigation. About five million people in five districts live in the area and their livelihoods, directly or indirectly, depend on irrigation from canal.
     Underground water is saline in some places, and the local population depends exclusively on the canal for drinking water. The overarching project objectives are to
     assist the borrower in: (i) rehabilitating and modernizing Jinnah Barrage and carrying out affiliated works to enable reliable and uninterrupted supply of water for over
     2.1 million acres of farmland, benefitting about 600,000 farm families for irrigation and domestic water users; and (ii) building capacity to improve water resources
     and irrigation system management. It has three components:
     ■■    Financing of rehabilitation and modernization of Jinnah Barrage, implementation of social and environmental management plans, and construction supervision
           and support for the project’s preparation and implementation.
     ■■    Financing of improvements in irrigation and water management systems, including development of management information system; monitoring and decision
           support system; modernization of water management equipment and facilities; and preparation of future irrigation and water distribution improvement projects.
     ■■    Financing of M&E activities to provide continuous feedback

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■    All barrages in Punjab are being equipped with the modern Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for operation of barrage gates, discharge
           monitoring, automated data collection and transmission, central instrumentation observation system for piezometers to measure sub-surface flows and CCTV
           based surveillance systems.
     ■■    The civil works and installation of gates on the main barrage have been completed. The review and updating of water resources management information systems
           (WRMIS) and Integration with decision support system (DSS) is in progress well and a GIS based crop identification system has been developed.
     ■■    Substantial progress is made in completing the Hydrological Modelling and the Real-Time Operational Modelling and the groundwater seasonal fluctuation
           maps are being developed.

 dependent on achievement of performance targets.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Polio: There is intense international scrutiny on Pakistan’s polio eradication efforts. Global polio eradication depends on Pakistan and Afghanistan interrupting
transmission in 2016. If this does not occur, the projected global resources required to meet the goal will expand by an additional $800 million each year. The Bank
has provided financial support of about US$250 million for Pakistan’s polio eradication efforts from 2003 to 2014.
National Immunization Support Project (NISP): At the same time, routine immunization in Pakistan is in crisis, with some of the worst coverage in the region –
concentrated in the poorest populations. Consequent outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as measles frequently cause significant childhood mortality
and morbidity, provoking public anger. The Bank, therefore, in partnership with Gavi, USAID, the Gates Foundation, and the Government has developed the National
Immunization Support Project (NISP), within a results-based structure with an emphasis on strengthening provincial capacity to manage and implement this essential
public health function.

The project also addresses the fragmentation of financing of routine immunization – which currently has multiple sources from federal and provincial government and
considerable international support that flows off-budget. The NISP IDA Credit of US$50mil is co-financed with the Government of Pakistan Immunization Programs
(Federal and Provincial), as well as a multi-donor trust fund for immunization contributed to by Gavi and USAID (total US$94mil, of which $79.60 is for recipient
executed activities). NISP also includes an innovative financing instrument – the “results-linked buy down”. Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs) govern disbursement
of the majority of the credit and grant resources, but these are also complemented by partial loan cancellation commitment from the Gates Foundation (US$25mil),
subject to achievement of the same DLI targets over the life of the project.
CSOs: With poor children as the major beneficiaries the project has a strong poverty focus. The project specifically aims to benefit vulnerable groups and previously
neglected groups to increase their access to immunization by engaging CSOs. The role of CSOs will be expanded to address the barriers to routine immunization at
policy and planning, services provision, and community levels. Priority engagement areas for the CSOs in the project design and implementation are service delivery,
training, behavior change communication analytical work and research.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project legal agreements were signed between the World Bank and the Federal and Provincial levels of Government on August 31st 2016. The World Bank
set the following condition before consideration of the project by the Board – Approval by the Government of a costed national financing plan for immunization
over the project period and an agreed mechanism for coordinated procurement of vaccines between the Federal and Provincial levels of Government. Imposing
this condition catalyzed the Government’s development and approval of mechanisms which will effectively increase the sustainability of immunization financing in
Pakistan. Technical assistance provided by the WBG to the Government as part of project preparation (and with the support of Gavi and the Gates Foundation) was key
to this achieving this important outcome.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Pakistan is one of the world’s most arid countries, with an extensive system of canals and hydraulic structures that are its lifeline and the backbone of its economy.
     Pakistan faces many challenges, however, regarding the availability and management of its surface and groundwater resources, including: (i) low water productivity
     in the agricultural sector; (ii) low water storage capability; (iii) acute power shortage requiring further development of hydropower resources; and (iv) increased
     vulnerability to drought and floods, the economic, social, and ecological impacts of which are expected to be amplified by climate change; and (v) water pollution.
     The project aims to improve the management and investment planning of water resources in the Indus River Basin. This includes: Capacity Building of, and Support
     to, Federal Institutions in Water Resources Planning and Management: Supports capacity building for federal institutions involved in water resources planning,
     management, and development.

     Improvement in Water Resources Management and Development: Supports WAPDA to undertake the following activities: upgrading existing tools, databases,
     models, and water resources management systems; undertaking sediment management studies for the Indus River system; and preparing a power investment plan
     for the upper Indus.

     Based on successful completion of WCAP phase I, on the request of government of Pakistan US$ 34.95 M Additional Financing was approved by the Bank to sustain
     the momentum of the project and continue delivering high level strategic initiatives to address the challenges of water sector of Pakistan.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Balochistan is comprised of eighteen river basins crossing six agro-ecological zones. Given the challenges of topography and inadequate water distribution infrastructure
less than half of the water available to Balochistan from the Indus is utilized. Less than 40 percent of Balochistan’ s available water is from the Indus River, and this
fraction is only available to around 5 percent of the area of the province. The nature of the climate also means that both extended droughts and destructive flash floods
are relatively common, and are expected to worsen with future climate change. Groundwater is a small fraction of the overall resource but its comparative reliability
means it is in high demand. In the absence of regulation or coherent management, groundwater has fueled horticultural development, the most economically
important component of agriculture in Balochistan, and supports most urban areas and is thus over-abstracted leading to major declines in groundwater levels.
In spite of its considerable mineral and energy resources and lack of reliable water, weak governance and a lack of investment mean the province is still highly
dependent on agriculture (60 percent of provincial GDP and 67 percent of labor). Recent economic growth has been largely driven by expansion of tube-well irrigation
for high-value agriculture, especially horticulture with key agricultural products including wheat, apples, grapes, vegetables, barley, milk and meat. While per capita
water availability in Balochistan is well above the national average, this simply reflects the low population. Variability in water availability is far higher than the national
average and per capita water storage is only 20 percent of the (grossly inadequate) national value. As a consequence, Balochistan is the least water-secure province in
Pakistan, the most at risk from climate change, and the least able to cope with water-related development challenges. In the current context improving rural livelihoods
and stimulating economic growth require vastly improved management of the scarce water resources of the province. The selection of two high priority (the Nari and
Porali) river basins is the first step in a long-term process of province-wide water sector strengthening and reform.

The Project Development Objective is to strengthen provincial government capacity for water resources monitoring and management and to improve community-
based water management for targeted irrigation schemes in Balochistan.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project was only recently signed and implementation has not yet started.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     About five percent of Pakistan’s total land area is under forest cover, including natural forests and planted trees. The forest resources continue to deteriorate both
     qualitatively and quantitatively as a result of increasing pressure from the rising population and associated needs. In the last two decades, Pakistan lost 25% of its
     natural forests at about 2% annually. This has resulted in reduction of carbon stock, both aboveground and underground biomass at 2.2% annually. The Government
     is determined to address deforestation and forest degradation as well as increase existing forest cover under the program REDD+ (Reduction of Emissions from
     Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks).

      The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) through the World Bank is supporting the Government of Pakistan to reach REDD+ readiness by 2017 by formulating
     and implementing its readiness preparation proposals. It is expected that international REDD+ regime will be in place by 2017. The project objectives are to
     strengthen the capacity of the government to monitor deforestation and reduce forests and land use change related greenhouse gas emission through socially,
     environmentally and technically sound national REDD+ strategy. The readiness preparation entails a number of studies on national readiness preparation, capacity
     building training and workshops, goods and operating costs, consultation processes and designing a site specific REDD+ PES program in one of the provinces. Specific

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
This project was prepared to support the creation of employment opportunities and sustainable jobs in the conflict-affected KP and FATA region. The region ranks
considerably lower in socio-economic indicators than most parts of the country. Rates for both literacy and the participation of women in the labor force are low.
Economic activity in the region is mostly dominated by SMEs, which suffered tremendously during the militancy crises and 2010 floods: almost 9,000 enterprises were
damaged, rendering 40,000 people jobless. The project addresses the core strategic objective of stimulating employment and livelihood opportunities, as highlighted
in the 2010 PCNA done jointly by the Bank and development partners. It also promotes the economic empowerment of women by assigning priority to eligible
enterprises owned and managed by women. It has three components:
■■   SME Development. This includes a matching grants program with TA to support SMEs that have been adversely affected by the ongoing crisis in order to enhance
     their productive capacity and restore lost employment. It will also promote economic empowerment of women by giving priority to eligible enterprises owned
     and managed by women.
■■   Mobilize private investment from the diaspora to jump-start the rehabilitation of businesses and reconstruction of infrastructure, thereby creating employment.
■■   Institution Building to Foster Investment and Implement Regulatory Reforms. This will support capacity building of both KP and FATA governments to improve
     the business climate and attract investment to the region.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   ERKF Project has created 4,500 direct jobs through the matching grants while the indirect jobs are estimated to be more than 15,000.
■■   $12.20 million disbursed in matching grants to 1,526 SMEs across the project area (KP and FATA), including 32 women entrepreneurs.
■■   The matching grants have rebuilt 20 schools for children and supported 30 micro hydro power generation plants that supply electricity to households and markets.
■■   Four investment road shows and conferences in Karachi, Islamabad, and Dubai to showcase investment opportunities for the private sector in KP and FATA. The
     authorities were overwhelmed by the response of the diaspora and local potential investors. To facilitate the investors and to ensure implementation of feasible
     projects in (for example) tourism, infrastructure and energy sectors, the Government of KP is developing its PPP (Public Private Partnership) regulatory framework
     and has already notified a PPP unit. In addition, a Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Authority was established.
In response to the request of Government of Pakistan, an Additional Financing of US$19 million is being appraised for the Project together with its extension up to
June 30, 2020

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The RLCIP has been extended up to 31st Dec, 2016 and will be further extended to 31st Dec , 2020 and scaled up as combined FATA Service Delivery MDTF Round 2
     operation. The project aims to improve the wellbeing of unserved and underserved low-income communities. Starting with two agencies (Mohmand and Bajaur), it
     is now operational in South Waziristan Agency as well, following military operations to reestablish access, and as the government helps displaced families to return.
     The selection of these agencies in FATA was based on: (i) A perceived lack of interest from the authorities to redress disparities, (ii) the fact that the region lags other
     provinces in social and economic indicators; (iii) the fact that the region is the most underdeveloped in Pakistan (iv) high unemployment due to militancy crises in
     2009-2010; (v) the fact that military operations in 2009 significantly damaged physical infrastructure and services, while displacing three million people; and (vi)
     the fact that the ongoing military operation against the militants in North Waziristan Agency has again pushed the region in deeper crisis. The project objective is to
     improve livelihoods and access to basic service infrastructure in selected Agencies in FATA. The project components include:
     ■■     Social mobilization of local communities through locally based indigenous organizations.
     ■■     Rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, construction of new infrastructure, and operation and maintenance (O&M), with priorities to be established in consulta-
            tion with community groups.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The KP SADP has been extended up to 30th June, 2016 and will be further extended to 31st Dec, 2016 and scaled up as a combined KP Service Delivery MDTF Round
2 operation.
This project aims to reach unserved and underserved low-income communities in Southern KP. Implementation will be focused on three districts (D I Khan, Tank and
Lakki Marwat) in order to concentrate project coverage, effectively monitor the process and its impact, and demonstrate the potential of the approach. The selection of
these districts is based on several factors, including: (i) prevailing low human development indices, even before the onset of the militancy crisis; (ii) proximity to the
Tribal Agencies of FATA; (iii) all three districts were recipients of the largest number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) who left the Tribal Agencies during the military
operation in 2009. The ongoing military operation has resulted in influx of more than one million IDPs to Districts D.I Khan (64,966 individuals), Tank (779 individuals),
Lakki Marwat (24,919 individuals) and Bannu (857,776 individuals). Restructuring of the project is near completion. It will open up the livelihood menu, leading to
context-based interventions, adding District Bannu to its area of operations.
The project development objective is to strengthen the capacity of the poor to improve their livelihood options through access to social and productive infrastructure,
using participatory approaches in the selected southern districts of KP province. Project components include:
■■     Community mobilization and formation of economic interest groups (EIGs) at village and district levels; capacity building; advisory services and input support;
       and communications and a knowledge program.
■■     Social infrastructure, on-farm and off-farm productive infrastructure for agriculture and its subsectors and asset-building support for poorest groups.


KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     A total of 441 community based organizations established with membership of 14,398. A total of 310 Economic Interest Groups (EIGs) formed with membership
       of 3,099. A total of 274 community action plans (CAPs) developed through this process of social mobilization.
■■     36 drinking water supply schemes and 46 village access roads completed; Rehabilitated 11 schools and two veterinary centers

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:
     Packages Limited (‘Packages’) was established in 1957 as a joint venture between the Ali Group of Pakistan and a Swedish partner to convert paper and paperboard into
     packaging for consumer industry. Packages has been an IFC client since 1964. Over the years Packages has evolved into a market leader in flexible packaging, folding
     cartons and tissue products, paper & paperboard, liquid packaging board, corrugated cartons, printing ink and packaging plastic films. It operates its business in
     partnerships with Stora Enso (Sweden), DIC Group (Japan) and Mitsubishi (Japan) and Printcare (Sri Lanka). Packages has strategic investments in the local operations
     of Tetra Pak, Nestle and Tri-Pack that yield good returns and help strengthen supply relationship. It also recently acquired a flexible packaging unit in South Africa.
     Packages operates a 45,000 tpa tissue mill, plastics packaging capacity of 13,000 tpa while its paper and board production mills has a capacity of 208,000 tons per
     annum and a conversion capacity of 124000 tpa as of Dec 2015. IFC’s equity financing enabled Packages, an IFC client since 1964, to strengthen its balance sheet by
     reducing reliance on debt taken for the expansion project that had exposed it to interest rate volatility and significant rollover risk. IFC financing helped provide the
     necessary stability to endure the global financial crisis of 2008.

     RESULTS ACHIEVED:
     TWith IFC’s support, Packages was able to undertake programs designed to have a positive impact on climate change (waste paper collection, closed loop system for
     water and waste heat recovery systems at the plants). It helped reduce carbon emissions from burning of wheat and eliminate approximately 450,000 cubic meters
     of landfills annually to avoid typical hazards such as contamination of groundwater, residual soil contamination after landfill close, inefficient use of land space and
     creation of methane, a potent greenhouse gas generated by decaying organic wastes.

     The relocation of the new mill has generated significant economic activity in what was previously an agrarian-based and under-developed part of the country. It also
     renovated 9 schools, provided portable water and installed tubewells. Additionally, procurement of wheat straw positively impacted the incomes of farmers, who used
     to previously burn wheat straw for disposal.
     IFC provided advisory services to Packages to increase waste paper collection from the local market, helping the client reduce reliance on imported waste paper. This
     advisory project was successfully completed in FY13.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
IFC has been implementing the Business Edge program in Pakistan since December 2008. IFC selects local training providers, builds their training delivery capacity
and accredits them to deliver Business Edge business management skills training workshops. It also makes available its range of Business Edge training materials
(trainer manuals) in the local language with local case studies and examples. The Business Edge program also ensures quality through trainers’ assessments and their
certification. The overall goal of the project is to enhance the business performance and increase the revenues of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by
developing their managerial capacities using IFC’s Business Edge (BE) product and services.


KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   BE-accredited training providers have trained a total of 15,961 individuals, of whom 2,813 (17.62 percent) were women, from 2,735 MSMEs, government and
     development organizations.
■■   The project is working with 12 BE-accredited local training providers.
■■   The project has trained 416 trainers including 114 women (27.4 percent) in Pakistan.
■■   The project has localized/translated 53 training manuals/workbooks into Urdu and developed 5 new manuals for micro-entrepreneurs.
An impact assessment of BE workshops in Pakistan was conducted in 2016. The study looked at positive changes in 19 key practices after the training, as well as positive
changes in five business performance areas over the past year. It was found that 66.3 percent of the enterprises surveyed (including large enterprises) reported positive
changes in at least one of the 19 practices after the BE training. In terms of positive changes in business performance areas, improvement was most frequently noted
with respect to monthly net profit, followed by increase in quantity of products/services sold, with 76.5 percent and 76.1 percent enterprises (excluding non-responses)
confirming positive changes in at least one of the five practice areas over the past one year. 57.2 percent of the enterprises reported positive change (increase) in
regular full time paid employees over the past one year. 49.36 percent of all the enterprises reported positive changes in at least one of the business performance
areas due to BE training. Impact assessment study reported that 328 MSMEs experienced positive change in at least one performance area and in at least one practice
area after having attended BE training, and they attributed the positive change in performance to the BE training.
Results under mdtf (wb/ifc) project:
■■   Business Edge has trained 15 Pashto speaking trainers to conduct training for the SMEs.
■■   23 training modules are available in Pashto.
■■   Business Edge accredited training providers trained 304 MSMEs in KPK and FATA. The accredited partners also trained 110 owners and managers of MSMEs in
     non-Business Edge topics.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     China Three Gorges Corporation (“CTGC”), one of the largest renewable power companies in the world is a key partner for IFC in Pakistan power sector. CSAIL was
     established by CTGC through its international investment arm – China Three Gorges International Corporation (“CTGI”) as a scalable investment platform to develop,
     own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan, primarily large run of river hydro projects. IFC has joined CTGI, as a founder shareholder in CSAIL,
     with 15% shareholding for a committed investment of $125 million.
     CSAIL’s current project pipeline in Pakistan includes seven multi-stage renewable power projects with a cumulative capacity of 2,960 MW, for a total investment of
     around $7 billion. These include an operational 50MW wind plant, three wind and solar projects for a cumulative capacity of 500 MW, and 2,410 MW in three large
     hydropower projects, all at the development stage. The vision for CSAIL is to evolve as a major independent power company, following the international best practice
     E&S, governance and compliance standards and grow to a sizeable and balanced assets portfolio of around 10,000 MW. The project will: i) help address the country’s
     severe power shortage situation by development of an incremental generation capacity of 3,000MW (1/2 of current energy shortfall), which will provide access to
     electricity to almost 6% of the total population; ii) utilize cost competitive, indigenous, renewable resource, which will contribute to a significant reduction in the cost
     of generation and help mitigate Pakistan’s reliance on imported thermal alternatives for power generation; iii) facilitate the single largest investment in Pakistan power
     sector, as a demonstration effect for increased private investment in the renewable energy sector in Pakistan; and iv) deliver significant climate change benefits in the
     form of utilization of indigenous clean energy resources for power generation.



     EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Bridge 1/2 of the existing supply shortfall, estimated at around 6,000 MW;
     ■■   Increase the available generation capacity in Pakistan by 10-15% and renewable power generation by 25-30%;
     ■■   Significantly reduce the average cost of generation by substituting the expensive oil fired generation with low cost hydro’s,
     ■■   Substantial foreign exchange savings on account of substitution of imported fuel oil, a critical benefit given Pakistan’s balance of payments weaknesses;
     ■■   Increase private sector share in overall generation by 10-15%; and
     ■■   Provide access to electricity for 11.2 million individuals – 6% of the total population.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Pakistan is facing one of the most severe energy crisis in the world with 144 million people either off-grid or suffering on average over 12 hours of load shedding a day.
Annually households spend an estimated $USD2.2 billion on battery powered torches, candles and kerosene lanterns for lighting. This crisis impairs Pakistan’s capacity
for economic growth and leaves families reliant on inefficient lighting solutions that account for an average of 13 percent of their household income.

Lighting Global was developed by the World Bank and IFC, as a platform to support sustainable growth of the international off-grid lighting market, as a means of
increasing energy access to people not connected to grid electricity, or areas poorly served by the grid.

The Lighting Global program provides market insights, steers development of quality assurance frameworks for modern, off-grid lighting devices and systems, and
promotes sustainability, in partnership with industry.

IFC and World Bank jointly manage off-grid lighting programs in more than 11 African countries through the Lighting Africa program. The success of Lighting Africa has
inspired programs in India, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Lighting Global supports Lighting Africa, Lighting Asia and Lighting Pacific, which work along the supply chain of off-grid lighting products and systems to reduce
market entry barriers and first mover risks.

Lighting Pakistan works to promote the development of a sustainable, clean and modern solar lighting market in Pakistan targeting households, businesses and
micro-enterprises that are unserved or underserved by the grid. The program aims to increase access to lighting and associated services to 1.5million people through:
■■   Quality Verification: Working with manufacturers who meet the Lighting Global Minimum Quality Standards;
■■   Business Development: Providing B2B connections between manufacturers and distributors/financiers;
■■   Market Intelligence: In-depth research into the off-grid lighting market to support client investment decisions;
■■   Consumer Awareness: A two year consumer awareness campaign to help consumer differentiate between good quality and poor quality lighting products.


KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   Number of Lighting Global Quality Certified Products Sold: 77,515
■■   Number of People with Access to Improved Services: 387,575
■■   GHG Emissions Reduced (t): 8,300.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Habib Bank Limited (HBL) is the largest bank in Pakistan in terms of assets, with a market share of approximately 16 percent. As of Mar-16 it had total assets of $21.1 billion,
total deposits of $15.2 billion and total equity of $1.8 billion. In April 2015, IFC invested $225m in HBL through a $150 million senior loan (including $86million mobilization)
and $75m equity for a 3.08 percent equity stake.
IFC’s relationship with HBL started in 2006 through a $50 million, eight-year, tier 2 sub debt which was fully repaid in December 2014. The purpose of the loan was to
strengthen the capital base and support HBL’s turnaround and expansion post privatization. This engagement paved the way for IFC Advisory Services (AS) to help HBL improve
its training infrastructure and processes. A GTFP facility was initiated with HBL in 2007 with a $20 million line, which was enhanced over time to $100 million. Currently the line
stands at $50 million. IFC entered into an AS agreement with HBL in June 2011 to provide capacity building in Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) banking, which concluded
in June 2013. IFC helped the bank: a) develop a value proposition for SMEs; b) re-engineer its credit and risk process; c) strengthen staff skill levels; and d) pilot its SME banking
services. Subsequently, IFC launched a Rural Banking Advisory project with HBL in July 2013 to help develop new agri/rural products aimed at farmers and rural SMEs. This
project is ongoing and is expected to improve access to finance in the rural finance market. In 2014, IFC launched another advisory project with HBL to help it position itself
as a champion for women in the marketplace in Pakistan, both as an employer and as a bank for women. This project was successfully completed in June 2015 and led to
HBL’s launch of a sub-brand for women called “Nisa”. The loan will support HBL’s domestic and international growth, including financing the growth of SMEs, rural/agri-finance,
sustainable energy finance (SEF) and women-owned businesses while the equity helped the Government of Pakistan (“GoP”) successfully complete HBL’s privatization.
In 2014, under the privatization program supported by the IMF, the GoP was looking to divest its shareholdings in the banking sector including the balance 41.5 percent shares
in HBL, valued at over $1 billion. This was considered to be the largest equity offering of a Pakistani corporate in the domestic and international capital markets. To facilitate the
offering, GoP sought IFC’s support to catalyze international investor interest. IFC brought in CDC Group to invest $121million and IFC’s name helped attract other international
investors like Lazard, Templeton and Fidelity enabling the issue to be over-subscribed by 1.6 times with foreign investors participating with $750 million (75percent of the
offering). Thus IFC supported the GoP in achieving critical targets and the development of Pakistan’s capital markets. IFC’s investment in HBL is the largest investment by IFC
in Pakistan, including mobilization, which was processed in a record time of 36 days
Given HBL’s outreach of more than 1,600 branches, the investments in HBL are expected to have a transformational impact in an IDA country ranked 5th globally among
financially excluded populations. It will help increase financial inclusion, SMEs and rural and agri finance, women owned businesses and SEF. It would also support HBL’s
expansion in markets that are important for Pakistan for trade and remittances.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   IFC’s participation in the equity helped attract significant investor interest helping the largest equity offering by a Pakistani entity to be oversubscribed by 1.6x. IFC’s sup-
     port was critical amidst the security, political, and economic uncertainties in Pakistan.
■■   HBL has disbursed 107,275 new SME loans since September 2011, amounting to $5.3 bn and opened 273,433 new SME deposit accounts with help from IFC SME AS
     (completed in June 2013)
■■   IFC Agri AS is expected to complete by June 2017. It has helped HBL disburse 35,700 new agri loans amounting to $157 million.
■■   As a result of IFC’s Women Markets AS project that was completed in June 2015 and resulted in the launch of “Nisa”, a HBL sub brand for women, HBL has already added
     605,355 new deposit accounts for women and disbursed 12713 consumer loans to female borrowers since January 2014.
■■   The GTFP facility helped HBL finance trade commitments of about $600 million since inception, supporting trade of essential commodities such as oil and gas, agricultural
     products, chemicals and others.
■■   HBL has developed a comprehensive environmental and social management system and has started implementing it across its portfolio. Given that HBL is the largest bank
     in the country this will have a demonstration effect and will help in making sustainable lending a sector wide trend.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bank Alfalah Limited (“BAFL” or the “Bank”) is the fifth largest private sector bank in the country. It has a network of 648 branches that includes 157 Islamic Banking
     Branches. BAFL has an asset base of $8.2 billion, deposits of $6.0 billion and an equity base of $533 million as of Mar-16 with a ~6.4% market share (based on total
     assets). It also has presence in Bangladesh, Afghanistan and UAE and is listed on the Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore Stock Exchanges. The Bank has the fourth largest
     Islamic banking set up in the country in terms of branches that are spread across Pakistan. The Bank is majority owned by the Abu Dhabi Group comprising members
     of the Al Nahyan family, one of the ruling families of the UAE and leading businessmen and associates based in UAE

     IFC’s relationship with BAFL started in 2007 through the GTFP program with an original limit of $20 million that was later enhanced to $40 million. On the AS side, IFC
     completed a SME advisory program with the Bank related to capacity building of its SME banking operations in June 2014. This engagement paved the way for an
     equity opportunity in the Bank and IFC made an equity investment of $66.7 million for 15% stake in 2014. IFC is now engaged with the Bank on other AS discussions
     including agri financing and non-financial services.

     The equity investment provided critical capital support to the Bank. IFC’s investment will support the Bank in growing its conventional and Islamic banking operations,
     increase penetration into priority areas like SME banking and agri finance helping improve access to finance

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     While this is a relatively new investment and its results are yet to be seen, some of the benefits of this investment and previous engagements are as follows:
     ■■   IFC’s equity investment provided critical capital support enabling the Bank to continue with its growth trajectory.
     ■■   The SME Advisory project ran from June 2012 to June 2014, where a new SME unit was set up, the credit processes were re-engineered to be more efficient and
          attuned to the smaller SMEs, and competitive differentiation was ensured through introducing non-financial advisory function.
     ■■   BAFL became the first bank in the country to host the IFC’s SME toolkit, which offers a web based platform to outreach to the market
     ■■   BAFL has disbursed 52,788 new SME loans since Sept 2012 amounting to $ 5 bn and opened 64,710 new SME deposit accounts.
     ■■   The GTFP facility helped BAFL finance trade commitments of approximately $ 540 million since inception, supporting trade of essential commodities such as oil
          and gas, agricultural products, chemicals and others.
     ■■   BAFL has developed an environmental and social management system and has started implementing it across its portfolio that is expected to have a demonstra-
          tion effect and will help in making sustainable lending a sector wide trend.
