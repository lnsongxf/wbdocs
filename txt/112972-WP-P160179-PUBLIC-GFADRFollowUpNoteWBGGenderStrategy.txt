Summary


Context
The new World Bank Group (WBG) Gender Strategy, 2016–2023: Gender Equality,
Poverty Reduction, and Inclusive Growth, endorsed by the WBG’s Board in Decem-
ber 2015, aims to address the vast challenges related to gender equality and empow-
erment, by setting ambitious targets and adopting a rigorous methodology to assess
progress. The objectives of the Strategy are: (1) Improving Human Endowments
(health, education, social protection); (2) Removing Constraints for More and Better
Jobs (care services, unsafe transport, occupational sex segregation, entrepreneurship);
(3) Removing Barriers to Women’s Ownership of and Control over Assets (land, hous-
ing, financial inclusion, and technology, including ICT); and (4) Enhancing Wom-
en’s Voice and Agency and Engaging Men and Boys (child marriage, gender-based
violence, engaging men and boys, women’s participation and decision making). The
purpose of this Follow-Up Note is to describe the status of gender integration in the
work of the Food and Agriculture Global Practice (GFADR) and to define the Global
Practice’s approach to achieving the objectives of the Gender Strategy.

Providing women equal access to services, assets, and enhancing their agency and oppor-
tunities would increase agricultural output in developing countries between 2.5 and 4 per-
cent.1 To achieve the objectives of the agriculture sector’s projects, relevant gender gaps
must be addressed in a rigorous and meaningful manner, so that both men and women’s
capacity, skills and talent are harnessed to generate sustainable and better quality rural
livelihoods. Achieving gender equality is one of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDG 5), and women play an important role in attaining progress in several other SDGs.
Empowering women farmers is also essential to the World Bank Group’s twin objectives of
ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity. Additionally, under the IDA18
commitments, at least 75 percent of IDA18 financing operations for skills development
will consider how to support women’s participation in and improvement of the productiv-
ity of their economic activity, and/or consider how to reduce occupational segregation.

CHAPTER ONE
Background
Agricultural growth is effective in reducing poverty. Cross-country econo-
metric estimates show that overall GDP growth originating in agriculture is, on aver-
age, at least twice as effective in benefiting the poorest half of a country’s population
as growth generated in nonagricultural sectors.3 Agricultural growth is particularly
effective in reducing hunger and malnutrition. Most of the extreme poor depend on agricul-
ture and related activities for a significant part of their livelihoods. Agricultural growth involving
smallholders, especially women, will be most effective in reducing extreme poverty and
hunger when it increases returns to labor and generates employment for the poor.4

Women are key players in agriculture. Women comprise on average 43 percent
of the agricultural labor force, ranging from 20 percent in Latin America to 50 percent
in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, and exceeding 60 percent in a few coun-
tries.5 At the same time, across all regions women possess fewer assets for agriculture
(land, livestock, and human capital), have less access to agricultural inputs (seed, fer-
tilizer, labor, and finance), and have less access to agricultural services (extension and
insurance) than men.6 As a result, the agriculture sector is underperforming in many
developing countries. Closing the gender gap could increase women’s yields on farms
by 20–30 percent, raise total agricultural output by 2.5–4 percent, and potentially
reduce the number of hungry people by 12–17 percent. The gender gap in agriculture
imposes costs not only on women and their families, but also on the agricultural sector,
the broader economy, and society as a whole.

Progress on addressing the gender gaps in food and agriculture is a key
to meeting the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Twin Goals of ending extreme
poverty and increasing shared prosperity. Also, under the IDA18 commitments, at
least 75 percent of IDA18 financing operations for skills development will consider

The Gender Strategy, IDA18
commitments and Agriculture
The new World Bank Group Gender Strategy, 2016–2023: Gender Equality, Poverty Reduc-
tion, and Inclusive Growth, aims to match the global attention given to gender equality
by setting ambitious targets and adopting a rigorous methodology to assess progress,
with the overarching goal of attaining transformative rather than incremental change
(Annex One). The objectives of the Strategy are: (1) Improving Human Endowments
(health, education, social protection); (2) Removing Constraints for More and Better
Jobs (care services, unsafe transport, occupational sex segregation, entrepreneurship);
(3) Removing Barriers to Women’s Ownership of and Control over Assets (land, hous-
ing, financial inclusion, and technology, including ICT); and (4) Enhancing Women’s
Voice and Agency and Engaging Men and Boys (child marriage, gender-based vio-
lence, engaging men and boys, women’s participation and decision making).

The Strategy stresses that gender equality is a core development objec-
tive as well as smart development policy and practice. Sustainability cannot
be realized without increasing capacity and agency, and the distribution of opportunities, resources,
and choices for men and women. Not only is gender equality a desirable objective, it is also
a feasible one, in which all three major societal sectors/actors—public, private, and civil
society—have a role to play, especially in rural areas.

GFADR is acting to close gender gaps in agricultural productivity, by
improving access to services, inputs, agricultural land and capabilities,
and by enhancing resilience and fostering a low carbon path to devel-
opment. The GP also identifies action to close gender gaps in food security via the
increased production of, and access by all, to diverse and nutrient-dense crops. The
GP is working on building the resilience of women and men to cope with natural
(climate change), economic (commodity price volatility) and human (conflict) shocks
through its interventions that support the billions engaged across the entire global food
system, especially smallholder farmers.

    and theme
In the agriculture sector, gender gaps vary by country, region, and live-
lihood source; consequently, a deep understanding and analysis of the
context is necessary to define the appropriate pathway(s) to close those
gaps. However, at a broader level, gender focal points and key Task Team
Leaders in GFADR have identified seven key gender gaps in the food and
agriculture sector, as follows: (1) nutrition, (2) access to services and
inputs, (3) agricultural land tenure, (4) hiring/labor practices, (5) post-
secondary and tertiary education in agriculture, (6) voice, and (7) gender-
based violence. Additional important stressors identified in several regions were
(a) the impact of climate change—with differentiated impacts and costs imposed on
men and women, and (b) jobs—among others, men’s migration from rural areas, tech-
nology adoption, fragility, conflict and violence as well as climate change have a bear-
ing on both the quantity and nature of jobs in agriculture.

Implementing the World Bank Group’s Gender Strategy—from Analysis to Action to Impact                                                                   7
     Box 3.1. Gender in Climate-Smart Agriculture
     Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) offers a cogent approach to developing technical, policy, and investment options to support actions
     that target any one or all three outcomes, as follows: (1) sustainably increasing agricultural productivity, (2) building the resilience of
     food systems and farming livelihoods to climate change, and (3) reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. To succeed,
     climate-smart agricultural interventions depend on institutional, operational and behavioral changes, which are not possible without
     social analysis (including gender analysis) influencing policies and projects. CSA strategies are unlikely to be effective, let alone equi-
     table or transformative, without active attention to gender.† CSA practices may, for example, have undesired effects on the gender
     perspective related to workload, assets, crop residues, food waste/loss, food and nutrition security, mechanization and extension.
     Furthermore, CSA practices may require substantial investments of time, labor or cash, which often pose considerable constraints
     for women. A pilot training workshop on Gender in Climate-Smart Agriculture for Development Practitioners, was organized by the
     World Bank, FAO, and Africa Alliance for CSA, and facilitated by CARE Tanzania in May 2016. The pilot program underscored an
     urgent need for training on practical ways to integrate gender issues in CSA projects, building on past experiences and lessons learned
     at international and national levels. In Tanzania, some key issues raised by the participants included: the high labor burden placed on
     women; initial lower yields in conservation agriculture; choice of practices; and lack of extension services on practical CSA solutions.
     This evidence needs to be made available to policy and decision makers in a tailored and actionable form.

 The partnership between the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Women’s Affairs, and the World Bank’s
 Relaunching Agriculture: Strengthening Agriculture Public Services II Project (RESEPAG II)

 Activities:

     »» Conducted a gender review that revealed women’s low participation in professional and managerial positions in MARNDR
        (the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development). The review also showed women to be largely
        absent from leadership roles in mixed productive organizations, often due to low levels of literacy, time constraints imposed
        by domestic duties, and resistance from men to having women occupy such positions.
     »» Recruited a Gender Focal Point (an agronomist with gender expertise) into MARNDR.
     »» Facilitated an ongoing collaboration between MARNDR and the Ministry of Women’s Affairs (MCFDF) to begin inte-
        grating gender mainstreaming tools into RESEPAG as well as MARNDR policies and programs.
     »» Conducted an in-depth gender analysis of the project’s implementation documents and instruments, and provided con-
        crete recommendations.
     »» Strengthened women’s productive involvement in agriculture in the project pilot areas by building skills and providing gender
        sensitization training.
     »» Conducted gender sensitization workshops, focus groups discussions with women in producer cooperatives, and
        community-level training to understand challenges to women’s active participation and leadership.
     »» Developed a financial literacy program for women in agriculture to teach basic market, economy, and financial skills
        (for literate and illiterate individuals).
     »» Created a gender monitoring system for agricultural investments and strengthened the monitoring framework to better
        understand the project’s impact on its target beneficiaries.

 Results:

     »» Increased capacity within MARNDR to mainstream gender.
        •  In 2009, a Gender Focal Point from MCFDF was appointed to MARNDR to ensure effective mainstreaming of gender in
           policy and programming development in the agriculture sector.
        •  Guidelines for MARNDR recruitment were revised to remove gender bias.
     »» Improved inclusion in the project’s incentive fund.
        •  The language of the RESEPEG II Market Support Facility was revised to include more female farmers.
        •  The farm area required for an individual to be eligible for incentive funding was reduced from 10 to 5 hectares, as research
           showed that few women in Haiti owned 10 hectares.
     »» Strengthened ability to monitor gender inclusion in the agricultural sector.
        •  Introduced preliminary gender-relevant project indicators in the overall M&E system. The number of women receiving
           extension services, as well as women’s level of adoption of new technologies, is now tracked with a target of at least 20 per-
           cent for women heads of households.
     »» Female farmers’ financial capacity improved.
     »» A financial literacy training program developed to serve women in agriculture.
        •  The program teaches basic market, economic, and financial skills to enhance competence in agri-business management. A
           comprehensive guide for the financial literacy program was produced in French and Creole. The program is designed to be
           implemented in ways that do not add to women’s complex time burden.

CHAPTER FOUR
Good Practices and Lessons Learned
The Quality Enhancement Review process, including peer reviewers’
comments and discussions in the review meetings, is the most system-
atic way of sharing good practices on specific themes across the GP. Fur-
thermore, good practices and lessons learned are usually shared among task team
members or staff working in the same country or on similar kinds of projects. Differ-
ent Communities of Practice (formerly Thematic Groups) have assumed the role of
collecting and sharing good practices. Within GFADR, the GENRD CoP has—and
has since its foundation in 1998—played a major role. GENRD and the Agriculture
GP have also prepared several publications, such as the Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook,
with numerous examples of good practices and lessons. Annex Two gives good prac-
tice examples from several countries with a range of gender actions. More efforts are
being made to identify, develop and share good practices with teams and national
counterparts.

The following good practices are drawn from the GFADR portfolio and
can be addressed across the pipeline:
   »» Ensure equal opportunities for men and women to engage in project
      activities. Because women often have less access to formal and informal net-
      works in addition to having restricted mobility, they do not always have enough
      information on opportunities to participate in agricultural projects. A good
      practice is to ensure that both men and women have information on oppor-
      tunities within projects. Second, ensure that both groups have opportunities to
      participate in subprojects and committees and hold positions in project imple-
      menting units and related collective activities that support a project’s outcomes.
   »» Select one of the client government’s implementation team mem-
      bers as a “gender champion.” The client’s commitment to gender issues
      and capacity to champion them is necessary for successfully integrating gen-
      der in projects. The selection of a “gender champion” and the provision of
      capacity-building opportunities are special incentives for an individual who can
      subsequently provide training to the entire team while continuously advising
      and monitoring the implementation of agreed actions.

CHAPTER FIVE
Operationalizing Gender Work

Agriculture is a diverse sector, embracing numerous subsectors (crops,
livestock, fisheries, rural finance, extension and research, natural
resource management, land tenure and land management, etc.), each
requiring specific technical and socioeconomic approaches for effective
weaving in of gender considerations. At the same time, in listening to opera-
tional staff working across these subsectors, it is clear that some specific gender issues
would require attention and action across all operations. A strategic opportunity exists
to reduce gender gaps through GFADR investments by making sure that the following
questions are systematically reviewed and rigorously addressed in each new project:
     »» Does this operation build capacity? If so, whose and how?
     »» Does this operation create jobs? If so, for whom and how?
     »» Does this operation improve women’s access to assets and information? And if
        so, how?
     »» Does this operation improve voice and agency? If so, whose and how?

These questions correspond very closely to the objectives of the WBG Gender Strat-
egy, further underlining the importance of agriculture in achieving those objectives
and in providing opportunities for gender-responsive actions.

5.1 Project pipeline reviews
At the Agriculture GP level, the Global Engagement Unit systematically
reviews gender integration in all Project Concept Notes (PCNs) and Proj-
ect Appraisal Documents (PADs). Teams preparing projects receive advice on
how to improve analysis of issues and gender responsiveness in their projects. Gender
aspects of projects are also discussed in Quality Enhancement Review (QER) meet-
ings, and additional information, guidance, and resources are provided where neces-
sary and feasible.

5.2 Capacity building
Capacity building on gender aspects—of all stakeholders involved in the project
cycle—is key for the successful integration of gender in projects. In what follows, staff

    collection
The data collected within agricultural projects is demand-driven and
project specific. World Bank lending operations in agriculture conduct baseline
surveys, needs assessments, specific evaluations, and case studies (and other special
studies such as food processing studies, analyses of value chains, land use patterns,
or policy reviews; see Box 6.1) that are strongly connected to a project’s geographical
area, context and activities. Projects also amass specific M&E information, including
empirical data collected through detailed surveys or qualitative data from focus group
interviews. Surveys usually collect sex-disaggregated data if they focus on the project’s
beneficiaries, and some of the special studies focus specifically on gender issues in
a particular area of interest, such as a value chain. Studies and data are not always
included in the ISRs or even stored within the project portals, but are available to
other Task teams upon request.

 Box 6.2. New Gender Tag in Operational Portal
 The new Gender Tag tracks whether and how project appraisal documents identify specific gaps between women and men, and girls
 and boys in analyses, as part of the country engagement framework (country gender assessment, poverty assessment, SCD, CPF,
 Country Gender Action Plan) and links them to specific actions supported by the project, with indicators in the results framework.
 The gender tag is intended to prompt discussion at the design stage on the opportunity to close gaps between males and females in
 the four pillars of the World Bank Group Gender Strategy 2016–2023, i.e., human endowments, more and better jobs, ownership
 and control of assets, and voice and agency. The tag prompts operational teams to take an active role in identifying operations that
 are critical to closing key gender gaps and in preparing actions to address them in order to try and ensure that reporting on gender
 captures the good work being done in operations.

 The new tag introduces three major changes: First, the prompt in the portal has moved from the Activity Initiation Summary (AIS)
 to the Concept Note stage, because project conceptualization usually has not progressed sufficiently at AIS to allow the Task Team
 Leader (TTL) to provide meaningful answers; Second, the questions have been sharpened to ask if teams have articulated a results
 chain to address the identified gaps, thereby shifting the focus to quality and depth of analysis rather than on processes and track-
 ing quantity alone; and Finally teams will be asked to assess and rate the project’s performance in closing the targeted gender gaps
 identified during project preparation as part of the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR).

Resources
Presently, the gender team in the GFADR Global Engagement unit includes a GG
level Senior Gender in Agriculture Specialist funded by the Government of Finland.
Each region has nominated a gender focal point. To maintain the momentum of the
gender work in agriculture, critical in meeting the twin goals of the WBG and imple-
menting the WBG’s Gender Strategy, it is essential to ensure that a commensurate
resource envelope is provided for this work in GFADR.

Adequate budget to finance a gender expert as well as the funds required to ensure that
gender expertise and analytical and operational tools are available for the agriculture
teams are important to deliver on the implementation of the follow-up note and action
plan.

Internal and External Partnerships
Cross-boundary cooperation to achieve stronger gender outcomes and
to influence change exist through both current and planned investments,
technical assistance and analytics relating to agriculture. Lending to agri-
culture occurs across multiple World Bank GPs, regions, and thematic areas. The fol-
lowing GPs are key collaborators in moving the agriculture agenda forward: (1) Water
Resources, (2)  Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience, (3) Environment and Natural
Resources, (4) Trade and Competitiveness and (5) Transport and ICT. GFADR is also
working closely with the Health, Nutrition and Population GP. The nature and depth
of the cooperation depends on each analytical piece or project’s particular design and
approaches. At the operational level, depending on the proportional GP involvement
required, some operations will be co-managed by other GPs, while most will have team
members engage on cross-GP support. Similarly, effective collaboration with CCSAs Cli-
mate Change, Jobs, and Gender, is vital for GFADR’s work in gender. Specifically, inter-
action with the Gender CCSA will keep GFADR staff current on the implementation
of the WBG strategy, new ideas, and new practices, especially within the dimensions of
analysis and M&E.

Four thematic priorities—Global Solutions Groups (GSG)—structure
GFADR’s efforts to understand and support the sustainability of global
food system(s): Climate-Smart Agriculture, Food Quality and Safety,
Markets and Value Chains, and Employment and Livelihoods. The GSGs
for each of these themes work actively to bring these thematic areas into agriculture
operations, and at the same time, the gender team in GFADR and the Gender in Agri-
culture and Rural Development CoP will make a concerted effort to integrate gender
awareness, actions, and evidence-based good practices into the work of the GSGs.

World Bank Group (WBG) Gender
Strategy, 2016–2023:27 Executive
Summary

By many measures, 2015 marks a watershed year in the international community’s
efforts to advance gender equality. In September, with the adoption of the Sustain-
able Development Goals (SDGs), UN Member States committed to a renewed and
more ambitious framework for development. This agenda, with a deadline of 2030,
emphasizes inclusion not just as an end in and of itself but as critical to development
effectiveness. At the center of this agenda is the achievement of gender equality and
empowerment of all women and girls (SDG 5). In addition to governments, the pri-
vate sector is increasingly committed to reducing gaps between men and women not
just because it is the right thing to do, but because it makes business sense. 27

Gender equality is also central to the World Bank Group’s own goals of ending
extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. No soci-
ety can develop sustainably without transforming the distribution of opportunities,
resources, and choices for males and females so that they have equal power to shape
their own lives and contribute to their families, communities, and countries. Promoting
gender equality is smart development policy.

During the past 15 years the World Bank Group has accelerated progress in addressing
gaps between males and females in its operational and analytic work, while at the same
time advancing its understanding of what works and what does not to close those gaps.
The 2001 strategy called for country and task teams to incorporate a gender lens in the
design and objectives of their engagements and established a monitoring framework
to track these considerations at entry. This approach helped raise awareness about
gender equality and its centrality in Bank Group operations.

Africa Regional Brief

BACKGROUND
Gender inequality permeates the economic fabric of many African countries: address-
ing it is an integral part of solving structural challenges faced by half of the region’s
population, as well as for unleashing Africa’s economic potential. In most of the African
countries, agriculture is the engine of growth, and the gender asymmetries are critical
in rural areas. The framing of this annex on the Gender Strategy and agriculture in
Africa follows the framing of the Gender Action Plan (2013–18) recently developed by
the Gender Team in Africa. The action plan stresses the need for generating and using
a sound evidence base to guide policy dialogue in African countries. While supporting
the mainstreaming of gender, the plan raises four thematic issues: (1) reducing female
mortality rates; (2) closing earnings and productivity gaps; (3) shrinking the differences
in voice in the household and society; and (4) investing in youth. All of these themes
are relevant to agriculture.

CRITICAL GAPS
Reducing Female Mortality. Gender asymmetries in health care provision contrib-
ute to female mortality, along with deficiencies in nutrition among pregnant women
and children. The links between malnutrition, child mortality, and stunting are clear.
Regional maternal mortality rates for 2015 ranged from 12 deaths per 100,000 live-
births for developed regions to 546 (511–652) for SSA. While the figures for SSA are
high, there has been substantial improvement from 1 death per 16 women in 1990, to
1 per 36 women in 2015. Rwanda and Cape Verde achieved a 75 percent reduction in
maternal mortality during that period.

Gender inequality in nutrition—resulting from women’s weak land rights, lower levels
of education, and inadequate access to credit, extension services, and technologies—has
been widely documented. Conversely, when women have more control over household
resources, children’s nutrition has been found to be better. Households in which women

East Asia and Pacific Regional Brief

BACKGROUND
The EAP region is very diverse, and the gender constraints differ, especially between
the Pacific and other parts of the region. The Pacific region has experienced faster
growth and greater poverty reduction than any other region. These achievements
have helped to narrow gender gaps, most notably in education and health. Gender
gaps in access to education—including secondary and tertiary education—have closed
dramatically.

Despite progress, important challenges remain to achieving gender equality in the
region. Growth and development alone are not sufficient to achieve gender equality
in all socioeconomic dimensions and for all women. Gender gaps in economic oppor-
tunity and influence in society have proven particularly persistent. The Pacific region
suffers from gender inequalities reflected in women’s inferior asset endowments, eco-
nomic opportunities, and voice and agency. Women are also disproportionately vul-
nerable to the effects of natural disasters and climate change, which heighten the risks
to their livelihoods, especially in the Pacific.

Female labor force participation is relatively high in EAP, where about 70 percent of
women participate in economic activities—exceeding every other region. Women also
have a higher level of participation in the management and ownership of firms than
women in other developing regions. In the Pacific region, many women in both urban
and rural areas work in the informal sector. Even though most of the region’s econo-
mies have shifted away from agriculture and toward manufacturing and services, agri-
culture still employs a large share of the labor force, ranging from about 34 percent in
the Philippines to 70 percent in Lao PDR. Most people in the poorest households work
in agriculture. Men have more opportunities for employment outside of agriculture,
while women are more likely to engage in unpaid family labor in agriculture and in
the informal sector. In addition, the EAP population is aging faster—and on a larger
scale—than the population of any other region in history, which increases women’s
care-related work burden.

Europe and Central Asia Regional Brief

BACKGROUND
Overall, ECA countries have managed to close large gender gaps in human develop-
ment, yet women continue to lag behind men in economic opportunities in most coun-
tries. Attitudes towards gender have been greatly affected by political systems in the
region. The socialist ideology that prevailed in much of ECA included a fairly strong
element of gender parity and contributed to the development of a legal framework
that is broadly gender neutral with respect to inheritance, property, freedom of move-
ment, and the educational rights of women and girls. The collapse of the communist
and socialist regimes and a resurgence of religiosity has led to some backtracking in
equality as traditional paternalistic patterns have reasserted themselves and spread.

While some countries have become more equal, women in certain communities face
barriers that reduce welfare and growth. The barriers are most evident when it comes
to women’s economic and leadership opportunities,32 even though their educational
achievement and tertiary education levels are generally higher than those of men in
many ECA countries. Female labor participation and educational attainment vary
considerably across the region. Women play a crucial role in local food security and
comprise about 17 percent of agricultural workers in ECA countries. Variation across
countries with respect to averages is modest. In Central Asia, however, women are
almost exclusively responsible for weeding cotton fields, and they provide a large part
of the labor for the harvest. Because much of this labor is informal, and like other
labor spent on family farms, it is not usually captured in official statistics. In fact, most
agricultural employment in the region is informal. Many women work as farmers on
their own account or as unpaid family workers, yet they do not declare themselves
to be employed (or seeking work) in agriculture.33 Self-employment tends to be more
widespread in ECA countries with large rural populations.34

Latin America Regional Brief

BACKGROUND
Agriculture is one of the keys to promoting growth and reducing poverty and food
insecurity in LAC. It represents almost 8 percent of the region’s combined GDP and
employs 20 percent of the population. It is also the most pro-poor sector, with growth in
agriculture proving more effective than nonagricultural growth at reducing poverty.38
Almost two-thirds of the region’s rural population still lives in poverty, and women
are overrepresented among the poor. For that reason, mainstreaming gender in agri-
culture not only is essential for the sector’s performance but also is also essential for
poverty reduction, food security, and gender equality.

The region’s rural women have less access than men to resources, particularly to
productive assets such as land, water, credit, and agriculture inputs. This disparity
helps account for women’s higher levels of poverty and vulnerability.39 The latest data
available for the region show that women in rural areas are poorer than men, except
in Guatemala and El Salvador. The gap is most pronounced in Uruguay and the
Dominican Republic, where women are 20 percent and 18 percent poorer than men,
respectively.

The countries of Latin America have high overall rates of female labor-force partici-
pation, but women participate much less in agriculture than women in other devel-
oping country regions. This pattern reflects relatively high female education levels,
economic growth and diversification, and cultural norms that support female migra-
tion to service jobs in urban areas. Just over 20 percent of the agricultural labor force
in Latin America was female in 2010, slightly higher than in 1980. Their participa-
tion in agriculture varies from a low of 10 percent in Central America to 43 percent

BACKGROUND
In MNA, agriculture is central to national economies, and women play key roles in the
production of goods. The female share of the agricultural labor force in the Near East
and North Africa appears to have risen substantially, from 30 percent in 1980 to almost
45 percent in 2010. Some of the highest and fastest-growing participation in the region
is found in Jordan, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and the Syrian Arab Republic.55 Rapid
growth in the number of wage workers in the region and in women’s agricultural labor
is widening the gap between female urban and rural labor force participation. Some
studies suggest that this feminization of agriculture maybe partly attributable to male
out-migration but is due mostly to globalization, population increase, and agricultural
intensification affecting differential gender roles as a response to labor market supply
and demand.56 For example, a case study from Syria57 indicates that the feminization
of agricultural labor reflects a situation in which women provide the bulk of agricul-
tural labor but are not involved in farm management, because the male head of the
household remains on the farm while other male household members work off of the
farm in urban areas or migrate to neighboring countries for work.

In MNA, conservative gender norms and an institutional framework that sometimes
formalizes unequal rights for women limit women’s opportunities to participate in the
economy by limiting their mobility and occupational choices, as well as their agency
and voice within and outside the home. Combined with an economic structure that
incentivizes women to stay at home or work in the public sector, limited options in the

South Asia Regional Brief

BACKGROUND
South Asia has experienced a long period of robust economic growth and has been
among the fastest growing in the world. From a sectorial point of view, agriculture
and services have driven the growth performance across South Asia.69 Despite recent
economic growth and changing social norms, dramatic gender inequities persist in
South Asia. SAR has the second-lowest rate of female labor force participation among
the six World Bank regions (MNA is lowest). SAR also has the largest gender dispar-
ity (16 percentage points) of all six regions when considering accounts held at formal
institutions,70 and gender gaps in secondary education completion rates continue to
be large.

The female share of the total population economically active in agriculture is about
35 percent in South Asia. The female share in India has remained steady at just over
30 percent. A very large country such as India can mask changes in some smaller coun-
tries in the region, where the female share of the agricultural labor force appears to
have increased dramatically—for instance, it now exceeds 50 percent in Bangladesh.71
Almost 70 percent of employed women in South Asia work in agriculture, making it
the most important source of employment for women by a wide margin, and much
more important for women than for men.72 At the same time, women in SAR engage
relatively more in agricultural wage employment than women in any other region,
most likely because of the increasing landlessness in SAR and because women in other
regions tend to have weaker property rights in land and other assets.73 Women in SAR

World Bank: Gender Equality Data and Statistics. This gender data portal is a one-stop
shop for gender information, catering to a wide range of users and providing data
from a variety of sources. The portal has indicators related to five dimensions of
gender equality: economic structures and access to resources; education; health and
related services; public life and decision making; and human rights of women and girl
children.

IFAD: Rural Poverty Portal. This portal provides a brief description of the poverty status
in rural areas in different countries as well as general information on rural poverty.

FAO: Gender and Land Rights Database. This portal highlights the major political, legal,
and cultural factors that influence women’s ability to claim their land rights through-
out the world. It includes 84 country profiles, land tenure statistics disaggregated by
gender, and a Legislation Assessment Tool for gender-equitable land tenure.

FAO: Agri-gender Statistics Toolkit. This toolkit supports increased collection and analysis
of sex-disaggregated agricultural data. It includes a compilation of gender-sensitive
questions, questionnaire components, and tables. The database is structured around
nine items related to agriculture: agricultural population and households; access to
productive resources; production and productivity; destination of agricultural pro-
duce; labor and time use; income and expenditures; membership in agricultural or
farmer organizations; and food security poverty indicators.

UN Women Watch: Facts and Figures: Rural Women and the Millennium Development
Goals. The portal highlights the rural women’s progress in achieving key Millennium
Development Goal indicators, pointing to advances that have been made and gaps
that still exist. In addition, the portal describes the comparative advantage of different
UN organizations in relation to rural women.

World Economic Forum: Annual Global Gender Gap Report. The Global Gender Gap
Index 2015 ranks 145 economies according to how well they are leveraging their female
