     his study would not have been possible without the input of many people. We would like to thank
     all the Somali men and women who shared their experiences and perspectives through focus group
     discussions, interviews and life-stories. And of course, special thanks to the dedicated and excellent
Somali research team and translators (see below), whose combined efforts has generated rich findings, only
some of which are captured in this report; the rest will form the basis of future analysis and documentation.

Special thanks to Fouzia Musse and Rhoda Ibrahim for keeping faith in the study since it was first conceived
back in 2004. And to Rakiya Omar, whose vision and drive put the wind in the sails and ensured work with
Somali institutions and trainee Somali graduate researchers became a key feature of the research process. The
research topic was explored and developed during a workshop in May 2013 with the invaluable help of Ra-
kiya, Asia Abdulkadir, Hala Al-Kharib, Cedric Barnes, Chris Dolan, Judy El-Bushra, Ahmed Farah Mohamed,
Faisa Loyaan, Osman Moallin, Fouzia Musse and Zakaria Yusuf.

The study team is indebted to the Somali interlocutors and institutions whose assistance in each of the field-
work locations was invaluable. In particular: SAYS in Boroma; Hassan Ibrahim, President of Sanaag Uni-
versity, Erigavo; SONYO, SOYAAL and NAGAAD in Hargeisa; Ahmed Fara and Norwegian People’s Aid,
Las Canood; Farhia Said, Garowe; SOYDEN in Mogadishu; GREDO in Baidoa; TRACKS in Dadaab and
Ahmed Warsame, Head of Operations, and the UNHCR team in Dadaab; and Ibrahim Hussein for assistance
in Eastleigh.

Particular mention is due to Adam Haji Ali, Director of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, Hargeisa
University and Burhan Adan Omar, Deputy Dean, Faculty of Law, Puntland State University for convening
critical thinking events on questions relating to the study.

Special thanks to the Rift Valley Institute (RVI) and its Nairobi Forum for including the study in its research
portfolio. The study team are grateful to RVI colleagues Charles Kyale, Amina Abdulkadir and Kit Kidner for
logistical and administrative support. Thanks are also due to Ellie Bradbury and Jo Kinnear for their input and
Adam Bradbury for editorial assistance. And finally, special thanks to Verena Phipps of LOGiCA and Mark

     He must respect clan laws (xeer) and respect the elders of the clan.
     A man must participate in decision-making
     He must accept decisions and follow leaders (a man who does this is gargaate)
     The clan expects contributions and qaraan (membership dues) and he must pay them.
     A man who does not have income to contribute qaraan is not respected.
     Those who don’t have wealth should also be active in the clan; they can give their physical support.
     A man must protect the dignity of the clan and promote its reputation; if he does not there could be
     negative repercussions for him.
     He should be attached to his clan and show dependency; he should not be disconnected and iso-

         Khat addiction and mental illness emerge as both causes and effects of male failure to fulfil family
         responsibilities. Many respondents pointed to depression and a sense of alienation when they were
         no longer able to provide for their families, as described by this man from Garowe: “Women and chil-
         dren don’t share their plans with men. They come and go as they wish. You stand there and you feel you’re
         nothing, nobody.” Not all such men resort to khat or other drugs but many do. Feeding khat addiction
         is costly, linked to mental illness and domestic violence, and a cause of family poverty and misery; at
         the same time, the sale of khat by women generates family income; rural women report hiding the
         family livestock from their husbands and sons because they know they have bought khat on credit in
         town, promising to pay in livestock; some women readily pay for their menfolk’s daily khat supply to
         encourage them to stay at home with the children and prevent them from stealing from the family’s
         livestock to pay for it.
         Findings suggest there may be strong links between khat addiction among men and conflict-related
         trauma, unemployment or financial dependency on others, and mental illness. Men of all ages and
         backgrounds commonly recalled periods when they experienced some form of mental breakdown.
         Many of the young men spoke of avoiding khat or having managed to overcome a khat addiction and
         finding their mental health and lives in general improved.

                     BOX 2.2 Extract from a young man’s testimony - from Mogadishu*


     I had a very devastating experience that continues to haunt me to date. While I was in Mogadishu I was
     approached by an elder to carry an explosive from point A to point B. I would not like to mention the name,
     I just fell into a trap. An elder approached me and asked me, “Do you want money?” I hesitated to answer
     him as I did not know the source of the money he was talking about. He followed me for many days to try
     to convince me. He said, “You will just carry this item from here to that place and you will get your money”.
     Eventually I agreed to take the money but was hesitant to be involved. The elder then decided to threaten me.
     I got convinced at some point that he may kill me if I don’t do the job. I then decided to accomplish the work.
     He gave me the explosive. It was about 1½ kg and I was to take it past a road block manned by AMISOM
     and the Somali army. I put the explosive in a paper bag together with some of my clothes and took off. While
     I was engaged in the process a friend of mine realized what I was planning to do and asked me, “What are
     you doing?” I told him, “I am doing this to save my life”. I knew I was getting involved in a very risky venture.
     Both ways I would die - if I am caught with this explosive by government soldiers or AMISOM that is the end
     of me and if I don’t fulfil the mission the elder will plan to eliminate me. So I decided to face the fate. I carried
     the explosive in a paper bag with my clothing as I have just explained and started the journey.
     This story ends with the young man’s mother finding out what he had been forced to do. Fearing for
     his life, she funded his escape to Kenya. He was visibly nervous when sharing his story and told the
     interviewer he lives in fear of Al-Shabaab finding and killing him. Nevertheless, he asked to share his
     story so that people will understand how difficult life is for young men like him who are poor and
     therefore vulnerable.

Methodology and process
Fieldwork has been conducted by a team of experienced Somali researchers plus trainee researchers who are
Somali graduates, (seven men and three women in total), in nine locations spanning south central Somalia,
Puntland, Somaliland, and Kenya.

Somaliland	       		Hargeisa

				Boroma

				                                Erigavo 	(in Somaliland / Puntland disputed zone)

				                                Las Canood	       (in Somaliland / Puntland disputed zone)

Puntland			Garowe

South Central Somalia	 	Mogadishu

				Baidoa

Kenya	 			                          Dadaab refugee camps (Hagadere, Ifo, Dagahaley)

				Eastleigh 	(Nairobi)	

The three Somali territories and the refugee and diaspora communities in Kenya have provided a diverse
spectrum of environments: on-going armed conflict with international dimensions (south central Somalia),
‘recovered areas’ dependent on clan-based security, areas of peace and stability maintained in a weak state
context (Somaliland and Puntland), refugee camps (northern Kenya) and diaspora communities (Nairobi).

The inception phase findings have been generated from consultation with over 400 men and 90 women using
the following research methodologies:

•	   Focus group discussions (29): in each location FGD were held, individually with older men, younger
     men and a validation group of mixed age group women, in order to identify and map out the key issues
     that should be explored through the study and the relevant target groups.
•	   Semi-structured interviews (32): following up on specific issues raised during the focus group discus-
     sions, constructing a historical time-line for each location and helping to identify respondents for life-
     story (testimony) collection.
•	   Life-story (testimony) collection (47): for each location the researchers sought older and younger
     men, urban and rural, majority and minority clan willing to share their life-stories. Each life-story was
     digitally recorded, transcribed and translated into English.
•	   Critical thinking events (2): the study partnered with Hargeisa University and Puntland State Univer-
     sity to convene two critical thinking events, one in Hargeisa, Somaliland and one in Garowe, Puntland.

          Husbands, fathers, sons
          Married and unmarried

     Consultations with Women

     In each location the study held a FGD with women. This was partly to validate the findings from the other
     FGDs and to hear women’s perspectives in their own right. The women consulted were drawn from the fol-
     lowing groups: educated and uneducated, professional, self-employed and traditional women; youth, adult,
     older women; religious leaders; minority and majority clans; civil society activists and local and national
     government representatives.

     Validation of the Findings

     Several meetings to present and discuss the research findings were held:

     •	     Validation event (1): Nairobi with Somali diaspora
     •	     Validation event (2): Hargeisa with key male stakeholders
     •	     Validation event (3): Mogadishu with men and women (pending)
     •	     Validation event (4) Hargeisa with women representatives

     Research Constraints

     Due to security constraints and associated costs, research in south central Somalia and Puntland covered
     fewer locations than in Somaliland. This will be rectified in the main study and already a follow on visit has
     been made to Baidoa.

     Al Shabaab-related insecurity in Dadaab meant focus group participants did not feel able to speak as freely
     as they would have liked for fear of retaliation and revenge attacks. The men consulted were keen to talk but
     visibly nervous.

     We did not hear much about religion in general, reportedly because in the current climate peopleare worried
     about sharing their views and experiences in relation to fundamentalism and Al Shabaab. This is an area the
     main study will seek to explore in more depth.

     Ten to twelve days were spent in each location which proved sufficient time to complete planned activities
     but insufficient time to process, analyse and follow up findings as they were generated.

Diya Groups and Customary Law
Diya-paying groups

The diya-group is the collective social institution that has most day-to-day relevance for men for it is at this
level that collective action takes place and collective accountability is realised. It is also the level at which the
political and social implications of clan membership are most clearly defined and collective security derived.
A single group may comprise several hundred families who are united through genealogy and marriage ties
and who are obliged to protect one another and to pay and receive blood compensation (diya) for murder
and other injuries. Traditonally diya is paid in livestock [see Table 1 in Annex 3 below]; the threat of losing
livestock to diya payments acts as a deterrent against violence and reinforces collective responsibility.

Diya payment was made illegal during the 1970s in Siad Barre’s attempt to eradicate clanism. State adminis-
tered accident and death insurance was introduced instead, though as the state structure had little reach into
the remote rural areas the customary laws and diya system endured.168

Figure 1 below gives an annotated diagrammatic representation of the diya group system. The diagram takes
a single clan lineage as an example. Depending on its size, each clan family comprises a number of main clan
lineages. As the male population grows so too do the lineages and over time they divide into sub-lineages. In
this way a main lineage will grow with branches of sub-lineages, some stronger and some weaker, depending
on the number of men they comprise. Thus the basis of a lineage’s potential strength and power is numeri-
cal - and what is counted is males. Because they can call on more kinsmen the larger branches are likely to be
stronger and more powerful than the smaller ones. This issue of numerical inequality has political and social
implications.

     Within some clans and sub-clans, a man’s obligations to his diya group and clan depend on his marital status.
     For example in the west of Somaliland unmarried men are not required to pay diya, but, crucially, they also
     do not receive it. In the east all men, regardless of marital status are required to pay. A man who does not give
     his share when required will be socially isolated and will not receive any diya contribution or other types of
     clan support when his own needs arise. It is not only the man who suffers in these situations but his wife and
     children too.

     Customary law or xeer

     “Kinship ties alone are insufficient to achieve social cohesion and cooperation. This requires rules of behav-
     iour and agreements between groups that define collective rights and responsibilities and further common
     interests. These rights and obligations are laid down in unwritten agreements or contracts between clans,
     known as xeer, that are transmitted orally through generations. Xeer exist at different levels of lineage segmen-
     tation. Collectively they form a repository of customary law (xeer somali) that defines basic social norms and
     values. Together the collective councils of elders, the office of the titled lineage heads and the xeer provide
     institutional mechanisms for managing turbulent change and conflict.” (Bradbury 2008)
