                                              SUMMARY

In 2015, students from more than 72 countries and economies participated in PISA, an international
assessment. Administered every three years by the OECD, PISA measures the skills of 15 year-old
students in applying their knowledge of science, reading, and math to real life problems. PISA provides
data on the strengths and areas for development in education systems, supports the development of
effective policies, and allows for benchmarking country achievements relative to other participating
countries.

The World Bank has performed in-depth analyses using PISA 2015 data. The analysis provides insight
into factors which determine which education policies have led to improvements – and those which
should be strengthened – in various systems.

This brief includes regional reports for the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region and the European
Union (EU). A summary for each regional report is included. This brief also includes individual analyses
for 22 select countries and economies in the ECA region. The brief analyzes education system
inequalities, the benefits of preschool attendance, and student factors – among many others – which
impact performance.




ABOUT PISA:

PISA was launched in 2000 and is conducted every three years. Roughly, 30 points in the PISA scales
are considered equivalent to one year of schooling in PISA 2015.




The summary statistics presented in this document are based on PISA 2015 test score analysis conducted by the Europe and
Central Asia team of the World Bank Group’s Education Global Practice. The findings do not necessarily represent the views of
the WBG or its member countries and economies.
                                                                                                                                  3

Note: Not all of the statistics are available for the 22 countries and economies that participated in PISA. For
instance, Kazakhstan’s results may not be comparable to those of other countries or to the results for
Kazakhstan from previous years’ (OECD, PISA 2015 Results Volume I, pp.304), thus it was excluded from this brief.
Microdata for Cyprus is not available; and it is not possible to match the test data for Albania with the data from
the student questionnaire.

In 2015, the OECD introduced several improvements to the design, administration, and scaling of PISA. For the
most part, these changes did not affect the comparability of the 2015 results with those for previous
assessments. For further information and implications for analyses of PISA data, please consult the PISA 2015
international report.

                                 §  There is a remarkable increase in PISA participation by our program countries since its inception
                                    [from 10 participant countries in 2000 to 22 in 2015].

                                 §  The ECA* countries perform below the OECD and the EU averages across all subjects; and the
                                    regional average decreased from 2012 levels. Our program countries have a high proportion [38
                                    percent for math and 34 percent for reading] of students who do not achieve basic proficiency
                                    levels and are considered illiterate and innumerate by OECD standards. Further work will explore
                                    how these proportions have changed over time.

                                 §  Given the budget allocations invested in education, many countries in the region are not reaping all
                                    the benefits in terms of student learning.

   OECD average. However, the Czech Republic
   saw a significant decline in both science and
   mathematics performance between 2006 and
   2015.     Reading performance remained
   constant over the same period.
                                                                        2000            511           492              498

   The difference in performance is equivalent to
   nearly 4 years of schooling.       A smaller                         2015            493           487              492

  Note: In 2015, the OECD introduced several                         430
  improvements to the design, administration, and scaling
  of PISA. For the most part, these changes did not affect
  the comparability of the 2015 results with those for               400
  previous assessments. For further information and

§  According to the OECD, "in Kazakhstan, the
   national coders were found to be lenient in
   marking. Consequently, the human-coded
   items did not meet PISA standards and were
   excluded from the international data. Since                                                    2000             -                  -               -
   human-coded items form an important part
   of the constructs that are tested by PISA, the                                                 2003             -                  -               -
   exclusion of these items resulted in
   significantly smaller coverage of the PISA test.                                               2006             -                  -               -
   As a result, Kazakhstan’s results may not be
   comparable to those of other countries or to                                                   2009           400                 390           405

§  Kosovo participated in PISA for the first time
   in 2015. Overall performance in all three
   subjects lags behind ECA and OECD
   averages. Kosovo’s outcomes in science
   place its students the equivalent of almost
                                                                          SCIENCE        READING       MATH
   four years of schooling behind the OECD
   average.

§  The share of students performing below
   basic proficiency in science is 68 percent,
   much higher than neighboring Montenegro                      Kosovo     378            347           362
   and Albania, and significantly higher than the
   OECD average of 21 percent. For reading and
   mathematics, more than three-quarters of                       ECA      454            451           449
   students perform below basic proficiency.

§  There are inequities in the Kosovo education
   system. In science, the gap in performance
   between students from the top and bottom
   income groups is the equivalent of 1.5 years
   of schooling; and urban students outperform
   rural peers by almost one year of schooling.

§  Despite impressive improvements, Moldova
   needs to continue reducing the performance                 Scores underlined indicate a statistically significant
   gap in science between students from the top               change between 2009 and 2015
   and bottom income groups –the equivalent to
   almost three years of schooling -- and between

  and skills of 15 year-olds. PISA tests proficiency in
  mathematics, reading, science, and problem-
  solving. In 2015, 72 countries and economies (22                                                                         411

§  However, its performance in all subject areas
   decreased since 2012. The largest decline was in
   science, equivalent to almost one year of
   schooling; while the decline in reading and math              2000           483            479            470

    ABOUT PISA:
    PISA is the OECD’s benchmarking tool to assess                                                           ROMANIA
    achievement and application of key knowledge               400
    and skills of 15 year-olds. PISA tests proficiency in
    mathematics, reading, science, and problem-
    solving. In 2015, 72 countries and economies (22
    ECA client countries and economies) participated
                                                               350

The PISA 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015 assessments use the same science performance scale, which means that
score points are comparable over time for these years only. The same is true for the reading performance scale
used since PISA 2000 and the mathematics performance scale used since PISA 2003. The exception in the EU is
Albania. The increase in the mathematics mean score for Albania between PISA 2012 and PISA 2015 (+19 score
points) would have been smaller and most likely be reported as not significant (+7 points) had all results been
generated under a consistent scaling approach (OECD, 2016).

§  EU countries rank among the top performing countries in PISA 2015.

§  The EU average score has been stable across all subjects and slightly below that of the OECD.

§  The proportion of students who do not achieve basic proficiency levels was 24 percent for math and
   22 percent for reading; slightly higher than the OECD [22 percent and 20 percent, respectively].
   Countries with the highest proportion of low performers are concentrated in the Balkans.

§  In 2015, Poland not only experienced diminished performance across all subjects in relation to 2012, but
   also the reduction was one of the highest. In contrast, Sweden registered one of the highest
   improvements in the three subjects.

§  Given the budget allocations invested in education, most EU countries are reaping the benefits in terms
   of student learning (exceptions are Cyprus and Luxembourg).

    proportion of students attending preschool
    in 2003 have higher science scores in PISA

 §  Preschool access is relatively high in the EU,
    although it remains low in a few countries
    [those located on the Balkan Peninsula].                                                  2008                                                                 84,4
    Even though access rates are high and they
    have substantially increased over the last
    years, a bit more could be done to achieve
    the last mile and achieve universal                                                       2003                                              71,1
