6 ""Conclusions:"
      The following conclusions are drawn from the Zimbabwe Water Sector Investment Analysis.

            The best use of the next dollar in the water sector, in terms of the highest socio-
      1     economic return on scarce financial resources per cubic meter of water, is rural water
            for basic needs and household production. This is the sector which has received the
            lowest allocation of public funds in recent years. There are problems, however, with the
            absorption capacity of the rural context due to a general lack of technical, professional
            and managerial capacity which itself requires investment.


            Rehabilitation of existing infrastructure to restore safe reliable water services (water
      2     supply and waste water treatment) is urgently required to underpin economic recovery.
            Rehabilitation includes restoration of services, reduction of network losses and non-
            revenue water, improvement of customer service and relationships, and efficient admin-
            istration. ‘Ring-fencing’ of water service revenue should be applied to ensure financial
            viability.


            Except in the case of Harare, no new water storage infrastructure is needed for the next
      3     two decades at least, based on optimistic recovery and growth projections.


            Due both to the economic collapse and apparent change in long-term rainfall patterns,
      4     supply augmentation investments are required in Bulawayo, Gweru, Karoi and Plumtree.
            Low-cost incremental options for supply augmentation options require urgent attention.


            All investments need to be subjected to thorough economic and cost-benefit analyses
      5     from a national, multi-sector and sector-wide perspective.


            Whilst millions of citizens do not have access to basic water supply and sanitation ser-
      6     vices, and lack water for sustainable productive subsistence use, investments in large
            prestige new projects which benefit few people are not in the greater public interest.


            The water sector in Zimbabwe cannot be run in a pre-collapse, ‘business as usual’
      7     manner. The pre-collapse economy, one of the strongest in Africa, is gone. The coun-
            try has reverted to basic un-developed status which it shares with the poorest countries
            in Africa and globally. Investment decisions in the water and other sectors, which may
            have been valid 15 years ago, are not valid today. Thus, whilst the crisis in basic rural,
            small town and urban water services persists, the policy of maintaining multi-year public
            expenditure allocations to large new ongoing projects (such as Tokwe-Mukorsi), be-
            cause they are already underway, is not in the greater public interest.


            Where projects provide opportunity for commercial return on investments, alternative
      8     sources of finance should be used - public sector finance should be reserved for priori-
            ties where commercial finance is not available.


            Public expenditure priorities need to be revised to align spending with the greater public
      9     interest. Revised priorities and policies should then be applied to actual allocation and
            expenditure.

the time of the assignment – some have been changed following the elections in 2013.]
  •   Ministry of Water Resources Development and Management;
  •   Ministry of Finance;
  •   Ministry of Energy & Power Development;
  •   Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation & Irrigation Development;
