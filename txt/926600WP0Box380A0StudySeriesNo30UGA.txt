alone; everyone is connected to various
parts of their community, with variables
of context and time. With this intercon-

and sometimes school shape their iden-

then can achieve results by helping par-

around the issues they face, and to conceptualize and rehearse future decisions and actions. This process is described in
part by educational psychologist Bloom’s pedagogy of higher learning. Figure 1 details the “Bloom Taxonomy of Learn-
ing Objectives,” from the beginning of the learning process (base) to the final result (peak).

There was a great deal of enthusiasm at the parish level for Stepping Stones participation. Table 2 outlines the overall

C        oncern Worldwide designed the VST livelihood program to address key challenges in the region, including
         high levels of illiteracy, low levels of education, and obstacles for women in accessing economic opportunities.
         Concern also targeted male youth who “face challenges in adapting to changing livelihood patterns in Karamoja
and are at risk of engaging in conflict” (Concern 2013b, 5). Implicit in the design of the livelihood project was the theory
that through increased economic opportunities (alternative livelihoods) for both genders, positive gains could be made
towards sustainable livelihoods, improved overall economic stability, and decreased violence.

Concern, along with the local four partner organizations, selected intervention villages based on areas that were the least
served by other organizations (as reported by local officials). Recruitment efforts included discussions with local officials
and community leaders to identify unemployed male and female youth and disadvantaged households for participation.

Participant selection varied by location based on the local partner and the market assessments.61 At times, Concern or
the local partners encouraged participants to select a specific program in order to ensure gender balance or even numbers
across programs. Participants could only register for one VST program. The local partners determined how many partici-
pants they could reach and what livelihoods alternatives they wanted to offer based on their organization’s budget, staff,
and technical expertise. Table 1 depicts the total numbers of participants for each VST skill area in 2012 and 2013.



61  The same VST programs were not offered in every location. Based on input from local authorities, market assessments, previously existing programs in
the area, and feedback from community members, VST and its local partners decided which trainings would occur in which sites. Some of the communities
had multiple VST local partners operating in the area, with a variety of skills offered to the participants. Other villages had only one partner and one skill set.

This report analyzed data using a mixed ef-
fects model to best capture both change
over time and incorporate the design effect.
A mixed-methods model is particularly well
suited for data with repeated measurements
(baseline, midterms 1 and 2, and endline)
made on the same units (in this case youth
respondents), and where measurements are
made on clustered units (in this case the par-
ish). Given the stepped wedge design of the
impact evaluation, and hence multiple corre-
lated measurements on the same respondent,
this model is ideal for analyzing change over
time and illustrates how the treatment pro-
gram gradually covers a greater portion of the
population (Figure 1).

Stones program as well as the necessity to           Source: Zhou, Chuan. 2012. “Analysis of Stepped Wedge Cluster

register all Stepping Stones male participants
(including those who would only take part in
the program in October) at the beginning of the survey (in March), there were issues of non-compliance to the initial
randomization.62 To reduce the potential bias that this introduces and because Stepping Stones is a parish-level interven-
tion, the impact evaluation relies on an Intent-to-Treat (ITT) approach to evaluate program impacts.

ITT analyzes participants as if they received the treatment to which they were assigned (Begg 2000). This approach
yields an unbiased estimate of being assigned to a treatment area and not for actually receiving the treatment. Hence,
ITT analysis allows for an estimation of the impact of living in a treatment parish on an individual, regardless of their
participation in Stepping Stones. We were aware that bias could be a problem if the surveys only compared respondents
in the Stepping Stones program versus those not in the Stepping Stones, as individuals who chose to participate in the
Stepping Stones program may be distinctly different from individuals who chose not to participate when given the op-
tion.63 Treatment status was assigned randomly to the parishes rather than to individual participants. Therefore, parish



62  All of the male youth survey respondents we interviewed came from the registration lists of Stepping Stones. Because we wanted to study the potential
impact of Stepping Stones and VST, the selection of survey respondents necessitated that the respondents be registered for Stepping Stones. This meant that
before we could begin the baseline (March), we needed all of the Stepping Stones sites to finish recruitment. Because VST already had its participants regis-
tered, FIC’s field team worked to try to recruit as many of the male youth VST participants into Stepping Stones as possible. In addition, due to the phased
stepped wedge design, two of the three locations experienced a delay between the time they signed up for participation (March) and the start of Stepping
Stones if they were in Phase two or three (June or September respectively). This meant that although all of the treatment-site survey respondents had originally
registered for Stepping Stones, many opted to not participate when the program began in their parishes.

63  An example of sample bias would be that youth who are sitting under the tree or closer to town may be more likely to register and attend Stepping Stones
characteristics are uncorrelated with uptake of the program, while respondent characteristics might be. Because partici-
pation in Stepping Stones and living in an intervention villages were strongly correlated (at 78%), ITT analysis is a valid
and unbiased treatment instrument.64

In order to verify the ITT approach to the analysis, both direct participation in Stepping Stones (taken from the Stepping
Stones roster) and the ITT variable were used throughout the analysis. In most instances, the relationships between liv-
ing in a Stepping Stones parish and actually participating in the Stepping Stones program were the same for both Step-
ping Stones variables.

Challenges to the Quantitative Model

A purely linear impact trajectory of the program cannot be assumed given that the majority of our outcome indicators
dealt with levels of behavior change. It is possible that the shape of the project’s functional form resembles a J or S curve
(with either an initial period of stasis or even a deterioration of circumstances before the positive behavior change be-
comes apparent) (Woolcock 2009). It therefore could be argued that the duration of the study (eight months) would
potentially only capture that initial dip or the dormant period of impact. While the research design would have benefited
from a longer duration to address this issue, two precautions were taken from the start: 1) a mixed methods approach
utilized both qualitative and quantitative data collection tools; and 2) a stepped wedge approach tried to isolate the pos-
sible trajectory of the intervention. The latter allowed the researchers to track the impact of the program on four cohorts
with varying degrees of time after the intervention: one month, three months, and five months. However, if the program
required more than five months for positive results to be observed, then this research design would be unable to capture
that change.

Another possible limitation of the methodology is the reliance on respondent self-reporting of sensitive questions re-
garding their perceptions and history of possible theft and violence. One may argue that, as a result of Stepping Stones,
the sometimes significant relationship between the intervention variables (direct participation and living in a Stepping
Stones parish) and the outcome variables (theft and violence) are based on improved communication and trust in dis-
cussing these activities openly in the SS program and therefore greater honesty in reporting these activities to the enu-
merators during the data collection.65 If this was the case, then the interpretation of the findings would be a reflection of
a positive attitudinal shift due to the Stepping Stones intervention rather than increased negative behavior.

There are several factors why the above interpretation of the data is not likely to be the case and that reports of activities
are proxies for actual proportions of theft and violence and not simply a reflection of more honest and open dialogue.
If honesty were driving the higher proportions in the Stepping Stones parishes, then this should be reflected in all, if
not most, of the outcome variables. However, for 11 out of 17 of the sensitive outcome variables, Stepping Stones is not
significant.66 Furthermore, the variables that are significant are not a random assortment, but rather represent consistent
relationships as the study moves from perceptions around theft and violence to reports of those activities in the past two



than youth who were herding animals or out in the bush collecting building poles or burning charcoal.

64    It is important to note that we are referring here to correlation (degree to which variables move together) of the two variables—living in an interven-
tion parish and attending Stepping Stones—and not direct attendance rates. Individual attendance rates for each phase decline over the course of the study.
In the first round of Stepping Stones intervention, the participation rate was extremely high at 95% (92 out of 97 people attended), in the second round the
participation level dropped to 48% (43 out of 89 people attended), and by the endline the participation rate dropped to 39% (33 out of 85 people attended),
for a total attendance rate of 62% (168 out of 271 people).

65  Given that all respondents, both those living in parishes that received the intervention and those that did not, were primarily interviewed by the same
enumerator for all four surveys, we cannot associate the correlation between the outcome variables and the intervention as a result of increased trust and
familiarity with the enumerators.

66  The outcome indicators referred to here are perception questions around: beating one’s wife or child; perception on whether stealing if hungry is wrong;
whether the respondent would personally steal assets or livestock from their or another community if they were hungry or their child were in need of medicine;
stealing livestock or assets over past two months; having assaulted a man, women, elder, child; or two women having had a dispute in the past two months.
months. The program impact on theft is consistently negative, while showing a positive impact in regards to respondent
perceptions around domestic violence. This relationship with Stepping Stones is also supported by answers from respon-
dents about whether they personally have been victims of lonetia activity and hence is a triangulation on the variable of
theft. Here, the question is neither sensitive nor would one expect respondents to minimize their impact from the lonetia
due to dishonesty. However, we still find, in line with the other correlations, that the respondents living in Stepping
Stones parishes are significantly more likely to report increased activity.

This section touches on constraints and limitations arising from the timeframe and design of the broader program.

Program Design

This study sought to test a behavior change model that piggy-backed onto a livelihoods model, but the two components
were not designed in conjunction with each other. The VST program had already started (and had been running for
over a year in some locations) when the Stepping Stones model was introduced. The Stepping Stones intervention was
therefore limited to the sites in which Concern and local partners were already implementing their program. One of
the main drawbacks in this regard for the Stepping Stones model was the incomplete inclusion of actors contributing
to regional tensions; i.e., one the main parties to violent conflict in southern Karamoja (the Matheniko sub-group) was
not included in the VST beneficiary population. This was due to different program objectives: the VST program was not
aimed at conflict resolution or reduction. A second challenge with overlapping the separate programs was the geographic
spread of beneficiaries, whereby there were many more VST individual participants in some locations than others. The
contrasting community-focused model of Stepping Stones meant that there were many participants in every location
where Stepping Stones operated.

Voluntary Nature of the Stepping Stones Program and Evaluation

The voluntary nature of the intervention and participation in the FIC longitudinal study was a constraint.67 The young
men who agreed to participate understood that they would be interviewed at least four times (more for the qualitative
component) over the duration of the study and that they would not be receiving compensation other than the small
facilitation fund. The stepped wedge design meant that the Stepping Stones intervention took place in three phases over
the study. In order to collect longitudinal data on the respondents, however, we had to register all the 400 individuals for
the survey at the beginning of the research. The young men in some of these locations started the Stepping Stones work-
shop right away, whereas in other locations the workshops did not begin for either two or five months. While this did not
significantly reduce the number of respondents surveyed throughout the study (the attrition rate was approximately four
percent from the baseline to the endline), the delays associated with this staggered design meant that some of the young
men who agreed to participate in the longitudinal study did not, ultimately, attend the Stepping Stones program.

Timeframe and Duration of the Overall Program

An additional constraint with likely implications for the findings of the evaluation component of this research is the
timeframe and duration of the intervention. The Stepping Stones model normally lasts for 18 weeks; due to the short
duration of the program because of donor constraints, each Stepping Stones intervention was shortened to 10 weeks
per site and the number of sessions per week increased. However, considering the nature of the change required—i.e.,
making adjustments to social, cultural, and economic determinants regarding the acceptability of violence as part of a




67  All research conducted by FIC adheres to standards mandated by the United States government for research on human subjects. This is ensured through
an internal review of all research documents and consent forms by the Social, Behavioral, and Educational Research Institutional Review Board of Tufts
University and is based on voluntary and informed consent.
livelihood strategy pursued by young men—even a full 18-week program may have struggled to bring about change. The
extensive research on peacebuilding and conflict resolution, for instance, indicates that at least five years is normally re-
quired to see any real change in attitudes on violent conflict, and decades can be required to realize sustainable peace.68

As touched on more fully in Annex C, there is no way to know the nature of any possible sustained impact brought by
the program. Positive impacts may be more visible at 12 or 24 months or, in contrast, positive outcomes may start to
decrease over time. These aspects would only be visible through an extended evaluation model.

The Nature of the Change Required

A last point on constraints is the nature of the change required to influence male involvement in violence in Karamoja.
Violence associated with cattle raiding and other related forms of crime have long defined the cultural, social, and eco-
nomic fabric of Karamoja (and various other pastoral and agro-pastoral regions in the Greater Horn). This violence is
deeply embedded in livelihood strategies, systems, and adaptations. As such, interventions aimed at influencing this vio-
lence must go the root causes and drivers of this violence and be widespread, systematic, and sustained. Such interven-
tions would need to take place at a period of policy support, economic growth and prosperity, and hope. Furthermore,
and clearly indicated by the seasonal variations evident in the findings for this study, much of the crime and associated
violence in southern Karamoja in 2013 directly correlated to food insecurity and the absence of viable alternative eco-
nomic options at the household level.



68  For instance, as John Paul Lederach explains in Preparing for Peace, Conflict Transformations Across Cultures, the approach to peacebuilding is akin to
nesting eggs, wherein the first phase is crisis intervention (2–6 months), then preparation and training (1–2 years), followed by the third stage, design of social
change (5–10 years); the final phase is the desired future, which can take decades (Lederach 1995).

             Livelihoods and Violence in Context

Livelihoods
The population of Karamoja has traditionally practiced a combination of pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihoods, bal-
ancing animal and crop-based assets through a diversified livelihood system. The region is part of the larger Karamoja
Cluster, which extends into parts of western Kenya, southern Sudan, and southern Ethiopia, as well as Uganda. Karamoja
is less arid than neighboring regions; however, the climate fluctuates widely and its erratic variability in rainfall makes
agriculture unsuitable as a subsistence livelihood (Ellis and Swift 1988; Markakis 2004; Otim 2002). Although failed
harvests today are often blamed on climate change, droughts were a regular event even half a century ago, with crop
yields poor or failing completely in approximately one out of every three years (Dyson-Hudson 1966). Given these
unpredictable conditions, a system of semi-nomadic animal husbandry emerged as the best suited livelihood system in
the region characterized by high rainfall variability and ecological uncertainty (Gray, Leslie, and Akol 2002). Cattle were
historically the preferred animal for most of the population groups, with small ruminants supplementing cattle herds.
Livestock ownership—especially of cattle—remains a prime determinant of both social and economic status (Gray,
Leslie, and Akol 2002), and livestock remain central to the collective consciousness and identity, even for those who have
diversified their livelihood activities away from strict animal husbandry.

Livelihood roles within households and communities are differentiated by age and gender (Hodgson 2000), with young
men playing a central role in herd management, including animal mobility and security. Young men in pastoral and
agro-pastoral households would normally spend a substantial portion of the dry season in mobile cattle camps known as
ngawiyoi (singular, awi) or kraals, returning only as needed to the semi-permanent ngirerya (singular, ere) or manyattas.
Decision-making took place in conjunction with the kraal leader and other elders, but young men bore a great deal of
responsibility for household well-being and food security through their management of the most valuable assets (live-
stock).

The last several decades have brought many changes in livelihoods for communities that traditionally relied heavily on
livestock. Rampant internal insecurity and the breakdown of traditional allegiances severely curtailed semi-nomadic live-
lihood strategies. The growth of neighboring agrarian populations, the tightening of national and international borders,
and government policies of land management and preservation all severely limited the mobility that is central to sustain-
able and productive pastoralism. Animal ownership became less equitable and less communal (a trend that started with
the massive raids in the 1980s; see Ocan 1992), with a growing divide between those households that were able to retain
herds and those that were not. The Government of Uganda’s most recent disarmament campaign (2006 to the present)
fundamentally altered the ways in which communities managed and protected animals (Stites and Akabwai 2010).

Overall, the erosion of the broad livestock base and associated livelihood system has left households and communities
increasingly impoverished and more vulnerable to food insecurity brought on by failed harvests and other shocks that
are common to the region. On the individual level, these livelihood changes have brought particular challenges for young
men. As herds have dwindled or disappeared, many young men have lost their predominant and essential role as provid-
ers for their households and as protectors of their families and assets. When combined with the rampant violence inher-
ent in the region—violence that was deeply imbedded in the livelihood strategies of these men, as discussed below—a
situation is created whereby young men are at high risk for engagement in crime and violence. In addition, FIC research
over the last three to five years indicates that young men who had lost their cattle-based livelihoods were increasingly
described by other groups and by their peers as “idle” and “without purpose.” This set the stage for the introduction of
the combined communications and relationship skills program with a livelihood intervention in an attempt to thwart
violence as an option for young men.
Violence and Security
Violence is not new to Karamoja. Cattle raiding has long been a part of pastoral livelihoods systems in eastern Africa.
Raids fulfilled important social, political, and economic functions within the pastoral system, as evidenced in the follow-
ing quotation from a Karimojong elder:
    Raiding was not just a means of restocking, but it was also an ancient form of wealth redistribution among the
    Karimojong. It is a traditional and central form of restocking. Young warriors were compelled to accumulate
    cows in order to gain status. Their respect depended on the number of successful raids. (Mkutu 2008, 17)
Prior to the widespread availability of firearms, young men fought with spears and bows and arrows in carefully planned
and orchestrated raids, the extent and intensity of which were regulated by the elders (Dyson-Hudson 1966; Gulliver
1953). Casualties occurred but were kept to a minimum through a ritualized fighting process that included advance
warning of the attack and prohibitions on harming women, children, or the elderly (Mkutu 2008; Akabwai and Ateyo
2007; Lamphear 1998).

Historically, large-scale raids most commonly occurred among “traditional enemies”—i.e., the Karimojong of southern
Karamoja were most commonly in conflict with the Jie, Turkana, and Pokot. The national and political upheaval of
the 1980s led to a period of pronounced pillage by raiders from Karamoja of the neighboring districts of north central
Uganda. The several years of raiding in the late 1980s resulted in the decimation of livestock herds for the Teso, Langi,
and Acholi populations and the collapse of the important cross-ethnic relationships that had allowed pastoralists from
Karamoja to access dry-season pasture in the adjacent districts. In addition, the influx of raided cattle into Karamoja
introduced new strains of tick-borne disease to which the local herds had no resistance; large numbers of animals subse-
quently died. The tensions and upheavals of the 1980s also brought the start of conflict among groups within Karamoja
that had previously experienced only small-scale thefts and problems that could largely be addressed by negotiation
among the elders. The most notable disintegration of relations was in southern Karamoja within the Karimojong ethnic
group; by the 1990s violence among the Bokora, Matheniko, and Pian was pronounced, with implications for the neigh-
boring Tepeth.

Violence associated with cattle raiding or defending against raids was almost exclusively practiced by male youth. Vio-
lence practiced by young men became increasingly widespread and destructive in the 1990s and 2000s for a number
of (largely cyclical and reinforcing) reasons: traditional institutions that had once mitigated violence were weakened
(Stites 2013a); weapons flowed into the region from neighboring states (Mkutu 2008); and acquisition and defense of
livestock became more critical, charged, and violent as the assets became increasingly scarce. In the words of a Sandra
Gray, a cultural anthropologist who was one of the few scholars conducting fieldwork during the extreme insecurity of
the 1990s:
    “[I]t is clear that AK-47 raiding seriously constrained the bio-behavioral adaptability of the Karimojong in
    the last decades of the 20th century. Through its effects on seasonal migrations, subsistence activity, the struc-
    ture of marriage, and the stability of social networks of the Karimojong, as well as on the operation of trade
    routes in and out of the district and on health care delivery, armed cattle raiding emerges as the critical factor
    in recurring famines and epidemics in Karamoja since the 1970s (2003, S21).”
Research conducted by FIC and supported by the work of other scholars indicates that violence over the past three de-
cades in Karamoja has changed in several key ways, all with important implications for the combined Stepping Stones
and livelihood program. These changes include a shift from a large to small group or individual being involved in raiding;
the loss of sanction from the elders and corresponding decrease in involvement by the wider community in the planning
and execution of raids; a decline in the ritualized aspects of raiding; a change in who accrues the bounty from the raid; a
shift from incorporation of raided animals into the family herd to a quick sale; an increase in the range of victims by age
and gender; a shift in communities that are targeted by raiders; and a shift in the location of violence.

Until very recently, the Ugandan government’s most consistent policy towards Karamoja has been disarmament, fol-
lowed by attempts to limit cross-border movement.69 Policies in both the colonial and post-colonial periods aimed to
minimize negative spill-over effects of violence in Karamoja on surrounding areas considered to be more stable or po-
litically relevant. Although disarmament has been a consistent and relatively regular effort from 1911 until the pres-
ent, the campaign that began in 2006 is the most relevant for discussion purposes. This disarmament involved greater
stakeholder consultation and an overt effort to protect assets of those communities that had been disarmed (a main
complaint of previous efforts) (Bevan 2008). This resulted in the emergence of the so-called protected kraals, whereby
herds were (and in many places still are) kept in often extremely large kraals adjacent or near to military barracks. While
limiting losses from raids, the protected kraal system has brought a decline in animal health and an increase in mortality
due to overcrowding and limited access to appropriate dry-season grazing and/or water sources. Of particular relevance,
young men saw their roles as protectors and managers of the herds be supplanted by soldiers (protectors) and the small
boys who were allowed access to the herds for daily grazing (the older youth had mutually suspicious relations with the
military) (Stites and Akabwai 2010).

Importantly, research from 2006 to 2012 by FIC indicated a general rise in insecurity as a direct consequence of the dis-
armament campaign. This trend was due to the uneven nature of the disarmament, which left some communities unpro-
tected.70 In addition, this time period saw the rise in small-scale but often still violent criminal behavior, a phenomenon
that respondents attributed to lonetia. This term refers to the (exclusively male) thieves who steal small-scale livelihoods
and productive assets from homesteads, normally at night and through forced entry. Violence often but not always ac-
companies the theft; a rise in sexual violence against women and girls does appear to correlate with the rise of lonetia
attacks. Crimes by lonetia emerged subsequent to the start of the 2006 disarmament and in response to the known ab-
sence of weapons for self-defense. Although very difficult to quantify, crimes by lonetia appeared to increase in the years
immediately following the start of disarmament. Large-scale raids of cattle appeared to decrease in the same time period,
due both to the progression of disarmament in both geographic coverage and depth71 and to the steady loss of animals
to disease or distress sales. In other words, having fewer guns with which to raid and fewer cattle to target ultimately led
to a decrease in raiding behavior.72 (This is a relative change. As is apparent in the discussion of findings, theft of cattle,
livestock, and all other assets has continued, but at a decreased rate.) In the research for this study, all of the crime and
violence was described as being committed by the lonetia. Put another way, respondents no longer talked about “raids”
or “raiders” and blamed all acts on the lonetia or “thugs.”73




69  A more recent variation of these selective (by ethnicity) restrictions on movement continue today and are apparent in efforts to prevent migration from
Karamoja to southern cities such as Kampala and Jinja; individuals found in these areas are rounded up and bussed back to Karamoja, at times against their
will and without family members.

70  The UPDF provided protection for livestock from disarmed communities, but did not protect those communities themselves.

71  Here “depth” is in reference to the number of times that communities were targeted for disarmament. Although there were many complaints about the
repeated nature of the exercises and the associated brutality and human rights abuses (Human Rights Watch 2007; Stites and Akabwai 2009), these repeat visits
may have ultimately resulted in a greater turnover of weapons. The lack of transparency regarding the disarmament campaign makes an accurate evaluation
of impact difficult.

72  The actual number of raids is difficult to measure as many raids are not reported and, even if they are reported, the monitoring and sharing of these
numbers goes against the state narrative of improved peace and security. This reference to decreased raiding is based on FIC research, reports from other
development and humanitarian actors, and anecdotal information.

73  It is of course important to note that this trend may not be applicable for locations beyond these particular study sites and would require further inves-
tigation in other areas.

60   Engaging Male Youth in Karamoja, Uganda
