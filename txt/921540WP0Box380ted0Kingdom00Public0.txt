For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        Hire an Approved Inspector

        BuildCo signs a contract with an Approved Inspector. Approved
        Inspectors (AI) are companies or individuals authorized under the
        Building Act 1984 to carry out building control work in England and
        Wales.

        An Approved Inspector will:
        • Advise BuildCo on how the building regulations apply to its work (to a
        degree)
        • Check plans for compliance with building regulations
        • Issue a planning certificate (if requested)
        • Inspect the work as it progresses
        • Issue a final completion certificate (if requested)

        A list of AIs is available at the Association of Corporate Approved
        Inspectors. Currently, there are 60 AIs that are recognized in England
   1    and Wales, accounting for about 20% of all building control work. The       1 day           GBP 2,964
        AIs are licensed by this independent board for every 5 years. They must
        also be insured, while the public building control authorities do not
        have that requirement.

        By hiring AIs, companies eliminate the need to deal with different
        external companies. It also eliminates the need for companies to
        interact with Building Control Department of Local Authority. However,
        the Local Authority is still responsible for the enforcement of the
        regulations. If the AI discovers any issues of noncompliance with the
        building regulations, the offences must be reported to the Local
        Authority so that they can take action. Unsurprisingly, the number of
        contraventions notified to the Local Authority by AIs is extremely low.
        Additionally, the Local Authority still has the power to cancel initial
        notices under certain circumstances -- e.g. the works have not
        commenced within the prescribed period (currently 3 years from the
        date of deposit).

                                                                                     Time to

      The other decisive factor for a company to choose an AI is time. AIs
      would provide more expeditious services. For example, a plan approval
      could be done by them in 2 -- 3 weeks, whereas the Local Authority
      would take 6 to 8 weeks, according to statutory time-limits.

      The cost for the services of AI is comprised of the several elements and
      is mostly charged on an hourly basis. The below estimate is a sample of
      what an average cost breakdown by an AI looks like:
      • Plan checking: (16 hours x GDP 60) = GBP 960.00
      • Inspections: (9 sessions x 2h x GBP 60.00) = GBP 1,080.00
      • Structural checking: (2 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 120.00
      • Consultations: (0.5 hrs x GBP 60) = GBP 30.00
      • Electronic/Internet drawings GBP 75.00
      • Meetings: (3.75 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 225.00
      • Administrative: (0.5 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 30.00
      • Inspections petrol fee: (40 miles x GBP 3.60) = GBP 144.00
      • Contingency: (5 hrs x GBP 60.00) = GBP 300.00

      Total: GBP 2,964

      Obtain planning permission

      BuildCo must obtain planning permission from the local planning
      authority. In London, the decision-maker is the relevant London
      borough where the site is located. There are 33 boroughs in Greater
      London.

      The planning application must be accompanied by a plan of the site,
      drawings showing the proposed development, and any other
      information the local authority considers necessary. The local authority
      publishes a list with the information it considers necessary on its
      website, so that applicants know what is required of them. The relevant
      legislative framework is the Development Management Procedure
      Order (2010). If BuildCo is submitting a paper application, it must also
      provide at least 3 copies of the accompanying documents.
      Alternatively, BuildCo can apply online via the Planning Portal, which
2     accepts electronic planning applications on behalf of all London              56 days       GBP 6,676
      boroughs, using a standard application form that was introduced
      across England in 2008. If it applies electronically, no further copies are
      required. A fee is charged for the planning application, based on the
      amount of floor space that would be created by the scheme.

      The size of BuildCo's proposed development falls below the threshold
      for a “major application”, which means that the time frame for a
      decision is 8 weeks rather than 13. During this period, the local
      planning authority will publicize the application in the surrounding area
      and consult a number of statutory consultees -- bodies with a specialist
      responsibility such as nature conservation, heritage protection,
      highways -- who may wish to comment on the acceptability of the
      proposal from their perspective. The local authority accepts these
      comments and the comments of any local people who wish to
      comment on the application. They will be taken into account in the
      decision to grant or refuse permission. If no decision is made within 8

      weeks, or if the authority decides to refuse permission, the applicant is
      entitled to appeal to the Secretary of State.

      Additionally, in April 2010, the Government introduced new 'permitted
      development' rights for businesses who seek to extend their existing
      premises. This means that minor extensions, which would previously
      have required planning permission, may proceed without it, thereby
      saving time for the business owners and enabling the local planning
      authority staff to concentrate on larger and more important projects. In
      May 2013, the Government further extended these rights to allow for
      larger extensions of pre-existing agricultural buildings and warehouses.

      Approved Inspector files the initial notice to the Local Authority

      Once the contract is signed and the terms of reference are outlined, the
      builder and the AI jointly notify the local authority of their intention to
      build -- also called an initial notice. This initial notice will inform the
      Local Council that the AI has been retained. Once this notice has been
      accepted by the local authority, the responsibility for plan checking and
      site inspection will be formally placed on the AI.

      The local council has 5 days to accept or reject the initial notice in
3     writing (via email, fax or post). Acceptance is given by default if the        5 days       no charge
      local authority does not respond within the 5-day period. During that
      period of time, no work can be done.

      Once construction work commences, the AI would conduct at least 8 --
      9 inspections at various stages of construction and risk-based factors
      (for BuildCo’s case).

      Agency: Local Authority



      Submit application to local Fire Safety Office and obtain approval

      Approved Inspector submits (via mail) the respective elements of the
      drawing and plans pertinent to fire safety to a local Fire Safety Office to
      ensure that the building is compliant with the latest fire safety
      legislation and that the appropriate fire and life safety systems are in
      place. By law, the Fire Safety Office must respond within 15 business
      days (21 calendar days) and send its comments and approval. This is
      done as part of plan approval process and is recorded as an
      independent procedure since AI interacts with a Fire Officer.                 21 days       no charge

      Upon the completion of the building, BuildCo used to obtain a Fire
      Certificate from Fire Safety Office. However, the Fire Certificate is no
      longer required following the reforms in the Regulatory Reform (Fire
      Safety) Order 2005 (FSO 2005) which came into effect in October 2006,
      and replaced over 70 pieces of fire safety laws.

      The FSO applies to all non-domestic premises in England and Wales,
      including the common parts of blocks of flats and houses in multiple
      occupations (HMOs). The FSO 2005 is a tool for self-regulation of

                                                                                  complete
      businesses for the fire risk of the premises.

      Under the FSO, the responsible person must carry out a fire safety risk
      assessment and implement and maintain a fire management plan. The
      companies have to carry out a risk assessment by completing a 5-step
      fire risk assessment survey online:
      (http://www.fire.gov.uk/Workplace+safety/WhatTheLawRequires/)

      According to this survey -- FSO 2005 the warehouse of BuildCo would
      be classified as medium risk object. Since there will be more than 5
      people occupying/working in the building, BuildCo would need to file
      the copy of completed FSO 2005 to the local Fire Safety Office. BuildCo
      does not need to wait for the approval or any other consent before
      using the premises. This risk is with the building operators, as they are
      deemed liable for any problems.

      The Fire Safety Office may conduct an inspection under a risk-based
      scheme: whether there was a similar track record of companies with
      fire, or neighbors complain, etc. Small scale and standard objects would
      be seldom inspected. Also, given that this would be a new building it
      would be assumed by the Fire Safety Office that the latest techniques
      of fire safety prevention would have been considered during the
      planning process.

      * Request and receive energy performance certificate from
      Accredited Energy Assessor

      Following the nationwide implementation of the "Energy Performance
      of Buildings Directive" adopted on December 16, 2002, as of January 4,
      2009 all commercial buildings require an Energy Performance
      Certificate (EPC) whenever built, rented or sold. The certificate records
      how energy efficient a property is as a building and provides A-G
      ratings. It is the responsibility of the builder/constructor to submit the
      EPC and Recommendations Report to the Purchaser upon physical
      completion of the building and notify the local authority Building
      Control officers or approved inspectors, who will not issue a certificate
      of completion until the EPC is provided.

      They are produced using standard methods and assumptions about
      energy usage so that the energy efficiency of one building can easily be
      compared with another building of the same type. This allows                  1 day         GBP 78
8
      prospective buyers, tenants, owners, occupiers and purchasers to view
      information on the energy efficiency and carbon emissions from their
      building so they can consider energy efficiency and fuel costs as part of
      their investment.

      An EPC is always accompanied by a recommendation report that lists
      cost effective and other measures (such as low and zero carbon
      generating systems) to improve the energy rating. A rating is also given
      showing what could be achieved if all the recommendations were
      implemented.

      The fee for the EPC may vary between GBP 55.00 to GBP 100.00.

      File completion certificate with the Local Building Control
      Department

      Once the building is completed, BuildCo would notify AI about the
      completion. AI completes the final inspection within 24 hours and
      prepares the certificate of completion. AI will file a copy of the
      completion certificate with the Building Control Department of Local
9     Authority (LABC) within 5 days after completion of the final inspection.      1 day        no charge
      LABC then files the documents and sends an acknowledgement of
      receipt to BuildCo/AI. Although legally not required, LABC may
      conduct an inspection in practice. LABC is not required to issue an
      approval of a completion certificate prepared by an AI; however, failure
      by BuildCo to obtain one may prove to be problematic.

        Submit an application to UK Power Networks for an electricity
        connection and await a quotation and connection offer

        The application can be submitted online, in person or by mail. One has
        to attach with the application: completed initial enquiry form if initial
        enquiry was made, load details and detailed site drawings.

        At this stage the applicant can choose either UK Power Networks or a
        qualified contractor to design a part of the network extension while only
        UK Power Networks can do the design of certain parts of the network
        extension and design of upstream reinforcement works. If the design is
        carried out by a qualified contractor and not by the UK Power Networks
        there are additional procedures for approval of the designs. Majority of
        the clients choose the UK Power Networks to complete all parts of the
        design.

        UK Power Networks will do the assessment and design which will result
        in the budget estimate as well as the Construction and Adoption
        Agreement which will include the formal offer to connect.

        Since September 2008 UK Power Networks has not charged assessment
        and design charges in advance but they have been included in the final
        connection payment as an overhead cost. This follows a consultation by
        the UK energy regulator Ofgem. Ofgem is currently considering new
        regulation concerning assessment and design charges.
        A budget estimate and connection offer is free of charge.

        By law all of the quotations should be provided as soon as reasonably
        practicable with an absolute backstop of 90 days – this is a requirement
        of Standard License Condition 12 of the Electricity Distribution License.

      Some of the external connection works which are contestable (not all
      works are contestable) can be performed by an approved contractor or
      by UK Power Networks. If contestable works are performed by a
      subcontractor additional procedures associated with inspections and
      testing of the contractor’s installation by UK Power Networks are
      required. In the majority of cases customers choose UK Power Networks
      to carry out all the external connection works.

      * Await issuance of a supply number by UK Power Networks, pass

      UK Power Networks issues a supply Number (or MPAN’s) after the
      connection offer has been accepted by the customer. UK Power
      Networks will issue a supply number (Metering Point Administration
      Number - MPAN) to the customer before the connection works are
      completed. The customer will pass the MPAN to its chosen electricity
      supplier. The supplier must register the MPAN with UK Power Networks.

3     The supplier will co-ordinate metering, energisation and application of   30 calendar days           GBP 0
      energy rates. The supply contract start date is aligned with connection
      energized date. The supplier will need to receive an estimate, or could
      work with the applicant to develop a load profile to be able to provide a
      supply contract.

        * Receive meter installation and internal wiring inspection by meter
        operator and electricity starts flowing

        The metering industry in the UK is an open competitive market, and the
        applicant can choose their own Meter Operator or can choose to use the
        Meter Operator services provided by the supplier. The electricity supplier
        normally appoints the meter operator. Requirements regarding the
        conclusion of the meter operation contract vary. The applicant can sign a
        separate contract with the chosen meter operator or cost can be passed
        on through the supply contract .
        The internal wiring must be completed by the electrician to BS7671
        standards. The electrician must carry out a full inspection and testing of
        the internal wiring and then provide a BS7671 certificate to both the
        Meter Operator and to the Electricity Distributor before the connection
        can be energized. The inspection of the internal wiring is done when a
        meter is installed. Inspection of internal wiring is done through a visual
        inspection by a meter operator. It is a good practice that somebody is
        present during the installation of the meter/internal wiring inspection.
        In the UK, the DNO only undertakes the work up to the cut-out. All
   4    internal works are the responsibility of the customer who must appoint a 20 calendar days        GBP 0
        qualified electrician. All internal works must be carried out to BS 7671
        standard and the Meter Operator (who works on behalf of the supplier)
        will need to see a BS 7671 certificate before the meter will be attached
        and the connection energized.
        There is no specific charge for the meter, but the customer can choose a
        meter operator and subject to measurement class there will be the
        annual operations and maintenance charge.

        The metering must be installed before a supply of electricity can be
        provided.

        The electricity can start flowing on the same day the external connection
        works are finished providing the supplier and the metering operator
        have sufficient notice.

       Standard enquiries of the seller delivered to the buyer's solicitor
       with a title pack

       Commercial Property Standard Enquiries (CPSE) are used by solicitors to
       find out details that cannot be inferred from the searches, eg. who is in
       actual occupation, how long the property has been used for its present
       use. Most solicitors use the commercial property standard enquiries
       prepared by members of the London Property Support Lawyers Group
       and endorsed by the British Property Federation. Depending on the               1-4 weeks
       enquiries raised, the seller's solicitor would typically spend 1-3 billable                   GBP 3,500 - GBP

       probably take the buyer's solicitor 30 minutes to 1 hour to review the
       replies. If there was no particular urgency, this part of the process would
       typically be started at the same time as the searches are requested, and
       would be completed in around 1 week after the results of all the
       searches are received.

       * Conduct searches on the property

       The buyer's solicitor will review the registered title to the property. It is
       the responsibility of the buyer's conveyancer to confirm to the buyer that
       it will be acquiring good and marketable title to the property.
                                                                                      1-3 weeks

       marketable, the purchaser's solicitor will conduct the following searches: with Procedure 1)
       1. Investigation of the title: to know whether the land is registered at the
       Land Registry and know what interests affect this land and if there are
       any limitations. If the land is unregistered, the solicitor would have to
       look at the deeds and correspondence between the persons that appear
       on those deeds. This will be decreasingly the case as registration is now

      compulsory.
      2. Conveyancing searches, which would include:
      • Local Authority Search
      • Planning history (eg. permissions)
      • Desktop environmental search (to determine any environmental issues,
      such as flooding or contamination)
      • Public highway search
      • Chancel repair liability search (in this case the solicitor does not search
      the property itself, but the area in which the property is. If the area turns
      out to be affected by the liability to contribute to chancel repairs, then
      the property has to be insured against any future chancel repair claims.
      The amount of the insurance depends on the value of the property)
      • Other searches depending on the area, eg. coal mine shaft search or
      underground search (these issues affect the value of the property)
      3. Seller company search: to see the articles of association and what
      powers the representatives have

      For a property in London, solicitors usually request most of these
      searches through a search portal. These search portals are the one stop
      shop for most searches, and solicitors need a user name to access them.
      The search portals will pass on to the solicitor the information that they
      acquire from the relevant authorities.

      In total, these searches are usually 300 to 1000 pounds, depending on
      the number of searches requested, the amount that each local authority
      charges, and whether the solicitor requests the standard searches or is
      adding additional questions, which increase the cost. The results of the
      searches take from one day to 2/3 weeks to come back, depending on
      the search. The local authority search is the lengthiest one.

      Once satisfied with the results of the searches, the information provided
      in the standard enquiries and the title pack, the buyer's solicitor will
      prepare a report for the buyer on the title and other matters affecting
      the property.

      Drafting of contracts and exchange of contracts once agreed

      Property transactions are conducted by licensed conveyancers or
      solicitors. However, in the case of commercial properties, these
      transactions are usually conducted by solicitors. The seller's solicitor will
      prepare a draft of the contract and submit it to the purchaser's solicitor          1 day
                                                                                                          included in

      agree on the contract, contracts are exchanged. The solicitors acting for
      the buyer and seller can meet to exchange contracts, but that is rare. The
      exchange is usually done over the telephone in accordance with a
      specific formula for exchanging contracts over the phone. The most
      common is formula B where each solicitor holds a 'part' contract signed

      by his client. The solicitors agree over the phone specific terms of the
      contract (e.g., the amount of the deposit, completion date, etc.) and
      record the time of exchange and other details. Each solicitor sends their
      client's part contract to the other solicitor in the post that day. The
      buyer's solicitor will also send a check for the deposit (usually 10% of the
      purchase price). It is usual for there to be a gap in time between
      exchange of contracts and completion of the transfer of the property.

      Complete and lodge a Land Transaction Return and pay the Stamp
      Duty Land Tax (SDLT) (available on-line)

      The buyer's solicitor would usually prepare the Land Transaction Return
      for the approval of the buyer (as SDLT is a self-assessment tax) prior to
      completion. For every land transaction the purchaser must complete,
      sign and send the land transaction return to be received by HM Revenue
      & Customs before the end of 30 days following the effective date of the
      transaction. The return includes a self-assessment of the stamp duty land
      tax chargeable on the transaction returned. The completed Land
      Transaction Return must be sent by post to the Revenue's Rapid Data
      Capture center in Netherton (near Liverpool) or submitted electronically
      (functionality available since 2006). When the Return is submitted, the
      correct amount of SDLT must also be paid either by cheque, through the Less than a day
      CHAPS automated payment system or via direct bank transfer. Once the            (online  GBP 13 + 4% SDLT

      Transaction Return Certificate. If the Return has been submitted
      electronically, the Certificate is typically received within two hours (since
      2009). If the Return has been submitted in the post, the Certificate is
      typically received within one month. The issue of a Land Transaction

        The buyer's solicitor drafts a Transfer Deed and sends it to the seller's
        solicitor for approval. Once approved, it is signed by the parties. The

        on completion.

        Parties register the transfer deed (and any legal charges) at the Land
        Registry by submitting the appropriate documents and paying the Land
        Registry's fees. A cheque made payable to "Land Registry" must

        Land Registry (unless there was a prior authorized agreement with the
        Registry to pay by direct debit)
        On completion of the registration the Land Registry will send to the

        The law requires conveyancers, from 10 November 2008, when they
        submit an application to register the interest of their client in a property,
        to provide details of the conveyancers who acted for all other parties
        involved in the transaction. If any involved person (including a company)
        is not represented by a conveyancer, the person lodging the application
        must either confirm that they are satisfied that sufficient steps have been
        taken to verify the identity of the unrepresented person or otherwise
        lodge evidence of the unrepresented person's identity. If confirmation
        of identity is required for an application, but is not provided, the Land
        Registry will reject the application. Identification requirements extend to
        buyers, sellers, landlords, tenants, borrowers and lenders.

local courts. Following the step-by-step evolution of       Time for trial and obtaining judgment
a standardized case study, it collects data relating to

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a
sales contract between 2 domestic businesses. The           Enforcement costs
case study assumes that the court hears an expert on
the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
