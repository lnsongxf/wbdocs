1        Introduction
There is an extensive literature on the linkage between exchange rate regimes and economic growth
with no consensus on the nature of the relationship. A key argument, among several, that has
been advanced in favor of ﬂexible regimes is that they enhance economic growth by facilitating
adjustments to real shocks originating from both domestic and foreign sources, in the presence
of nominal rigidities. This argument therefore suggests that a ﬁxed regime renders the economy
susceptible to greater macroeconomic volatility, and should have an adverse impact on growth. A
contrasting theoretical argument is that a ﬂexible regime is a source of macroeconomic uncertainty,
as it allows the propagation of negative external shocks and hence dampens growth. Thus, in this
case, a ﬁxed regime is favored to provide an environment that enhances growth through a decline
in uncertainty and limited variability in the interest rate.
    This paper addresses the debate on whether exchange rate regimes matter for the impact of
remittances on economic growth in recipient countries. It is well documented that countries, in
the past, have resorted to combatting inﬂationary consequences and the concomitant real exchange
rate appreciation eﬀects of capital inﬂows by pegging their exchange rates under the notion that
this would help their external competitiveness and thereby enhance their eﬀorts at utilizing those
capital inﬂow resources to enhance productivity and growth. Remittances, as has been observed,
could act as private capital inﬂows, and given that they could negatively impact economic growth
through an appreciation of the real exchange rate and contraction of the tradable sector, it is
important to empirically assess the role exchange rate regimes play in driving the economic growth
dynamics in recipient economies.
    Several indirect channels through which exchange rate regimes could aﬀect growth have been
identiﬁed. These include the level of ﬁnancial development, investment and international trade.1
Aghion et al. (2009) ﬁnd evidence that more ﬁnancially developed countries grow faster under a
more ﬂexible regime. They also observe a negative relationship between productivity growth and
ﬂexible regimes in less ﬁnancially developed countries. The main idea is that ﬁrms in countries
with higher levels of ﬁnancial development are able to survive liquidity shocks that accompany
exchange rate ﬂuctuations and contribute to innovation and long-run growth. Such exchange rate
volatility tends to have negative eﬀects on long-run growth in less ﬁnancially developed countries
as they discourage investments. Bailliu et al. (2003) note that the indirect route is based on the
certainty or uncertainty triggered by the exchange rate regime, and the impact of that on trade
and investment.
    In a study that analyzes the implication of exchange rate policies for the dynamics of sectoral
output and nontradable inﬂation in an economy that is subject to remittance shocks, Lartey (2015)
shows that under a ﬁxed exchange rate regime, an increase in remittances leads to an increase in
consumption of nontradable goods and a rise in nontradable inﬂation. For an inﬂation targeting
regime, though, an increase in remittances leads to an expansion of the tradable sector, and a decline

in consumption of nontradables, which reduces nontradable inﬂation. The ﬁndings also indicate
that a near-zero nontradable inﬂation rate, and a managed variability in the nominal exchange
rate characterizes the optimal monetary policy, suggesting that an inﬂation targeting regime is
preferable to a ﬁxed exchange regime. An empirical assessment of the theoretical model using
vector autoregression analysis indicates that these observations are generally consistent with the
dynamics of inﬂation induced by a shock to remittances in El Salvador, which is representative of
an economy that operates a ﬁxed exchange regime, and the Philippines, which typiﬁes an economy
with an inﬂation targeting monetary regime.
    It may be argued then, that exchange rate regimes could facilitate or undermine economic
growth directly, to the extent that they curtail or precipitate Dutch disease eﬀects of remittances
respectively, through their impact on resource reallocation which in turn has implications for eco-
nomic growth. In addition, exchange rate regimes could have an indirect eﬀect on how remittances
impact growth, particularly in the case where remittances act as investment capital. Furthermore,
given that exchange rate policies have implications for macroeconomic (un)certainty and the trans-
mission of negative external shocks, the choice of exchange rate regimes could serve to provide
desirable macroeconomic environments for remittances to positively aﬀect growth or otherwise.
    On that account, this study contributes to the literature by examining the question of whether
the relationship between remittances and economic growth is aﬀected by exchange rate policies
in recipient countries. The paper also analyzes whether exchange rate ﬂexibility diminishes the
growth eﬀects of remittances in countries with low levels of ﬁnancial development. Furthermore,
this study diﬀers from the extant literature, in that it utilizes a comprehensive data set on 135
developing and transition countries representing diﬀerent income groups, and employs estimation
techniques that address potential endogeneity issues that exist between GDP per capita growth on
one hand, and exchange rate regimes and remittances on the other hand.


2    Related Literature
Remittances to developing countries have been on a rising trend in the last several years, with a
projection to top $500 billion by 2015 according to a World Bank report on global migration and
remittances issued in 2012. The estimates for the recent past are $327 billion in 2010 and $372
billion in 2011, reaching slightly over $406 billion in 2012. Remittances have become an important
component in total international capital ﬂows to developing countries, and currently, are more than
three times the size of oﬃcial development assistance and have become the second largest source
of external ﬁnance behind foreign direct investment (FDI). Table 1 shows the top recipients of
migrant remittances in 2012, with India leading the group and followed closely by China, having
received $70 billion and $65 billion respectively.
     The literature has documented both desirable and undesirable consequences of remittances in
recipient economies. Studies by Adams and Page (2005) and Acosta et al. (2008) have provided
some evidence that remittances are associated with lower poverty indicators and high growth rates.


                                                3
Others, like Gupta et al. (2009) indicate that remittances have contributed towards smoothing
household consumption, and to investment in human capital. There is also evidence that there is a
positive relationship between remittances and growth, and that there exists an investment channel
through which remittances aﬀect growth (Lartey, 2013). In direct contrast, some studies have shown
that remittances may be harmful to the long-run growth of recipient economies through a decline
in labor supply and labor market participation rate, as well as through the appreciation of the real
exchange rate and the associated detrimental eﬀect on the tradable sector, otherwise known as the
Dutch disease phenomenon (Acosta et al., 2009). In essence, the inﬂow of remittances, in spite of
its beneﬁts, could cause a real exchange rate appreciation and loss of international competitiveness,
and eventually lead to resource reallocation away from the tradable sector and toward real estate
and other nontradables that tend to experience rising prices in the face of capital inﬂow, which
could potentially hurt economic growth (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo, 2004; Lartey et al, 2012).
    Against the backdrop of extensive research on the impact of the choice of exchange rate regimes
on the macroeconomic eﬀects of capital inﬂows, some work has been done on the macroeconomic
dynamics generated under diﬀerent exchange rate regimes following the inﬂow of remittances. This
has been in response to the magnitude of remittances, and the questions it has generated with
respect to the potential undesirable eﬀects and how that could alter the economic growth prospects
of recipient economies, as was the case during periods of massive capital inﬂows to emerging market
economies in the 1990s. Mandelman (2012), for instance, examines the stabilization role and
welfare implications of monetary and exchange rate policies in a small open economy that is subject
to remittances ﬂuctuations. The study shows that a ﬁxed exchange regime provides a better
outcome for households facing rising trend in remittances, while a ﬂexible regime does better when
unanticipated shocks over the business cycle are considered. Lartey (2015) studies the properties of
exchange rate and monetary policies in an economy that is a recipient of remittances, focusing on
the implications for the dynamics of sectoral output, nontradable inﬂation and the real exchange
rate. The main results are that an increase in remittances leads to an increase in nontradable
inﬂation under a ﬁxed exchange rate regime, whereas for an inﬂation targeting regime, an increase
in remittances generates dynamics that result in a decrease in nontradable inﬂation.
    Lartey et al. (2012), using disaggregated data, show that an increase in remittances in emerging
economies is associated with Dutch disease eﬀects by way of real exchange rate appreciation and
resource reallocation that favors the nontradable sector at the expense of tradable goods. Moreover,
their ﬁndings suggest that these eﬀects operate stronger under ﬁxed exchange rate regimes. Ball et
al. (2013) analyze the short-run dynamics triggered by an increase in remittances under diﬀerent
exchange rate regimes, with a focus on the monetary nature of remittances. The theoretical pre-
dictions indicate that under a ﬁxed exchange rate regime, a rise in remittances leads to an increase
in gross domestic product (GDP), increase in the rate of inﬂation and an appreciation of the real
exchange rate, while they do generate an increase in GDP, an appreciation of the real exchange
rate but a decrease in inﬂation rate under a ﬂexible exchange rate regime. The key result is the
inﬂationary consequences of remittances under ﬁxed exchange regimes, which is supported by an

empirical analysis using data for 21 emerging market economies and a panel vector autoregression
approach.
    The aforementioned studies have focused on diﬀerent aspects of the impact of exchange rate
regimes on macroeconomic dynamics in recipient economies, none of which directly addresses the
economic growth consequences, although their results do carry some implications for that. Thus,
the focus of this study is to examine directly, how exchange rate ﬂexibility inﬂuences the way
remittances aﬀect economic growth. Notably, it departs from studies by Guliano and Ruiz-Arranz
(2009) and Lartey (2013) which focus on the impact of remittances on economic growth without
consideration for the role of exchange rate regimes.
    The next section explores the data and considers an empirical examination of the extent to
which exchange rate ﬂexibility aﬀects the relationship between remittances and economic growth.
Section 4 discusses the results and the policy implications thereof, and section 5 presents some
concluding remarks.


3       Data and Methodology
3.1     Characteristics of the data
The data set used constitutes annual observations that span the period, 1970-2007, for 135 de-
veloping and transition countries.2 The data for exchange rate regimes is based on the Reinhart
and Rogoﬀ de-facto exchange rate regime (COARSE) classiﬁcation, whereas the data for remit-
tances and all other variables are from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI)
database. Table 2 presents a description of the exchange rate regime classiﬁcation scheme. Table
3 provides some basic descriptive statistics for the data on the main variables used in the analy-
sis. The exchange rate regime varies between categories 1 and 5, with an increase indicating a
movement towards a more ﬂexible exchange rate regime. GDP per capita growth rate is highly
variable across countries over the sample period, ranging between about -50 percent to about 91.7
percent, with a mean of about 7 percent. Remittances are characterized by a low of US$9,980 and
a high of US$37.2 billion, with an average of US$687 million. When expressed as a share of GDP,
remittances receipts amounted to the tune of about 5 percent of GDP on average.
    Table 4 presents correlation coeﬃcients between remittances and GDP per capita growth across
the ﬁve exchange rate regime classes. With the exception of regime 2, all other regimes classes show
a positive correlation between remittances and growth, of which only regimes 1 and 3 are statistically
signiﬁcant. The estimates further show that when regime classes are combined into two groups only,
then for regimes 1 through 3, there is a positive and statistically signiﬁcant correlation between
    2
    The following are noteworthy: a. The choice of countries was guided by availability of data for remittance
recipients, and particularly for exchange rate regimes. b. Although the data spans 38 years, the time dimension is
in the range, 13 -15 years, across the various estimations due to missing observations. c. Annual observations are
used primarily in the estimations, because the literature documents that remittances may aﬀect growth by enhancing
macroeconomic stability via consumption smoothing over the business cycle, in addtion to the potential impact
through an investment channel. Refer to Lartey (2013) for further details.

    Figure 1 shows a graph of remittances and GDP per capita growth for the Philippines and El
Salvador, two countries that operate under two diﬀerent exchange rate regimes, and have been the
focus of studies on diﬀerent aspects of the macroeconomic eﬀects of remittances. The plot reveals
no clear diﬀerence in the observed association between the two variables in the two countries. The
data, however, reveals that the Philippines had an average growth rate of 1.7% between 1998 and
2007, a period during which they operated under some type of a ﬂexible exchange rate regime
(category 4). El Salvador, on the other hand, for the same period, achieved an average growth
rate of 2.4%, while operating under some type of a ﬁxed exchange rate regime (category 1). The
data further shows that between 2001 and 2007, when the Philippines saw the steepest rise in
remittances, the average growth rate was about 3%; compared to an average growth rate of 2.4%
for El Salvador over the period 1999-2007, during which they experienced a marked increase in
remittances.3

3.2    Model speciﬁcation and estimation
In order to explore further, how exchange rate ﬂexibility aﬀects the relationship between remit-
tances and economic growth, I specify and estimate a dynamic model using the generalized method
of moments (GMM) estimator proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) and Blundell and Bond
(1998), which is designed to deal with potential endogeneity in all explanatory variables, but which
accounts, particularly, for endogeneity due to the introduction of lags of the dependent variable as
covariates.
   The dynamic equation is represented by an autoregressive-distributed lag model of the form

                                     yi,t = ϕyi,t−1 + β ′ (L)xit + η i + εit .                                  (1)

This is a dynamic model for yit , where yi,t−1 is the one period lag of yit , xit is a vector of other
explanatory variables, β (L) is a vector of associated polynomials in the lag operator, ηi is a country
speciﬁc eﬀect which is unobserved, and εit is an error term. The dependent variable is GDP per
capita growth rate, and the main explanatory variables include remittances, exchange rate regime,
investment as a percentage of GDP, money supply (M2) as a percentage of GDP, government
spending and an interaction term for remittances and exchange rate regimes. The interaction
term is introduced to analyze the extent to which exchange rate ﬂexibility inﬂuences the eﬀect of
remittances on economic growth.4
    Estimating equation (1) with the ﬁxed-eﬀects (within) estimator yields a biased and inconsistent
estimate of the coeﬃcient on the lagged dependent variable because it makes use of a transformation
by which the country speciﬁc eﬀect is eliminated, and which culminates in a correlation between the
lagged dependent variable and the error term. Thus, I utilize the system GMM estimator which
   3
    The estimated mean growth rates for the referenced periods are the author’s calculation based on the data.
   4
    For all estimations, I use a logarithmic tranformation of all variables, with the exception of the exchange rate
regime index.


                                                         6
combines an estimator in ﬁrst-diﬀerences with an estimator in levels. The inclusion of a levels
equation allows the use of information on cross-country diﬀerences. This estimation technique
generates internal instruments by using the lagged levels and lagged diﬀerences of the explanatory
variables as instruments under two conditions: i) that there is no serial correlation in the errors and
ii) the diﬀerences of the explanatory variable and the errors are uncorrelated. Two speciﬁcation
tests, Sargan test for over-identifying restrictions and Arellano-Bond test for second-order serial
correlation are applied to assess the validity of the instruments and consistency of the estimates.5


4       Results
4.1     The role of exchange rate ﬂexibility
The results obtained from the preliminary regressions are presented in Table 5. The estimates
show that when expressed as percentage of GDP, remittances and the interaction of remittances
and exchange rate regimes are both positive and statistically signiﬁcant in one case only, but when
expressed in units of currency, they are signiﬁcant in both regressions.6 The main initial observation
is that remittances have a positive eﬀect on growth, and the impact increases with exchange rate
ﬂexibility.
    Table 6 presents estimates from alternative speciﬁcations that indicate that the initial ﬁndings
are robust. These results, which are based on both the two-step and one-step GMM system esti-
mation methods, show that the point estimate for remittances is statistically signiﬁcant in columns
(1), (3) and (4) whereas the estimate for the interaction term is positive in four regressions, in-
cluding the three identiﬁed. The estimated contemporaneous eﬀect of remittances on growth, when
interacted with exchange rate regime, thus, turns out to be statistically signiﬁcant across those four
speciﬁcations. Based on column (4) for instance, which shows results using the preferred estimator,
the point estimate suggests that a 1% increase in remittances increases per capita growth by about
0.79% under a ﬁxed exchange rate regime (regime class=1), and that this eﬀect increases by about
0.13% for a 1-point increase in the exchange rate classiﬁcation index, as evidenced by the estimate
of 0.92 at the mean of the exchange rate indicator (1.97 ≈ 2).7 Since the remittances-growth
relationship could operate at a lag given the smooth growth in remittances, a speciﬁcation using
one-period lag of remittances, and an interaction term involving that variable and exchange rate
regime is estimated, the results of which are in column (5). The one-period lag of remittances is
positive but not statiscally signiﬁcant, likewise the interaction term. The estimated eﬀect of remit-
tances at one period lag, when interacted with exchange rate regime, is therefore not statistically
signiﬁcant.8 It is noteworthy that when robust standard errors are employed in the estimations,
    5
      These estimators have been widely applied and discussed in a number of studies. See Blundell and Bond (1998)
for details on the system GMM estimators.
    6
      Given that the ratio of remittances to GDP would be expected to have a strong correlation with GDP growth
rate, the statistical insigniﬁcance of its coeﬃcient is attributable to weak internal instruments.
    7
      Following Bond et al. (2001), I use the one step GMM estimator with standard errors that are both robust and
reliable for ﬁnite sample inference, and consider this to be the preferred estimator.
    8
      The two-period lag of remittances, and an interaction between that and the exchange rate regime is also estimated


                                                          7
the impact of remittances when taking into account exchange rate ﬂexiblity has been observed to
be statistically signiﬁcant only when expressed in units of currency.9
    I implement additional checks for robustness by comparing the impact of remittances on growth
under a ﬁxed exchange regime to that under all other regime types that accommodate some variabil-
ity in the exchange rate. An indicator variable, which is equal to 1 for regime classes greater than
1, is interacted with remittances and introduced into various speciﬁcations. The results of those
estimations are presented in Table 7. The coeﬃcient estimates for remittances and the interaction
term are statistically signiﬁcant in all the regressions and support the ﬁnding that an exchange rate
policy that allows for some degree of variability increases the impact of remittances on economic
growth. For instance, the estimates given in column (2) suggest that on average, under a regime
that is not ﬁxed, the impact will be about 0.13% higher, which matches the initial estimated impact
for a unit increase in the exchange rate regime index. The baseline eﬀect, however, is found to be
slightly lower at about 0.65% in the case of a ﬁxed exchange rate regime.

4.2     Exchange rate regimes and ﬁnancial development interaction
Aghion et al. (2009) ﬁnd that countries that have a more developed ﬁnancial system grow faster
under a more ﬂexible exchange rate regime, and that growth may be hampered under ﬂexible
regimes in those with a less developed ﬁnancial system. The objective for this part of the analysis
is to test the hypothesis that the impact of exchange rate ﬂexibility on the eﬀect of remittances
will be negative for countries with low level of ﬁnancial development, in line with the ﬁndings in
Aghion et al. (2009). An indicator variable, set equal to 1 for low level of ﬁnancial development
is further interacted with the original interaction between remittances and exchange rate regime.
The indicator variable is based on two measures of ﬁnancial development; domestic credit provided
by banking sector (% of GDP) and domestic credit to private sector (% of GDP). In each case, the
indicator variable is set to 1 where the value of the ﬁnancial development variable is less than the
median observation for the sample.
    The results for the set of regressions that incorporate the three-way interaction term are given
in Table 8. The estimates that are based on domestic credit provided by the banking sector are
in columns (1) through (3), and they show the interaction term is statistically signiﬁcant in one
case only. Where the indicator variable is based on domestic credit to the private sector, the
estimates are in columns (4) and (5), and the interaction term is negative and not statistically
signiﬁcant. Still and all, the estimates show that, in general, the standalone eﬀect of remittances
is positive and statistically signiﬁcant, likewise the total eﬀect of remittances when interacted
with the indicator variable for ﬁnancial development and exchange rate regime, with estimates
using the same set of control variables. The results, which are available upon request, show that the standalone eﬀect
of remittances(t-2) is positive but not statistically signiﬁcant, whereas the interaction term is positive and statistically
signiﬁcant. The non-linear combination of the two (total eﬀect) at the mean value of exchange rate regime is not
statistically signiﬁcant, however.
    9
      Remittances expressed in currency units is used for the remainder of the analysis, given that in the preceding
regressions, when expressed as a percentage of GDP, the estimates are not statistically signiﬁcant, which could be
due to the problem of weak instruments.


                                                             8
between 0.555 and 0.867. These estimates therefore suggest that exchange rate ﬂexibility increases
the impact of remittances when countries have a low level of ﬁnancial development, where the
measure is domestic credit provided by the banking sector; but decreases this impact where the
ﬁnancial development indicator is given by domestic credit to the private sector. A unit increase
in exchange rate ﬂexibility would, thus, increase the growth eﬀect of remittances by about 0.18%
in less ﬁnancially developed countries, as measured by total domestic credit, but decrease it by
about 0.05% where the indicator is domestic credit to the private sector, based on the diﬀerence
between the standalone eﬀect of remittances, and the nonlinear combination of the estimates for
remittances and the interaction term in columns (1) and (4) respectively.
    A ﬁnal set of speciﬁcations are estimated using 4-year period averages of the data as additional
checks for robustness of the results, and the estimates are given in Table 9.10 The results show
that when expressed as percentage of GDP, the standalone eﬀect of remittances is positive, but
when taking into account the exchange rate regime, the impact of remittances is not statistically
signiﬁcant. On the other hand when expressed in currency units, remittances have a positive eﬀect
on growth under a ﬁxed regime, and the eﬀect rises with exchange rate ﬂexibility, consistent with
the preceding results. Of particular interest are the estimates reported in column 3, which show
remittances with a positive coeﬃcient, and lagged remittances with a coeﬃcient of -0.429, whereas
the interaction term coeﬃcient estimated at the mean value of exchange rate regimes is -0.378.
This is an intriguing result, as it suggests remittances have positive eﬀect on growth in the short-
run but could impact growth negatively in the medium to long-run, possibly through the Dutch
disease mechanism, and that exchange rate ﬂexibility may minimize such negative consequences;
an inference that is consistent with ﬁndings in Lartey (2015). In general, the results presented in
columns (4) — (6) support those in Table 8, which suggest that exchange rate ﬂexibility may increase
or decrease the growth eﬀects of remittances in countries with low levels of ﬁnancial development.11
    Thus, although the impact of remittances on growth is observed to be positive under ﬁxed
regimes, it is unclear whether exchange rate ﬂexibility increases or decreases this impact in less
ﬁnancially developed economies. It is interesting to note, however, that the negative impact of
exchange rate ﬂexibility is based on the ﬁnancial development index associated with the private
sector, which seems to be consistent with the argument advanced by Aghion et al. (2009), that
for ﬁrms in countries with lower levels of ﬁnancial development, liquidity shocks that accompany
exchange rate ﬂuctuations discourage investments and hence tend to have negative eﬀects on eco-
nomic growth. In other words, the broader measure for the level of ﬁnancial development, i.e.
domestic creidt provided by the banking sector, is associated with a positive impact of exchange
rate ﬂexibility on the relationship between remittances and growth plausibly because it conceals
  10
    This is done to reduce any business cycle eﬀects and potential measurement errors.

    I performed additional robustness checks by foremost, estimating the speciﬁcations in Table 9 while dropping
from the sample, China and India, the two largest recipients of remittances with receipts in excess of US$40 billion
more than countries like Mexico and the Philippines, which are ranked directly behind them. Secondly, I estimated
the same speciﬁcations after dropping from the sample, oﬀshore ﬁnancial centers namely Belize, Malaysia, Panama,
Samoa and Vanuatu.The results, which are available upon request, are identical to the reported estimates, and do
not alter the main ﬁndings.

that aﬀects growth negatively.

4.3   Policy implication
Remittances, it has been found, can generate certain short-run dynamics that could potentially hurt
the growth prospects of recipient countries. The main mechanism through which this can occur is
the well-known Dutch disease phenomenon. Studies on such short-run dynamics, in general, have
found that ﬂexible exchange rate regimes tend to minimize the inﬂationary consequences of the
inﬂow of remittances (Ball et al., 2013). A supporting argument is that in the case where monetary
policy is not devoted to pegging the nominal exchange rate, an inﬂation targeting regime, for
instance, generates dynamics that lead to lower nontradable inﬂation and favorable outcome for
the tradable sector which is considered key to economic growth (Lartey, 2015).
    The main ﬁnding in this paper indicates that, by and large, the impact of remittances on growth
is positive under both ﬁxed and ﬂexible exchange rate regimes, such that this eﬀect increases with
exchange rate ﬂexibility. The positive eﬀect that is observed under ﬁxed exchange rate regimes is
likely a consequence of the neutralizing eﬀect of any potential appreciation of the nominal exchange
rate and the favorable impact on economic growth that this generates. However, given that this
positive impact is higher under more ﬂexible regimes, it is arguable that policies that are character-
ized by exchange rate ﬂexibility do mitigate some of the undesirable consequences of remittances
that occur under ﬁxed regimes. Nonetheless, such negative consequences corresponding to ﬁxed
exchange rate policies are not strong enough to overturn the positive contribution that remittances
invariably make towards economic growth.
    In essence, a ﬁxed regime may not decrease the growth eﬀects of remittances. Still and all,
it may generate dynamics in the short-run that could potentially limit the size of the positive
impact of remittances on growth. Thus, where a ﬁxed exchange rate is considered as necessary to
satisfying the short-term objectives of policy makers, which may include controlling appreciation
of the nominal exchange rate following the inﬂow of remittances, it would be appropriate for such
a policy to be adopted. On the other hand, the adoption of a policy that favors exchange rate
ﬂexibility should lead to realization of a larger impact of remittances on growth.


5     Conclusions
This paper informs the debate on whether the exchange rate regime that a recipient country adopts
has consequence for the impact of remittances on economic growth. Particularly, the study analyzes
how exchange rate ﬂexibility impacts the eﬀect of remittances on growth. The literature has
documented a positive association between remittances and growth, and argued in favor of diﬀerent
channels through which this may occur, including investment in both human and physical capital,
and through consumption smoothing. However, it has also been shown that remittances may be
associated with a decline in labor supply, appreciation of the real exchange rate and reallocation


                                                 10
of resources away from the tradable sector, all of which have adverse consequences for economic
growth. Furthermore, it has been argued that exchange rate regimes may have implications for the
growth eﬀect of remittances either directly through the impact they exert on resource reallocation
and the real exchange rate or indirectly with respect to how they inﬂuence macroeconomic stability.
    The ﬁndings indicate that the impact of remittances on growth is positive under ﬁxed exchange
rate regimes. The results further suggest that more ﬂexible exchange rate regimes are associated
with a greater increase in economic growth following an increase in remittances. In the case of
countries with less developed ﬁnancial systems, however, the results demonstrate that exchange
rate ﬂuctuations may serve to diminish the eﬀect of remittances on growth. Thus, in general, in
spite of the exchange rate policy a country adopts, it can be expected that the inﬂow of remittances
will have a positive eﬀect on growth, with the size of this eﬀect increasing in the ﬂexibility of the
exchange rate regime.
