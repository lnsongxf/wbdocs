Dramatic climate changes and weather extremes are already affecting millions of people around the world,
damaging crops and coastlines and putting water security at risk.
    Across the three regions studied in this report, record-breaking temperatures are occurring more fre-
quently, rainfall has increased in intensity in some places, while drought-prone regions like the Mediter-
ranean are getting dryer. A significant increase in tropical North Atlantic cyclone activity is affecting the
Caribbean and Central America.
    There is growing evidence that warming close to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is locked-in to the
Earth’s atmospheric system due to past and predicted emissions of greenhouse gases, and climate change
impacts such as extreme heat events may now be unavoidable.
    As the planet warms, climatic conditions, heat and other weather extremes which occur once in hundreds
of years, if ever, and considered highly unusual or unprecedented today would become the “new climate
normal” as we approach 4°C—a frightening world of increased risks and global instability.
    The consequences for development would be severe as crop yields decline, water resources change,
diseases move into new ranges, and sea levels rise. Ending poverty, increasing global prosperity and reduc-
ing global inequality, already difficult, will be much harder with 2°C warming, but at 4°C there is serious
doubt whether these goals can be achieved at all.
    For this report, the third in the Turn Down the Heat series, we turned again to the scientists at the
Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytics. We asked them to look at the likely
impacts of present day (0.8°C), 2°C and 4°C warming on agricultural production, water resources, cities
and ecosystems across Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, and parts of Europe
and Central Asia.
    Their findings are alarming.
    In Latin America and the Caribbean, heat extremes and changing precipitation patterns will have adverse
effects on agricultural productivity, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. In Brazil, at 2°C warming, crop
yields could decrease by up to 70 percent for soybean and up to 50 percent for wheat. Ocean acidification,
sea level rise, tropical cyclones and temperature changes will negatively impact coastal livelihoods, tour-
ism, health and food and water security, particularly in the Caribbean. Melting glaciers would be a hazard
for Andean cities.
    In the Middle East and North Africa, a large increase in heat-waves combined with warmer average tem-
peratures will put intense pressure on already scarce water resources with major consequences for regional
food security. Crop yields could decrease by up to 30 percent at 1.5–2°C and by almost 60 percent at 3–4°C.
At the same time, migration and climate-related pressure on resources might increase the risk of conflict.
    In the Western Balkans and Central Asia, reduced water availability in some places becomes a threat
as temperatures rise toward 4°C. Melting glaciers in Central Asia and shifts in the timing of water flows


                                                                                                           vii

  will lead to less water resources in summer months and high risks of torrential floods. In the Balkans, a
  higher risk of drought results in potential declines for crop yields, urban health, and energy generation. In
  Macedonia, yield losses are projected of up to 50 percent for maize, wheat, vegetables and grapes at 2°C
  warming. In northern Russia, forest dieback and thawing of permafrost threaten to amplify global warming as
  stored carbon and methane are released into the atmosphere, giving rise to a self-amplifying feedback loop.
      Turn Down the Heat: Confronting the New Climate Normal builds on our 2012 report, which concluded
  the world would warm by 4°C by the end of this century with devastating consequences if we did not take
  concerted action now. It complements our 2013 report that looked at the potential risks to development
  under different warming scenarios in Sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and South Asia, and which
  warned that we could experience a 2°C world in our lifetime.
      Many of the worst projected climate impacts outlined in this latest report could still be avoided by
  holding warming below 2°C. But, this will require substantial technological, economic, institutional and
  behavioral change. It will require leadership at every level of society.
      Today the scientific evidence is overwhelming, and it’s clear that we cannot continue down the current
  path of unchecked, growing emissions. The good news is that there is a growing consensus on what it will
  take to make changes to the unsustainable path we are currently on.
      More and more voices are arguing that is possible to grow greener without necessarily growing slower.
  Today, we know that action is urgently needed on climate change, but it does not have to come at the
  expense of economic growth. We need smart policy choices that stimulate a shift to clean public transport
  and energy efficiency in factories, buildings and appliances can achieve both growth and climate benefits.
      This last report in the Turn Down the Heat series comes at a critical moment. Earlier this year, the UN
  Secretary General’s Climate Summit unleased a new wave of optimism. But our reports make clear that
  time is of the essence.
      Governments will gather first in Lima and then Paris for critical negotiations on a new climate treaty.
  Inside and outside of the conference halls, global leaders will need to take difficult decisions that will require,
  in some instances, short term sacrifice but ultimately lead to long term gains for all.
      At the World Bank Group we will use our financial capacity to help tackle climate change. We will
  innovate and bring forward new financial instruments. We will use our knowledge and our convening
  power. We will use our evidence and data to advocate and persuade. In short, we will do everything we
  can to help countries and communities build resilience and adapt to the climate impacts already being felt
  today and ensure that finance flows to where it is most needed.
       Our response to the challenge of climate change will define the legacy of our generation. The stakes
  have never been higher.

Summary
                                                                                                              Executive Summary
The data show that dramatic climate changes, heat and weather extremes are already impacting people, damaging crops and coastlines
and putting food, water, and energy security at risk. Across the three regions studied in this report, record-breaking temperatures are
occurring more frequently, rainfall has increased in intensity in some places, while drought-prone regions are getting dryer. In an overview of
social vulnerability, the poor and underprivileged, as well as the elderly and children, are found to be often hit the hardest. There is growing
evidence, that even with very ambitious mitigation action, warming close to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by mid-century is already
locked-in to the Earth’s atmospheric system and climate change impacts such as extreme heat events may now be unavoidable.1 If the
planet continues warming to 4°C, climatic conditions, heat and other weather extremes considered highly unusual or unprecedented
today would become the new climate normal—a world of increased risks and instability. The consequences for development would be
severe as crop yields decline, water resources change, diseases move into new ranges, and sea levels rise. The task of promoting human
development, of ending poverty, increasing global prosperity, and reducing global inequality will be very challenging in a 2°C world, but
in a 4°C world there is serious doubt whether this can be achieved at all. Immediate steps are needed to help countries adapt to the
climate impacts being felt today and the unavoidable consequences of a rapidly warming world. The benefits of strong, early action on
climate change, action that follows clean, low carbon pathways and avoids locking in unsustainable growth strategies, far outweigh the
costs. Many of the worst projected climate impacts could still be avoided by holding warming to below 2°C. But, the time to act is now.
This report focuses on the risks of climate change to development in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North
Africa, and parts of Europe and Central Asia. Building on earlier Turn Down the Heat reports this new scientific analysis examines
the likely impacts of present day (0.8°C), 2°C and 4°C warming above pre-industrial temperatures on agricultural production, water
resources, ecosystem services and coastal vulnerability for affected populations.

                                                                                           development. While covering a range of sectors, special attention

  Holding warming to below 2°C and bringing warming back to 1.5°C by 2100 is technically and economically feasible but implies stringent mitigation over the short term.
While IPCC AR5 WGIII identified many mitigation options to hold warming below 2°C with a likely chance, and with central estimates of 1.5–1.7°C by 2100, only “a limited
number of studies have explored scenarios that are more likely than not to bring temperature change back to below 1.5°C by 2100”. The scenarios in these studies are “charac-
terized by (1) immediate mitigation action; (2) the rapid upscaling of the full portfolio of mitigation technologies; and (3) development along a low-energy demand trajectory”.

     Box 2: Social Vulnerability Impacts of Climate Change
     Shocks and stresses related to climate change can undermine poverty reduction and push new groups into poverty. Informal settlements
     on flood plains and steep hillsides in many Latin American cities and the Western Balkans, for example, have been severely affected by floods and
     landslides in recent years. While many poor people will be living in isolated, rural areas, continued urban expansion into hazard-prone areas means
     that a growing proportion of urban populations will be at risk of climate-related extreme events and rising food prices, and thus of increasing poverty
     levels among urban groups.
           The impacts of climate change will often be most severely felt by poor and socially excluded groups, whose capacity to adapt to
     both rapid- and slow-onset climate change is more limited. These include indigenous people and ethnic minorities, migrant workers, women,
     girls, older people, and children. Although these groups—like their more advantaged counterparts—are already adapting to climatic and other
     changes, these efforts are often undermined by their limited assets, lack of voice, and discriminatory social norms. For example, increasing water
     stress, projected for parts of Latin America and low-income Middle East and North Africa countries, can dramatically increase the labor burden asso-
     ciated with fetching water in rural and poor urban environments; and child malnutrition linked to climate change reducing protein and micronutrient
     contents of staple foods (wheat, rice) could have irreversible, negative life-time consequences for affected children.
           Climate change may lead to displacement and also affect patterns and rates of migrations. Most displacement related to extreme
     weather events has, to date, been temporary. However, if climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable (for example, if they become too hot,
     too dry, or too frequently affected by extreme events—or sea-level rise) such migration may increase in scale and more often lead to permanent
     resettlement (as already being seen in some water-scarce parts of MENA). Large-scale migration may pose significant challenges for family relations,
     health, and human security. There is a risk of disadvantaged groups being trapped in adversely affected rural areas as they lack the funds and/or
     social connections to move.

     Box 3: Selected Climate Risks in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region
     In a 4°C world, heat extremes, changes in hydrological cycles, tropical cyclones and changes in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are
     expected to pose severe problems with risks cascading to the agricultural sector, human health, large urban centers and the functioning of critical
     ecosystem services. At lower levels of warming, glacial melt in the Andes will reduce freshwater and hydropower for communities and large Andean
     cities during the dry season, while increasing the risks of flooding in the short term and impacting agriculture and environmental services down-
     stream. Severe threats are expected from sea-level rise, damages to low-lying areas and coastal infrastructures. Degrading coral reefs will endanger
     tourism revenues and undermine biodiversity, fisheries, and the protection of coastal zones thereby negatively impacting livelihoods. For the global
     community, the potential impact of climate change on the Amazon rainforest is of high relevance. With increasing warming, degradation—if not
     dieback—of the Amazon rainforest is increasingly possible potentially turning the forest into a large carbon source during dry years and triggering
     further climate change.

Box 5: Selected Climate Risks in the Middle East and North Africa Region
The region will be severely affected at 2°C and 4°C warming, particularly because of the large increase in projected heat extremes, the substantial
reduction in water availability, and expected consequences for regional food security. High exposure to sea-level rise in the coming decades is linked to
large populations and assets in coastal areas. In a 2°C world already low annual river discharge levels are projected to drop by more than 15 percent
and highly unusual heat extremes are projected to affect about a third of the land. Crop yield declines coupled with impacts in other grain-producing
regions could contribute to increasing food prices in the region. The growing food import dependency further exacerbates such risks. Deteriorating
rural livelihoods may contribute to internal and international migration, adding further stress on particularly urban infrastructure, with associated risks for
poor migrants. Migration and climate related pressure on resources (e.g. water) might increase the risk of conflict.

     Box 6: Selected Climate Risks in the Europe and Central Asia Region
     Increasing precipitation and glacial melt lead to increased water availability and flood risk in Central Asia in the coming decades. After mid-century
     and especially with warming leading to a 4°C world, unstable water availability poses a risk for agriculture and competing demands for hydropower
     generation. In the Western Balkans, extreme heat with a strong decrease in precipitation and water availability are projected to lead to large reduc-
     tions in crop yields, adverse effects on human health, and increasing risks to energy generation for a 4°C world; but would already be present in a
     2°C world. The Russian forests store enormous amounts of carbon in biomass and soils. While their productivity may generally increase with warmer
     temperatures, large-scale forest dieback and the release of carbon resulting from interacting heat stress, insect spread and fire, have the potential to
     further affect boreal forests in the second half of the century.

  Warming levels are relative to pre-industrial temperatures. The impacts shown here are a subset of those summarized in Table 3.15 of the Main
  report. The arrows indicate solely the range of warming levels assessed in the underlying studies, but do not imply any graduation of risk unless
  noted explicitly. In addition, observed impacts or impacts occurring at lower or higher levels of warming that are not covered by the key studies high-
  lighted here are not presented (e.g., coral bleaching already occurs earlier than 1.5°C warming but the studies presented here only start at 1.5°C).
  Adaptation measures are not assessed here although they can be crucial to alleviate impacts of climate change. The layout of the figure is adapted
