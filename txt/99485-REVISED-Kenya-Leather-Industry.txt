         The modified Delphi method is a structured communication technique or method developed as a systematic, interactive forecasting method which
         relies on a panel of experts. The experts answer questions in two or more rounds, and after each round, a summary of the experts’ forecasts from the
         previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgments is presented. Experts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the
         replies of others. It is believed that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the "correct" answer.

      	 Just what constitutes ‘eco-friendly’ or ‘green’ leather is ambiguous. Generally, a leather product is considered ‘eco-friendly’ if it has been produced
        through means other than chromium sulphate tanning (which, along with about 250 other chemicals typically used in the tanning process, releases
        unfriendly toxins into the atmosphere). It is not clear, however, whether this assumes that the husbandry involved in delivering the hide was done so in
        an organic and/or humane manner.

      	 The number of Kenyans working for wage jobs grew gradually over the last few decades, and since the year 2009, has exceeded self-employment. The
        nature of employment is in transition as well, as more people are moving away from traditional family-owned farming to higher value-added jobs.
    20
      	At the same time, there exists an ever present challenge for Kenyan manufactures to reclaim market share in their own home market (particularly
        for footwear), where Chinese producers remain extremely aggressive price-wise and are apparently committed to preserving their dominant market
        position.

       	 There is concern among industry leaders that official sources of data underrepresent actual leather exports. A significant quantity of raw hides and skins
         are being smuggled out from Kenya without being taxed. At the leather processing level, a key tannery owner reports that Alpharama tannery alone
         exports over US$6 million worth of finished leather and the industry total is estimated to be around US$10 million. Finished leather product exports
         also appear to be undervalued. Bata is estimated to export around US$4 million worth of leather shoes. Also, a large share of leather sandals and other
         goods are leaving the country without declaration. Based upon interviews and analysis of the official data, in our judgment, the share of each stage of
         the value chain in figure 8 portrays a relatively accurate picture of reality.

  	 By having a benchmark we can assess the competitiveness of the current Kenyan leather industry vis-à-vis other global competitors. We chose Ethiopia
    as our reference point due to its proximity and similarities with Kenya in three areas. First, the strengths and weaknesses of the leather industries in
    Ethiopia and Kenya bear similarity. Their competitiveness derives primarily from abundant livestock (raw material) and relatively cheap labor cost. Both
    countries lack advanced technology or productivity. Second, both countries mostly produce low-cost leather products. Third, they are in the same
    region and are competitors for markets in the region. Also, Kenya could emulate Ethiopian policies and initiatives, which led to the industry’s highly
    successful transformation.

In order to foster linkages and collaboration                                   support from a Leather Cluster Action
across the leather industry, it is recommended                                  Fund (US$50,000-US$100,000) to support
that Kenya establish a collaborative,                                           initial implementation projects/tasks (e.g.,
stakeholder-driven leather industry strategy                                    feasibility studies, benchmarking trips, etc.).


 	Clustering is internationally recognized as the best way to pro-actively address sector development and stimulate economic development (e.g.,
64

  World Bank, African Development Bank, InterAmerican Development Bank). Clustering is effective because it doesn’t only deal with individual
  companies; instead, it engages entire networks of entrepreneurs, companies, research and educational institutions, government, and other institutions
  in a coordinated fashion to accelerate competitiveness. Competitiveness is accelerated by supporting the entire value chain to develop, based on
  knowledge and value added, rather than compete on low costs. Clustering is especially important for small economies like Kenya where the critical mass
  of individual companies is too small to effectively compete in domestic and international markets.

      Box 1: Branding Ethiopian sheep leather in Japan
          Dubbed as a champion product approach, Ethiopia is set to brand its leather and leather products made of sheepskin
          to Japanese market and beyond.

          Sponsored by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the champion product approach movement
          is something which is said to seek and improve Ethiopia's image and brand the country's finest sheep leather and
          finished leather products abroad.

          Noriyuki Nagai, one of the four consultants hired by JICA to undertake the job of championing sheep leather to become
          a brand product, told The Reporter that the short term target of the champion product approach is to introduce
          Ethiopia's high-end sheep leather and leather goods to the Japanese market.

          Similarly, Kenya can find ways to brand and distinguish its sheep and goat skins and hides to Japan and other countries.

      Box 2: Case study−Slovakia
          Over the years, Slovakia has acquired a reputation for rampant corruption in doing business. However, since
          the enactment of a new initiative of a procurement portal called EVO, in which the public can access various public
          procurement information sources, Slovakia has been making an effort to shift away from a deeply entrenched stigma.
          The recent development has brought a paradigm shift in the role of civil society and media oversight. As more
          information is available to the public, journalists and civil society can proactively play an analyst and intermediary roles
          in shedding light on corruption during the public procurement process. Information disseminated via EVO include:
           •	   Name of the contractor who won the contract;
           •	   Number of bids received;
           •	   The monetary value of the contract;
           •	   The criteria used for selection;

           Box 4: Lessons learned in developing industry parks in Kenya and other countries
              1.	 Improvements in the business environment are the primary magnet for attracting
                  private investment into development zones. In particular, zones which succeed in
                  assisting investors overcome service, land, and infrastructure constraints are more
                  likely to succeed than are other zones which afford less conducive investment
                  environments;
              2.	 Industrial zone development projects which are fully funded, led, and managed
                  within the public sector frequently fail to meet project expectations. This is most
                  frequently the result of misalignment of incentives, politically driven and risk adverse
                  decision-making, slow to react and bureaucratic processes, and weak management
                  skills. The Export Processing Zone Authority of Kenya is an example of a public sector
                  organization, which has been responsible for the development of industrial parks in
                  Kenya but whose track record has been mixed.69
              3.	 Diversity in institutional and business model arrangements is good. “One size” never
                  suits all businesses, will not work in all zones, nor will it fit all supply chains.
              4.	 In all cases, a private operating company should be engaged to market the zone,
                  negotiate leases and sales terms with tenants, assure the provision of essential
                  ancillary business services, and manage a “one-stop” customs, business permitting
                  and licensing interface with government.
              5.	 Zone investments anchored by joint ventures between local and foreign investors are
                  more likely to result in technology transfer and strong linkages to the local economy
                  than those which are anchored by local investors or foreign investors alone.
              6.	 Zone development projects which are fully funded by private investors frequently
                  attempt to price up until marginal costs and benefits are equal and thus, capture
                  economic rents which projects are otherwise able to provide to tenants and their
                  commercial dependents. As a result, privately managed development zones
                  frequently frustrate efforts to realize external economies because they allow less
                  producer surpluses to accrue for the benefit of tenants suppliers, including poor
                  farmers and aspiring SME’s.
              7.	 Zone development projects, which define clear, balanced, and counter balancing roles
                  for public and private participants, appear to offer the most effective and ultimately,
                  the most successful modes of governance. Issues which frequently require mediated
                  resolution between public and private sector interests include: (i) effective modes for
                  integrating the local economy into zone operations; (ii) equitable terms negotiated
                  between zone tenants and employees and local suppliers; (iii) basis for expanding,
                  maintaining and up-keeping the zone and near zone infrastructure. Examples of
                  successful zones organized to balance the interests of public and private sector
                  stakeholders can be found in Tanzania in the sugar production zones and in Jordan
                  and Gabon in more conventional industrial export zones.
              8.	 Early occupancy and tenancy commitments on the part of large anchor tenants can
                  significantly reduce implementation risk and shrink the time required from initial zone
                  development to full zone occupancy. On the other hand, large anchor tenants are
                  not reluctant to exercise their market dominant position in ways designed to reduce
                  development time and to secure favorable terms for building out infrastructure and
                  providing supportive services.

   zones take time to develop. They rely on effective state capacity, and their success is tightly intertwined with that of the wider national economy in which
   they are based. Clearly, they are not for the faint-hearted.” (p. 263). “Kenya’s EPZ program, often held up as an example of African success, looks rather
   anemic. Even including the single factory units, the program, which has been operating for nearly two decades, accounted for just over US$400 million

Box 5: Case study: Ethiopia Leather Industries Development Institutes (LIDI)
 The Government of Ethiopia established the Leather and Leather Product Technology Institute (LLPTI) in 1998.
 The facility, renamed as Leather Industries Development Institutes (LIDI), became a designated institution that would
 spearhead capacity building and technology transfer. Since its foundation, LIDI has played a critical role in helping
 the Ethiopian leather industry in reaching its potential. LIDI not only works on the development and dissemination of
 technology for the entire range of the leather supply chain but also works closely with key industry players in training
 and building capacity.

 Furthermore, LIDI also supports the leather industry in the following ways:
  •	   Benchmarking: The objective is to build capacity and ultimately, to promote greater competitiveness in the
       Ethiopian leather industry. The government identified globally prominent leather enterprises and sponsored the
       process of aiding selected Ethiopian counterparts in a wide range of areas such as management, productivity,
       input supply, marketing, product quality, and human resource development.
  •	   Twining: The objective is to establish long term knowledge sharing with globally recognized institutions and
       advanced counterparts in other countries. For example, a long-term relationship was formed between LIDI and
       the Indian Leather and Leather Products Technology Institute.
  •	   Market Research: LIDI recognizes market entrance as a great challenge to the industry. To facilitate new,
       international market entrance, LIDI constantly conducts research on trade agreements and markets for the
       industry manufacturers.
  •	   Direct Assistance: By maintaining close relationships with industry players, LIDI also directly assisted leather
       good producers in production and design. Beyond their conventional role of training, LIDI provided its facilities
       to leather good producers in order to facilitate their production.

 More importantly, LIDI ensured its facility is highly accessible to Ethiopian tanneries and leather good producers
 by offering its service at a minimal cost.

 Implications for the Kenyan leather industry
 Factors that allow LIDI to be effective are not only found in sufficient funding and a strong backing from the
 government. The success also lies in its organizational structure. Unlike Kenya, where responsibilities and roles
 are dispersed into several institutions, LIDI oversees every facet of the leather industry in Ethiopia. Its close linkage
 with the market and industry stakeholders allows its training, marketing, technology dissemination, and investment
 programs to be more effective. Moreover, having all the services and programs under one institution allows a higher
 level of communication and knowledge sharing among different industry players in the supply chain. It allows LIDI to
 design programs and services that are catered to the industry’s demand.

      Box 6: Promoting environmental practices in the leather industry
          The international Leather Working Group (LWG)—a consortium of major global leather stakeholders—promotes
          sustainable and appropriate environmental practices within the leather industry. It is a multi-stakeholder
          organization which has developed and which applies a process management and audit protocol for assessing the
          environmental compliance and performance capabilities of tanners. Its members include brands, manufacturers,
          suppliers and NGOs. LWG seeks to improve the tanning industry by aligning industry practices with environmental
          priorities and by providing guidance for continual improvement. The group works transparently to improve brand
          value and to strengthen the environmental husbandry of all industry participants.

  India Leather Industry Development

  India’s rise from a small raw leather exporter in the 1960s into one of the world’s primary exporters of both raw
  and finished leather today is a testament to at once liberalization and central planning. Today, raw leather makes
  up only 26 percent of India’s leather exports, meaning finished leather garments, accessories, and footwear have
  taken an impressive share. Clearly, a concerted effort has been made to capitalize on the value addition of finished
  leather, and thus maximize export return.


  In 1991, the Indian government ushered in a policy of ‘de-licensing,’ targeting several manufacturing industries
  including leather. The Industries Development and Regulation Act (IDRA) sought to jump start the leather industry
  (and others) by liberalizing the market and allowing free entry to all firms. Moreover, de-licensing simplified FDI
  regulations by affording an ‘automatic route’ to foreign investors seeking entry into the Indian market.


  Over time, the government has sought to develop leather clusters converging producers along various stages
  of the supply chain and based throughout the country. Of particular note, the Indian Ministry of Small and
  Medium Enterprises (MSME) has taken charge of organizing and funding the vast number of SMEs in the leather
  sector, most of which lack a strong and centralized base. In its most recent Indian Leather Development Programme
  (ILDP), the MSME laid out plans for a new series of interventions—comprising a diagnostic study, the setting up
  Common Facility Centers (CFC), and infrastructure development—in Bihar, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and
  West Bengal, through its own support as well as that of state governments.


  Mega leather cluster projects have been developed in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. In both cases a special
  purpose vehicle (SPV) was organized by private investors to bid on the mega leather cluster projects and win a
  capital grant to implement the projects, involving leading development and negotiating the basis on which risks
  and rewards were shared among tenants. The SPV’s are corporate bodies, promoted by entrepreneurs willing to set
  up the proposed leather parks. Local governments contribute undeveloped land to the SPV’s and private investors
  provide paid-in capital. As part of the bidding process SPV apply for Environmental Clearance from the Government
  of India. Importantly, these Indian mega leather parks are being located where skilled tanners and workers already
  exist and where a tradition of leather production has already taken hold.

     In order to develop an action plan for the implementation of the leather sector strategy, an assessment of the
      expected impacts and feasibility of implementation of the proposed strategy and actions was undertaken.
     Each action initiative was assessed in terms of its expected impact on: (i) jobs generated; (ii) increase in value
     added; (iii) increase in investment; and in terms of (iv) implementation cost; and (v) ease of implementation.
     The estimation of expected impact is shown as follows.
