               Summary
               u	The economic recovery in high-income countries is lifting global growth, but the pace of recovery in
                     these countries remains uneven.
               u	Economic activity was robust in much of Sub-Saharan Africa in 2013, supported by strong domestic
                     demand—notably investment growth.
               u	The outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa remains favorable, but prospects are sensitive to downside risks
                     from lower commodity prices and a sharp slowdown in capital flows.
               u	The pace of expansion in recent growth spurts in Sub-Saharan Africa has been faster and less volatile
                     than in earlier periods and higher than in takeoffs in other developing countries.
               u	Patterns of growth in Sub-Saharan Africa show considerable variation across countries, with resource-
                     rich countries growing at a faster pace than non-resource-rich countries.
               u	Growth has shifted sectoral shares, with the resources and services sectors gaining at the expense of
                     agriculture and manufacturing.




               Section 1: Recent Developments and Trends

                   u	Global  output growth is projected to strengthen to 3 percent in 2014, with much of the impetus
                       coming from high-income countries.
                   u	Despite   emerging challenges, medium-term growth prospects for Sub-Saharan Africa remain positive,
                       and regional gross domestic product (GDP) growth is projected to rise to 5.2 percent in 2014, and
                       strengthen to 5.4 percent in 2015.




               GLOBAL ECONOMY
               After five years of prolonged weakness, the global economy is finally mending. Global output expanded
               by 2.4 percent in 2013, and growth is set to rise to 3 percent in 2014 due to the recovery in high-income
               economies (figure 1).1 The pace of the recovery in these countries remains uneven, however. In the
               United States, economic expansion was constrained to 1.9 percent in 2013 as the growth momentum
               slowed in Q4. Weak retail spending, job growth, and Purchasing Managers Index surveys point to a

softening of economic activity in 2014Q1, as severe weather has weighed on consumer spending and
business activity in Q1. Nonetheless, the underlying impetus remains solid. With fiscal drags diminishing
and reduced policy uncertainty, the recovery is expected to pick up speed, and U.S. output is forecast
to grow at 2.7 percent. Activity in the Euro area has continued to firm following a near doubling of
growth to 1.1 percent in Q4, supported by strong exports. The region is expected to post growth of
over 1 percent in 2014, although significant spare capacity and a continued slide in core inflation are
generating concerns about deflation. In Japan, GDP growth was flat at 1 percent in Q4, thanks to weak
net exports, and the overall expansion in economic activity came in at 1.5 percent for the year. Industrial
output growth rebounded strongly in January, reflecting robust demand. Still, the cyclical recovery
could be harder to sustain amid fiscal drags from a sales tax hike in 2014Q2 and if progress on structural
reforms remains slow.

Developing countries grew at an overall pace of 4.8 percent in 2013, compared to 4.9 percent in 2012.
Trends were mixed across countries, however. China’s economy grew by 7.7 percent in 2013 (as in 2012),
although growth moderated in Q4 from an annualized 9.3 percent to 7 percent, amid rising uncertainties
about investment and corporate debt. Economic activity firmed in developing countries (excluding
China) in Q4, with the annualized pace of GDP growth picking up from 4.8 percent to 5.6 percent.
Growth in East Asian countries excluding China continued to strengthen, supported by acceleration in
exports and robust domestic demand in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Similarly, the Europe
and Central Asia region benefited from strengthening Euro area demand. By contrast, weak domestic
demand resulted in slowing industrial activity in India and lower Q4 GDP growth in Mexico.

               There have been two recent episodes of global financial turbulence—May–August 2013 and early
               2014—during which capital flows dropped off, and developing country equities and currencies
               fell sharply, forcing sharp adjustments on several emerging market countries. The second bout of
               market volatility followed a string of weaker-than-expected economic data in January and a sharp
               devaluation of the Argentine peso. Financial market volatility spiked to levels not seen since the
               summer of 2013. U.S. Treasuries declined by some 20 basis points in the last two weeks of January,
               while markets in developing countries came under pressure. Between January 22 and February 5,
               2014, developing country stock markets sustained losses of 6 percent and their CDS spreads widened
               by some 100 basis points. The currencies of large middle-income countries with higher current
               account deficits and external financing needs came under intense pressure. The Turkish lira and South
               African rand sustained declines of 6.4 and 4.7 percent, respectively, in January, prompting their central
               banks to raise interest rates.

               The outlook is for a gradual strengthening of the global recovery. Global GDP growth is projected
               to strengthen from 2.4 percent in 2013 to 3 percent in 2014, rising to 3.3 percent in 2015 and to
               3.4 percent in 2016, with much of the impetus coming from high-income countries (figure 1).
               Growth in high-income economies is expected to rise from 1.3 percent in 2013 to 2.1 percent
               in 2014 and 2.4 percent in 2016, as drags on growth from government and household budget
               consolidation efforts draw to a close and demand for consumer durables and investment goods
               firms. Growth in developing countries is expected to rise to 5 percent in 2014 and average 5.5
               percent in 2015-16, supported in part by the ongoing recovery in high-income countries.

               Increased financial market and capital volatility remains a significant downside risk to the global
               recovery. Notwithstanding the support from stronger external demand, developing countries face
               significant risks from the normalization of monetary policy in high-income countries. According
               to U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, less than half of the eventual increase in U.S.
               long-term rates has occurred thus far (the CBO estimates they will rise to 5 percent, compared
               to just below 3 percent today and 1.6 percent in May 2013). While the baseline is for a gradual
               tightening of global financial conditions, a rapid and disorderly rise in interest rates or a sharp
               pullback in capital flows cannot be ruled out. Such developments could lead to lower investments
               and severe financial disruptions.

               Other risks to the global economy include those arising from China’s high debt levels,
               geopolitical tensions, and downside risks from commodity prices. China’s commitment to
               improve resource allocation and increase the role of market forces in the economy has been
               reflected in major reforms since November 2013. But rebalancing the economy away from
               investment and export to consumption could be a challenge. Any “hard landing” could have
               substantial spillovers to economies within the East Asia region, and to commodity exporters
               in Sub-Saharan Africa. Geo political tensions (as in Crimea) also pose tail risks, and could have
               substantial confidence impacts that cut into global spending and activity, and cause dislocations
               in global financial markets.

offshoring in global value chains (GVCs). For host countries in Africa, the new wave of FDI not only delivers                                                                             generating

Recent research (Farole and Winkler 2014) suggests the experience in Sub-Saharan Africa on achieving
FDI spillovers has been largely disappointing. At the heart of the problem is that linkages between foreign
investors and local economies—especially through supply chains—have remained limited in Africa. But
there are some important differences hidden in the aggregate story.

First, some sectors may have greater potential for integration than others. Survey results indicate that
while foreign investors purchase virtually no inputs from domestic suppliers in the apparel sector, local
supply relationships are more extensive in mining and (not surprisingly) much more in agribusiness
(figure 6). One of the main reasons for differences across sectors (especially between mining and
apparel) relates to the sourcing strategies of foreign investors in the context of their global supply and
production networks. In the apparel sector,
local management in African host countries           Figure 6: Distribution of inputs by sourcing location

One positive feature of these findings is

better than others. While the survey sample                                 Ghana                                               87                                             13

situation, whereby generating productivity-
enhancing spillovers is dependent on having                                                             Local management                   External decisionmakers

Box 1:             a base of relatively productive firms and workers in the first place. Indeed, this is precisely what the study
Continued          finds. Results from a large cross-country regressiona show absorptive capacity is the most important
                   factor mediating productivity spillovers from FDI. More specifically, firms that are relatively large, spatially
                   clustered, export oriented, and technologically sophisticated are most likely to be affected by the presence
                   of foreign investors.

                   Thus, generating spillovers from FDI is not easy, particularly for small economies with limited existing
                   capacity. And in the context of GVC-oriented FDI, the scope for shaping and managing spillovers is
                   increasingly limited. The research suggests, however, that governments have a role to play in facilitating
                   spillovers. Much of this is long term and involves getting the “basics” of policies and institutions right, in
                   particular investing heavily in education and skills development and supporting trade and financial market
                   openness. Beyond this, however, the research suggests there are a number of things governments can do
                   to deepen linkages and support the potential for spillovers in the short to medium term. It is important to
                   note that local context should determine appropriate policies.

                   First, actions to expand supply chain and labor market linkages may be considered. One possibility is to
                   promote (although not compel) joint ventures; an important finding from the cross-country regressions
                   is that partly foreign-owned firms (joint ventures) are significantly more integrated into domestic markets
                   than fully foreign-owned firms.

                   Second, governments can help overcome information gaps around local supply capabilities and align
                   fiscal incentives used to attract foreign investors with the goals of building local supply capacity and local
                   technical skills (including some level of conditionality). Governments can also improve the environment
                   for domestic contract enforcement and other barriers to formal contracting with local suppliers. One
                   interesting finding from the survey was that local suppliers that had formal contracts with foreign investors
                   were 56 percent more likely to receive critical technical assistance from investors than those in more ad-
                   hoc supply relationships.

                   Third, government can create an environment conducive to facilitating translating linkages into spillovers.
                   An example might be incentivizing foreign investors to employ “appropriate technology”—the study
                   productivity spillovers were greater when the technology gap between foreign investors and local firms
                   was not too large. Another example might be promoting the provision of technical assistance, particularly
                   around building quality capabilities of local firms, which was shown clearly to influence the capacity and
                   performance of local suppliers.

                   Finally, the study suggests that programs to support linkages and spillovers need to take into account the
                   heterogeneity of local firms, and therefore concentrate limited resources (at least initially) on relatively
                   higher capacity, high-potential firms.

                Lower inflation supported the demand for goods and services. Due in part to lower international food
                and fuel prices, and to prudent monetary policy, inflation decelerated in the region, growing at an
                annual rate of 6.3 percent (median rate 7.7 percent) in 2013, compared with 10.7 percent (median rate
                10.4) a year ago (figure 8). Some countries, such as Ghana and Malawi, have seen an uptick in inflation
                because of depreciating currencies. Remittances to the region grew 6.2 percent to $32 billion in 2013,
                exceeding the record of $30 billion reached in 2011. These inflows, combined with lower food prices,
                boosted household real income and spending.

                The region’s export performance was adversely affected by the fall in commodity prices. With the
                exception of energy, all the key commodity price indexes declined significantly in 2013: precious metals

moderate slowdown in the second quarter. Leading growth in 2013 were destinations in Rwanda (up
13.8 percent), Zimbabwe (up 12.5 percent), the Seychelles (up 10.8 percent), and Cabo Verde (up 5.3
percent). Madagascar and Kenya, two leading destinations in the region, saw significant declines in
international tourist arrivals due to domestic events.

Fiscal deficits widened in 2013 and debt-to-GDP ratios rose across the region. The largest deterioration
of fiscal balances occurred among oil exporters and low-income countries. In Cameroon and Chad,
fiscal deficits as a share of GDP more than doubled in 2013; and in Malawi, the overall fiscal deficit
widened to about 15 percent of GDP after rising to 11.3 percent of GDP in 2012. Among middle-income
countries, Ghana’s fiscal deficit remained high at around 11 percent of GDP in 2013; in Zambia, the fiscal
deficit widened sharply in 2013, and in South Africa, the fiscal deficit is forecast to remain unchanged
at 4.2 percent of GDP in 2013/14. Ambitious public investment programs and large increases in public
wages coupled with weak revenues contributed to the deterioration of fiscal balances in many of these
countries. In Zambia, for example, the government increased civil servants’ salaries by 27 percent in

                  2013 (and the wage bill was 9.4 percent of GDP), and in Ghana the wage bill remained over 10 percent
                  of GDP in 2013.

                  The debt-to-GDP ratio for the region has risen moderately from 29 percent in 2008 to 34 percent in
                  2013. Overall, Sub-Saharan Africa’s debt ratios are lower than those for other developing regions, partly
                  because of debt cancelation under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative and the Multilateral
                  Debt Relief Initiative. The regional average, however, reflects significant differences across countries.
                  Among low-income countries, the debt-to-GDP ratio rose to an estimated 46 percent of GDP in Senegal
                  and 48 percent of GDP in Mozambique. Among middle-income countries, debt-to-GDP ratios exceeded
                  50 percent of GDP in Ghana and 90 percent of GDP in Cabo Verde in 2013, raising concerns about debt
                  sustainability going forward.

                  Fiscal policy has remained expansionary in the region even as growth has returned to precrisis levels
                  in many countries, resulting in depleted fiscal buffers and rising vulnerability to external headwinds.
                  Botswana, where fiscal consolidation has underpinned macroeconomic stability in recent years, remains
                  a notable exception. Reflecting prudent fiscal policy, the budget remained broadly balanced in 2013,
                  allowing the public debt ratio to fall to 16 percent in 2013 from 18 percent in 2012.

                  Five years after the global financial crisis, more than a third of Sub-Saharan African countries continue to
                  see both fiscal and current account balances that are weaker than at the beginning of the crisis. Resource-
                  rich countries mostly entered the crisis with large current account deficits: The median current account
                  deficit was 9.3 percent of GDP and the fiscal deficit was close to zero percent of GDP. The median value
                  for these deficits in 2013 was 6.2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Non-resource-rich countries entered
                  the crisis with current account and fiscal deficits at 8 percent and 1.8 percent of GDP, respectively. While
                  there is heterogeneity across countries, many resource-rich and non-resource-rich countries have seen
                  deterioration in their current account and fiscal balances (figure 9). In some countries such as Liberia, the

to reduce fiscal and external imbalances. At the beginning of the year, as the United States began to
taper its asset purchase program, the currencies of South Africa and other frontier market economies
came under renewed pressure (box 2). The Ghanaian cedi and Zambian kwacha depreciated sharply
against the U.S. dollar, and South Africa’s central bank hiked interest rates by 50 basis points to prop up
the rand. Monetary policy was also tightened in Ghana and Zambia as inflation worries and exchange
rate depreciations prompted their central banks to hike interest rates, by 200 basis points in the case
of Ghana and 50 basis points in the case of Zambia. In Nigeria, the central bank continued its tight
monetary policy, leaving the policy rate unchanged at 12 percent, while foreign reserves fell 11.7 percent
to $37.8 billion in March from $42.9 billion in December as the government intervened in the foreign
exchange market to support the naira.

With global financial conditions tightening, short-term capital inflows have declined significantly,
suggesting changing investor sentiment toward the region. Meanwhile, the slowdown of economic
growth in China is translating into lower industrial metal prices. For example, the price of copper, a key
export for several African countries including Zambia, has decreased by more than a third from its 2011
peak of $10,190 per ton. Falling commodity prices, an important source of export and government
revenue in many countries in the region, could exacerbate fiscal and current account deficits in these
countries, leaving their currencies vulnerable to external headwinds.

   A recent paper (Eichengreen and Gupta 2014 ) documented the effect of “tapering talk” on a large set of
   emerging markets and asked who was hit by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s tapering talk and why.a Two key
   points emerged from this study. First, there is little evidence that the countries with stronger macroeconomic
   fundamentals (smaller budget deficits, lower debts, more reserves, and stronger growth rates in the
   immediately prior period) were rewarded with smaller falls in exchange rates, foreign reserves, and stock
   prices. Second, what mattered for the emerging markets was the size of their financial markets.b Investors
   seeking to rebalance their portfolios concentrated on emerging markets with relatively large and liquid
   financial systems. These were perhaps the markets where they could most easily sell without incurring losses,
   and where there was the most scope for portfolio rebalancing. Their analysis provided an obvious contrast
   with so-called frontier markets, with smaller and less liquid financial systems. The findings were a reminder
   that success at growing the financial sector can be a mixed blessing—while easing the financing constraints
   on developing countries, it can accentuate the impact of financial shocks emanating from outside.

   A review of the changes in the nominal exchange rate during April–August 2013 for 40 African countriesc
   shows considerable heterogeneity in outcomes, with the largest exchange rate depreciation experienced
   by countries with floating exchange rates (figure 10): South Africa (10.6 percent), Ghana (8.5 percent),
   Botswana (5.4 percent), Tanzania (5.2 percent) and Kenya (3.9 percent). Overall, the exchange rate changes
   in African countries were less marked than in the sample of emerging market countries from other regions

Continued          other regions, and the proportion of such African countries was much smaller at 37 percent. The extent of
                   depreciation in African countries was smaller, as well, with average depreciation at 2.9 percent compared to
                   nearly 6 percent in emerging markets in other regions.

  The experience of the fragile 5 holds some lessons for African economies. As the frontier African
  economies attract increasingly larger amounts of capital flows in future, it is imperative for them to
  keep encouraging the flows that are considered more stable, such as FDI. They need to be aware that
  with larger capital flows comes the larger responsibility of managing them well. As the reliance of
  frontier economies on foreign capital increases, they need to implement policy frameworks that can
  handle the potential volatility in capital flows, which include their firms and banks being able to absorb
  exchange rate volatility; using a broad array of macroprudential measures to avoid appreciation of the
  real exchange rate and widening of the current account deficit in response to foreign capital inflows; and
  maintaining policy buffers in fiscal and monetary policies to respond to shocks emanating from beyond
  their borders.

  a. The analysis by Eichengreen and Gupta focused on about 50 emerging markets with little representation from the Africa region (the only African countries they included were
     Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, and South Africa.
  b. What also mattered was the real exchange rate appreciation or widening of current account deficits in the earlier period, when large amounts of capital were flowing into emerging
     markets. Financial market size is measured by total external private financing—that is, inflows of equity, bonds, and loans during 2010–12 (see Global Financial Stability Report
     [IMF 2013]).
  c. Fourteen countries had pegged their exchange rates to the euro as part of their monetary unions, the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) and the West African
     Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). Another four countries had pegged their currencies to the euro outside these unions; one adopted the U.S. dollar as its legal tender; and the
     remaining 21 countries had some kind of floating exchange rates.




Near-TERM GROWTH PROSPECTS
Despite emerging challenges, medium-term growth prospects for Sub-Saharan Africa remain favorable.
GDP growth is projected to rise to 5.2 percent in 2014 from 4.7 percent in 2013, and to strengthen to
5.4 percent in both 2015 and 2016, indicating that Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to remain one of the
fastest growing regions.

Robust domestic demand, underpinned by investment in natural resources and infrastructure and
household consumption, will continue to drive growth in most countries in the region. External
demand will also be supportive of growth in the region in view of the strengthening recovery in high-
income countries, which bodes well for export demand and investment flows. As the Federal Reserve
continues to taper its asset purchases and financial conditions in the United States and other developed


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A f r i c a’ s P u l s e      >   13
                countries tighten, capital inflows are projected to fall in the region in 2014. Countries with liquid capital
                markets and large financing requirements, notably South Africa but also frontier market countries, are
                expected to suffer a tangible impact. However, for most countries in the region, the impact of tighter
                global financing conditions is likely to be limited. This is partly because foreign direct investment, the
                dominant type of capital inflows for the region, is less sensitive to global interest rate hikes than short-
                term portfolio flows. Nevertheless, FDI flows are expected to be lower in 2014 due to weaker commodity
                prices and slower growth in emerging markets. Still, new discoveries of oil, gas, and metals are expected
                to attract substantial FDI flows into the region, which should support growth in many countries. Besides
                FDI, public investment in infrastructure, particularly in energy, roads, and ports, is also expected to
                continue to expand, especially in fragile countries, which should help boost industrial production and
                strengthen export capacity.

                Private consumption is expected to remain robust in most countries in the region during 2014–16,
                underpinned by a growing population, improving real per capita incomes, and continued price stability.
                Adequate rainfalls, improved agricultural production, and stable exchange rates are expected to help
                contain inflationary pressures in low-income countries, which should keep interest rates low. Although
                the inflation outlook is expected to remain favorable across the region, prices will trend higher due to
                droughts in some countries or pass-through from currency depreciations in others, particularly Ghana
                and South Africa. Combined with steadily rising remittances, these effects should stimulate private
                consumption and permit a robust expansion of domestic demand.

                Government consumption is expected to rise at a moderate pace. Large public sector wage bills, transfers
                and subsidies, and other recurrent expenditures for social sector projects (as governments strive to
                achieve better development outcomes) will continue to drive public expenditures in 2014. However,
                governments in many countries, including Ghana, Senegal, and Zambia, are expected to carry out fiscal
                consolidation measures in an effort to bring public expenditures down to sustainable levels and restore
                fiscal buffers.

                Net exports are expected to exert a drag on GDP growth in the region over the forecast horizon.
                Commodity prices are expected to remain subdued over the forecast period due to slowing growth in
                emerging markets, notably China. In particular, prices of copper, iron ore and oil are expected to remain
                relatively soft. The weakening of commodity prices will be particularly damaging for countries where
                output is low, such as among the oil-exporting Central African countries where production is stagnating.
                Metal-exporting countries, such as Zambia, have maintained or increased output, which should help
                mitigate the weakness of metal prices. Overall, export earnings are expected to remain depressed. On
                the import side, the demand for capital goods is projected to remain strong. Reflecting the buoyant
                growth in import demand, despite sharp currency depreciations in some cases and subdued global
                commodity prices, the current account deficit in the region is projected to increase from an estimated
                3.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to an average of 3.4 percent of GDP in 2014 and 2015.

                Regional growth will be broad based, driven by resource-rich countries, low-income countries, and

Ethiopia is expected to be among the fastest-growing countries in the region, with growth underpinned
by strong public investment in agriculture and infrastructure. In Southern Africa, tight monetary policy
combined with labor strikes and weak electricity supply will keep growth subdued in South Africa;
but despite falling copper prices, growth is expected to remain robust in Zambia as the high grades
of Zambia’s copper reserves keep production profitable and new mines open. In Angola, following a
slowdown in 2013, growth is expected to pick up in 2014, supported by a rebound in oil production and
infrastructure investment.

Within the major economies in West Africa, growth is expected to remain robust in Nigeria, supported
by the continued expansion of the nonoil sector, with growth in manufacturing, communication,
transport, and real estate remaining robust, and as agricultural production expands in response to
reforms in the sector. However, growth is expected to remain subdued in Ghana as higher domestic
interest rates and inflation weigh on demand. In francophone West Africa, growth prospects will be
affected by drought in the Sahel, where erratic rainfalls could lower agricultural production and lead to
higher food prices. Nevertheless, driven by FDI flows in the natural resource sector, increased production
from projects coming onstream, and public investment in infrastructure, growth is expected to remain
robust in many of these countries, particularly in Côte d’Ivoire.

Overall, real GDP growth in the region is expected to remain stronger than in many other developing
countries, allowing for some relative gains in real per capita incomes. Poor physical infrastructure will,
however, continue to limit the region’s growth potential. While fixed investment has increased in recent
years, a further scaling up of infrastructure spending is needed in most countries in the region if they are
to achieve a lasting transformation of their economies. The region’s infrastructure deficit is most acute
in the energy and road sectors. Across the region, unreliable electricity supply and poor road conditions
continue to impose high costs on business, reduce efficiency, and impede intraregional trade.


RISKS to the economic Outlook

The risks to the region’s outlook are mainly on the downside and include lower commodity prices
brought on by weaker growth in emerging markets; the reversal of capital flows resulting from
tightening of global monetary conditions; and domestic risks from political unrest, security problems,
and inflationary pressures.


Lower commodity prices
Weaker demand combined with increased supply could lead to a shaper decline in commodity prices
than assumed in the baseline. In particular, if Chinese demand, which accounts for about 45 percent of
total copper demand and a large share of global iron ore demand, remains weaker than in recent years
and supply continues to grow robustly, copper and iron ore prices could decline more than the baseline
presented in the outlook, with significant negative consequences for the metal-producing countries.
Monetary risks, including the normalization of monetary policy in high-income countries, should be


                                                                                               A f r i c a’ s P u l s e   >   15
                  less of a concern for metal prices. Over the years, the effect of short-term interest rates on metals has
                  been mixed and modest. The most important impact is likely to come from the weakening of industrial
                  production growth. Markedly weak Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production figures during
                  January–March suggest that China’s economy may be slowing amid the rebalancing of its growth
                  toward more reliance on demand and less on investment. A major slowdown in China’s growth and
                  weaker commodity prices would significantly weaken long-term foreign investment and growth in many
                  countries in the region.


                  Tighter monetary conditions
                  Capital flows to developing countries are expected to face headwinds in 2014 as the process of
                  normalization in global financing conditions continues. Financial market and capital flow volatility has
                  already led to sharp policy adjustments in countries in the region. A rapid and disorderly rise in interest
                  rates or pullback in capital flows remains a major concern for these countries. Simulations conducted for
                  the January 2014 Global Economic Prospects Report suggest that a sudden 100-basis-point increase in
                  U.S. bond yields, as observed in summer 2013, could be expected to lower capital inflows to developing
                  countries by about 50 percent for several months, implying a significant increase in the cost of raising
                  capital, which could lead to lower investment and growth.

                  South Africa, which has strong links with global financial markets, is particularly vulnerable to sudden
                  stops of capital inflows given its reliance on portfolio inflows to finance its current account deficit. In
                  the recent bout of financial volatility the rand depreciated sharply, prompting the central bank to hike
                  interest rates. As the recent episode of market volatility has demonstrated, frontier market countries
                  such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Zambia, which have seen significant portfolio inflows in local securities
                  markets, will also be affected by the reversal of capital flows. Similarly, countries that are planning to tap
                  the international bond markets are likely to face higher coupon rates (box 3). Countries with ongoing
                  political and economic vulnerabilities and where progress in reducing fiscal and external imbalances has
                  been slower are likely to experience greater volatility.



Box 3:            Rising global interest rates can have an impact on both public and private debt in a country through a
Global interest   number of channels: (i) direct and indirect impact on interest rates on external debt, (iii) indirect impact
rate shocks
                  on interest rates on domestic debt, and (iii) indirectly through valuation effects from exchange rate
and debt
vulnerability     shocks. Which of these channels are important for African countries depends on the structure of their debt
                  portfolio, their reliance on external or domestic financing, and their resilience to these shocks.

                  Many African countries borrow primarily on concessional terms from the main multilateral organizations.
                  These loans typically carry fixed interest rates (or predetermined charges), which means that interest rate
                  risk on these instruments is limited.a Similarly, most loans from bilateral lenders, whether from the Paris Club
                  or not, are typically but not exclusively at fixed interest rates.

                  Some countries, however, have variable-rate external public and private debt, typically on a fixed spread
                  over a market rate such as the LIBOR.b This means that any global interest rate shock is immediately
                  transmitted through these loans. Apart from Zimbabwe, which is in a special situation, Angola, Botswana,
                  Côte d’Ivoire, and South Africa have the highest levels of variable-rate external debt (figure 13).

Short-term external loans may have fixed interest rates, but since they need to be repaid fully within one
year by definition, there is always a risk that the loans need to be refinanced at a different, and possibly
higher, interest rate. Some of these loans may be trade credit, and secured against the delivery of imports
or exports, so that they do not have to be refinanced. However, to the extent that such trade flows
display a regular annual pattern, these loans will be contracted annually. The majority of external debt
in Mauritius is short-term private sector debt, amounting to 33 percent of GDP. Apart from Sudan and
Zimbabwe, short-term external debt is still around 6 to 7 percent of GDP in Benin, Ghana, São Tomé and
Príncipe, South Africa, and Tanzania.

Sovereign bonds issued on international capital markets (also called Eurobonds) typically carry a fixed
coupon payment, and mostly have a 5- to 10-year maturity. This means that, in principle, interest rate risk
is low. However, bonds are fully repaid upon maturity (bullet payment). If the borrower needs to refinance
the bond, there is a refinancing risk and an interest rate risk for the entire loan amount. Investors will
compare any new bond against safe alternatives (typically U.S. Treasuries or safe Euro area bonds), and
may demand a higher credit and liquidity premium. Although around 10 African countries have issued
Eurobonds in the last few years, only the bonds of Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa mature in
the near to medium term (2014 and 2018) (figure 14). Many of the issuers have taken advantage of the
favorable market conditions and have issued debt with maturities beyond 2018. For this reason, interest
rate shocks do not have an immediate impact, except in countries that need to refinance in the medium
term (Ghana) or are expected to issue soon (Kenya).

                Data on nonresident participation in domestic markets in Sub-Saharan Africa are difficult to find, but
                available data suggest that South Africa has the highest participation (37 percent of outstanding domestic
                debt as of 2013Q2),c while in Uganda about 10 percent of domestic debt is held by nonresidents.d
                Furthermore, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia may have significant nonresident participation.e In these
                countries, between 30 and 50 percent of domestic debt is rolled over every year.f

                Once a nonresident investor decides not to refinance Eurobonds or domestic bonds due to better
                alternatives elsewhere, this will amount to a capital outflow, and may lead to pressure on the exchange
                rate. Any subsequent exchange rate depreciation will increase the domestic currency value of the all public
                or private loans in foreign currency, and increase the effective interest paid on these loans. The main risk is
                therefore the total size of external private and public debt relative to GDP.

                A country’s resilience to absorb interest rate shocks will depend on the extent of policy buffers, such as
                having relatively low public debt, sufficient fiscal resources, sufficient foreign exchange reserves to repay
                all external debt maturing in one year, and a well-aligned exchange rate. In addition, it is also important to
                have structural resilience, such as access to multiple sources of external and domestic financing on favorable
                terms; good currency match between assets and liabilities on the government, private sector, and household
                balance sheets; and sound debt management.

                Prepared by Ralph Van Doorn:
                a. The interest rate risk is not zero. These loans typically have a long amortization (repayment) profile, and in principle each time an amortization takes place, the
                   government must choose whether to repay from the budget or refinance it. At that stage, there is both a risk that these funds are not available (refinancing
                   risk) and a risk that the interest rate may be less favorable than before (interest rate risk). However, since individual amortizations are small relative to the size
                   of the loan, interest rate and refinancing risks are small.

Domestic risks
Domestic risks associated with social and political unrest, and emerging security problems, remain a
major threat to the economic prospects of some countries in the region. In South Sudan, a ceasefire,
signed between the conflicting sides on January 23, 2014, remains tenuous, and sporadic violence
has continued to disrupt oil production. In the Central African Republic, insecurity and large-scale
displacement of persons are severely disrupting economic activity and livelihoods there. Also on the
domestic front, upcoming national elections in several countries may slow implementation of much-
needed structural reforms.

Inflationary pressures are on the rise in many countries and could weigh down domestic demand. In
2013, inflation eased in most countries in the region due to lower international fuel and food prices and
better-than-average harvests as weather conditions remained broadly favorable, which helped boost real
income and support domestic demand. Since February 2014, international food prices have risen sharply
due to drought in part of South America and tensions in Ukraine. Within Sub-Saharan Africa, strong price
pressures have emerged in several countries driven in part by large currency depreciations, as in Ghana
and Zambia, and also by unfavorable weather conditions. In francophone West Africa, drought in 2013
resulted in crop losses of up to 50 percent in parts of the Sahel region. Larger currency depreciations and
lower local harvests due to intensifying drought conditions could result in higher inflation across the
region than assumed in the baseline. This would dampen household consumption which has been an
important driver of growth in the region.


Food prices
The World Bank’s Food Price Watch reports that domestic grain price trends are mixed in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Several factors affect local prices: seasonal patterns, available supplies and prospects of upcoming
harvests, currency depreciations, and demand conditions (box 4). In Sudan, increasing demand and
currency depreciation pushed up wheat prices by 30 percent (in monitored markets) between October
2013 and January 2014. In Malawi, Mozambique, and South Africa, domestic maize prices were higher by
more than 40 percent on tighter supplies, rising fuel prices, and weaker currencies (in Malawi and South
Africa). Tanzania also saw a 26 percent increase because of lower national supplies. By contrast, wheat
and maize prices declined in Ethiopia, as the recent bumper crop boosted domestic availability. Staple
food prices remained high in Somalia and South Sudan as renewed conflict is disrupting markets in
those countries.

Fluctuations in food prices have typically exerted pressures on consumer price inflation. A non-
negligible proportion of food price volatility is attributed to seasonal factors in the production of these
commodities. Box 4 illustrates the relative weight of these seasonal factors in selected Sub-Saharan
African countries. On the other hand, food price volatility may also respond to structural factors that may
put food security at risk. The report illustrates the role of trade promotion in addressing the structural
bottlenecks in the African drylands.

food prices
                  Some seasonality in food prices is unavoidable given storage costs and the opportunity cost of capital. But
                  imperfect capital markets (inducing sell-low, buy-high behavior among liquidity-constrained households),
                  uncompetitive market structures, credit constraints for traders, and high transaction costs (e.g., due to
                  poor infrastructure) may further push up the seasonal price gaps. As domestic food markets became
                  more integrated, the topic of food price seasonality in Sub-Saharan Africa has garnered less attention by
                  researchers and policy makers.

                  Some emerging evidence, however, points to continuing high seasonality in domestic food prices in the
                  region. Using econometric time series techniques, Kaminski et al. (2014) study the domestic food price
                  evolutions over the last 7 to 12 years (2000–12) across 100 marketplaces in three eastern and southern
                  African countries (Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda) for a series of food products.a

                  Among cereals, the seasonal gap (the difference between the highest and the lowest average monthly price,
                  controlling for annual trends), is largest for wholesale maize (main staple),b ranging from about 25 percent
                  on average across markets in Uganda and Tanzania to close to 50 percent in Malawi (figure 15). The average
                  gaps are lower for rice, millet, and sorghum (around 15 to 20 percent), consistent with the larger integration
                  in international markets (rice) and better storability (millet/sorghum) (World Bank 2011b). They are generally
                  also somewhat lower for retail prices.

                  Overall, these seasonal gaps are substantial, and well above what is observed, for example, at the South
                  African Futures Exchange (SAFEX) market in Johannesburg. SAFEX is the main international market for white
                  maize consumed in southern and eastern Africa and, as such, provides a reasonable benchmark. While the
                  seasonal patterns in Tanzania and Malawi closely track the seasonal SAFEX profile (with a two-month and
                  one-month lag, respectively), the gaps in SAFEX prices are only around half those in Tanzania and less than
                  a third of that in Malawi. This suggests substantial scope for reduction in the seasonal gaps.

Using trade to promote resilience in drylands of Africa 2
Africa’s drylands regions are subject to especially high and volatile food prices, which reduce food
security. Improved trade can reduce the wedge between producer and consumer prices, increasing
the welfare of consumers in structural deficit areas where food prices are high, and of producers in
surplus areas where farm gate prices are relatively low. Furthermore, drylands areas are particularly
vulnerable to disasters (climatic and man-made) and food production shocks. Increasing integration
with larger regional markets can reduce the magnitude of the price effects from localized shocks, while
lower barriers and better trade infrastructure allow faster and more efficient response to localized food
shortages due to disasters of all types.

Trade is a necessary ingredient to resolve chronically low agricultural productivity. Technology embodied
in imported inputs—seed of improved crop varieties, fertilizer, agricultural machinery, and animal

                vaccines—would pave the way for more intensive production systems with increased productivity and
                greater sustainability (Jouanjean 2013). In addition, facilitation of trade in crops, livestock, and inputs
                brings the prospect of a significant number of new jobs in these regions, where unemployment is high.
                Jobs are created in activities all along the value chain in transporting, distributing, wholesaling, and
                retailing agricultural inputs and products.

                Notwithstanding the benefits of increased integration, markets in many drylands areas remain
                fragmented, isolated from regional and global markets. One indication of this in West Africa is that cereal
                prices differ dramatically between net producing and net consuming markets. Prices of food staples are
                much more volatile between markets on either side of a border than between markets within a country.
                This pattern of volatility suggests a very low level of trade integration among these countries.

                Several factors explain why markets in drylands are so fragmented. First, costs of transporting food
                are high relative to their low value per ton. Along key trading corridors between Burkina Faso,
                Ghana, and Benin, costs of moving maize account for approximately 59 percent of final market prices
                due to monopoly and cartel rents, irregular payments, and poor and scarce infrastructure (USAID
                2011). In some localities, poor quality or quantity of infrastructure—for example, failure to make
                “last mile” connections—creates areas with high natural production potential but low connectivity,
                reducing opportunities for efficiently and sustainably raising food production and promoting rural
                development. These “hot spots” merit consideration for future infrastructure investment.

                Second, formal direct trade barriers are also a problem. Nontariff measures pose a much more
                significant problem than tariffs. For example, traders pay as many as 40 different nontariff fees when
                traveling from Ghana to Nigeria (Keyser 2012). Ad-hoc food trade barriers imposed during times of
                crisis—especially export bans—have been a particular problem. Such barriers increase the magnitude
                of food price shocks in neighboring countries and reduce the reliability of regional suppliers. Grain
                prices in African countries are twice as volatile as in international markets (Minot 2013), largely because
                of the large-scale and unpredictable interventions in food markets. These policies expose private
                traders to huge risk, discouraging desirable arbitrage functions such as purchasing, storage, and
                transporting of grain (Jayne et al. 2010).

                Third, regulatory and “behind-the-border” policies create additional indirect trade barriers and impede
                technology flows. Unnecessary and unreasonable regulatory requirements for imported inputs have
                created small, highly fragmented markets, which is discouraging international firms from entering,
                reducing the flow of imported technologies. Instead of reforming regulations that stifle trade in inputs,
                efforts to expand input use have so far focused mainly on measures to either directly intervene in input
                marketing or provide heavy, and usually untargeted, subsidies. These measures prevent private sector
                development in input markets and crowd out more effective programs of public expenditure (see Jayne
                and Rashid 2013, for an overview).

Several options are available to reduce trade barriers and promote market integration in input and
commodity markets of Africa’s drylands region. These include reforming regulations to integrate markets
and facilitate technology flows; reducing or eliminating nontariff measures; improving national data
systems to provide governments with information to make decisions based on transparent rules and
evidence; continuing to address trade liberalization through regional economic communities (RECs), but
also use other vehicles; understanding and facilitating informal trade; and upgrading roads, reducing
border-crossing costs, and increasing border crossings.

                Section 2: Patterns of Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa

                   u	The  economies of Sub-Saharan Africa grew at a strong pace of 4.5 percent a year on average during
                       1995-2013, amid broad-based growth, but per capita income growth was modest at around 2 percent.
                   u	GDP    growth (median annual rate) was nearly four times higher in the region’s fast-growing countries
                       than in slow-growing ones. Among best performers, resource-rich and non-resource-rich countries
                       had comparable growth rates.
                   u	For  both fast- and slow-growing countries, economic activity was supported by a robust increase in
                       domestic investment: Gross capital formation (per capita) increased at an annual rate of 6.1 percent
                       among fast-growing countries and 3.1 percent for countries with weak growth.
                   u	The    resources and services sectors have gained output share in the structural change in Sub- Saharan
                       Africa’s best performers: The share of the resources sector rose from 9 percent during 1995-99 to 12.5
                       percent during 2007-11, while that of the services sector grew from 40 percent to 47 percent. The
                       shares of manufacturing and agriculture declined.
                   u	The   contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) to per worker output growth is relatively larger
                       in Sub- Saharan Africa’s best performers than in fast-growing developing countries elsewhere; the
                       region’s slow-growing countries show negative TFP growth throughout the period.
                   u	The pace of expansion in recent growth spurts in the region has been faster and less volatile than in
                       earlier periods and higher than in takeoffs in other developing countries; output expansions are larger
                       and more volatile during takeoffs in the region’s resource-rich countries than in non-resource-rich ones.
                   u	Export   diversification has been limited, mirroring sectoral shifts in the region’s economies, but there
                       has been substantial progress in diversifying trading partners.




                ECONOMIC GROWTH TRENDS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
                The recent economic performance in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been remarkable. Real GDP in the
                region grew 4.5 percent per year during 1995–2013, and the benefits from this surge were broad based,
                since they were reaped not only by resource-rich countries but also by non-resource-rich low-income
                countries. Economic activity grew 4.8 percent in the region in 2013 and is projected to increase at an
                average annual rate of about 5.4 percent during 2014–16 (see section 1).

                The sustained growth in Sub-Saharan Africa since the mid-1990s has raised real income per capita to
                levels that surpassed the 1976 peak (figure 17).1 Moreover, income per capita of the region relative to the
                Euro area appears to have stopped sliding at the start of the 2000s and to have slightly improved over
                the last decade—most notably, among the region’s fast-growing countries (figure 18).2 The improved
                economic performance of Sub-Saharan Africa since 1995 was partly attributed to generally benign
                external factors and progress in macroeconomic management (see Hostland and Giugale 2013).


                1	 It has taken the region nearly three decades to surpass the previous peak in income levels.
                2	 Growth deceleration has become less frequent in Sub-Saharan Africa, declining from 29 percent during 1975–94 to 12 percent during 1995–2005. The frequency of growth accelerations
                   increased, however, from 14 to 42 percent over the same time period (Arbache and Page 2009).

has been comparable to that of developing
countries outside the region (4.4 percent), and has been outperformed only by East Asia and the Pacific
(5.1 percent). The growth surge in the region was broad based: The region’s resource-rich countries grew
at 5 percent per year during 1995–2012, while non-resource-rich countries grew at an average annual
rate of 4 percent (figure 19).

Real GDP growth in Sub-Saharan Africa was supported by robust domestic demand—particularly, higher
household consumption and (private and public) investment; in fact, gross capital formation increased
at an annual rate of 6.8 percent. Domestic investment in 2012 was nearly triple the 1995 level. In contrast
to other developing areas, investment in the region continued growing throughout the 2008–09 crises,

                  throughout the region, although to different degrees. The cumulative growth in output per capita of the
                  region is comparable to that of Latin America and the Caribbean and lags the performance of real GDP
                  per capita of developing countries outside of the region (3.3 percent) or East Asia and the Pacific (3.8
                  percent). Figure 21 shows that there is heterogeneity in the growth performance of Africa across different
                  subgroups. For instance, median annual expansion of output per capita is faster among resource-rich
                  countries in the region (2.6 percent) when compared to non-resource-rich countries (1.7 percent), and is
                  even slower among fragile countries (1.2 percent).

                  The growth of real economic activity in Africa was robust over the last two decades. Yet, it is evident
                  that there are differences in the growth experiences of countries. Output expanded faster in some
                  countries and country groups than in others. Country characteristics associated to the structure of

or starting to experience a surge in
economic activity during the last two
decades. From this sample, we identify five oil exporters (Angola, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, and
Sudan) and eight nonoil resource-abundant countries (Botswana, Ghana, Liberia, Mozambique, Namibia,
Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Zambia). Nine non-resource-rich countries in the region experienced growth
spurts (Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, The Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Rwanda, and Uganda). Takeoffs in growth per capita also took place among fragile countries although, as
expected, they tend to be relatively shorter in duration (or started later).4

Table 1 depicts the median growth rate from 1995 to 2012 for the fast-growing developing countries
compared to slow-growing countries. Within each group, the performance of Sub-Saharan Africa
compared to developing countries outside the region is benchmarked, and African countries are also
distinguished according to their degree of natural resource abundance. The representative fast-growing
country in Africa grew at the same pace as that of the median country in the developing world outside
the region, but slower than the fast-growing countries in the latter group.5 The best performers in Africa
registered a median annual growth rate of 3.3 percent per year (lower than the 3.9 percent of the best
developing country performers outside Sub-Saharan Africa). In contrast, the slow-growing countries in
the region were able to grow at a median annual rate of 0.9 percent during 1995–2012.


3	 It is likely that we may be able to identify two close episodes of rapid growth in one country using this algorithm. We will consider these two episodes as one when (a) the decline in real
   output per capita between them is lower than 1 percent, (b) the annual average growth in both episodes exceeds 3.5 percent, or (c) the annual average growth in the joint single episode
   exceeds 3.5 percent. In addition, we have considered countries with long-lasting expansions (more than 10 years) that had growth per capita greater than 3 percent and GDP growth
   during that period exceeding 5 percent per year.
4	 The criteria used to distinguish fast-growing from slow-growing nations has also been used in Bluedorn et al. (2013) and IMF (2013). Bluedorn et al. (2013) points out that the threshold
   of 3.5 percent per year has been used in studies such as Hausmann, Pritchett, and Rodrik (2005) and Johnson, Ostry, and Subramanian (2007), and corresponds to the 60th percentile
   of growth in output per capita in all emerging market and developing countries over the last two decades. In our sample, the 3.5 percent per year threshold corresponds to the 67th
   percentile of the distribution of growth per capita among non-high-income countries during 1995–2012.
5	 Simple averages indicate that Sub-Saharan Africa grew 6.6 percent annually during 1995–2012, with resource-rich countries growing at an average annual rate of 7.4 percent and non-
   resource-rich countries at 5.5 percent. The larger size of the unweighted average growth (relative to the median and weighted average) denotes the remarkable performance of small
   (resource and nonresource) countries in the region.

                    Note: The data on real GDP per capita and the aggregate demand components are expressed in U.S. dollars at 2005 constant prices. All variables are in per capita terms.
                    The criteria used to classify fast-growing countries comprises: a) expansionary episodes of more than 5 years, and b) growth per year that exceeds 3.5 percent in each episode.




                Growth patterns in Sub-Saharan Africa: Domestic-demand driven or outward oriented?
                The evolution of aggregate demand components—household consumption, domestic investment,
                government consumption, exports and imports—during 1995–2012 helps to assess whether growth in
                Sub-Saharan Africa countries was supported by domestic demand or net exports and how different were
                the experience of fast and slow growers and of resource-rich and non-resource-rich countries. Figure 22
                shows the cumulative growth over the period for African countries with strong and weak growth, and for
                fast-growing natural-resource-abundant countries and non-resource-rich countries in the region.

                Regardless of whether growth was strong or weak among African countries, real economic activity was
                supported by a robust increase in domestic investment. Gross capital formation (per capita) increased at
                an annual rate of 6.1 percent among fast-growing countries in the region and 3.1 percent for countries
                with weak growth per capita. In addition, exports and imports had a predominant role in explaining
                growth performance of the best performers in the developing world. In most cases, imports tended
                to outgrow exports, thus, either widening trade deficits or shifting trade surpluses into deficits in most
                developing countries. For instance, imports grew slightly faster than that of exports during 1995–2012
                (6.1 and 6 percent per year, respectively). However, the growth differential between imports and exports
                was much larger for resource-rich countries (8.5 and 6.4 percent per year, respectively).

                Sectoral contribution to growth performance in Sub-Saharan Africa
                The behavior of different sectors of economic activity during the last two decades is examined in order
                to identify the sectors of economic activity that grew faster among Sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of
                the developing world. This analysis is done at two different levels: first the major sectors of economic
                activity—agriculture, manufacturing, resources, and services—are reviewed. Then, we look more deeply
                into the dynamics of both the industry sector—namely, manufacturing, construction, mining and
                quarrying, and electricity, gas, and water—and the services sector—that is, banking, wholesale and retail
                trade, and transportation, storage, and telecommunications.

                Figure 23 focuses on the output growth of major sectors of economic activity and the evolution of
                their shares of GDP for fast-growing countries during 1995–2012.6 Growth among fast-growing nations
                (whether they are African or outside the region) was broad based. All types of activity had positive
                growth, although there are some differences in their pace. For Sub-Saharan African countries, the
                resources and the services sectors were the best performers—increasing at annual rates of 7.2 and 6
                percent per year, respectively. Moreover, those two sectors also experience an increase in their share to
                GDP over the last two decades: the share of the resources sector went from 9 percent during 1995–99
                to 12.5 percent during 2007–11, while the share of the services sector grew from 40 percent during
                1995–99 to 47 percent during 2007–11. Correspondingly, the shares of manufacturing and agriculture in
                the region (sectors with the slowest growth over the last two decades) declined.

                For developing countries outside the region, the analysis shows that the resources and services
                sectors also exhibit the largest median growth rates per year during 1995–2012 (5.2 and 5.3 percent,
                respectively); however, they increased at a slower pace than that of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                In contrast to countries in the region, the rest of the developing world has a larger services and
                manufacturing sector. The former increases its share even more (from 53 percent of GDP during 1995–99
                to 58.5 percent of GDP during 2007–11), while the importance of manufacturing in total value added
                decreases from 18 to 16 percent. In both groups of countries, the share of agriculture in total GDP
                declines from 13 to 9 percent among fast-growing developing nations and from 36 to 29 percent in Sub-
                Saharan Africa over the same period.

                Figure 24 examines the subsectors within resources and services that may explain the growing share
                of GDP of these sectors among the fast-growing countries during 1995–2012. Within the resources
                sector, construction and mining and quarrying vastly outperform gas, electricity, and water (as well as
                manufacturing). Construction expanded over the period at an annual rate of 8.5 percent, while mining
                and quarrying grew 7.2 percent per year. Among developing countries outside the region, it is the gas,
                electricity, and water sector that outperforms all other activities within the resources sector (it grew at
                an annual rate of 5.1 percent), closely followed by construction (4.9 percent). Finally, the infrastructure
                sector (transport, storage, and telecommunications) drove the rising participation of the services sector
                in economic activity among fast-growing developing countries. It grew 7.2 percent per year among
                fast-growing Sub-Saharan African countries and 6.2 percent per year among fast-growing developing
                countries outside the region.

                6	 We also conducted our analysis for slow-growing countries. Although we do not report these results, we will describe some of their features if relevant to our discussion.

                The analysis of the sectoral composition of Africa’s growth finds that rapid growth has shifted the
                structure of African economies (i.e., sector shares in GDP): The relative size of agriculture in GDP has
                shrunk, as has that of manufacturing, while the share of the resources and services sectors has grown.
                Indeed, the region’s share of manufacturing in GDP is less than half the average for developing countries
                Page (2014). These trends are also reflected in the region’s continuing reliance on primary commodity
                exports (see below). Clearly, Sub-Saharan Africa’s pattern of structural change is divergent from that of
                fast-growing East Asian countries, where structural change was led by manufacturing, with the share of
                this sector in total output rising at a fast pace (McMillan and Rodrik 2011; Rodrik 2013).

                Analysis of a subset of 11 African countries by de Vries, Timmer, and de Vries (2013) shows that
                between1990 and 2010, the sectoral share of employment in Sub-Saharan Africa shifted as well,
                declining in agriculture and rising in services. The employment share of market services—distribution
                and retail trade—rose especially sharply. The change in shares essentially represents a shift from
                a low-productivity activity to a slightly higher-productivity activity (much of the services sector
                continues to be characterized by informality).7 While the size of the resources sector has increased
                in African countries, the potential of this sector to absorb workers is small (the extractives sector has
                high productivity, but it is very capital intensive). Moreover, the backward linkages of this sector are
                small as well. Overall, economic transformation characterized by a reallocation of resources from low-
                productivity activities such as agriculture into the modern, high-productivity sector has not taken place
                in Sub-Saharan Africa’s growth boom. Several recent studies—the 2014 African Transformation Report,
                de Vries, Timmer, and de Vries (2013), McMillan and Rodrik (2011), Rodrik (2013), and Page (2014)—have
                highlighted the issue of Africa’s growth without structural transformation.

Expansions in Sub-Saharan Africa: Capital deepening or productivity growth?
The sectoral drivers of economic performance may differ across different groups of countries within
the region. For instance, surges in the resources sector (most notably, construction and mining and
quarrying) have driven economic performance in the fast-growing countries, whereas that role may have
been played by the services sector in fast-growing developing countries outside the region (say, gas,
electricity and water, and banking). The analysis investigates whether the expansion has been supported
by higher capital formation or enhanced total factor productivity growth, or both (box 5). In addition,
it assesses whether TFP growth behavior is related to the sectors driving the growth spurts in Africa.

Figure 25 depicts the contribution of capital stock and TFP to (median annual) growth of real GDP per
worker during 1995–2012 for developing countries and Sub-Saharan African countries. By construction,
stronger growth in output per worker is registered by fast-growing countries compared to slow-
growing ones. Interestingly, the results show that (a) slow-growing countries show negative TFP growth
throughout the period; and (b) TFP plays a larger role in fast-growing countries, and its contribution
is relatively larger among fast-growing countries in the region.8 Finally, resource-rich countries in the
region outperform non-resource-rich ones in terms of output per worker growth, and the contribution of
TFP is clearly more significant in the former group.

8	 Moreover, we also conducted an analysis of growth accounting in the Africa region over the last two decades that included the evolution of human capital. The stock of human capital was
   computed as the weighted average of the share of population that attained and/or completed the different levels of education (primary, secondary and tertiary). The weights correspond
   to the returns to education computed by Psacharopoulos (1994). The inclusion of human capital reduces our regional sample to 32 countries in the region, of which 15 are fast-growing
   and 17 are slow-growing countries. In spite of the reduced number of countries, the analysis still finds positive TFP growth for the fast-growing African countries (mainly explained by the
   surges in TFP of fast-growing resource-rich nations) and negative TFP growth throughout the period among slow-growing countries in the region.

                Figure 26 shows that adjusted net savings have been negative in Sub-Saharan Africa since 2004, which
                means that the region’s growth is being accompanied by a depletion of total wealth. In fact, the gap
                between gross and net savings has increased by 31 percent over the last two decades. The declining
                trend in the region’s adjusted net savings over the last two decades has been driven mostly by large
                negative savings in oil-rich countries such as Angola, which had an adjusted net savings of -23 percent of

                 Growth Spurts in Sub-Saharan Africa
                 Several African countries have experienced episodes of rapid and sustained growth, that is, growth
                 spurts. Growth spurts are defined as trough-to-peak phases of the cycle in real output per capita that
                 have a duration of at least five years and that the peak of the current expansion is greater than that of
                 the previous one. In addition, the depth of this spurt, as measured by the growth of real output per
                 capita per year, is greater than 3.5 percentage points. The troughs and peaks in real GDP per capita are
                 obtained by implementing the Bry-Boschan algorithm.9



                 9	 Empirical applications of the Bry-Boschan algorithm using annual data to characterize expansions in economic activity and growth spurts can be found in Harding (2002), Abiad et al.
                    (2012), and Bluedorn et al. (2013). See Annex I for more details.

Identifying growth spurts
Growth in real GDP per capita has been higher and less volatile among Sub-Saharan African countries;
however, there is still some degree of heterogeneity across countries. When comparing the performance
of countries during 1995–2012 to 1974–94, 32 out of 44 countries in the region registered a higher
growth rate, and the average increase in the growth rate for those countries is nearly 50 basis points per
year. In terms of growth volatility, it declined in the latter period for 28 out of 44 countries in the region,
and growth volatility during 1995–2012 was approximately 0.6 times that of 1974–94.

In line with the results outlined in the previous paragraph, Arbache and Page (2009) show that the
frequency of growth decelerations during 1995–2005 declined relative to 1975–94 while, more
important, that of growth accelerations increased. Specifically, they found that the share of country-
years of growth acceleration in the region increased from 14 percent during 1975–94 to 42 percent
during 1995–2005. They also find that growth accelerations were three times as frequent as growth
decelerations during the latter period, and that the annual average growth rate during these episodes
was nearly 3.8 percent.10 Recent research also shows that some of the fastest-growing countries in
the region during 1995–2012 are non-resource-rich low-income countries (IMF 2013). It is argued that
these countries grew thanks to a combination of sound macroeconomic policies and sensible structural
reforms.11

 One of the stylized facts of the growth experienced in the region is that many countries are
experiencing an ongoing growth spurt or have managed to engineer one during 1995–2012. Table 2 lists
all (ongoing and new) growth spurts experienced by Sub-Saharan African countries during 1995–2012.
As can be seen, the occurrence of growth spurts has been broad based: not only have countries that are
abundant in natural resources experienced takeoffs in real output per capita, but so have countries that
have specialized in non-resource-based sectors and fragile countries. Most of the growth spurts in Africa
were still evolving as of 2012.

Figure 27 looks at the incidence of growth spurts in the developing world and in Sub-Saharan
Africa during 1995–2012. The likelihood of a country having a growth spurt during 1995–2012 was
monotonically increasing from the late 1990s; however, that frequency declined sharply after the 2008–
09 global financial crisis. Despite this decline, the share of country-year episodes that were taking place
in Sub-Saharan Africa increased from 25 to 40 percent. This implies that growth spurts in the region
continued uninterrupted throughout the crisis. When looking at the incidence of spurts across African
countries, it is observed that the incidence of spurts among resource-rich countries was higher during
2002–08 (12 to 13 countries), thus coinciding with the super cycle of commodity prices.




10	 Moreover, Arbache and Page (2009) find that resource-rich countries were more likely to have a growth acceleration than non-resource-rich countries in the region (51 percent compared
    to 38 percent).
11	 The non-resource-rich lower-income countries identified by the IMF (2013) report are Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. These countries are also
    identified according to our algorithm as fast growing.

   Note: The figure depicts the number of countries experiencing growth spurt episodes each year from 1990 to 2012. The data on real GDP per capita used to compute these spurts are
   expressed in U.S. dollars at 2005 prices.




Main features of growth spurts
The application of the algorithm to identify growth spurts renders 23 ongoing and new episodes in
Sub-Saharan Africa during 1995–2012, of which 13 episodes correspond to resource-rich countries and
9 to non-resource-rich countries. For developing countries outside the region, 53 ongoing and new
episodes of growth spurts are identified. Table 3 summarizes the main characteristics of these takeoffs
in per capita growth for countries in the region and other developing countries.

The average duration of growth spurts among fast-growing Sub-Saharan African countries and fast-
growing developing countries is relatively similar (13.4 and 13.3 years, respectively). Moreover, spurts
in output per capita tend to last longer among non-resource-rich countries (15.2 years) than among
resource-rich countries (nearly 12.3 years). During the 23 takeoffs experienced in Africa, the average
growth per year was approximately 6 percent—greater than the 5.2 percent per year during takeoffs
among other developing countries. Comparing spurts among resource-rich and non-resource-rich
countries in the region, the former group grows at a faster pace (6.8 percent per year compared to 4.8
percent), but their growth is more volatile (table 3).

                Dynamics of output per capita along expansionary periods
                The trajectory of real output per capita during the first decade of the trough-to-peak phase of the
                cycle associated to growth spurts is investigated to see how it is associated with (i) the behavior of the
                components of aggregate demand, (ii) the behavior of GDP by sector of activity, and (iii) the dynamics
                of output and capital stock per worker and total factor productivity. The comparative analysis focuses
                on growth spurts in developing countries and Sub-Saharan Africa, and in the case of the latter, also
                distinguishes between resource and non-resource-abundant countries.

                Real output per capita grows at the same pace for fast-growing countries in the region and among
                developing countries outside the region. Growth takeoffs in non-resource-abundant Sub-Saharan African
                countries, however, are steeper than among fast-growing developing countries. In fact, real output per
                capita grows at an annual rate of 4.14 percent from the previous peak in non-resource-rich countries
                in the region, which is slightly higher than fast-growing developing countries outside the region (4.06
                percent per year). These countries also outperform resource-rich African countries, which grew 3.6
                percent per year.

Figure 28 depicts the cumulative growth rate of the different components of aggregate demand
along the growth spurts for the developing world and Sub-Saharan Africa. A sharp boost in domestic
investment and growth of imports that outpace exports appear to characterize the path of fast-
growing developing countries outside the region. In the case of Sub-Saharan Africa, the fast pace of
real economic activity is supported by a sharp increase in (private and public) domestic investment and
balanced growth of exports and imports. Gross capital formation along the first decade of the spurt
grew 6.9 percent per year among African countries, while average annual growth in exports and imports
exceeded 6 percent.

However, while the increase in domestic investment along the spurt was faster in resource-rich than
in non-resource-rich countries (8.2 and 5.1 percent per year, respectively), the growth of exports
outperforms that of imports in the latter group. That is, non-resource-rich countries either reduced
their current account deficits or moved into surplus along the spurt, while the opposite was the case
for resource-rich countries. In non-resource-rich countries, countries like Burkina Faso saw their current
account deficits narrow from -15 to -5 percent of GDP over the last decade. Among resource-rich
countries, some oil and nonoil producers experienced a deterioration of their current accounts. For
instance, Sudan widened its current account deficit from -3.6 percent of GDP in 1995 to -11 percent of
GDP in 2012, while Ghana’s deficit over the same period increased from -2 to -12 percent of GDP.

                 During the last two decades of economic performance in Africa, growth was also broad based across
                 all sectors, although there is some degree of heterogeneity in growth across sectors. Figure 29 shows
                 the evolution of the sector shares during spurts. Growth in the developing world (excluding African
                 countries) has occurred with greater shares in the resources and services sectors and declining shares
                 in both agriculture and manufacturing. In the Africa region, a resources sector boom occurring at the
                 expense of all other sectors was the norm.

                 Zooming in on the different subsectors within the resources sector shows that the resources sector
                 increase in the developing world was predominantly driven by a boom in the construction sector and
                 higher growth in gas, electricity, and water. For Sub-Saharan Africa, the boom in the resources sector
                 is explained by the surge in mining and quarrying (11.6 percent per year during the first decade of the
                 spurt) and construction (9.9 percent per year). The boom in mining and quarrying might be, in turn,
                 attributed to favorable international prices of oil, metals, and minerals, and to rising foreign investment
                 in extractives industries of the region (figure 30). Finally, banking and transportation, storage, and
                 telecommunications explain the rising share of the services sector among developing countries outside
                 the region, while the share of services in the region remains almost invariant during the first decade of
                 the spurt, despite the increase in the infrastructure sector. Along their corresponding growth spurts, the
                 share of services in Cabo Verde has increased from 72 to 74 percent of GDP, while that of Tanzania has
                 fluctuated around 42 and 47 percent, and in Zambia it has dropped from 50 to 43 percent. In most of
                 these cases, the importance of banking and the infrastructure declined while that of wholesale and retail
                 trade increased.

Finally, the paths of real output per worker, capital stock per worker, and TFP along growth spurts are
depicted in figure 31. In the developing world, GDP per worker grew at an average annual rate of 3.3
percent during the first decade of the spurt, with capital deepening and TFP growth contributing equally
to the boost in output per worker. Average annual growth of GDP per worker among African countries
was faster during the spurt (3.5 percent per year), however, and the contribution of TFP growth was
relatively larger than that of capital deepening (1.9 and 1.6 percent per year, respectively).

The pace of growth in labor and TFP is different when comparing resource-rich and non-resource-rich
countries in the Africa region. Real output per worker grew faster among resource-rich countries (4.3
compared to 2.6 percent per year), and TFP growth explains more than half of the surge in economic
growth in this group of countries (2.3 percent per year or 54 percent of the variation in output per
worker). For non-resource-rich countries, TFP growth was positive although slower (1 percent per year). It
can be argued that the faster dynamics in output and productivity among resource-rich countries can be
attributed to the technological and know-how diffusion embedded in foreign investment in extractive
industries. For non-resource-rich African countries, the lower TFP growth would be associated to the shift
in economic activity to activities in the services sector that have low productivity (say, the wholesale and
retail trade sector).

                 GROWTH AND TRADE PATTERNS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
                 Sub-Saharan Africa’s largely resource-based growth has had implications for structural change in the
                 region’s economies and patterns of export growth. An important issue here is whether African countries’
                 growth has been accompanied by a diversification of exports away from primary commodities.


                 Pattern of export growth: Same exports, new partners
                 Sub-Saharan Africa’s exports grew at a robust pace, driven by the region’s natural resources. During
                 1995–2012, the region’s total exports increased from $68 billion to over $400 billion, or at an annual
                 rate of 11 percent (figure 32). Most of this increase came from natural resources export. For example,
                 petroleum, minerals, and metals exports ballooned from $38 billion to $300 billion during this period.
                 Petroleum exports (fuel and gas) alone accounted for over half of the exports in 2012. While high
                 commodity prices have helped the region in recent years, the heavy reliance on resource-based exports
                 also makes the region highly vulnerable to the shocks in commodity prices—as has been observed
                 during 2009 and to some extent in 2012.

The region’s manufacturing exports are also growing, albeit at a much slower rate. During 1995–2012,
manufacturing exports quadrupled from $7 billion to over $29 billion—an average annual growth rate
of about 8 percent, below that of total merchandise exports. Consequently, the share of manufacturing
exports in total merchandise exports has declined over the last 10 years, and at 7 percent is well below
the 1995 level of 10 percent (table 4). The region lags all other developing regions in the relative size of
its manufacturing exports: The share is one-sixth of that in South Asia and one-tenth of that in East Asia
and the Pacific.

                    Export diversification remains a difficult challenge for many African countries, particularly oil exporters.
                    Oil-exporting countries rely heavily on a single commodity as their revenue source. For example, Angola,
                    Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Nigeria received, on average, more than 92 percent of their exports
                    earnings (as a share of total merchandise exports) from oil during 2010–13. Although, the export revenue
                    share from minerals and metals may not be as high as that from oil, it is still high for some nonoil
                    resource-rich countries—Botswana, Guinea, Mauritania, and Sierre Leone—with earnings more than 50
                    percent of their revenue from natural resources. In 2012, oil-rich Sub-Saharan African countries had the
                    highest degree of export concentration (index of 0.68) in the region, and the extent of concentration
                    has deepened since 1995. The export concentration index is considerably lower for both the nonoil
                    resource-rich country group (index of 0.48) and the non-resource-rich country group (0.38), and the
                    degree of contentration has declined since 1995 (figure 33).

                    Some countries have had success in diversifying exports. An example is Uganda. The country’s export
                    diversification has been driven by an increase in nontraditional exports such as flowers, fresh fruits
                    and vegetables, and fresh and frozen fish. Diversification of exports was helped by policy measures

                    drop in coffee prices, which encouraged producers to switch to other sectors; diverse initiatives from
                    international donors; and regional integration and pacification of neighboring countries, which opened
                    opportunities in new markets. Tanzania also saw major increases in and diversification of output and
                    exports. The production and export of traditional agricultural cash crops (such as cashew nuts, coffee,
                    cotton, tea, sisal, and tobacco) declined considerably in importance. As a result, output concentration
                    decreased quickly. The geographic distribution of Tanzania’s exports also changed considerably over the
                    last decade. The European Union (EU) decreased in importance, while regional trade, especially with the
                    East African Community (EAC) and South Africa, increased.

Although Sub-Saharan Africa’s merchandise exports have remained concentrated in a few commodities,
the region’s countries have made substantial progress in diversifying their trading partners. Over the
last decade, exports to emerging markets such as the BRICs—Brazil, Russia, India, China—have grown
robustly, primarily due to the prolonged boom in commodities demand. The BRICs received only 9
percent of Sub-Saharan Africa’s exports in 2000 but accounted for 34 percent of total exports a decade
later (figure 34). Total exports to the BRICs surpassed the region’s exports to the European Union (EU)
market in 2010 and continue to grow. In 2012, the region’s exports to the BRICs reached $145 billion.
China alone accounted for about a quarter (23.3 percent) of the region’s total merchandise exports. Of
course, this shift in trading partners also underscores the region’s vulnerability to any slowdown in the
BRICs, namely China.

Trade in services – An untapped growth area
Globalization of services is a potentially important source of growth for developing countries. Recent
studies (Ghani, Goswami, and Kharas 2011; Goswami and Saez 2014) point to several favorable trends
that support this view: services trade is the fastest-growing sector within global trade; the share of
modern services in total services trade is rising; and the share of developing countries in world service
exports has been rising. Technology and outsourcing are enabling traditional services to overcome
their old constraints such as physical and geographic proximity. Modern services, such as software
development, call centers, and outsourced business processes, can be traded like value-added,
manufactured products, enabling developing countries that focus on such services, innovation, and
technology to leverage services as an important driver of economic growth.

                    Has Sub-Saharan Africa tapped this potential? At over $50 billion, the region’s services exports trail
                    all other developing regions; however, these exports are expanding annually at about 12 percent, on
                    average. Traditional services (such as transportation and travel) have recorded a decline from 73 percent
                    of total services exports in 2005 to less than 64 percent in 2012, while modern services in the region
                    have increased their share by nearly 10 percentage points over the same period, from just over 26
                    percent of total services exports to about 36 percent (figure 35).

Annex I. Detecting Turning Points with Annual Data
Applying the Bry-Boschan algorithm to annual data is straightforward (Harding 2002). The calculus rule
that > (<) 0 to the right (left) of a local peak (trough) provides a starting point to identify turning points
in a series. Moreover, macroeconomic series are recorded at discrete intervals and typically are not
continuous functions of time. Hence, we require a discrete analog of the calculus rule. For annual data,
the rule for locating turning points becomes:

   Peak in real GDP at time t if:
   Trough in real GDP at time t if: .

We apply the calculus rule specified above to annual data on real GDP per capita for a wide array of
countries.

We characterize the different phases of the cycle in real output per capita, that is, recessions and
expansions. The main features of these phases are defined as follows:

u	The duration of the cycle is computed as the number of years from peak to trough during
   contraction episodes and from trough to the next peak in an expansionary phase.
u	The amplitude of the cycle is calculated as the maximum drop of GDP from peak (trough) to trough
   (peak) during episodes of contraction (expansion).
u	The slope of each phase is calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of the peak-to-trough (trough-to-
   peak) phase of the cycle to its duration.
