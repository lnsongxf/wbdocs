	    BOX 1.1    WHAT IS VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS?

     The United Nations defines violence against women as “any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical,
     sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether
     occurring in public or in private life.”

     Violence can occur in different phases of a woman’s life. It can start even before birth, with sex-selective abortion; throughout a girl’s
     childhood, with increased female child mortality, child abuse, female genital mutilation, child marriage and trafficking; and in adulthood,
     with intimate partner violence, marital rape, and honor killings.

	                  BOX 1.2    HARMFUL PRACTICES: EARLY AND FORCED MARRIAGE—A CASE FROM SOUTH AFRICA

                   A common practice in South Africa, the Ukuthwala, is the custom of abducting girls for the purpose of marriage, sometimes with permission
                   of their family. A criminal case in 2014 brought the practice to light again, involving a 28-year-old man who abducted and subsequently
                   abused a 14-year-old girl after paying bride price to her family. Under the South African Marriage Act of 1961, a girl can be married at 15
                   with parental consent.

                   However, the South African Sexual Offenses Act criminalizes marital rape. While the man could not face penalties for child marriage, he
                   was declared guilty of rape, human trafficking, and assault, in the first ukuthwala-based conviction in the region. The High Court of South
                   Africa ruled that the man used unlawful sexual coercion to subdue an under-age girl who did not consent to the marriage. The case shows
                   progress in curtailing such practices, but highlights the need to remove exceptions to the legal age of marriage, pass comprehensive
                   legislation protecting girls from early marriage, and criminalize rape within marriage.

     Rape is a legally recognized crime across the world. However, when it                 RAPING THEIR WIVES
     involves husband and wife, criminal codes still have different approaches to
     addressing it as a sexual offense, largely due to historical and cultural views.      Is the husband exempt from facing criminal penalties for rape?

     Historically, a man could not be prosecuted for raping his wife. The common
     law “marital rape exemption” dates back to 1736, when English jurist                                                                     Yes 35%

                                                                                                                                    16

     contract, the wife [has] given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which
     she cannot retract.”
                                                                                                           30
     This English common law concept became enshrined in criminal codes
     worldwide. The United States Model Penal Code, drafted in the 1950s,
     for example, maintained that “retaining the spousal exclusion avoids [an]             No 65%

	    BOX 1.4    BEYOND THE LAW: ISSUES OF IMPLEMENTATION

     In a marital rape case in Argentina in 2013, the Court, taking into account the cultural background of the spouses, found the accused
     not guilty of sexually assaulting his wife. The Court considered, in support of the decision, that in their culture and country, women are
     commonly abused and are expected to have sexual intercourse with their husbands.

     In a case in Nicaragua in 2011, the Supreme Court reduced the husband’s penalty for marital rape, based on the fact that he was drunk
     when the offense was committed and for considering that the victim cooperated in the execution of the crime. Nonetheless, greater
     equality in society can also affect judicial decisions in setting precedent toward progress. In 2013, the High Court of the Solomon Islands
     struck down the marital rape exemption based on constitutional equality provisions.

	    BOX 1.5    PROTECTING VICTIMS FROM ECONOMIC VIOLENCE

     Economic abuse is a particularly prevalent form of domestic violence, and financial and economic constraints compel many women to
     remain in abusive relationships. Because perpetrators may use financial vulnerability to control their victims, protection orders evicting
     partners but leaving the victim without financial recourse are neither adequate nor effective.

     A disproportionate number of complaints are withdrawn because of economic dependency. Moreover, when victims are economically
     dependent or there is a child involved, it is more likely that protection orders will be breached by both parties if the issues are
     not addressed.

     Protection orders should provide for monetary relief, including financial assistance to the survivor in the form at least of payment of
     medical costs and shelter fees. The perpetrator’s financial obligations should also include monetary compensation and mortgage, rent,
