1       Introduction


It is notoriously diﬃcult to study labor market discrimination. In recent years, a large literature

has emerged in which researchers send ﬁctitious resumes to estimate discrimination along many

characteristics including race, gender, age, and sexual orientation (for recent reviews see Bertrand

and Duﬂo (2016); Neumark (2016); Rich (2014)). While these correspondence studies have important

advantages over observational and audit studies, they can only be used for select types of vacancies

(Pager (2007)) and have several methodological limitations (Heckman (1998)).


In particular, audit studies have been applied almost exclusively in the formal sector of developed

countries.1 Yet, a minority of the global labor force works in these markets and these are precisely

the settings in which employees enjoy the most comprehensive legal protection from discrimination.

This study provides evidence for a very diﬀerent setting: the situation of immigrants working in

the informal sector in South Africa. Obtaining evidence on discrimination through audit studies is

diﬃcult in these markets as employers typically neither advertise job vacancies nor use formal hiring

processes that include systematic screening of job seekers.2 Pager (2007, p.111) therefore concludes

that in this context “any study would require in-person application procedure ”. I will argue that the

observational data collected in this study allows me to not only apply many of the methodological

advantages of audit studies, but also address some of the key methodological limitations.


I collect a unique data set of 5,500 job seeker advertisements in the domestic work, nanny and general

work sector collected from South Africa’s largest classiﬁed ad website, which caters mainly to the

informal sector3 . When employers search for workers in a particular sector and region they are

presented with a list of truncated summaries of job seeker proﬁles. Based on the information visible

at the search stage employers decide whether to click on the full proﬁle, which provides additional

information and contact details of the job seeker. Importantly, the proﬁle page reports how many

people previously clicked on the proﬁle which serves as a measure of employer demand. This setting

mimics the ideal experiment in that, similar to correspondence studies, researchers observe exactly
    1
     Bertrand and Duﬂo (2016) note, for example, that there is not a single audit study conducted in Africa.
    2
     Moreover, ethical concerns have been raised about conducting audit studies that involve sending thousands of
ﬁctitious CVs in labor markets with mass unemployment as this would further impede the hiring process.
   3
     According to the ILO, one of the deﬁning characteristics of the informal sector is that “Labour relations are based
mostly on casual employment, kinship or personal and social relations rather than contractual arrangements with formal
guarantees.” According to the data I collect, 80% of job seekers employed through the website are agreed on the basis
of a verbal agreement rather than a written contract. It is predominantely used by private households looking to hire:
among job seekers who receive a response to their advertisement, 95% report being contacted by a private household.


                                                           1
the same information as the potential employer at the time of her decision whether to further screen

a job seeker. I ﬁnd that after controlling for other covariates, stating that one is an immigrant is

associated with receiving about 10-20% fewer employer visits to the proﬁle page than job seekers

who state they are South African.


This unique data set also allows me to at least partly address previous studies’ limitation that the pool

of applicants from which employer can hire (in addition to the ﬁctitious applicant) is not observed.

This is an important concern as the size, qualiﬁcation and racial composition of the applicant pool

aﬀect the cost of discrimination. Intuitively, the fewer and relatively less qualiﬁed applicants of the

preferred race, the more costly are discriminatory hiring practices.4 For the classiﬁed ad market I

investigate, we observe the full set of available candidates presented to employers in her local labor

market. What is more, the nationality composition presented to employers is quasi-random as the

order is determined by the time of the day that job seekers post their proﬁle. Consistent with

theoretical predictions from a tournament model in which employers discriminate against foreigners,

I ﬁnd that being pooled with a larger share of immigrants beneﬁts both foreign and South African

job seekers. Employing an estimator that soley exploits variation in the composition of the choice

set is a methodological contribution that may be applied to estimate preferences in otthe scenarios.


Exisiting audit studies have been criticized on the ground that minority workers may be able to iden-

tify discriminating employers, which would alleviate the eﬀects of employer discrimination (Heckman

(1998). In an extension of Becker (1957), Arrow (1973) shows that the wage diﬀerential between

groups can disappear if there are a suﬃcient number of non-discriminating employers. In equilibrium,

this may result is a (partially) segregated employment without (wage) discrimination. The extent to

which (wage) diﬀerentials disappear depends on how well minorities can target non-discriminating

employers in their job search (Black (1995); Lang and Lehmann (2012)). On the website, I observe

both where job seekers live and the location where they search for work. These data allow me to shed

some light on whether minority applicants adjust their search behavior in response to discrimination.

Employing a residential location ﬁxed eﬀect strategy, I ﬁnd that immigrants search 21% further away

and suggestive evidence that higher levels of discrimination faced in the area of residence induces

immigrants to search for work in a diﬀerent suburb. Geographic sorting in response to discrimination
   4
     A related challenge to interpreting audit studies is that results are consistent with a world in which employers’
racial preferences are proportionate to the population’s racial composition but in which the share of minority applicants
is disproprtionately high.


                                                           2
presents an important additional cost of labor market discrimination to job seekers, especially in a

setting with high transport costs like South Africa.5 These ﬁndings complement recent evidence from

the U.S. by Pager and Pedulla (2015) who document that perceived discrimination among African

Americans is associated with applying to a wider range of jobs.


Last, this study hopes to contribute to the literature on the nature of discrimination.6 Altonji

and Pierret (2001, AP henceforth) aim to distinguish between statistical and taste discrimination

by testing how the eﬀect of observable characteristics on wage develop over time. According to the

statistical discrimination theory, observable characteristics such as education and race should explain

less of wage levels over time as employers learn about harder to observe determinants of productivity.7

Building on the AP employer learning model, I ﬁnd that employer demand diverges between South

Africans and foreigners once more information is revealed on the applicants’ proﬁle. This is consistent

with a model in which employers positively statistically discriminate against foreigners. Results from

an anonymous survey I conduct with 208 domestic workers supports this conclusion: I ﬁnd that

immigrants have characteristics (e.g. age, education) favored by employers.


There are other diﬀerences between South African and foreign workers which may explain the results.

Employers may refrain from selecting foreigners due to uncertainty of their legal status. However,

I ﬁnd that among foreign job seekers, those that indicate they have a work permit receive about

8% fewer proﬁle clicks. The South African government suspects that some employers prefer hiring

undocumented foreigners because they have less bargaining power and are thus more exploitative

(DoL 2007). Alternatively, revealing that one has a work permit may also signal a higher reservation

wage to employers. Results from the survey paint a subtle picture: undocumented immigrants do

not have lower reservation wages or are paid lower wages than documented immigrants or South
   5
      Kerr (2015) estimates that household spend on average 11% of their income on transport cost and that modes like
trains or buses impose an eﬀective tax rate of 25-30% on hourly wages.
    6
      The theory of statistical discrimination was pioneered by Phelps (1972) who reasoned that in a world of asymmetric
information, employers assess the expected productivity of workers according to the average of the population with
similar observable characteristics. Labor market discrimination can result when observable characteristics like race or
gender are used by employers to infer information about productivity. By contrast, according to Gary Becker’s model
of taste-based discrimination, employers have discriminatory tastes and are thus willing to pay in order to not hire
certain groups (Becker (1957)). While existing audit studies (Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004); Oreopoulos (2011))
credibly show that discrimination exists in the screening process, they do not provide conclusive evidence on the source
of discrimination (Lang and Lehmann (2012)). For example, a lower return to more credentials is at odds with both
the taste and statistical discrimination approach (Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004)).
    7
      The authors ﬁnd little support for a model of statistical discrimination by race: while the coeﬃcient on education
falls, the negative coeﬃcient for black race persists. One concern with this interpretation is that the discriminated
group may face additional forms of discrimination such as being omitted in promotion decisions due to reasons of
statistical discrimination, which may explain the persistent negative eﬀect on race.


                                                           3
Africans. They are, however, less likely to know about or be willing to utilize the CCMA, a widely

used labor arbitration institution available to employees to take employers to court.


In sum, foreigners receive fewer proﬁle clicks despite positive statistical discrimination and lower risks

of being taken to court, pointing to the importance of taste discrimination. Consistent with this in-

terpretation, I ﬁnd that discrimination increases in the intimacy of the employer-worker relationship:

it is highest in the nanny and lowest in the gardening sector.


One limitation of this research design is that, similar to most audit studies, we only observe the

ﬁrst step in the hiring process. Faced with a large number of applications, ﬁrms may commonly

use heuristics in screening applicants and stop reading once they see a certain signal, in our case

foreign nationality (Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004)). In fact, a review by Riach and Rich (2002)

concludes around 90% of discrimination occurs at this ﬁrst selection stage. Kuhn and Shen (2013)

develop a screening cost model and show that narrow search strategies that pre-screen applicants are

more commonly used in low-skilled sectors with large applicant pools. A coarse job screening strategy

is thus highly relevant for the high unemployment, low-skill sectors context of this study (Bartos et al.

(2016)).8 A second limitation is that while we observe the same information as employers, we may

fail to notice subtle diﬀerences between proﬁles that diﬀer between natives and immigrants. I try

to address this by controlling for a rich set of proﬁle characteristics including the number of words,

spelling and grammar mistakes, the time and day of the posting, and a set of variables for information

such as experience, age, and qualiﬁcation. I also ﬁnd that results are robust to controlling for job

seeker characteristics unobservable to employers at the screening stage.


This study adds to a growing literature on online labor markets. These markets, which are predicted

to increase rapidly in the future (Horton (2010)), are particularly prone to information asymmetries

since, especially at an early stage in the hiring process, employers have very limited information of

the job seeker (Pager (2007)). The study is most similar to Kuhn and Shen (2013, 2014) who use

data from an online labor market in Xiamen, China to test how employer call back rates diﬀer for

job seekers with varying observable characteristics like age, gender, or education. This study also

contibutes to a larger literature that uses data from online markets to estimate preferences. For

example, Pope and Sydnor (2011) analyze data from propsper.com, a peer-to-peer lending website
  8
    In addition, social-psychology theories of unconscious bias predict that discrimination is most pronounced when
ﬁrms have limited information on job applicants (Arrow (1998); Pager (2007)).

in which borrowers create a loan listing with unveriﬁed personal information and pictures in order

to request funding. The authors ﬁnd that signals about the lenders’ age, race, and gender from the

advertised proﬁle signiﬁcantly aﬀect the likelihood to receive loans and the interest rates paid by

borrowers.


The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the evidence on labor market discrimination and

(undocumented) immigration in the South African context. Section 3 summarizes data collected from

an online labor market for domestic workers. Section 4 discusses the identiﬁcation strategy, reports

the main results and oﬀers model extensions that explore the role of the applicant pool composition

and market thickness. Section 5 explores mechanisms and Section 6 tests if spatial sorting of job

seekers is linked to employer preferences. Section 7 concludes.




2        Background: Immigration and discrimination in the South African

         labor market


Racial discrimination has played an important role in South Africa’s history, both before and during

apartheid. The post-apartheid regime implemented legislation to improve the economic situation of

previously disadvantaged groups, most notably the Employment Equity Act (Act 55 of 1998) and

the broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Act (Act 53 of 2003). Yet, the legacy of

half a century of racial segregation and discrimination under apartheid has persistent eﬀects even

more than 20 years after the democratic transition.9 Firstly, while BEE created a small class of

highly successful workers, the majority of businesses are still owned by the white minority. Secondly,

racial tension and discrimination exists between previously disadvantaged population groups, partly

as the result of the apartheid’s policies of racial division and the selective lifting of restrictions for

Coloureds10 and Asians in the 1980s (Seekings and Nattrass (2008)). Thirdly, it has been argued

that apartheid’s racist immigration laws, class division, de-sensitization to violence, and attitude of

superiority towards the rest of Africa are partly to blame for South Africa’s high degree of xenophobia

that resulted in violent riots in 2008 and 2015 (Crush (2008)).
     9

    10
    The term ‘Coloured’ refers to a heterogeneous ethnic group with ancestry from Europe, local tribes, West Africa,
Mozambique and various places in Asia including India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Coloureds tend to have lighter skin
than the black population group and make up 9% of the population in South Africa and are mainly concentrated in
the Western Cape (Seekings and Nattrass (2008)).

This paper focuses on the situation of immigrants in the South African labor market. At the end

of apartheid, South Africa opened up to migration. The total number of documented immigrants

increased by 60% from 1994 to 2003 and the share of Africans among immigrants increased from 25%

to almost 50% over this time. In 2002, amidst increasing unemployment rates, the government passed

the Immigration Act to facilitate easier access for South African employers to foreign skills while

limiting labor market access for unskilled and semi-skilled immigrants. Employment opportunities

in the formal sector became scarcer for immigrants due to “South Africans ﬁrst” legislation, most

notably in the mining sector. As a result, the proportion of foreign miners fell from 51% in 1997

to 38% in 2006 (DOL (2007)). Yet, rather than deterring immigration, many believe that the new

migration policy led to a shift from legal to undocumented migration and employment of immigrants

in the informal rather than formal sector. Undocumented immigration in recent years was further

spurred by the political and economic crisis in neighboring countries, most notably Zimbabwe.


It is diﬃcult to measure the number of immigrants living in South Africa. According to the 2001

census, 688,000 foreigners lived in South Africa, yet the number of irregular immigrants is likely much

higher. The government estimated the number of undocumented immigrants to be around 600,000

but they cannot rule out that the true ﬁgure might be as high as three million (DOL (2007)). The

government’s response to the inﬂux of undocumented immigrants was increased deportation: more

than 3 million undocumented immigrants have been deported since 1990 (97% from SADC countries

including 90% from Zimbabwe and Mozambique) and the annual number of cases tripled between

2002 and 2007 (Crush (2011)).


Large immigration ﬂows combined with high unemployment rates have fostered xenophobic atti-

tudes among South Africans as revealed in a survey of South Africans’ attitudes towards migrants

and refugees (Crush (2008)).11 Yet, the South African Department of Labor (DoL) concludes that

“although a systematic survey of employers has not been conducted, case study evidence suggests that

there is widespread preference for non-South African workers.” (DOL (2007)). If true, this poses a

puzzle: Do employers prefer hiring immigrants despite widespread xenophobic attitudes? What role

does the legal status and exploitability of immigrants play? And how does discrimination vary be-
  11
    84% of respondents believe that South Africa lets too many foreigners into the country, 74% favor deporting
people that are not contributing economically, and two-thirds agree that rights to legal protection and police protection
should never be granted to undocumented immigrants. Hostile attitudes are routed in beliefs that foreigners pose a
criminal threat (48%), compete for jobs (37%), and bring diseases (29%). Xenophobic attitudes only diﬀer slightly by
employment status and tend to be somewhat stronger among whites across all income brackets (Crush 2010).

tween occupations? This paper hopes to shed light on these questions using data from the domestic

worker, nanny, and general work sector in South Africa.




3        Data


I collect data on job seekers that use the website www.gumtree.co.za, South Africa’s most widely

used website for classiﬁed job advertisements.12 Gumtree allows job seekers to post ‘job wanted’

advertisements for free in sectors ranging from housekeeping to engineering.13 People specify the

suburb where they search for employment, include a text with information about themselves, provide

their home address and the position they are looking for and may upload a picture. Employers can

either post ‘job oﬀered’ advertisements or search for people by sector, region and suburb. Search

results provide a list of matched proﬁles that include a truncated version of the text (see Figure 1).

By clicking on the truncated proﬁle of a job seeker, the employer is directed to the individual proﬁle

site that contains the full text and contact information. The proﬁle page also has information on the

number of people that previously visited this site which will serve as the main outcome variable of

interest in the analysis of employer demand.


I collect advertisements posted by job seekers in the housekeeping, general work, and nanny sector

between October 2012 and January 2013 in the Cape Town region.14 Data were captured twice a

day for all job seeker ads posted 12 to 24 hours before to alleviate potential selection problems as

proﬁles of people successfully hired may be taken oﬀ the website.15 I collect all posted information,

the time of the posting and number of visits for more than 5,400 advertisements. I use only the text

visible to employers on the search result site to encode characteristics provided by the job seeker

including nationality, age and gender as well as qualiﬁcation information such as whether the person

has job experience or certiﬁcates, holds a driver’s license, and is willing to live in the employer’s
    12
     Over all provinces, Gumtree has more than 30,000 advertisements posted by employers. Comparable numbers for
the next most popular online sites and newspapers are 9,000 by Job mail, 1,000 by Career junction, and 14,000 by
JunkMail.
  13
     Gumtree also gives the option to pay for priority advertisements that are posted at the top of the search results.
These advertisements are excluded from the analysis as this service is mainly used by agencies that act as brokers.
  14
     I focus on Cape Town as it is the region most highly on the job website. Other cities and more rural areas are
unsuitable for this analysis as they have a much lower frequency of advertisement postings.
  15
     Job seekers have the option of re-posting an advertisement once a month. This may potentially bias results as
employers may not click on a proﬁle that they recognize from a previous search. In practice, less than 5% of the proﬁles
are re-posted using the identical advertisement and I exclude these from the analysis. More frequently, job seekers
post the same proﬁle in a diﬀerent suburb. This is less of a problem since employers are likely only looking for people
searching in their speciﬁc suburb.


                                                           7

house. I also manually review a random subset of job postings and quantify the number of spelling

and grammar mistakes as well as ﬂawed punctuation. The goal of this exercise is to codify all the

proﬁle information that may determine employer demand.


The main focus of this study is the domestic work sector, which provides employment to about

one million people or 7% of the (employed) labor force in South Africa (Dinkelman and Ranchod

(2012)). Data from the South African Labor Force Survey (LFS) conﬁrms that domestic workers are

predominately drawn from lower socio-economic classes: their average level of education (7.5 years)

is lower than that of other unemployed women (8.7 years) and paid workers (11.0 years). Domestic

workers tend to be older (41.5 years vs. 35.1 years of population in labor force) and more likely to be

black (92% vs. national average of 77%). It is the single most important sector for women; in fact,

18% of all women with paid jobs are employed as domestic workers. A study of domestic workers

in Johannesburg shows that almost half of all domestic workers are either internal or cross-border

                                                  8
migrants (Dinat and Peberdy (2007)).


Table A.1 provides summary statistics for the gumtree domestic work sample divided by the main

nationality groups. As the website does not systematically collect information of job seekers, all data

reported are derived from the proﬁle text visible in the search result. For example, the age mean is

calculated from the 28.3% of Gumtree job seekers that provide information on their age. There is

thus the possibility of reporting bias - an issue I will discuss below.16


For a ﬁrst descriptive summary of employer demand across population groups, Figure A.1 plots the

distribution of proﬁle clicks for South Africans, Malawians, Zimbabweans and people who do not

state their nationality. The ﬁgure shows that the proﬁle clicks follow a normal distribution for each

population group. South Africans get more proﬁle clicks than proﬁles without nationality information

which in turn get more clicks than proﬁles of Zimbabweans and Malawians. The order of employer

preference seems robust to outliers; in fact, the ranking of distributions (almost) follows a pattern of

statistical dominace. However, these diﬀerences may be due to diﬀerences in proﬁle characteristics

between population groups documented in Table A.1. The next section oﬀers two empirical strategies

4        Identiﬁcation and Results


4.1      Selection on Observables


4.1.1     Domestic Work Sector


As discussed in section 3, I observe exactly the same information as the employer at the time she

makes the decision whether to screen an applicant’s proﬁle. While employment studies using ob-

servational data often suﬀer from the omitted variable problem, this study design guarantees that

the observable data are orthogonal to the error term (assuming that I correctly codify the proﬁle
    16
    While this study focuses on domestic workers, I will also compare results to the nanny and general work sector (which
includes gardening) to test how employer preferences vary between sectors. Table A.2 compares summary statistics
across sectors. 75% and 80% of job seekers revealing their gender in the housekeeper and nanny sector, respectively,
are women, whereas the general work sector is dominated by men. The share of Malawians is disproportionately high
in the general work sector and Zimbabweans are overrepresented in the nanny sector. While job seeker characteristics
such as age, experience, and the share holding work permits are relatively similar across sectors, I can reject a test of
equal means for almost all variables.

information). The ﬁrst empirical strategy is thus to estimate what information revealed in the search

result determines the decision of the employer to click on the full proﬁle page. I estimate the following

speciﬁcation:




                      yi = α + β1 SA + β2 F or + γXi + φj + timet + langi + ei                       (1)


I regress the log number of proﬁle clicks yi on a vector of control variables (X ) which includes

covariates listed in Table A.1 such as gender, age, experience, and references. I also control for a set

of suburb dummies φj and a vector of variables timet that control for the day and time at which

the proﬁle was posted and the number of hours for which the proﬁle was online by the time of data

collection. The covariate vector langi controls for the number of spelling, grammar and punctuation

mistakes in the proﬁle.


This paper’s main focus is on the role of nationality. I include dummies capturing if the applicants are

South African (SA) or a foreigner (F or). I will also estimate speciﬁcations with a set of nationality

dummies to account for the fact that employers may have diﬀerential preferences for applicants

from diﬀerent African countries. The omitted category in these speciﬁcations is the group of people

providing no information on nationality. The parameters of interest βi thus capture the diﬀerence in

proﬁle clicks among proﬁles with the same observable characteristics X , posted at the same time for

the same suburb but with varying nationality.


Column 1 in Table 1 shows that proﬁles of South Africans get about 7.5% more clicks compared to

proﬁles without nationality information whereas proﬁles of Zimbabweans and Malawians get 3.4%

and 10.9% fewer clicks, respectively. The diﬀerence in coeﬃcients for natives and foreigners are

statistically signiﬁcant. Once I control for language mistakes, the coeﬃcient on the Zimbabwe dummy

becomes more negative (Column 2). This reﬂects that Zimbabweans tend to make fewer language

mistakes. Estimates are unchanged when I control for a set of suburb dummies which suggests that

diﬀerences in employer demand are not due to diﬀerences in where people search for jobs (Column

3). In Column 4, I control for the full set of control variables. The nationality coeﬃcients stay

qualitatively unchanged and coeﬃcients on most of the control variables have the expected sign

which is reassuring. For example, male job seekers receive fewer proﬁle clicks and people with more

years of experience or who are willing to live with employers receive more clicks. I estimate the eﬀect

of age non-parametrically by including dummies for four age groups which roughly correspond to age

quartiles. I ﬁnd a monotonic decline of clicks in age indicating that employers prefer young domestic

workers. Overall, it is reassuring that nationality coeﬃcients remain very stable when controlling for

demographic and socio-economic variables.17



4.1.2    Cross-sector comparison


As described in section 3, I collect data from three sectors: domestic work (Dom), nanny (Nan)

services, and general work (Gen). These professions are very diﬀerent with respect to the frequency

and intimacy of interaction. Domestic workers have access to the personal living space and often

live with the employer. The relationship with nannies is even more intimate as they take care of the

employer’s children. If employers dislike being around foreigners, we would expect discrimination to

be largest in the nanny sector and smallest in the general work sector. To test how employer demand

for foreigners varies, I estimate equation 1 separately for each sector. Coeﬃcients reported in Table

2 provide support for this hypothesis. The eﬀect of being Malawian or Zimbabwean is about 50%

and 200% larger in the domestic work and nanny sector, respectively, compared to the general work

sector. However, this test remains inconclusive since there may be other unobservable diﬀerences like

reputation of diﬀerent nationality that vary across sectors.


The coeﬃcients on adding a picture to the proﬁle also show interesting cross-sectoral diﬀerences.

While the eﬀect is large and highly signiﬁcant in each sector, it is 30% and 40% larger for the

domestic work and nanny sector, respectively, compared to the general work sector. Taken at face

value, this indicates that the increased level of familiarity and trust that pictures evoke are more

important in sectors with a more intimate employer-employee relationship.18
  17
      While we focus on the immigrant status, there are additional interesting results, e.g. on references. 31% of proﬁles
in the domestic work sector mention a reference in the search result. I divide these proﬁles into three groups: ads that
were posted by the employer on behalf of their current worker (Employer posts ), ads that list the phone number of a
reference (Refer.phone) and those that only lists having a reference (Reference ). Results in Column 4 show that just
mentioning a reference is associated with 3.5% fewer proﬁle clicks whereas providing a reference without a number has
no eﬀect. By contrast, job ads posted by current employers receive about 10% more clicks. These results suggest that
employers tend to be suspicious and that references need to be credible in order to be eﬀective Abel et al. (2017). In
addition, many job seekers claim on their proﬁles to be ‘hardworking’, ‘reliable’ and ‘trustworthy’. The eﬀect of these
claims on the number of clicks is very small and statistically insigniﬁcant (results not reported), possibly because these
traits are not easily veriﬁable and may thus be regarded as ‘cheap talk’.
   18
      In a seperate analysis, I asked South Africans to rate these pictures according to two metrics: i) physical attrac-
tiveness and ii) to what extent the picture reﬂects the image of a domestic worker. The phycial attractiveness measure
was a signiﬁcant positive determinant of proﬁle clicks whereas the second measure was negatively correlated. While
these results warrant further investigation they suggest that some people may review job postings for reasons unrelated
to hiring workers.

4.1.3   Robustness Test: Controling for Unobservables


While I observe the exact information as employers by the time they decide whether to click on a

proﬁle, one may be concerned that I fail to codify all relevant information as job seeker texts are multi-

dimensional. To address this concern, I take advantatge of the fact that I observe more information

than the employer by the time she makes the screening decision. Speciﬁcally, I observe the residential

location of 2,120 job seekers (which is revealed on the proﬁle page). Given South Africa’s history of

spatial segregation, residential locations are correlated with socio-economic variables. By observing

                                                                  13
where job seekers live, I can therefore control for factors unobserved by the employer. The rationale

for this robustness test is as follows: assume that the residential location (zi ) is correlated with the

number of proﬁle clicks after controlling for other covariates, i.e. it was previously subsumed in the

error term (ei = vi + zi ). Instead of speciﬁcation (1), I now control for the residential location (zi )

non-parametrically by including dummies for each 0.5x0.5 grid cell:




                     yi = α + β1 SA + β2 F or + γXi + φj + timet + langi + zi + vi                   (2)



This unobservable variable explains an additional 20% of variation in proﬁle clicks compared to

speciﬁcation 1. The identiﬁcation concern was that E (F or ei ) = 0 leading to biased estimates of

β2 . Comparing how much coeﬃcient β2 changes as one reduces the error term by controlling for zi

provides an indication to what extent initial results suﬀered from omitted variable bias. Estimating

(1) and (2) separately and testing for equal coeﬃcients, I cannot reject that the coeﬃcients are

identical (p-value: 0.52, results not reported). This supports the validity of identiﬁcation strategy

(1), although it is of course still possible that E (F or vi ) = 0.



4.2     Identiﬁcation from Applicant Pool Composition


4.2.1    Framework


One common criticism of audit studies is that they cannot provide information on the eﬀect of

employer discrimination in equilibrium (Heckman (1998)). If the share of discriminating ﬁrms is

small relative to the share of the minority, than the diﬀerences in callback rates observed in these

studies may only have a muted eﬀect in equilibrium. As observed by Arrow (1973), it is the attitude

of the marginal employer that may determine ﬁrst order eﬀects of discrimination. Charles and

Guryan (2008) attempt to test the eﬀect of discrimination on the marginal by measuring regional

racist sentiments with data from the General Social Survey.


In order to derive predictions on the role of the applicant pool composition in determining the cost

and prevalence of discrimination, I propose a simple framework in which the employer hires the

applicant with the highest expected productivity. This framework builds on tournament models

                                                     14
developed by Rosen (1981) and Lazear and Rosen (1981) and is most closely related to Charles and

Guryan (2008).19 The contribution of this study is to provide, to my knowledge, the ﬁrst direct

empirical test of the role of the applicant pool composition on discrimination.


Workers can be of type s (South African) or f (foreigners) and ﬁrms derive negative utility λ from

                                                                 ¯s = w
employing type f . Let’s assume that there is a ﬁxed market wage w    ¯f = w
                                                                           ¯ and that ability of all

workers follows a uniform distribution with a ⊂ [a, a
                                                    ¯]. Within each population type, the ﬁrm can rank

applicants according to ability a. I denote the ability level of the highest ranked applicant of each type

as af ∗ and as∗ . It is straightforward to see that the probability of both South Africans and foreigners

to be highest ranked, P [as        s∗ f ∗                       f            s∗ f ∗
                          i > max(aj , aj − λ)], ∀j = i and P [ai − λ > max(aj , aj − λ)], ∀j = i

respectively, increases in the share of foreigners, denoted θF or , in the applicant pool.



4.2.2    Empirical Test


This framework oﬀers an indirect test of discrimination. If employers penalize foreigners, then both

immigrants and South Africans would beneﬁt from being pooled with more foreigners and fewer

South Africans. I construct θF or by measuring the nationality composition of the ﬁve applicants

posting directly before and the ﬁve posting after a given proﬁle in the same suburb20 (see Figure

A.3) and estimate the following model:




                     yi = α + β1 F or + δ1 θF or + δ2 F or ∗ θF or + γXi + φj + timet + ei                         (3)



The predictions are that both δ1 and (δ1 + δ2 ) are positive. It is a priori unclear if foreigners or

natives beneﬁt more from being pooled with foreigners, i.e. δ2 ≶ 0.


To discuss the identiﬁcation assumption, imagine three job seekers ordered by the time they posted

on the website.
  19
     Cornell and Welch (1996) argue that labor market discrimination may be the result of employers’ ability to extract
productivity signals more accurately for applicants of their own type. By contrast, results from the present study
suggest that employers display a taste for hiring natives. However, the implications of the following simple framework
do not depend on the nature of the preference for a certain group.
  20
     Computing the share θ oﬀ the previous and following ﬁve proﬁles is based on the fact that a total of about 10
proﬁles are shown on a typical computer screen. Given that only a small percentage of job seekers explicitly state
they are South African and that employer preference did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between South Africans and those not
stating their nationality (Table 2), I pool these two groups for the analyses (and refer to them as SA) in this section
to increase precision.


                                                          15
yi−1 = α + βF ori−1 + γXi−1 + ei−1


yi   = α + βF ori       + γXi      + ei


yi+1 = α + βF ori+1 + γXi+1 + ei+1


Identifying discrimination solely from the pool composition requires that the nationality status of job

seekers who just posted before or after person i is orthogonal to i ’s error term, i.e. E [           j =i   F orj ei ] = 0.

This identiﬁcation is more likely to be valid than the selection on observable strategy which requires

E [F ori ei ] = 0 as the neighboring proﬁles are determined by who posted a proﬁle minutes earlier or

later.21 Regressing the share of foreigners θF or on a host of covariates provides support for the

validity of the identiﬁcation assumption: of the 21 covariates collected, only one (ability to drive) is

signiﬁcant at the 5% level. This suggests that the immigrant share displayed just above and below

a proﬁle is quasi-random.


Table 3 reports results of equation (3) estimated across the three sectors. Looking at the pooled

sample, we see that job seekers indeed beneﬁt from being in a pool with more foreigners (column

1) and that South Africans beneﬁt more, although the diﬀerence is not statistically signiﬁcant (2).

Being pooled only with foreigners increases the number of proﬁle clicks for natives by about 12.2%

and for immigrants by 5.6%. While the results are generally consistent across sectors, the relative

gain for natives and foreigners varies (4,6,8).


Last, it is interesting to interpret the sign of the coeﬃcients on the foreigner main eﬀect (β1 ). This

estimate measures the eﬀect of being the only foreign job seekers that the employer observes in

the local applicant pool. Across sectors this coeﬃcient is negative and statistically signiﬁcant in

the nanny and housekeeper sector. This ﬁnding is inconsistent with a model of heterogeneous race

preferences within the employer population. For example, if 25% of employers had preferences for

immigrants, we would expect a foreign job seeker who is pooled only with natives to receive more

proﬁle clicks. Taken at face value, the ﬁnding provides evidence that employer preferences with

regards to nationality are not heterogeneous.


Empirical strategy 3 oﬀers a robustness test for results from speciﬁcation 2 as preference for South

Africans is a necessary condition for the composition of the applicant pool to have an eﬀect. A
  21
     While, in theory, job seekers could post their proﬁles at strategic times (e.g. when they see few natives), this is
practically infeasible as there is a delay of about 6 hours between submitting and posting of ads.

second necessary condition is that employers compare applicants locally, i.e. the ones presented to

them at a given time on the computer screen. One implication of this assumption is that the share of

foreigners presented on a previous or following search result page should matter less than the share
                               1−5
presented on the same screen (θF or ). I test this by estimating equation 3 with the immigrant share
                                                                         6−10
of the applicants posted 6 to 10 places above and below a given proﬁle (θF or ). The coeﬃcient drops

from 0.089 to 0.024 and is not statistically signiﬁcant (not reported, p-value: 0.525).




5      Mechanisms



What may explain the preference for South African job seekers? There are at least three channels:

i) employers risk paying a ﬁne if they are caught hiring an immigrant who is undocumented, ii)

employers may receive disutility from interacting with foreigners, and iii) employers may believe

that South Africans are more productive with respect to unobservables (Appendix C oﬀers a simple

theoretical framework). To shed light on these questions I administered an anonymous phone survey

with 208 domestic workers in Cape Town who posted a proﬁle on gumtree (for more information on

survey procedures, see Appendix D).

                                                                     17
5.1    Legal Status and Bargaining Power


Employing an immigrant entails an expected cost as employers get ﬁned if the employment contract

is monitored and the immigrant does not have a valid work permit.22 The data allows to explicitly

test for the role of the legal status as about 8% of immigrants state in the search result that they

have a work permit. One straightforward prediction of this mechanism is that within the group of

immigrants, those with work permits receive more proﬁle clicks. I test this hypothesis by including

a dummy for workpermit (permit) in speciﬁcation (1).


Column 1 in Table 2 shows that among foreigners having a work permit in signiﬁcantly negatively

correlated with the number of proﬁle clicks in the pooled sample. Stating that one posesses a work

permit reduces the number of proﬁle clicks by about 7 percent.23 While these ﬁndings are surprising

at ﬁrst glance, they are consistent with a theory that employers prefer job seekers that are exploitable.

The DoL (2007) speculates about the reasons for anecdotal evidence showing lower unemployment

among immigrants: “The usual advantages of irregular employment (low wages, vulnerability, ex-

ploitative conditions) may be at the core of this preference [for non-South African workers]”.


Consistent with this exploitation hypothesis is the ﬁnding that job seekers stating that they are

willing to live with employers or expressing that they need a job urgently receive more proﬁle clicks

(Table 2). An alternative plausible theory is that employers infer from reading that somebody holds

a work permit that the person demands a higher wage and reading that somebody is ‘urgently’

looking for work may signal that she is less likely to shirk on the job. However, results from the

anonymous phone survey do not support this explanation. Undocumented immigrants do not have

lower reservation wages are not willing to work longer hours than documented immigrants (Table 4).


Results in Table 4 point to an alternative explanation for the preference of undocumented over

documented immigrants: bargaining power. South Africa instituted the Commission for Conciliation,

Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), an administrative tribunal at which employers can bring cases

against employer mistreatment at no charge. If disputes are not resolved and no arbitration is reached,

cases are referred to labor courts. About 70% of the formal workforce fall under the juristriction
  22
     As per the Labour Act (Section 49), “anyone who knowingly employs an illegal foreigner or a foreigner in violation
of this Act shall be guilty of an oﬀence and liable on conviction to a ﬁne or to imprisonment not exceeding one year.”
  23
     This ﬁnding also provides evidence against the explanation that employers prefer South Africans because they are
more likely to remain in the Western Cape area since, controlling for other factors, immigrants with a work permit can
be expected to be more established and thus stay in South Africa for longer.

of the CCMA. The CCMA is very visible in the media and widely used with about 120,000 cases

per year, of which about 70% are about unfair dismissal (Bhorat et al. (2009)). Undocumented

immigrants are signiﬁcantly less likely to know about the CCMA (62.8% vs. 78.9%) and less willing

to take their employer to court (57.7% vs. 70.1%) than documented immigrants.24

Interestingly, this lower bargaining power does not translate into lower actual daily or hourly wages. It

is also notable that undocumented and documented immigrants do not report to be treated diﬀerently

by employers. And while immigrants are more likely than South Africans to report incidents of lower

than agreed payments and rude behavior from employers they report positive overall treatment by

employers (2.5 on a 0-3 scale), low prevalences of maltreatment (5-10%), and feel comfortable to ask

for time oﬀ if sick (96%).


However diﬀerences in bargaining power cannot explain the overall preference for South Africans.
 24
    It is unclear whether undocumented immigrants have access to the CCMA. The case of Discovery Health Ltd v
CCMA & others sided with an immigrant whose work permit renewal process was pending.

They are signiﬁcantly more likely to know about the CCMA (93%) and take their employer to court

(95%), are more likely to hold a have a written contract (33%) and have negotiated wages (52.4%,

not signiﬁcant). The next section will explore whether the results can be explained by diﬀerent

expectations about the productivity of native domestic workers.



5.2    Statistical vs. Taste


To shed light on the nature of discrimination, I build on insights by Farber and Gibbons (1996) and

Altonji and Pierret (2001): if ﬁrms use nationality as a proxy for productivity, then the importance

of nationality should decrease as other predictors of productivity become available and are factored

into employer beliefs. By contrast, if employers have the same productivity expectation of South

Africans and foreigners but prefer hiring locals due to taste -based discrimination, we would expect the

revelation of additional information to have no eﬀect on the foreign-national gap in hiring decisions.

(For a formal employer learning model see Appendix D.)25


                                     ˆi ) in the pooled sample using covariate vector Xi . The residual-
I ﬁrst predict the number of clicks (y

ized numbrt of proﬁle clicks (yi − y
                                   ˆi ) is regressed on nationality dummies interacted with a measure

of the number of relevant information (I ) that the search result includes26 :




                           ˆi = α + β1 SA + β2 F or + δ1 I ∗ SA + δ2 I ∗ F or + ρI + ei
                      yi − y                                                                                        (4)


The intuition for this test is as follows: imagine there are two binary characteristics (X1 and X2 )

that equally determine productivity. Individual A has a positive signal for X1 and a negative for X2

while person B does not provide any information on X1 and X2 . While both may have the same

predicted productivity, person A’s proﬁle is more informative. If employers statistically discriminate

we would expect employer demand to converge as more information (I ) becomes available. Given

that the previous analysis found that foreigners receive fewer clicks than South Africans, we would
  25
     Similar tests of the nature of discrimination have been conducted through audit studies, e.g. by Baert and De
Pauw (2014). Neumark (2016) points out that it is unclear whether the information content that is varied is relevant
to employers.
  26
     All variables are categorized to be relevant that have a an absolute t-value>1 in speciﬁcation (1). Relevant
information includes gender, age, experience, references, pictures, workpermit, drivers license, and whether a person is
willing to sleep in. The average proﬁle has information on 2.9 of these variables. While applicants who do not provide
information on their nationality reveal on average 2.6 characteristics, more information is revealed by South Africans
(3.3), Zimbabweans (3.4) and Malawians (3.1).

thus expect δ2 to be positive and δ1 to be negative. Table 5 shows results of speciﬁcation (4) estimated

for the pooled sample and each sector separately.

Results are consistent across most speciﬁcations. The interaction term of nationality and information

(I ) is positive for South Africans and negative for Malawians and Zimbabweans (columns 2, 4, 6, 8).

While providing more information is beneﬁcial for job seekers without nationality information and

especially South Africans, immigrants do not beneﬁt (sum ρ and δi ): at the average level of proﬁle

information, job seekers without nationality information and South Africans receive an additional

0.57 (7.7%) and 1.35 (18.2%) clicks, respectively, while demand for immigrants is unaﬀected. The

p-values reported show that these diﬀerences in coeﬃcients (δ1 and δ2 ) are statistically signiﬁcant

at the 5% level in all but the general work speciﬁcation. These estimates suggest that the number

of proﬁle clicks is diverging between South Africans and foreigners as more information becomes

available to employers. Results are consistent with a model in which employers believe that foreigners

are on average more productive than natives. However, in the aggregate this positive statistical

                                                                     21
discrimination is oﬀset by the eﬀect of taste-based discrimination.


This conclusion is supported by previous studies concluding that immigrants are more employable

(Crush (2008)) and by evidence from the domestic worker survey: immigrants are more educated

and younger than South Africans. (Section 4 found that employers prefer younger job seekers.)




6        Supply Side Response to Discrimination: Spatial Analysis


Models of discrimination and job search can be divided into discrimination with random search and

discrimination with targeted search. In random search models, the discriminated groups have lower

reservation wages and accept jobs with lower match quality given that they expect to receive fewer

job oﬀers. In models of targeted search, job seekers decide where to apply after observing ﬁrms’

wage oﬀers which provide information on the level of discrimination. The question whether job

seekers adjust their search strategy in response to discriminatory practices of ﬁrms has important

implications for how to interpret empirical results in the existing literature. In particular, Heckman

(1998) points out that audit studies make the critical assumption that workers employ random search

strategies. If job search is costly and workers are able to direct applications to non-discriminatory

ﬁrms, this should increase their reservation wage, improve match quality and thus reduce racial wage

gaps in equilibrium.


Partly due to a lack of data, there is very little evidence whether discrimination induces people to

direct their job search. South Africa provides a context conducive to testing these questions. One

of the legacies of apartheid is that workers tend to live far away from where jobs are located.27 The

average distance of African townships from the central business districts (CBDs) of the seven largest

South African cities is 28 km. Combined with relatively high costs of public transport, this results

in high search and commuting costs both monetary and time-wise.28
    27
     In an attempt to claim city centers and marginalize the black and coloured population, the apartheid regime
forcefully removed large parts of the urban population to homelands or townships outside urban areas; the most famous
cases include Sophiatown in Johannesburg and District 6 in Cape Town. Townships suﬀered from poor infrastructure
and provided few employment opportunities as they were located far from business and industry.
  28
     Recent evidence shows that people with employment spend on average R215 (7.3% of net salary) per month on
transport to and from work (SALDRU (2009)). The mean amount spent by the actively searching unemployed on
transport costs related to the job search was R105.75 in the previous week. 42.5% of the unemployed refrain to local
job search and report not spending anything.


                                                         22
While it is widely argued that spatial segregation is a barrier to ﬁnding employment, there is little

evidence on where people are looking for jobs. Does high transport cost induce them to only look

for jobs in their vicinity or are they willing to accept higher commuting expenses and search in areas

with more employment opportunities? Are immigrants more willing to travel further for work and, if

so, is this decision linked to the level of discrimination they are facing? The online job advertisement

data can shed some light on this question since job seekers have to specify the suburb where they

are searching and about half provide the address or postal code. In total, I collect location data of

about 3,000 job seekers in the Cape Town area.

                            Figure 2: Spatial Analysis of Job Search (Cape Town)




Figure 2 shows a map of the Cape Town region and the location of job seekers categorized by

nationality.29 It also displays the centroid of the nine suburbs where job seekers can indicate they

are searching for employment. A few facts stand out: the distribution of job seekers roughly aligns
 29
      To guarantee anonymity of job seekers, random noise (0.5km) is applied to the location.

with the population density of the urban area (with the notable exception of the poorer Cape Flats

area), which lends support to the claim that the website is widely used. Second, there is no clear

spatial pattern of nationality. However, one may still be concerned that diﬀerence in search behavior

between immigrants and natives is linked to unobservable diﬀerences that are correlated with where

people live. For example, if natives live in more central parts of the city, they would mechanically

have shorter commuting distances. Conversely, if natives have better access to public transport we

would expect them to search further away. These concerns are particularly important in places

with large informal settlements like Cape Town where the residential location of people is linked to

socio-economic factors (Hellerstein and Neumark (2008)).30




To address these concerns and control for unobservable diﬀerences correlated with the residential

location, I draw a 0.25 x 0.25 degree gridnet (approximately 2.5 x 2.5km) and employ an empirical

strategy using job seeker location ﬁxed eﬀects following Black et al. (2013) (Figure 2). Coeﬃcients

are estimated from variation in nationality within a grid cell with standard errors clustered at the

grid cell level. First, I compare how the distance between residential location and the centroid of the

suburb where job seekers look for work varies between nationalities (Panel A, Table 6). Columns

1 and 2 indicate that immigrants search for work in places that are signiﬁcantly further away from

their residential area: target suburbs of foreigners are on average 2.2km further compared to the

pooled group of South Africans and those that do not indicate their nationality.31 These diﬀerences

are economically meaningful given the average search distance of 10.4km. When I control for location

ﬁxed eﬀects, coeﬃcients decrease in magnitude but remain statistically signiﬁcant. One caveat with

the location ﬁxed eﬀect strategy is that this limits the sample used to estimate eﬀects. I ﬁnd that

results are robust to extending grid cells to 0.5 x 0.5 degrees which the sample used for identiﬁcation

(results not reported).




  30
     Previous studies pointed out that employers may discriminate based on the location where job seekers are living
(Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004); Rathelot (2014)). The previous results cannot be explained by this as the location
of the job seeker is only revealed once employers click on their proﬁle.
  31
     These ﬁndings are consistent with Pager and Pedulla (2015) who ﬁnd that African American job seekers search
broader. Of course this correlation could also result from selection as immigrants are widely believed to be more mobile.

 Panel B estimates standard errors through bootstrapping (200 repetitions) to account for the fact that the ’suburb
 discrimination’ variable is estimated.




One explanation is that job seekers may decide to search further away if they are faced with dis-

crimination in their suburb. Location subgroup analysis of speciﬁcation (1) suggests that levels

of discrimination vary considerably by suburb - both towards immigrants in general and between

immigrant groups in a given suburb. For example, in the Northern Suburbs, Malawian proﬁles re-

ceive 19.3% fewer clicks than those not revealing their nationality compared to 1.6% fewer clicks for

Zimbabweans. Conversely, Zimbabweans get 9% fewer clicks in Somerset West compared to 2% for

Malawians. This may be the result of spatial stratiﬁcation within the white population and the large

historic, political and cultural diﬀerences between whites from Dutch and English descent.32 This

raises the question whether discrimination is one of the factors that determine search patterns and
  32
    English-speaking whites live predominantly in the southern suburbs while Afrikaans-speakers more frequently live
in the northern suburbs. The imaginary dividing line between northern and southern suburbs is referred to by locals
as the ’boerewors curtain ’ in reference to the Afrikaans word for sausage. Furthermore, spatial stratiﬁcation is reﬂected
by the fact that the most popular newspaper is the “Die Burger” in the northern suburbs and “The Cape Argus” in
the southern suburbs.


                                                                           25
could explain why immigrants search in places further away.


To shed light on this question I next test whether nationality-speciﬁc discrimination faced in the

suburb of residence aﬀects search behavior. I estimate the following regression:




                                            ˆj,n + γXi + timet + ej
                                 yi = α + δ σ                                                      (5)



yi is an indicator variable capturing whether a workers searches for work outside her suburb of

residence. Variable σ
                    ˆj,n measures the suburb and nationality speciﬁc coeﬃcients of discrimination

estimated from equation 1. It is normalized so a higher value presents more discrimination and

measures how many fewer percent proﬁles of nationality n receives in suburb j . To account for the

facct that σ
           ˆj,n is a generated regressor, I compute standard errors (clustered at the grid cell level)

through bootstrapping.


Results reported in Panel B provide suggestive evidence that discrimination in the home suburb

induces migrants to search in other areas. The coeﬃcient δ is positive and signiﬁcant in column 6

and 7. Column 8 reports marginal eﬀects estimated from a probit model. To interpret the magnitude

of the coeﬃcients, it helps to keep in mind that the aggregate coeﬃcient of σn is around 0.1 (Section

4). Discrimination faced on the home market thus increases the probability that immigrants search

in diﬀerent suburbs on average by about 8 percentage points which is sizable given the mean value

of 28.1% among natives.


At face value, estimates provide some of the ﬁrst evidence that a group adjusts job search behavior in

response to facing discrimination by employers. This has important implications for how to measure

the cost discrimination. In particular it would imply that estimates of discrimination observed in

Section 4 would underestimate the total cost of discrimination since they are estimated in equilibrium

after immigrants adjusted their search behavior. The additional cost of discrimination stems from the

transport cost of searching and working in places further away. However, several important caveats

should be kept in mind when interpreting these results. First, coeﬃcients (σ
                                                                           ˆj,n ) are estimated from

samples of only a few hundred job seekers. Secondly, location choices are endogeneous and native

and migrant job seekers living in the same location may diﬀer along unobservable characteristics

correlated with job search behavior. Rathelot (2014) notes that if immigrants are penalized on the

                                                 26
housring or labor market, the marginal immigrant to participate in the labor force should be more

qualiﬁed than the marginal native. However, this should lead to lower commuting rates among

immigrants as they have an advantage over native competitors in the same market which should

reduce their inclination to search in diﬀerent suburbs.


Can job seekers target suburbs with lower discrimination? To shed light on this question, I look at

the subset of 1,073 commuters and measure the diﬀerence in discrimination between the home and

target suburb. I ﬁnd that on average levels of discrimination in the home suburb are only marginally

higher (diﬀerence: 0.005 or 0.07 standard deviations, not signiﬁcant). Taken at face value, this

suggests that people have information on discrimination in their place of residence but that this is

more diﬃcult to assess for suburbs where one is searching for jobs.




7    Concluding Remarks


This study uses a unique data set of job seekers using a free job advertisement website in South

Africa’s Western Cape province. This is to my knowledge the ﬁrst study of this kind in Africa,

a continent in which the rapidly increasing internet access oﬀers new opportunities to create and

facilitate markets. In particular, internet fora like gumtree oﬀer an opportunity to match employers

with job seekers in spatially segregated urban areas and reduce the reliance of ﬁrms to hire through

social networks, currently the most common form of hiring in most developed countries (Beaman

and Magruder (2012)).


One may wonder why such a large share of job seekers reveal that they are immigrants on their proﬁle

page if they get penalized by employers. One explanation is that employers can easily verify job

seekers’ nationality (as they typically require to see the national ID card). It is therefore beneﬁcial

for immigrants to reveal their nationality upfront to avoid going through the hiring process with

discriminating employers.


One limitation of the study is that we know relatively little about the identity of potential employers

using the website. From the survey we know that 96% were employed by a private household. In

the Western Cape, these employers are predominantely White (63%) compared to Blacks (27%) and

Coloured (10%). Whether diﬀerent race groups have diﬀerential preferences over hiring immigrants

                                                  27
vs. natives should be the subject of future research. A second limitation of the data set is that I can at

best estimate discrimination at the ﬁrst stage of the hiring process.Yet, in a country like South Africa

with excess supply of labor and employers often reporting that they receive hundreds of applications

for a single job, this ﬁrst screening likely plays an important role in explaining employment outcomes.

C. Simple Model of Hiring


A simple model may help to clarify these three channels: assume that ﬁrms have the following utility

function U = U (Y, λ, δ, c). Aside from the productivity of workers (Y ), ﬁrms care about the ﬁnes (δ )

they receive for hiring in undocumented immigrant with probability p which is a function of the legal

status l. Last, employers may incur utility loss (λ) from interacting with foreigners. As evidence

shows that South Africans’ attitude towards foreigners varies across nationalities (Crush 2008), the

distate is modeled to be a function of the applicants’ country of origin λ(d). In addition, the ﬁrm

accrues cost c for reviewing each applicant. While I later consider a more realistic tournament model

of hiring, for simplicity assume that there are n vacancies and n applicants. For each job applicant,

the risk-neutral ﬁrm decides to hire iﬀ:




                                  E [Y |d, x] − λ(d) > c + w
                                                           ¯ + p(l)δ                               (6)



The condition simply states that the ﬁrm hires a native if the expected output is higher than the

wage plus the screening costs c. For a foreign applicant, the expected proﬁt must also exceed the

expected ﬁne and the distate from hiring a foreigner. For now, I assume that wages are ﬁxed (w
                                                                                             ¯)

so ﬁrms strictly prefer to hire more productive workers. The model predicts that conditional on

applicants’ observable characteristics X , employers prefer to hire South Africans for three possible

reasons:



  1. Employers risk paying a ﬁne if they are caught hiring an immigrant who is undocumented (i.e.

     l = 0).

  2. Consistent with models of taste discrimination, employers may receive disutility from hiring

     and interacting with foreigners.

  3. Consistent with models of statistical discrimination, employers may believe that South Africans

     are more productive with respect to unobservables e, i.e. E [Y |x, d = SA] > E [Y |s, d =

     F oreign].

                                                  36
D. Employer Learning Model


To shed light on the nature of discrimination, I test a simple employer learning model based on

Faber and Gibbons (Farber and Gibbons (1996), FG) and Altonji and Pieret (Altonji and Pierret
                                                      ˜ (x, q, n, z ). x captures information available
(2001), AP). FG model productivity Y as a function of Y

to both the researcher and employer, q information available only to employers, z information only

available to the researcher and n unobserved factors. Since I observe exactly the same information

set as the employer at the time of the screening decision, the production function thus simpliﬁes to
   ˜ (xi , ni ).
Y =Y


Let’s posit an additive separable production function in which a worker produces output y = f (d) +
                         1
g (x) + e with e ∼ N (0, he
                            ) and let the ability y of each job seeker be a random draw from the

population distribution of their nationality d. The employer observes the applicants’ nationality d
                                       1
and forms beliefs E [y |d ∼ N (m0 (d), h0
                                          )] . The employer then receives additional information x with
               1
y |x ∼ N (m1 , h1
                  ) which she uses to form the posterior belief y |x, d ∼ N ( h0 m 0 +h1 m1
                                                                                 h0 +h1
                                                                                                 1
                                                                                            , h0 + h1 ).
                                                                                                        33 It is


straightforward to show that the posterior productivity belief is a weighted average of the information

on nationality and other signals with the weights determined by the relative informativeness presented

by the inverse of the variance of the error term.


This simple model of employer learning oﬀers a test to distinguishing taste from statistical dis-

crimination similar to AP (2001). Assume that the vector X consists of J potential predictors of

productivity Y such as age, experience or education, X = (x1 , x2 , ...., xJ ), that the job seeker may

                                                  σe
                                                       as the relative informativeness of the observed set X

relative to the unobserved error term e and assume that I monotonically increases in the number of

signals j actually provided, i.e. each additional information increases the predictiveness of Y .


AP test whether the eﬀects of the easy to observe variables (e.g. education, race) decrease as the

employer learns additional information on the hard-to-observe variables over time. The equivalent
  33                                                                           2
    I assume that hi , which captures the inverse of the population variance σi  , is constant, independent of d.

    Given that there is no standardized form to report information, job seekers may be strategic about what they
reveal. For 201 job seekers in the domestic work sector, I observe both what is revealed online and detailed data from
an anonymous survey. I ﬁnd that there is no signiﬁcant correlation between the reported age, years of experience, legal
status or nationality with the decision to whether a person reveals this information in the classiﬁed ad. This could be
explained by two factors: either job seekers do not know about the beneﬁt of revealing positive characteristics and/or
negative characteristics (e.g. immigrant status) is easily veriﬁable by employers so job seekers have an incentive to
reveal it before incuring interview expenses.

test in this setting is to test if nationality becomes less important in the screening decision as job

seekers provide more information. In a model of statistical discrimination,

                                           ∂ 2 P (Hire = 1|X, I, d)
                                                                    <0                                             (7)
                                                     ∂d∂I

, i.e. the eﬀect of nationality d on the probability of an applicant beeing hired decreases as addi-

tional information I is available (conditional on the actual content of the new information X = x).

The intuition behind this prediction is straightforward: if ﬁrms use nationality as a proxy for pro-

ductivity, then the importance of nationality should decrease as other predictors of productivity

become available and are factored into employer beliefs. By contrast, if employers have the same

productivity expectation of South Africans and foreigners but prefer hiring locals due to taste -based

discrimination, we would expect the revelation of additional information to have no eﬀect on the
                                                     ∂ 2 P (Hire=1|X,I,d)
foreign-national gap in hiring decisions, i.e.               ∂d∂I           = 0.35



E. Domestic Worker Phone Survey


Protocol: We collected phone numbers of all job seekers who posted in the domestic work category

in Gauteng and the Western Cape between December 1st, 2015 and January 10th, 2016. Experienced

phone surveyors called these people and explained that they are calling as part of a research project

to “understand the situation of domestic workers in South Africa.” and that you “will be asked about

your job search and work history.” Surveyors stressed that we are not oﬀering employment and that

the survey is completely volunary, fully anonymous, and would take 15 minutes to complete. “As

a thank you for participating in this research, you will receive 30 Rand Airtime, regardless of your

responses and how many questions you choose answer.” The compensation is about 20% of the daily

income of domestic workers. It was paid via an airtime transfer to a phone number of their choice.


Selection: We attempted to call a total of 444 people of which we reached 343 (77.2%). Of these

people we reached 303 (88.3%) agreed to participate in the survey. This is a remarkably high share

compared to other phone surveys. To assess how selective this sample is, in particular with regard
  35
     This test is distinct from related audit studies. Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) and Oreopolous (2011) test
how callback rates change for higher quality CVs. The quality of resumes is improved both by adding new information
(e.g. additional certiﬁcates) and by changing the quality of signals provided (e.g. domestic vs. international work
experience). The test in equation (7) by contrast looks at the eﬀect of providing more signals (j ) holding the quality
of provided information (X ) constant.


                                                          38
to nationatlity composition, I test whether the nationality information posted on the website is

correlated with the probability of being reached or the decision to participate (conditional on being

reached). Compared to people who do not post their nationality, foreigners are 0.3% more likely

to be reached (p-value:0.96) and 2.7% more likely to participate (p-value: 0.54). South Africans

are 3.1% more likely to be reached (p-value:0.29) and 3.3% more likely to participate (p-value:0.77).

These results suggest that the sample is representative of the population of job seekers, at least with

regard to nationality composition.
