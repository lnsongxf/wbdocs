PPD involves the public and private sectors working together
to identify, prioritize, and resolve investment climate obstacles.


                                                                       DEFINITION
It is often important to engage citizens in the process. The
success of PPD entails collaboration and trust between all

Principles
Stakeholder mapping and engagement are ongoing activities
throughout the life cycle of a PPD. It is important at all stages
to ensure that the PPD is open to stakeholders as they continue
to appear and become relevant. This openness is an indicator of
the potential success of the dialogue process. When there is little
interest among stakeholders in working together, the first stages
of the PPD are critical in building trust. It is not uncommon in the
early stages of PPD to have challenges in achieving a specified
reform even with increasing support from the public and private
sectors. After trust is built and impact is quantifiable, the PPD
process may become institutionalized within the government and
private sector.

1	PROCESS:
   STAKEHOLDER MAPPING
PPD has several principal actors: the public and private sectors, civil society,
academia, and the donor community. As shown in the figure below, it is
an inclusive process that seeks to engage relevant actors who have a keen
interest in a specific issue and the capacity to engage and influence the key
people making decisions and policy. The focus of PPD can range from being a
single issue to a comprehensive reform agenda that includes policy, legislation,
regulations, and implementation of these reforms.

PRIMARY STAKEHOLDERS: Those who are critical to the policy
reform’s success or failure, such as high-level officials, public sector policy
implementers, and business leaders. This group includes all stakeholders
with a direct interest in the reform outcome and who will be positively or
negatively affected by it.

SECONDARY STAKEHOLDERS: All other individuals or groups with a stake,
interest, or potential intermediary role in the reform process or outcomes.

Mapping Context and Relevance
The design of each PPD intervention is unique, because it factors in relevant economic and political complexities for the
targeted sector or overall economy. At the onset, it is crucial to assess and understand the market dynamics that may
trigger and influence subsequent phases. The basic market assessment will ensure that the PPD design team is able to
address political risk and include all stakeholders.

                                            When undertaking stakeholder mapping, it is important to identify all levels of executive
                                            decision making. In some instances, the office of the president or prime minister may
                                            take primary responsibility for driving private sector development reform. Where such an
                                            authority, board, or function exists, it is important to identify its roles and activities during
                          Executive level
                                            stakeholder mapping. Direct linkage to the highest level of authority indicates that the
                                            government has prioritized (at some stage) investment climate reform. This may indicate that

                                            it is a clear advantage when introducing reforms.

                                            Ministries focused on private sector development are the principal public sector stakeholders.
                                            PPD champions exist within those line ministries. The authority of ministries can vary from
                                            country to country. When mapping public sector stakeholders for a sector-focused PPD, it is
                          Ministries
                                            important to identify not only functional alignment, but also the decision-making alignment
                                            that exists within the government. This is particularly important where decisions require intra-
                                            ministerial coordination.

                                            Departments are also important stakeholders. Depending on the type and scale of PPD, it
                                            may be at the departmental level where a PPD champion is located. Departments are also a
