II. Evaluation Capacity Development and Learning

   Learning and Knowledge Sharing:

   IEG held internal launch seminars for World Bank Group staff for its evaluations on Procurement and
   Fragile and Conflict-Affected States (FCS).

   In addition, multiple dissemination events took place targeting external audiences:

      The Global Food Crisis evaluation was presented to Civil Societies during the WBG Annual
       Meetings 2013.

      The Procurement evaluation was presented at events attended by international procurement
       practitioners: the MDBs Heads of Procurement meeting in Jeddah (hosted by the Islamic
       Development Bank); the OECD Meeting of leading practitioners on public procurement in Paris;
       International Advisory Group on Procurement (IAGP) workshop in Geneva (hosted by WTO);
       and one-day workshop and learning event co-organized by IEG, the World Bank procurement
       anchor and the MENA region procurement department in Tunis (jointly sponsored by the AfDB
       Procurement Department and the AfDB Evaluation department).

      The WBG Assistance to Fragile and Conflict-Affected States (FCS) evaluation was presented
       to the Swiss Development Cooperation in Bern, at the International Dialogue on Peacebuilding
       and Statebuilding Steering Committee meeting in Kinshasa and at a seminar with Kinshasa-based
       donor partners (hosted by the Bank’s Country Office). In addition, IEG collaborated with the
       Bank’s Global Center for Conflict, Security and Development to organize a Learning Week on
       Fragility, Conflict and Violence in Nairobi. As part of this Learning Week, the report was
       publicly launched at an international seminar organized jointly with the International Dialogue for
       Statebuilding and Peacebuilding Working Group on Implementation. The launch seminar was
       followed by a two-day learning retreat of World Bank Country Directors/Country Managers from

                                                   4
    FCS countries where sessions were organized on different topics covered by the evaluation
    report. These sessions were designed as forward-looking learning sessions focused on the
    operational lessons from the evaluation, which led to rich discussions on how to enhance the
    effectiveness of World Bank Group engagement in FCS.

   The Biennial Report on Operations Evaluation (BROE) on Assessing the Monitoring and
    Evaluation Systems of IFC and MIGA was presented at the 14th Annual Conference of the
    Japan Evaluation Society in Yonago, Japan (co-sponsored with the JICA’s private sector
    partnership department).

IEG made a series of presentations at the 2013 American Evaluation Association Conference in
Washington, DC, drawing on evaluation findings and lessons learned: Evaluation Practice in
International Organizations: The Case of UNICEF, UNDP, the Rockefeller Foundation and the World
Bank; The World Bank’s Partnership With Large Global Programs: Lessons from the Global Fund,
The Global Environment Facility and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization; Evaluating
Governance and Public Sector Management Reforms, and many more.

IEG launched a blog on “Transforming Development through Evaluation: Using Evaluation for
Results.” The blog aims to highlight lessons and findings from IEG's evaluations and the value of
evaluation for development results.

Evaluation Capacity Development:

A study on the supply and demand of evaluation capacity development programs was initiated to help
inform IEG’s future ECD strategy.

Two papers were published: ECD Working Paper #28 "The Government Monitoring and Evaluation
System in India: A Work in Progress" and another report in the Blue Book Series: "Program
Classification for Performance-Based Budgeting: How to Structure Budgets to Enable the Use of
Evidence"

IEG held a seminar in Beijing in collaboration with the World Bank Institute and the China Country
Team on international practices in evaluation for Chinese government officials and other
stakeholders.

Technical assistance was provided for the international National Evaluation Capacities conference
jointly sponsored by UNDP and the Social Development Ministry of Brazil in Sao Paulo, Brazil; IEG
also prepared a background paper on independence in evaluation and moderated an on-line discussion
on the topic.

CLEAR: The program initiated a competitive selection for a CLEAR center based in Brazil and
selected the São Paulo School of Economics at Getulio Vargas Foundation. Financing will be
provided by the Inter-American Development Bank. CLEAR held a second workshop for the Pacific
Islands on fundamentals in evaluation in cooperation with the Pacific Islands Center for Public
Administration at the University of the South Pacific. CLEAR held its fourth global forum in
collaboration with CIDE in Mexico, which included two days of programs on international practices
in evaluation for CLEAR's stakeholders and clients.

Management Action Record:

The 2013 MAR analysis was conducted and adoption and implementation of evaluation
recommendations were summarized in the 2013 Results and Performance Report.

inclusiveness, engagement with stakeholders, and public oversight of WBG-supported operations.
A technical briefing on the MAR systems (both internal and external) for the ED advisers is
scheduled for January 23, 2014.
