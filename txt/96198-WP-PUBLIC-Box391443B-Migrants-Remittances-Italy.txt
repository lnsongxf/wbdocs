FOREWORD AND
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS


W     ith over $400 billion officially recorded annual flows to developing countries,
      remittances are a critical source of national and families’ income. However, high
transaction costs and other inefficiencies in the process often adversely impact migrant
workers and their families.

The G8 and G20 have, therefore, set among their objectives the reduction of the average
cost of remittances by five percentage points in five years (5x5 objective). Achieving the
objective would save $16 billion per year: these funds would simply remain to migrants
and their families and could contribute significantly to improving the living conditions of
the migrants themselves as well as reducing poverty in their countries of origin.

Project Greenback 2.0 aims at increasing efficiency in the market for remittances
through an innovative approach: promote change inspired by the real needs of the ulti-
mate beneficiaries of international money transfers: the migrants and their families.

In Project Greenback 2.0, Remittances Champion Cities are selected. The World Bank work
to implement initiatives aiming at increasing transparency and efficiency in the market
for remittance services. The focus is on migrants and their needs. Cooperation between
migrants, remittance service providers, and public authorities is key for the achievement
of the Project’s objectives. Turin, Italy is the first “Remittances Champion City.”

In this context, the World Bank commissioned this study, which is the result of the joint
efforts of FIERI (Forum of International and European Research on Immigration) and
Labor (Laboratorio R. Revelli).

The team included Ferruccio Pastore (Director, FIERI), Eleonora Castagnone (Senior
Researcher, FIERI), Claudia Villosio (Senior Researcher, Labor), and Laura Bartolini
(Junior Researcher, Labor), whom we all wish to thank. The fieldwork was coordinated
by Laura Bartolini and Marta Pinto (Junior Researcher, FIERI). Data were processed and
analyzed by Laura Bartolini and Claudia Villosio. The team wish to thank FIERI’s inter-
viewers for their great work: Serena Anastasi, Dario Basile, Elena Evangelisti, Agnese
Migliardi, Emanuela Roman.

Project Greenback 2.0 is coordinated by Marco Nicolì (Financial Sector Specialist, World
Bank). In Turin, the team is coordinated by Viviana Premazzi and includes Romina Car-
puci, Leyden Durand, and Khaled Elsadat.

I would like to express our gratitude to all of the participating communities, groups,
and associations, the City of Turin and other local authorities and, most importantly, the
interviewed migrants who gave us their time and their attention.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


“G      reenback 2.0–Torino” is a project led by the World Bank, in partnership with the
        City of Turin, aimed at fostering the development of an efficient and transparent
market for remittances. Within this framework, this survey, conducted by FIERI and
Laboratorio R. Revelli between July and September 2013, investigated the demand
side of the remittance market in the city of Turin, collecting 480 in-depth interviews of
migrants from the Moroccan, Peruvian and Romanian communities. These are the three
most numerous communities in the city and the largest in terms of remittances sent
to the country of origin. The survey is aimed at describing the economic and financial
profile of migrants. Specifically, it investigates the interconnected dimensions of financial
behaviors—patterns of consumption and savings, remittances and investments, and
financial needs and aspirations. Strong emphasis is given to remittance services and
access to different types of financial products and services.

Interviewed migrants differ by country of origin, gender, length of stay in Italy, type of
occupation and related economic stability. Moroccans and Peruvians tend to have larger
families than Romanians, considering both relatives in the origin country and in Italy.
Moroccan migrants show on average a longer presence in Italy and hence a higher rate
of family reunification than both Peruvians and Romanians, which instead often report to
have children left in the country of origin. As for economic conditions and level of inte-
gration into the Italian labor market, differences arise across the subsamples and by gen-
der. Romanians report the highest average monthly income, while Moroccans have the
lowest earnings. This differentiation is consistent with the job and sector specialization
of the three subsamples: Moroccan migrants, mostly men, are employed in manufactur-
ing and construction, while many Peruvians and Romanians, especially among women,
are employed in the care and domestic sector and seem to have more stable and higher
earnings. Moreover, the relatively better economic condition among Romanians can also
be attributed to their acquisition of the EU citizenship in 2007, which may facilitate their
economic integration and stability.

Collected data suggests, on average a good level of economic and financial integration
of interviewed migrants, who, on average, declared high usage of financial products
and instruments connected to a bank account, while microcredit is not popular and used
very marginally.

As for the remittance service providers and channels for sending remittances, 83 per-
cent of all recorded remittance flows are sent in cash through a money transfer opera-
tor, and only a very small proportion through a bank account, a prepaid card, or twin
cards. Although transaction costs are often deemed to be the crucial element in decid-
ing if and how often to send remittances, remittance behaviors also seem to respond
to other important characteristics of each channel and service provider, such as the

      availability of agencies at origin and at destination, the easy access for recipients to
      withdraw the money, the relative transaction speed, etc.

      The analysis depicts a widespread misperception of transaction costs and overall
      service conditions by migrants. Remitters have low awareness of costs’ composition
      and often do not consider the presence of exchange rate’s margins and fixed costs at
      destination, irrespective of the preferred remittance service provider. Moreover, highly
      frequent flows are associated with low-value transactions, which imply an overall higher
      weight of fixed costs on the total amount sent per year. These characteristics suggest
      there is room for improvement in terms of competitiveness and transparency of all
      remittance service providers and the need for greater awareness and financial literacy
      and management skills among remitters.

      The survey also provides a picture of trends and changes in migrants’ behaviors since
      arrival in Italy and demonstrates the impact of the current economic crisis on income
      and remittance flows. Declining economic conditions in the migrant communities
      depends, among other things, on different job specializations within the Italian labor
      market. Nevertheless, our empirical data show on average a severe situation in which
      the protracted economic instability is threatening the overall level of economic integra-
      tion of migrants and their capacity to keep remittance flows constant over time. In this
      regard, it is worth noting the role of reverse remittances, which represent the support
      from the origin household to migrants’ income to overcome the period of crisis. Never-
      theless, comparing trends in income and remittances, for the time being migrants’ remit-
      tances seem to be more resilient than income to the worsening of economic conditions
      in Italy in the last five years.

The figure represents transition in legal status from “initial period of residence” (spell 1) to 2013 (spell 2), in absolute values by country of origin. All possible
conditions—types of permit to stay, documents or reasons for the lack of them—were considered. The category “Not needed” includes migrants entered
when Italy’s immigration law did not require a permit to stay, and European citizens (mostly Romanians after 2007). The “999” indicates the very low share of
migrants which refused to answer.
