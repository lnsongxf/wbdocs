The objective of this strategic framework is to mainstream citizen
engagement in World Bank Group-supported policies, programs, projects, and
advisory services and analytics to improve their development results and
within the scope of these operations, contribute to building sustainable
national systems for citizen engagement with governments and the private
sector. Progress toward this objective will be assessed using indicators
included in program, project, and corporate results frameworks.

                                      Executive Summary

The World Bank Group (WBG) has a long history of multi-stakeholder engagement in the
operations it funds. Multi-stakeholder engagement began in the 1970s, was formalized in the
1980s, and deepened throughout the 1990s through participatory approaches in operations.
Concepts of social inclusion, social accountability, and governance and anticorruption (GAC)
emerged during the early 2000s. The landmark 2004 World Development Report Making
Services Work for Poor People highlighted the benefits of listening to citizens to improve pro-
poor targeting of service delivery. The 2007 GAC Strategy introduced engagement with demand-
side actors, and its 2012 Update undertook to “support initiatives that enable greater openness in
governments and closer interaction among citizens, the private sector and the state.” Also in
2012, the establishment of the Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA) provided a
mechanism for capacity building for civil society organizations (CSOs) to implement social
accountability programs in countries where governments have agreed to these approaches. In
addition, the Bank, IFC, and MIGA all require engagement with project-affected people and
communities as part of their safeguard policies or performance standards.

The purpose of this strategic framework for citizen engagement (CE) is to capture the
diverse experiences, assess lessons learned, and outline methods and entry points to provide
a more systematic and results-focused approach for the WBG. Its objective is to facilitate
mainstreaming of CE in WBG-supported policies, programs, projects, and advisory services and
analytics to improve their development results and, within the scope of these operations, to
strengthen engagement processes between governments and the private sector and citizens at the
national, regional, local, or sectoral level, as applicable.

The WBG Strategy incorporates CE, including beneficiary feedback, specifically in its
treatment of inclusion, which entails empowering citizens to participate in the development
process and integrating citizen voice in development programs as key accelerators to achieving
results. In addition, under the right circumstances, CE can contribute to achieving development
outcomes in support of the goals the WBG aims to support through all of the operations it funds:
eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The WBG is
therefore committed to mainstreaming CE in operations it supports where it can improve
outcomes, and it has made a strong corporate commitment to incorporating CE in 100 percent of
projects that have clearly identified beneficiaries (“beneficiary feedback”).

This framework builds on stocktaking and lessons learned from WBG-financed operations
across regions and sectors. A key lesson is the importance of country context, government
ownership, and clear objectives for CE. Certain regions, such as East and South Asia, have a
long history of using participatory development processes, while others, including the Middle
East and North Africa region have new opportunities to scale up CE as a result of recent political
transitions. A stocktaking of World Bank-financed projects shows that the majority of projects
with CE activities have been service delivery, natural resource management, and social inclusion
projects. CE is less prevalent in public financial management and governance projects. There is
an increasing effort to systematically track and report on results, and draw lessons learned from
these activities.



                                                                                                1
Growing evidence confirms that under the right conditions, CE can help governments
achieve improved development results. This framework includes a comprehensive review of
impact literature, which has found positive links between CE and improved public service
delivery, public financial management, governance, and social inclusion/empowerment.
Evidence also shows, however, that the outcomes of CE are highly context-specific and sensitive
to governments’ and citizens’ capacity and willingness to engage, as well as to social, political,
economic, environmental, cultural, geographic, and other factors, such as gender dynamics.

The approach to mainstreaming CE in WBG-supported operations is guided by five
principles: it is results-focused, it involves engaging throughout the operational cycle, it
seeks to strengthen country systems, it is context-specific, and it is gradual. As CE is not
without cost, opportunities for engaging citizens in WBG-supported operations should be sought
where such engagement can contribute to improved development results. While the preparation
of WBG-supported operations frequently involves stakeholder consultations, CE during program
and project implementation can be enhanced to facilitate ongoing learning and feedback and to
allow making adjustments as necessary. A gradual approach to mainstreaming is recommended
to avoid the pitfalls of “box-ticking” and tokenistic approaches, build the capacity of
governments and citizens to engage on a sustainable basis, including through adequate processes
and systems, and continue to learn and make adjustments as necessary.

While mandatory consultations have been the main form of engagement to date, numerous
context-specific entry points for CE exist across the World Bank Group product portfolio.
Consultations are mandatory in the preparation of Systematic Country Diagnostics, Country
Partnership Frameworks, Program-for-Results operations, and investment project financing (IPF)
operations that trigger certain safeguards. In IPF, consultations and grievance redress
mechanisms are largely motivated by safeguard requirements and are often focused on project
preparation 1. CE during program and project implementation can be scaled up to facilitate
ongoing feedback and learning and improved monitoring. There are additional context-specific
entry points in Systematic Country Diagnostics, policy dialogue, advisory services and analytics,
and IPFs. Much of the work to date on CE has taken place in IPFs—for example, in community-
driven development or service delivery projects. Other opportunities include citizen-led
monitoring of procurement and other approaches to build feedback into the project cycle. IFC
and MIGA engage with stakeholders, including citizens, in the context of their Performance
Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability, which require consultations and grievance
redress mechanisms if specific performance standards are triggered. In addition, IFC is piloting
CE in public-private dialogues and results measurement approaches.

Scaling up CE across WBG-supported operations for improved results entails several
elements. First, an analysis of the specific country, sector, or program/project context is required
to identify the appropriate entry point(s) for CE. Second, the objectives of the engagement need
to be clearly defined in the context of the operation’s results chain, and clearly communicated.
Third, a stakeholder mapping is needed to inform the design of the engagement mechanism
through an understanding of the interests, incentives, and objectives of key stakeholders,

  “The draft Environmental and Social Framework proposes that the Borrower will develop and implement a Stakeholder
Engagement Plan (SEP). This SEP will describe the timing and methods of engagement with the project-affected communities
and other stakeholders (See ESS10, para 14). This is a mandatory requirement. Additional details will be clarified in forthcoming
procedures”.

                                                                                                                               2
ensuring inclusion and representation, including for women and marginal and vulnerable groups.
Fourth, the engagement level and mechanism need to be tailored to the context, objectives, and
willingness and capacity of governments and citizens to engage, and they should support existing
national processes for CE as much as possible. Finally, the outcomes of mainstreaming CE
activities in WBG operations need to be monitored and reported systematically and consistently.

The quality of mandatory consultations can be enhanced, and there is significant scope to
scale up collaborative approaches. Consultations need to respect good practice principles,
including providing adequate notice periods and closing the feedback loop more systematically.
Grievance redress mechanisms are mandatory in IPFs that trigger certain safeguard policies, but
they do not always function well during project implementation. In collaboration with client
governments, teams can pursue opportunities to scale up collaborative approaches (such as
participatory planning and budgeting, and citizen membership in decision-making bodies) and
empowering mechanisms for citizen engagement (such as community management of resources)
in WBG-supported operations, in the appropriate context and in areas where they can contribute
to improved results.

Improved understanding and monitoring of the outcomes of CE in WBG-supported
operations is an objective of this framework. Because such monitoring and reporting is not
systematic, it is challenging to learn from and evaluate CE activities. To enhance measuring and
reporting on CE going forward, therefore, the framework proposes a focus on clarifying results
chains and citizen engagement indicators in five outcome areas (a) improved service delivery, (b)
public financial management, (c) governance, (d) natural resource management, and (e)
inclusion/empowerment. The results chains and indicators have been informed by impact studies
and experience with CE within and outside the WBG.

Access to information is a necessary but not sufficient enabling condition for effective
citizen engagement. Relevant information needs to be made available to citizens in a timely
manner and in a format they can understand. At the same time, information does not
automatically lead to engagement or participation, which depend on additional context factors.
ICT has the potential to be leveraged for increased outreach and inclusivity at limited cost, but to
yield results it needs to be integrated into the design of CE processes. Further work is required to
isolate and study the contribution ICT can make to CE processes and outcomes.

Adequate capacity of governments and citizens to engage is an important prerequisite for
scaling up CE in WBG-supported operations. Governments need to understand the benefits of
engaging with citizens and to have the time and capacity to respond to their feedback. Capacity
building of governments should prioritize strengthening existing institutions. Citizens/CSOs need
to be able and willing to engage, and they need to acquire an understanding of relevant tools,
processes, responsibilities, and constraints. Capacity building for CE initiatives in WBG-
supported operations has been successfully integrated into program and project design and
implementation, providing valuable lessons for future opportunities.

Scaling up CE in WBG-funded operations needs to be supported by comprehensive staff
training and systematic knowledge management. Only a limited number of WBG staff have
in-depth understanding of and practical experience with CE processes. Assessing staff capacity
and developing staff training is planned as part of the implementation of this framework. In


                                                                                                  3
addition, systematic and pooled knowledge management through a CE knowledge platform and
structured knowledge exchange will be important.

Mainstreaming CE in the new WBG structure will require collaboration between the
regions and the new Global Practices. As CE is specific to country contexts, the regions will
continue to take the lead in identifying country-specific opportunities and demand for CE and,
where relevant, will include them in Country Partnership Frameworks. Each of the new Global
Practices will be responsible for integrating CE in the operations it manages, including scaling
up the use of citizen engagement in IPF to reach the corporate target on beneficiary feedback,
which will be monitored by the Presidential Delivery Unit as well as through the World Bank
Corporate Scorecard and the IDA Results Measurement System. IFC will monitor progress
through its Performance Standard Achievement Rating. An institutional coordination mechanism
is envisioned to facilitate implementation of the agreed results-focused approach, monitor
progress, and facilitate knowledge exchange and training across Global Practices and regions.

The implementation of a more systematic approach to CE, as laid out in this framework,
will benefit from the continued guidance of an external Citizen Engagement Advisory
Council, which includes representatives of government, academia, civil society, the private
sector, and development partners. The Advisory Council has engaged with the Bank to inform
the design of this framework, assist in assessing lessons of experience, and providing advice on
implementation for the next two years. In addition, opportunities for exchange of experience
with CSOs and other partners will be sought throughout the implementation of this framework.

                                          I. Context and Objectives
1.      The World Bank Group (WBG) Strategy sets out a framework to align all the
WBG’s public and private sector interventions to the goals of ending extreme poverty and
promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The goals emphasize the importance of
economic growth, inclusion, and sustainability. Inclusion entails empowering citizens to
participate in the development process, removing barriers against those who are often excluded
and ensuring that the voice of all citizens can be heard (World Bank, 2013c).

2.      Supporting client engagement with citizens where such engagement can improve
development outcomes is a key component of the WBG’s strengthened focus on results. As
part of this approach, the WBG is strengthening its focus on results and evidence of what works
in development. Citizen engagement (CE) entails working with the WBG’s direct clients—
whether government or private sector—to find ways to include citizens to assess priorities for
interventions, learn about design and implementation to adjust as necessary, contribute to
monitoring, and ultimately improve outcomes. This framework builds on evidence of impact that
shows that CE can help governments and the private sector improve development outcomes, as
well as lessons learned from WBG-supported CE activities. It proposes to systematically scale up
CE where such engagement can contribute to improved development results. It also involves
strengthening technical support to WBG task teams and clients to design and implement
sustainable CE activities for improved development impact.

3.      In Country Opinion Surveys, many respondents consider increased civic
participation to be a key area in which the WBG can strengthen its impact. In the most
recent Country Opinion Survey, 32 percent of respondents pointed to an inadequate level of
citizen/civil society participation in World Bank-assisted reform efforts as the most important
reason these efforts fail or are slow to implement, ahead of government inefficiencies and
political obstacles. Similarly, the assessment of the effectiveness of WBG collaboration with
groups outside the government shows room for significant improvement. 2

4.       In supporting clients to engage with citizens for improved results, the WBG can
draw on experiences from a history of multi-stakeholder engagement, participation,
governance, social accountability, and transparency work (see Box 1.1). Over time, the
institutional approach has evolved from multi-stakeholder consultations to one focused on
participation, social accountability, and improved governance, combined with increased
transparency. The challenge of enhancing CE is to understand in which contexts it can contribute
to improved results, such as improved quality and access to services for the poor or more
efficient resource allocation and use.

5.      Increasing feedback from the direct beneficiaries of WBG-supported projects is
part of the WBG’s approach to scaling up CE in 100 percent of projects that have clearly
identified beneficiaries. Feedback from project beneficiaries can contribute to learning from
implementation and allow midcourse correction, thereby improving outcomes.

Box 1.1. Evolution of the Concept of Citizen Engagement in WBG Operations: Openness, Participation,
Accountability, Results
The Bank began building relationships with civil society organizations (CSOs) in the late 1970s as part of a new
approach to multi-stakeholder engagement. In 1982, a formal World Bank-NGO Committee was established,
through which senior Bank managers could have regular and intensifying dialogue with leading international CSOs.a
Following on this dialogue, the Bank developed a reform agenda throughout the 1980s that included information
disclosure, environmental protection, and social development.

The concept of participation at the Bank was introduced with the launch of the Participation Sourcebook in 1996,
which established how participatory approaches—which include women, the poor, and marginalized groups—could
be integrated into Bank-supported projects. Building on this, the concept of social accountability emerged
throughout the 2000s. The 2004 World Development Report: Making Services Work for Poor People highlighted the
role of citizen voice in influencing the accountability relationships that make service delivery pro-poor.b The Bank’s
first Social Development Strategy, published in 2005, identified inclusion and cohesion as a pillar of socially
sustainable development.c In 2007 the Bank’s first Governance and Anticorruption (GAC) Strategy introduced
multi-stakeholder engagement with demand-side actors as one of its core principles, while the first GAC
benchmarking exercise in 2008 explicitly tracked “transparency, accountability, and participation” efforts in the
Bank. In 2012, the Update to the GAC Strategy made governance a focus area of WBG operations, including
initiatives that enable greater openness in governments and closer interaction among citizens, the private sector, and
the state. Transparency received a further boost through the Bank’s landmark Access to Information Policy, adopted
in 2011. In 2012, the Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA) was launched to build capacity for CSOs
to engage in social accountability initiatives.

The concept of citizen engagement began to emerge in the Bank in 2013, when the WBG hosted a conference on
citizen engagement with CIVICUS and InterAction to highlight the value of engaging with citizens for effective
development.d In 2013, the corporate change process adopted a recommendation to scale up engagement with
citizens for improved results. In addition, the WBG Strategy adopted in October 2013 undertook to engage more
systematically with citizens and beneficiaries and integrate citizen voice in development programs as a key
accelerator to achieve results. At the Annual Meetings in October 2013, President Kim undertook to include
beneficiary feedback in 100 percent of projects that have clearly identifiable beneficiaries.

6.      The public sector can learn from private sector feedback and measurement
approaches. Traditionally, the market mechanisms of supply/demand and market/consumer
research provided information on results and enhanced business accountability. The concept of
shared value recognizes that societal needs, not just conventional economic needs, define
markets (Porter and Kramer, 2011). Shared value measurement assesses progress and results,
generating actionable data and consumers’/suppliers’ insights to refine shared value strategies
(Porter and others, 2012). Feedback from those who are affected both directly and indirectly can
be analyzed with other evidence of development results to enrich the understanding of how
companies are performing. Technology is changing the ways in which companies engage and
interact with people, especially those at the base of the pyramid. But it is the consumers,
producers, or end beneficiaries, combined with these new technologies, that are defining a new
norm of interaction—one in which they play a central and active role (Long and Brindley, 2013).




                                                                                                                    6
A. Objectives
7.     The overall objective of this strategic framework is to mainstream CE in WBG-
supported policies, programs, projects, and advisory services and analytics where such
engagement can improve development results and, within the scope of these operations, to
contribute to sustainable processes for CE with governments and the private sector. In this
process, WBG-supported development interventions aim to build on and strengthen existing
engagement processes and systems between governments, the private sector, and citizens at the
national, regional, local, or sectoral level, as applicable.

8.     In operationalizing CE for improved results across its portfolio, the WBG aims to
achieve the following sub-objectives:
       (a) Scaling up context-specific CE across the WBG client engagement spectrum where
           such engagement can contribute to improved development outcomes;
       (b) Improving the quality and outcomes of mandatory engagement mechanisms
           (consultations and grievance redress mechanisms);
       (c) Achieving 100 percent CE in projects that have clearly identifiable beneficiaries
           (referred to as “beneficiary feedback”); and
       (d) Improving the monitoring and results reporting on CE, including beneficiary
           feedback, in WBG operations.

9.      This framework complements other related work. Staff guidance, “Piloting Citizen
Engagement in Projects,” developed by the Middle East and North Africa region, facilitated
piloting and scaling up citizen engagement in projects in FY14, and early feedback and findings
have informed this framework. The report by the Africa region, “Listening to Citizens, Learning
from Projects in Africa,” identified relevant and useful lessons learned that were integrated in
this work. The draft SDV Flagship Report “Opening the Black Box: Contextual Drivers of
Social Accountability Effectiveness” studies contextual influences on social accountability
interventions in detail; the high-level elements of this work have been integrated in Table 5.1 of
this framework. A proposed Policy Research Report, “Transparency, Citizen Engagement and
the Politics of Development,” is planned to further study selected aspects related to the interface
of information, CE, and political context.

B. Definitions
10.     The literature review and stocktake, including interviews of task team leaders (TTLs),
undertaken for the preparation of this framework confirmed the need for clear and consistent
definitions of citizen engagement and beneficiary feedback in the context of WBG-supported
operations.

11.     Citizens are understood as the ultimate client of government, development
institutions’, and private sector interventions in a country. Citizens can act as individuals or
organize themselves in associations and groups such as community-based groups, women’s
groups, or indigenous peoples’ groups. Civil society organizations (CSOs) can represent citizens
and can include organizations outside the public or for-profit sector, such as nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, foundations,
academia, associations, policy development and research institutes, trade unions, and social

                                                                                                 7
movements. In this context, the term citizen is not used in a legal sense but is understood in the
broad sense of referring to all people in a society or country in an inclusive and
nondiscriminatory way.

12.    Beneficiaries are defined as a subset of citizens directly targeted by and expected to
benefit from a development project. For the World Bank, clearly identified project
beneficiaries are understood to be a subset of citizens who directly benefit from a World Bank-
supported project (e.g., children who benefit from an immunization program, or households that
have a new piped water connection). As the large majority of such projects with direct
beneficiaries are provided through investment project financing (IPF) operations, the target of
achieving 100 percent beneficiary feedback in WBG projects that have clearly identifiable
beneficiaries will be tracked on the basis of the use of CE mechanisms in IPF.

13.     Citizen engagement is defined as the two-way interaction between citizens and
governments or the private sector within the scope of WBG interventions—policy dialogue,
programs, projects, and advisory services and analytics—that gives citizens a stake in
decision-making with the objective of improving the intermediate and final development
outcomes of the intervention. The spectrum of citizen engagement includes consultation;
collaboration and participation; and empowerment (see Figure 1.1). Access to information is a
necessary enabling condition, but it typically implies a one-way interaction only. Information-
sharing and awareness-raising activities alone, therefore, do not meet the definition of citizen
engagement. Closing the feedback loop (i.e., a two-way interaction providing a tangible response
to citizen feedback) is required to meet citizens’ expectations for change created by their
engagement, use their input to facilitate improved development outcomes, and justify the cost of
engaging with them.

14.     Beneficiary feedback, a subset of citizen engagement that is applicable to World
Bank IPF, refers to engagement (consultation, collaboration, and empowerment) with those
citizens who are clearly identifiable (direct) project beneficiaries during IPF preparation,
implementation, and evaluation. The objective is to integrate consultations, collaboration, and
empowerment activities into IPF project design and implementation to facilitate continuous
learning, improved project monitoring, and improved project outcomes.

15.     A number of mechanisms exist for engaging with citizens (see Annex I). They broadly
include (a) traditional consultation and feedback mechanisms, such as focus groups and
satisfaction surveys; (b) participatory mechanisms, such as community scorecards, participatory
planning, and budgeting; and (c) citizen-led mechanisms, such as community management or
user management committees. In addition, third-party monitoring mechanisms include social
audits, citizen report cards, public expenditure tracking surveys, and working with independent
monitoring entities such as information commissions, ombudsmen, or supreme audit institutions.

                     II. Summary of Evidence and Lessons Learned

A. Summary of Evidence
16.     This section reviews the current state of knowledge on the impact of CE initiatives
on development outcomes and on contextual factors that help determine how such
engagements shape development results. See Annex II for more details on the literature
review.

       1. Citizen Engagement and High-Level Development Goals

17.     Emerging evidence on CE suggests that there is largely untapped potential for CE
initiatives to influence high-level development goals such as poverty reduction. Wong’s
(2012) review of the impact evaluation results of World Bank-supported community-driven
development (CDD) programs over the past 25 years found generally positive evidence for
poverty reduction, poverty targeting, and increased access to services. Similarly, a program for
inclusion and empowerment, Brazil’s Bolsa Família conditional cash transfer (CCT) program,
has helped reduce inequality and extreme poverty and has improved education outcomes (Soares
and others, 2010). CCT programs often use participatory mechanisms to improve beneficiary
targeting and monitoring. For example, in Zambia, the targeting and approval systems are
designed through Public Welfare Assistance Scheme structures, using elected Community
Welfare Assistance Committees operating at the village level, which receive training and use a
multi-stage participatory process to identify the neediest 10 percent of households (Schubert,
2005). At the same time, such examples of impact on high-level development goals are still
limited because of the highly contextualized nature of CE, the need to establish stronger links
between citizen-led interventions and desired development outcomes (Holland and Thirkel,
2009), and the limited extent to which CE interventions can induce changes in policy, practice,
behavior, and power relations (Menocal and Sharma, 2008).

       2. Citizen Engagement and Intermediate and Final Development Outcomes

18.     There is stronger evidence that CE can lead to improved intermediate and final
development outcomes in suitable contexts through better targeting and implementation of
development interventions and improved monitoring of the performance of governments
and service providers. CE initiatives have had a positive impact on such outcomes in several
areas, including improved service delivery, public financial management, governance, natural
resource management, and social inclusion and empowerment, particularly for women and
marginalized or vulnerable populations.

19.    However, the literature in this area also points to caveats. In a smaller number of
documented cases, CE initiatives have either had no impact or have led to unintended adverse
outcomes. In a review of more than 100 case studies that mapped CE outcomes, Gaventa and
Barrett (2010) describe examples in which authorities either refused to respond to citizen
demands, or made tokenistic concessions such as declaring policy changes but not implementing
them.




                                                                                             10
          3. Impact of Citizen Engagement on Development Outcome Areas

20.     While there is a significant body of evidence that links CE with improved
intermediate and final results, the nature and rigor of such evidence varies by type of
development outcome. Based on case studies, randomized control trials, and participatory
evaluations, the strongest evidence attests to the impact of CE on the accessibility, coverage, and
quality of service delivery in health, education, infrastructure, and water and sanitation. There is
also substantive evidence that CE in public financial management processes has led to citizen
mobilization, more inclusive budget processes, and pro-poor fiscal policies. Most of such
evidence is based on qualitative case studies and case study analysis and to a lesser extent on
indices and rankings, though there are efforts to explore and substantiate links between increased
budget transparency and improved governance (Islam, 2003); positive development outcomes
(Fukuda-Parr and others, 2011); and higher credit ratings and lower spreads between borrowing
and lending rates (Hameed, 2011).

21.     In the area of natural resource management, the literature upholds, with exceptions,
the influence of CE on process-driven outcomes such as increasing participation of CSOs,
promoting disclosure of contracts, and demanding increased revenue transparency.
However, it is less clear about how citizen-centered initiatives have led to institutionalized
changes in policy outcomes or influenced corruption and poverty in resource-rich countries.
There is also substantial scope to improve evidence in this area, since these conclusions are
primarily based on studies of transparency and accountability initiatives and community-based
natural resource management systems. In some cases, such community-based natural resource
management systems have been found to contribute to more sustainable forest management or
more equitable water distribution, for instance, but the overall evidence is mixed (Mansuri and
Rao, 2013).

22.     A range of methods, including qualitative analysis, indices, randomized control
trials, and participatory evaluations, have been used to measure the impact of CE on
improved governance 3 and social inclusion and empowerment. However, the evidence is still
mixed and uneven for these areas. While it is difficult to draw an overarching conclusion for an
area as broad and complex as governance, a number of relevant interventions attest to impact on
intermediate outcomes such as changes in policy, regulation and reform, improved transparency,
more active community-level participation, reduced corruption, and improved responsiveness to
citizen demands. Similarly, even though there is consensus about the positive economic impact
of CCT and CDD programs/projects, their influence on promoting inclusiveness, social cohesion,
and empowerment is subject to caveats. In the same vein, a growing body of evidence suggests
that increased female participation in self-help groups and other participatory development
programs improves economic outcomes (Meier zu Selhausen, 2012; Kandpal and Baylis, 2013;
Beath and others, 2010; Blattman and others, 2013; Oxfam, 2013). Still, mobilization of such
groups can at times also exclude poor, less educated, or more marginalized women and does not
always translate into greater empowerment or a shift in norms that can drive wider social and
political changes (Hallward-Dreimeier and Hasan, 2013; Weldon and Htun, 2013; Hasan and
Tanzer, 2013; and UN Women, 2011).

    Governance is defined as “...the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised. This includes the
    process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate
    and implement sound policies; and the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social
    interactions among them” (Kaufmann and Kraay, 2007).
                                                                                                                            11
           4. Contextual Factors that Influence the Impact of Citizen Engagement Initiatives

23.     The literature points toward a growing recognition that context-specific factors are
essential to understand why and how CE interventions can contribute to improved
intermediate and final development outcomes (O’Meally, 2014; Buckenya and others,
2012). One of these factors is the availability of timely, user-friendly, reliable, and
comprehensive information, as a precondition for effective CE. Examples from countries with
highly developed information campaigns and from government programs in India and South
Africa show the role of greater transparency in mobilizing citizen-centered interventions. At the
same time, Lieberman and others, (2014) and Banerjee and others (2010) describe campaigns on
information sharing and dissemination interventions that had no perceptible impact on civic
participation or service delivery, and Hubbard (2007), Fox (2007), and Darch and Underwood
(2010) question whether access to information by itself can translate into broader social,
economic, and political outcomes. Table 2.1 provides a broad overview of additional factors that
may be of relevance to analyzing and designing context-specific CE initiatives.

                  Table 2.1. Contextual Factors that Affect Outcomes of CE Initiatives

                   -   Capabilities (economic, human, social, political, technical) to engage in the “upstream” (policy
                       formulation) as well as “downstream” (implementation) stages of the engagement process.
                   -   Strong, broad-based, and recognized leadership to engage on the development issue.

Willingness        -   Willingness of state functionaries (elected officials/bureaucratic staff/service providers) to (a) engage
                       with citizens, and (b) respond to citizens’ feedback (as determined by interests, ideology, incentives,

24.     Additional context factors play a role in the effectiveness of CE initiatives in specific
outcome areas. For example, community characteristics such as inequality, likelihood of elite
capture, and capacity to participate in development processes influence the effectiveness of CE
in natural resource management and CDD. In the area of public service delivery, CE outcomes
depend on factors such as social norms and values, service characteristics, the degree of choice
of service provider, or circumstances influencing the performance of service providers. Legal
frameworks and the timing of citizen input into budget processes, among other aspects,
determine the impact of CE on public financial management. The organizational culture of
public institutions, and the mandate and strength of oversight institutions such as the judiciary,
supreme audit institutions, and anticorruption agencies, influence CE outcomes in the area of
governance. Table 2.2 provides an overview of additional context factors by outcome area,
identified through the literature review.

Public service delivery         - Service characteristics, such as availability of information on and complexity of the service
                                  provided.
                              -   Influence of citizen feedback on the outcomes of service provision vis-à-vis such factors as
                                  capacity of service providers.
                              -   Accessibility/quality of services affiliated with ideologies and values (e.g., water, sanitation).
                                  Concerns about service provision in such areas can emerge into socially and politically
                                  salient issues.
                              -   Institutional capacity, mandate, and incentives to respond to citizen feedback.
                              -   Existence/effectiveness of oversight mechanisms to ensure responsiveness to citizen
                                  feedback.
                              -   Cultural and social factors that affect decision-making processes (e.g., gender, wealth,
                                  ethnicity, and education).
                              -   Risks of providing feedback or engaging with service providers (e.g., retribution by the
                                  service personnel on whom citizens depend)
                              -   Limited or no choice of service providers (e.g., in geographically remote areas).
Public financial              -   Existence of legal frameworks that require or facilitate opportunities for CE in budget
management                        processes.
                              -   Stage of budget process and timing of citizen input: early CE during budget preparation (vs.
                                  execution) increases opportunities for impact.
                              -   Government structure: governments with existing participatory processes are more likely to
                                  be open to a broader range of CE approaches.
                              -   Perceived legitimacy of citizen input: citizen input that is collective/representative may lead
                                  to greater government responsiveness in budget processes than individual input.
Governance                    -   Organizational culture of public institutions. (e.g., clarity and effectiveness of policies,
                                  procedures, and monitoring and control systems).
                              -   Form of corruption: extortive corruption practices are more likely than collusive corruption
                                  practices to motivate citizen action.
                              -   Cultural values such as gift-giving or nepotism.
                              -   Mandate and strength of oversight institutions, including legislature, judiciary, supreme audit
                                  institutions, and anticorruption agencies.
                              -   Independence and proactivity of media.
                              -   Degree of decentralization, effectiveness of local institutions, and extent of central
                                  government oversight.
Natural resource              -   Resource value: high resource value/economic dependence provides fewer incentives for
management                        devolution of authority to local communities.
                              -   Costs/benefits for relevant stakeholders; e.g., agreement on revenue sharing could help to
                                  motivate community engagement.
                              -   Community characteristics, such as high inequality, likelihood of elite capture, limited
                                  information flows, or low capacity.
                              -   Legal framework and reporting requirements on access to and ownership, allocation, and
                                  control of natural resources.
                              -   Central government support for local management of natural resources, and capacity to
                                  negotiate favorable concessions and legal agreements.
                              -   Existence/efficacy of the private sector’s attempts to understand and address the needs of
                                  local communities.
Social inclusion and          -   Community characteristics such as transparency of decision-making rules, identification of
empowerment                       the poor, and degree of equality.
                              -   Community capacity to implement projects and utilize CE mechanisms effectively.
                              -   Existence of measures to prevent elite capture (such as contested election of local leaders).
                              -   Social norms and incentives for the inclusion of women and other vulnerable and
                                  marginalized groups.
                              -   Commitment of state actors to decentralization and empowerment of local governments and
                                  communities.

25.    While political context matters, entry points for CE exist in all types of polities. A
higher level of democratization creates more space for CE activities and may facilitate better
outcomes. At the same time, the influence of democratic approaches and institutions on CE
                                                                                           14
outcomes, versus that of informal institutions and other types of political settlement, merits
further study (Crook and Booth, 2011). CE can emerge in other political contexts, including less
democratic or so-called “closed polities,” 4 where electoral accountability is typically missing and
space for civil society is often controlled. In such cases, avenues for CE may exist in areas where
governments are willing to share information and development objectives are aligned—for
example, for service provision or environmental protection. Decentralized government structures
and independent oversight institutions provide additional entry points for CE in such contexts.

26.     CE in fragile contexts requires careful design. Fragile and conflict-affected settings are
typically characterized by the absence or weakness of government institutions, lack of a common
understanding of the social contract, and, in some cases, limited state authority over territory. In
such contexts, engaging with citizens is not without risk, as it can contribute to further fragility
or conflict and can entail greater personal risk for those engaged. At the same time, opportunities
for CE can be explored in settings where there is precedent for state-citizen interaction, local
government structures exist, or there are local customary institutions and other intermediaries
that have the government’s trust and the capability to mobilize citizens. “Windows of
opportunity” such as elections or other transitions provide additional openings for public
engagement.

27.      Gender dynamics can be consequential for citizen engagement outcomes. Social
norms that reinforce negative stereotypes about women’s ability to contribute to participatory
initiatives or that restrict them from participating in public spaces may not be favorable for
female participation in decision-making processes. Setting minimum quotas for women’s
participation, working with separate women’s groups, and working through alternate formal and
informal channels can help to address such gender imbalances in participation (World Bank,
2012e). While in some cases a higher proportion of women in decision-making bodies, such as
forest management groups in India, has been associated with improved outcomes (Agarwal,
2009), outcomes of female participation in CE initiatives have been found to also depend on such
factors as financial autonomy and representation of the poorest and most vulnerable women.


B. Stocktaking Findings
28.    This section presents a synopsis of the lessons learned from World Bank experiences
in using CE approaches in projects, drawing on reviews and studies, the stocktaking
undertaken for this framework (see Annex III), and regional experiences (Annex IV).

29.     Most CE activities in World Bank-supported projects have been motivated by
application of safeguard policies. The vast majority of projects reviewed have triggered one of
the three safeguard operational policies (OP 4.01, Environmental Assessment; OP 4.10,
Involuntary Resettlement; and OP 4.12, Indigenous Peoples) that require CE through
consultations and grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs). This fact highlights significant
potential for scaling up non-mandatory CE mechanisms in World Bank Group-supported
projects and for moving from compliance to systematically integrating citizens’ voices in
operations for improved results. In this context, there are opportunities to use CE more
systematically for course correction during project implementation (World Bank, 2014b).

    Draft SDV Flagship Study, forthcoming.
                                                                                                 15
30.     CE already occurs mostly during project preparation, and consultations are the
primary mechanism for engagement, largely reflecting safeguard requirements. This
framework therefore pursues a systematic approach to scale up CE during implementation to
realize opportunities for improving project outcomes through learning and mid-course
correction.

31.     CE is implemented in all sectors and WBG geographical regions (see Annexes III and
IV), so that there are numerous opportunities for systematically identifying entry points to scale
up CE where it can contribute to improved results. Some regions, including East and South Asia,
have a long history of using participatory development processes, while the Middle East and
North Africa region has, as a result of recent political transitions, new opportunities to scale up
CE. Similarly, CE mechanisms can be found in projects across all sectors, but in some regions,
the degree of implementation has been found to vary significantly by sector. 5

32.      The majority of projects that currently include CE activities are service delivery
projects. As the World Bank has long experience with CE in service delivery projects, this can
become a cornerstone of mainstreaming CE in Bank-supported operations. CE mechanisms are
also used in natural resource management and social inclusion projects. Interestingly,
governance and public financial management projects have included relatively fewer CE
activities, pointing to important opportunities for learning from experience and scaling up CE
where it can improve outcomes.

33.     CE outcomes are not monitored systematically, and results reporting during project
implementation is irregular. A review of reporting through Implementation Status and Results
reports (ISRs) in FY13 for investment lending operations approved in FY10 found that 32
percent of total approved projects reported on CE results indicators in ISRs. Interestingly, the
share of results reporting is higher in fragile and conflict-affected states (45 percent). This fact
highlights opportunities for the use of CE results indicators to set incentives for adequate
monitoring and reporting. TTLs confirmed that the use of results indicators can help focus
attention on CE during project implementation.

34.     Most CE takes place at the project level; there are only a few examples of country-
level approaches to CE for improved results. Some of the larger WBG-supported CDD-type
projects in, for example, India or Indonesia have arguably achieved regional or national scale. To
harness the opportunities of CE at larger scale, country-level and cross-sectoral approaches can
be scaled up where they can contribute to improved development outcomes. Examples of
country-level approaches to CE in the World Bank portfolio include the Central Asia Citizen
Engagement Framework and the Cambodia Social Accountability Framework (see Annex IV).




5
    The work by the Africa region found that CDD-type projects generally included the most sophisticated instruments for
    community involvement in decision-making and monitoring, while certain infrastructure projects did not always follow
    through on implementing the CE mechanisms included at project design, or on reporting.
                                                                                                                    16
C. Lessons Learned
35.     Country context is a key determinant for the design and outcome of CE. As the
summary of evidence has shown, government and citizen willingness and capacity to engage, as
well as the enabling environment, economic, cultural, and social factors, and the history of
government-citizen interaction, are important factors in determining the appropriate entry point
and mechanism for CE and in influencing its outcome. For example, a number of countries in
Africa that recently adopted decentralization legislation saw an increase in CE instruments, albeit
with differences in implementation depending on the characteristics of local jurisdictions (see
Annex IV). At the same time, CE has also been found to work in World Bank-supported projects
even in countries that do not have an enabling environment for large-scale CE (World Bank,
2014b). The success of CE is also influenced by the timing and degree of political transitions,
which can create challenges or opportunities. For example, the political transition in parts of the
Middle East and North Africa region has provided opportunities to position citizen participation
as part of a sustainable approach to development interventions. Identifying the right entry points
for CE for improved results therefore requires analysis and understanding of the relevant
country, sector, and local contexts. While context-specific entry points for CE exist in all country
types, engagement approaches differ—for example, approaches in fragile and conflict-affected
states differ from those in middle-income countries.

36.     Government ownership matters for sustainable engagement processes. For some
Bank-supported projects, government-citizen engagement processes created or strengthened as
part of the project were successfully sustained beyond the life of the project; 6 for others,
opportunities for engagement receded after projects closed. This highlights the importance of
government ownership of these processes and the need to think through the sustainability of
engagement processes from the beginning. Opportunities to build on and strengthen existing
country institutions and sectorwide approaches need to be systematically explored with client
governments during the design of operations. Incentives for governments to support CE include
greater legitimacy and the potential to achieve improved results.

37.     The objectives for CE need to be clear, and CE needs to be integrated into project
design, answering questions such as how CE activities can support the achievement of project
development objectives, and which mechanisms at what stage in the project cycle are best suited
in the specific country, sector, or local context. Currently, objectives for CE activities are not
always clearly articulated either conceptually or vis-à-vis those engaged, so that it is hard to
monitor their outcomes.

38.     Early successes help to create trust and buy-in from all stakeholders. The capacity of
and commitment by governments, citizens, and other stakeholders have been found to increase
significantly once the initial results of CE have been achieved, typically close to midterm. Thus
such results can be a driver for scaling up CE activities. Similarly, additional financing or
repeater projects are more effective in recording the early results of CE, as are projects that used
multiple entry points for engagement instead of one-off tools. In addition, trust is a key factor:
citizens need to trust that governments will take their feedback into account to the extent
possible, and governments need to have confidence that citizen feedback reflects pressing needs
and priorities.

6
    An example is the CDD PNPM project in Indonesia.
                                                                                                 17
39.     Multipronged and iterative approaches to CE tend to achieve more sustainable
results. Lessons learned from literature and the stocktaking found that CE approaches that
support both supply- and demand-side measures, use a combination of engagement methods, and
support CE over the long term tend to achieve more sustainable results. Repeater projects
strengthen both supply- and demand-side capacity, enjoy buy-in from earlier results achieved,
and in some cases contribute to building institutions that can be used for cross-sectoral
engagement approaches.

40.      There is strong demand for systematic guidance and support to mainstream CE in
WBG-supported operations. Bank staff have noted the importance of ongoing designated
technical support, and of improved and systematic access to Bank knowledge on CE. The
changing composition of Bank teams has been mentioned as an obstacle to passing along
institutional knowledge and maintaining focus on CE activities. To ensure adequate attention to
CE throughout the project cycle, staff guidance for IPF has been updated to include a set of
indicative results indicators for CE. Illustrative results chains are being developed for five
outcome areas including public service delivery, public financial management, governance,
natural resource management and social inclusion and empowerment to help task teams think
through their project results chain as they consider integration of citizen engagement activities in
their project. 7

41.     Technology is not widely used to support CE activities in WBG-supported
operations. The use of ICT depends on the nature of the project, the size of the project area, and
the number of beneficiaries. It also depends on the approach and context, as in some cases direct
interaction between project implementation units and beneficiaries and citizens is deemed vital
by staff to build needed relationships, particularly during the initial stages of the project. In
projects where ICT is used to engage with citizens, the use of websites or web portals is most
prevalent, followed by mobile short message service (SMS). Technology is often cited as
expensive to incorporate into a project; however, experience demonstrates that when used in the
right context and processes, it has saved time, reduced costs, and increased outreach.

42.     Time has been cited as a key constraining factor to building CE into project design.
TTLs unanimously noted that meaningful CE requires adequate time for design, implementation,
and closing the feedback loop—that is, informing those engaged how the information they
provided has been used. Some TTLs also point to the relatively small number of staff with CE
skills as a factor to consider in scaling up CE across WBG-supported operations.

43.      Governments are borrowing for CE activities in priority sectors. Some staff in the
Africa region noted inadequate funding as a barrier to implementing CE in World Bank-
supported projects. At the same time, the main source of funding for CE activities has been
project components. WBG experience demonstrates that a government’s willingness to engage is
highest when CE is incorporated into project components that are discussed and agreed upon
during project design. Counterpart funding is also a significant source of funding for CE
activities. Additionally, World Bank budget and trust funds have supported such work, the latter
to a lesser extent and primarily to pilot CE activities.

7
    Given the considerable challenges around isolating and measuring CE impact, results chains will help governments and staff
    think through the objectives and targeted outcomes of CE in the context of a specific development operation. Results chains
    will not provide a rigorous impact analysis of CE in operations, which requires a longer time horizon.
                                                                                                                           18
D. Guiding Principles
44.    This framework does not propose new mandatory policies but builds on entry points
for CE from existing WBG policies and identifies additional context-specific entry points
for scaling up CE across all types of operations where such engagement can improve
development outcomes. Drawing on the lessons learned from the literature review and the
stocktaking, this framework is guided by five higher-level principles: it is results-focused, it
involves engaging throughout the operational cycle, it seeks to strengthen country systems for
engagement, it is context-specific, and it is gradual.

       •   Results-focused. CE is not without cost; it requires the allocation of resources, time,
           and effort to design and implement appropriate engagement mechanisms. For these
           reasons, investments in CE in WBG-supported operations need to be undertaken
           where they can contribute to improved development outcomes. Operationalizing this
           approach entails identifying strategic entry points where CE can make the strongest
           contribution to development outcomes, being clear about the objectives of engaging
           with citizens, and understanding the results chains for CE in the specific context of
           the operation. As the stocktaking has shown, the majority of WBG-supported
           operations with CE pursue development objectives in the outcome areas of improved
           service delivery, public financial management, governance, natural resource
           management, and social inclusion. For each of these outcome areas, sample results
           chains will be made available to help task teams examine their project results chain as
           they consider integration of citizen engagement activities in their project. An
           indicative list of outcome indicators that can be used in results frameworks for
           reporting progress on implementing CE has been included in the updated Results
           Framework and M&E Guidance Note for IPF.

       •   Engagement throughout the operational cycle. While consultations are frequently
           used during World Bank program and project preparation, engagement is less
           systematic during implementation, except in CDD projects. This framework therefore
           promotes an approach to increase CE during program and project preparation,
           implementation, and evaluation, to contribute to improved outcomes.

       •   Strengthening country systems for CE within the scope of WBG operations. To
           facilitate sustainable development outcomes, including those of engagement
           processes, WBG-supported operations aim to support and strengthen government
           systems for engaging with citizens. The scope of such support needs to be agreed
           with client governments, and it varies by type of operation. For example, a
           development policy lending (DPL) operation can facilitate the adoption of national
           legislation on participatory budgeting or procurement monitoring, while an IPF
           operation can contribute to building effective feedback and recourse mechanisms to
           improve service delivery in specific sectors or empower citizens at the local level to
           participate in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of development
           interventions.


                                                                                               19
       •   Context-specific. As has been discussed, evidence shows that successful CE requires
           a context-specific approach and adequate capacity and willingness of governments
           and citizens to engage. Governments need to make relevant information available to
           citizens in accessible and understandable formats, and to build the capacity and
           systems to provide adequate responses to citizen feedback. Citizens need to acquire
           minimum skills to engage, and they need to be interested in the issue.

       •   Gradual, iterative, and scalable. Because of the complex nature of CE, the time
           required to build adequate capacity for engagement where it does not yet exist, and
           the need for continuous learning, the framework proposes a gradual approach to
           mainstreaming CE in WBG-supported operations. This approach is informed by the
           evidence and lessons learned from internal and external impact studies, the
           stocktaking (see Chapter III and Annex II), and complementary regional initiatives
           (see Annex IV). In addition, the approach has been elaborated in parallel to and in
           close collaboration with the rollout of regional pilots in mainstreaming CE in WBG-
           supported operations, allowing for real-time learning from the pilots. The framework
           proposes to take stock of progress and lessons from the pilots every six months to
           make this an iterative and continuous learning process and allow for adjustments.

45.     This framework has been developed in partnership with internal and external
partners. Internally, a CE change subgroup, followed by a WBG-wide CE working group, has
provided substantive inputs. Externally, the framework draws on the expertise from external
stakeholders provided through a multipronged outreach strategy, including (a) a web-based
consultation space; (b) several dialogues in capitals and country offices; and (c) guidance from
an external Advisory Council comprising representatives from CSOs, academia, governments,
the private sector, and development partners. The partnership approach will continue during the
implementation period.

               III. Entry Points for Mainstreaming Citizen Engagement in WBG
                                Operations for Improved Results
46.    The WBG Strategy promotes a more evidence-based and selective engagement
model with countries. At its core, the new engagement model seeks to maximize the use of
evidence and analysis to help country governments focus on the challenges of meeting the goals
of eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner, in the
context of country ownership and national priorities, and in coordination with other development
partners. The new engagement model includes a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and a
Country Partnership Framework (CPF). 8 The CPF process includes a performance and learning
review at midterm and a completion and learning review at completion. The SCD and CPF are
WBG products that cover World Bank, IFC, and MIGA analyses and operations.

47.     A strategic approach to CE in WBG-supported operations for improved results
includes three steps (a) the identification of the priority development results a country needs to
achieve in the context of the goals and its development strategy; (b) the identification of areas in
which CE can contribute most to the targeted development results at the country level; and (c)
the inclusion of CE in WBG-supported operations that support the achievement of such results,
anchored in the CPF.

48.    Entry points for CE for improved results exist across the WBG product portfolio,
including diagnostic, strategic, and operational portfolio products (see Figure 3.1). There are CE
entry points throughout the product cycle of all of these operations, from preparation/design to
implementation and monitoring and evaluation.

    Starting on July 1, 2014, the Country Partnership Framework replaced the Country Partnership/Assistance Strategies.
                                                                                                                          21
49.     Over time, this approach can lead to a programmatic, cross-sectoral approach for
government engagement with citizens. There are opportunities and entry points for CE not
only at the country level, but also at the programmatic level—for example, systematic CE to
improve service delivery across several infrastructure sectors. Furthermore, entry points for CE
also exist in each World Bank operational product (see Table 3.1).

50.   Operationalizing CE in each of these instruments requires the following:

      (a) Context analysis. Defining the entry points for engaging with citizens requires an
          analysis of the specific country, sector, and program/project context. This
          understanding can be gained by analyzing such factors as political, economic,
          cultural, environmental, and social contexts, including supply- and demand-side
          factors (see Table 2.1) that influence CE in the country and operation (see Table 3.2).
          Existing diagnostic processes and analyses, such as the SCD, can be leveraged for
          such an analysis.

      (b) Stakeholder mapping. All forms of CE require a stakeholder mapping to facilitate
          targeting engagement mechanisms and understanding the objectives, interests, and
          incentives of key stakeholders. For consultations, representative stakeholders,
          including representatives of marginalized and vulnerable groups, need to be identified
          at the national, regional, and local levels as applicable. For participatory approaches,
          target groups and champions need to be identified. Due consideration needs to be
          given to principles of inclusivity and representation, as well as to the capacity and
          willingness of the identified target groups to engage. Aspects of political patronage
          and potential elite capture also require consideration. Existing stakeholder mapping
          processes—for example, for client surveys—can be leveraged for this purpose,
          although a detailed understanding of the relevant stakeholders in the context of the
          operation is required to achieve results.

      (c) Clear definition and communication of the objectives for CE. The objectives of
          engaging with citizens need to be clearly defined and to be realistic in terms of what
          they can achieve. For this purpose, guidance will be made available to help task teams
          work through the results chain for the planned operation in collaboration with client
          governments, identifying entry points where engaging with citizens has the potential
          to improve program or project outcomes. Once defined, the objectives of CE need to
          be clearly communicated to those to be engaged, and documented in operational
          documents.

      (d) Tailored design of engagement level and mechanisms. The objectives, context
          analysis, and stakeholder mapping can inform the appropriate level and mechanism of
          CE. Where possible, it is desirable to pursue opportunities for CE in operations that
          support sustainable national processes for CE with governments and the private
          sector. However, in countries and environments where the experience, capacity, or
          willingness to engage with citizens is limited, pragmatic entry points for engagement
          may be at the level of an individual investment project. Table 3.2 provides an
          overview of engagement mechanisms along various types of CE approaches and a
          high-level outline of relevant context factors that can inform the choice of
          mechanism.

      (e) Improved results frameworks, indicators, and reporting. There is a need for more
          systematic monitoring of the outcomes of engagement across the product portfolio.
          The planned integration of CE results indicators into program and project results


                                                                                               23
               frameworks and reporting on them more consistently during implementation and
               evaluation will help address this point (see Chapter VII).

The next section summarizes key entry points and opportunities for CE in the various World
Bank products.

engagement mechanisms it is not included in the corporate definition of CE (see Chapter II).




                                                                                                                    24
A. Systematic Country Diagnostic
51.    The objectives of CE in the SCD process are threefold: first, stakeholder
consultations including citizens can improve the analytic focus of the SCD by providing
information about citizens’ perceptions of the country’s key development challenges. Second,
collaboration with local think-tanks or universities can improve the quality of the SCD’s analytic
work. Third, the SCD provides an opportunity to identify country-specific areas of development
in which CE can help to address constraints and improve development results.

52.      During the preparation of the SCD, stakeholder consultations including citizens can
provide an informative grassroots perspective on the country’s development challenges, fill
information and data gaps, validate hypotheses, and improve the understanding of context. The
SCD is developed in close consultation with the government and is expected to be informed by
inputs and feedback from country partners (such as private sector, governments, researchers, or
institutions) and citizens. Consulting citizens, CSOs, media, the private sector, and other
stakeholders through, for example, online platforms, surveys, townhall meetings, or focus group
discussions can yield important insights on perceived and actual development challenges in a
country, their relative rankings, and perceived priority solutions. Consultations also create
ownership around the SCD process. Consultations should follow good practice principles, be
announced well in advance to allow for adequate preparation of those consulted and for input,
and respect the principles of stakeholder diversity and representativeness (see Box 3.1).

Box 3.1. Guiding Principles for Including CE in SCDs
The following principles can guide task teams in incorporating CE in SCDs:
  • Country context. Understanding the local context and political economy factors are key when considering CE
      in SCDs.
  • Stakeholder mapping. When mapping relevant stakeholders for engagement, it is useful to differentiate
      between (a) stakeholders who can provide analytical input to the SCD (such as local universities, think-tanks,
      media, the private sector), and (b) stakeholders who need to be consulted to understand citizen perceptions of
      development challenges (CSOs, community organizations, etc.). Principles of diversity and representativeness
      also need to be respected when engaging citizens as part of the SCD process.
  • Clarity of objective. It is important to be clear on the scope of citizens’ engagement to avoid unrealistic
      expectations.
  • Government support. Wherever possible, existing national and local engagement processes should be used.
  • Process and timeline. Citizens should have at least one month’s notice of upcoming consultations and
      available avenues for engagement.
  • Closing the feedback loop. Documenting consultations and reporting back how citizen feedback has been
      used to inform the SCD process needs to be an integral part of engaging citizens in the SCD process.

53.    Collaboration with local universities, think-tanks, or the private sector can improve
the quality and relevance of the SCD. Local universities may be able to provide an in-depth
understanding of specific sector issues, as well as local data. The local private sector can provide
a view on issues such as obstacles to competitiveness and the investment climate. Think-tanks
can contribute potential work on overcoming core development challenges. Such collaboration
can occur both at the design stage of the SCD to inform the concept and focus areas of the SCD,
and during the elaboration of the SCD itself.


                                                                                                                 25
   54.     SCDs can provide an opportunity for analytic work related to areas in which CE
   can contribute to development results. In the process of identifying a country’s key
   development challenges, the SCD may identify areas in which CE can strongly contribute to
   improved governance and results—for example, through improving accountability in public
   service delivery and transparency in public policy and expenditure. In such cases, an analysis of
   the enabling legislation for citizen participation, such as laws related to access to information or
   participatory budgeting, and of existing country systems, can help inform the SCD. Where
   appropriate, diagnostic work can also assess non-legislated spaces and processes for stakeholders
   to collaborate with authorities in areas such as third-party monitoring of procurement, or
   collaboration in or feedback on service provision. Understanding a country’s track record in
   citizen participation and collaboration between government and the private sector can also
   inform the design of future development solutions.

   55.     Ongoing learning from early SCD processes will further inform the approach to CE
   in SCDs. A part of the WBG’s new approach to inform country partnerships, consultations and
   participatory approaches in the preparation of early SCDs provide an opportunity to learn and
   further refine guidance to WBG staff. For example, one SCD being prepared in a post-conflict
   country has identified the lack of trust between the state and its people as an important obstacle
   for progress on poverty reduction, increasing shared prosperity, and regional integration.

   B. Country Partnership Framework
   56.     CE in the CPF process has two objectives: (a) to inform and improve decision-making
   about the targeting and expected outcomes of the CPF, and (b) to include CE in programs and
   projects where it can improve development outcomes.

   57.     Stakeholder engagement is an integral part of the CPF process. The CPF process
   involves a dialogue with the country authorities, and with citizens and other stakeholders, about
   the country’s development program. Stakeholder engagement in the CPF process should be
   anchored in national engagement processes around the government’s own national development
   plan. Engagement processes focus on the views of governments, partners, and citizens on how
   the WBG can best support the objectives and actions set out in the SCD and the government’s
   development strategy (see Box 3.2 on the experience with consultations on Country Assistance
   Strategies). Tools for engagement in the CPF process include consultations through townhall
   meetings, workshops, focus groups or interviews, surveys, websites, GRMs, third-party
   monitoring, social audits, citizen report cards, and community scorecards. Documenting
   consultations and closing the feedback loop (that is, informing those consulted how their
   feedback has been used) is an important guiding principle.


Box 3.2. Consultations on Country Assistance Strategies (CASs)

In FY10-12, civil society participated in 82 percent of the 129 CAS-related products approved by the Board of Executive
Directors. For example, extensive structured consultations for the 2009-2011 CAS for Burkina Faso involved meetings
with multiple stakeholders, including CSOs, rural communities, local municipalities, universities, media, parliament, and
the private sector. Some key areas of consensus that emerged from these consultations included the proposition that the
World Bank should maintain an appropriate balance between general budget support and project lending, including direct
support to local communities, and that it should adopt a better communication strategy in the country.


                                                                                                                    26

58.     Depending on the country context, the CPF can include CE in programs and
projects and support national engagement processes that have the potential to contribute to
improved development outcomes. The entry points and extent of CE activities to be included in
the CPF depend on the dialogue between the WBG and the client government, based on country
demand and on the areas that are most critical to achieving the two goals of ending poverty and
promoting shared prosperity sustainably. For example, in countries where the quality of service
delivery in sectors such as health, education, and infrastructure provision has been identified as a
key constraint to eradicating poverty and increasing shared prosperity, including CE in service
delivery projects can help governments to improve service provision for citizens. Similarly, in
countries where governance has been identified as an obstacle to development, CPF support
could include assistance for strengthening national engagement and accountability processes—
for example, support to access to information legislation, or capacity building for transparency
and accountability institutions, legislatures, and supreme audit institutions. The WBG
operational portfolio in Mongolia, for example, has contributed to improving the overall
anticorruption framework by bolstering the functional system of income-and-asset declaration
and disclosure and the code of conduct framework for conflict-of-interest prevention and
resolution.

59.     When analyzing entry points for CE at the country level, country context factors
need to be taken into account (see Table 3.1). For example, in countries with a limited history
of CE, pragmatic initial entry points for CE may be in service delivery initiatives, while more
complex engagements, such as in participatory budgeting, would likely require additional time,
capacity, and trust among all actors. The World Bank’s approach in Central Asia (see Annex
IV.C.) is a good example of a context-specific approach to mainstreaming CE in country
programs. Initiated with the objective of contributing to improved transparency and governance,
the Central Asia Citizen Engagement Framework has become a valuable tool to manage risk in
operations by introducing third-party monitoring and incorporating CE in country- and project-
level operations.

60.    Citizen feedback can inform performance and learning reviews during CPF
implementation. Potential entry points for CE in performance and learning reviews include the
following:
         (a) A client and citizen satisfaction survey addressing the implementation of the CPF to
             date;
         (b) Focus groups with representative stakeholders of the areas of CPF implementation on
             lessons learned to date;
         (c) An independent, third-party assessment (e.g., by CSOs, academia, independent
             experts) of results achieved to date (see Box 3.3.);
         (d) Collaboration with local academics, think-tanks, CSOs, foundations, and so on in
             collecting results data.

61.     Similarly, citizen voices can contribute to the completion and learning reviews. CAS
completion reports are based on a self-assessment by the World Bank country team, which also
solicits feedback from the government. Potential future entry points for CE in the CPF
completion learning review can include the following:

                                                                                                 27
          (a) A client and citizen satisfaction survey addressing the results and implementation of
              the CPF;
          (b) Direct feedback from CSOs and other stakeholders on the results and implementation
              of the CPF program to inform the World Bank’s self-assessment;
          (c) Governments can be encouraged to solicit feedback from citizens on the results
              achieved by the CPF program;
          (d) An independent third-party evaluation on the results of the CPF program by CSOs,
              academia, independent experts, and others (see Box 3.3).

Box 3.3. Third-Party Monitoring of the World Bank’s CAS for Bangladesh 2011-2014

Objectives. The 2011-2014 CAS for Bangladesh includes third-party monitoring of CAS implementation by
foundations, CSOs, and independent experts to:
    • Ensure a continuous focus on progress towards results;
    • Promote greater demand for good governance and lower tolerance of corruption over the long term;
    • Strengthen domestic accountability mechanisms; and
    • Provide avenues for citizens to monitor the delivery and quality of services.
CE tools such as community score cards, focus group discussions, and social audits were used to implement third-
party monitoring.

Results. Preliminary findings of a third-party monitoring report to verify progress on selected CAS indicators for
public programs and projects indicate that World Bank funds have been used effectively for the following:
     • Increased access to roads, bringing improved access to health, education services, and economic
          opportunities;
     • Multifunctional shelters that saved thousands of lives in the recent cyclones;
     • Wide coverage of communities with access to safe drinking water; and
     • Promoting the satisfaction of women who have gained access to short-term employment.
At the same time, the report identifies additional opportunities for active beneficiary involvement and rigorous
internal supervision of the implementation of public projects and programs on the ground.

62.     Opportunities exist to enhance CE in CAS/CPF products and monitor their
outcomes through results indicators. Of the 34 CAS products submitted to the Board in
FY12, 9 half included support to outcomes that enable or include CE in the CAS program, 10 and
the majority included in their results frameworks results indicators related to CE. The majority of
CAS-supported outcomes and indicators related to CE refer to information disclosure; only five
CAS products included outcomes and indicators involving collaboration with citizens, only two
included activities related to empowerment of citizens and local communities, and only one
included an explicit outcome to strengthen country systems to implement gender and social
inclusion policies and frameworks. Country-level results indicators related to CE were used
mainly for information and consultation activities, while project-level results indicators were
used in the area of collaboration with and empowerment of citizens. These findings point to
scope for exploring additional entry points for CE across WBG-supported country programs
where such engagement can contribute to improved results, and to the need for an improved
understanding of how collaboration and empowerment of citizens might contribute to achieving
country-level outcomes.
9
     Products include Interim Strategy Notes, CAS/CPS, and CAS/CPS progress reports.
10
     Outcomes supported by CAS products enabling or involving CE include increased transparency in budget and procurement
     processes, improved accountability of institutions, natural resource management, public service monitoring, access to
     infrastructure, and social inclusion.

                                                                                                                      28
C. Policy Dialogue
63.     Policy and reform dialogue provides opportunities for structured interaction with
citizens. The World Bank does not mandate citizen voice and participation in the general policy
and reform dialogue it conducts in a country. At the same time, it regularly consults with the
major development stakeholders and partners in a country where it leads an active reform
dialogue, and it expects the governments to do the same. In addition, taking the voices of citizens
and their representatives into account can inform and contribute to the sustainability of
governments’ policy decisions.

64.     Opportunities exist to test entry points for increased CE in the preparation,
implementation, and evaluation of World Bank-supported policy and reform dialogues
with a view to improving their quality and outcomes, including capturing the contribution of
citizens to policy adoption and outcomes. Specifically, the World Bank can support the
following:
        (a) Assessments and analytic work on a country’s structures and processes for citizen
            voice in policy dialogue, possibly as part of the SCD, where relevant.
        (b) The creation of national/regional/local fora for exchange between government and
            citizens (CSOs) on policies and reforms, including in the context of multi-stakeholder
            fora (see Box 3.4).
        (c) The definition of objectives and elaboration of results frameworks for policy
            dialogue, anchored in national development strategies. Defining the objectives of a
            policy and reform dialogue allows opportunities to identify how citizen voice and
            participation can contribute to reaching the expected results. For example, different
            outcomes would be targeted in a reform dialogue about natural resource management
            than in one about reforms affecting the enabling environment for citizen participation.

   Box 3.4. CSOs as Equal Partners in the Dialogue around Natural Resource Management: The EITI
   Multi-Stakeholder Group
   The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a global coalition of governments, companies, and
   civil society working together to improve openness and accountable management of revenues from natural
   resources. Countries interested in joining the EITI apply for candidate status and need to be accepted before
   they can embark on implementing the EITI standard, including the publication of an annual EITI report. Among
   others, the EITI standard requires the creation of a group, including representatives from governments,
   companies, and civil society that oversees the EITI implementation in a country, the so-called Multi-
   Stakeholder Group. The Multi-Stakeholder Group agrees on its governance structure and working modalities;
   develops the country work plan for EITI implementation and the production of the EITI report; and ensures that
   the EITI contributes to public debate.

   Through the EITI Multi-Donor Trust Fund, the World Bank is supporting EITI implementation in most of the
   44 implementing countries, including capacity building for CSOs to engage with and participate in EITI in 31
   countries, of which 9 are EITI candidates and 19 have achieved EITI validation (2 are delisted and 1 is a pre-
   candidate).

D. Development Policy Lending
65.     DPL is rapidly disbursing policy-based financing that aims to help a borrower achieve
sustainable reductions in poverty through a program of policy and institutional actions that
promote growth, enhance well-being, and increase the incomes of poor people. Consultation and
participation are a policy principle of DPL. According to OP 8.60, Development Policy Lending,
“In carrying out dialogue with borrowing countries, the Bank advises the clients to consult with
and engage the participation of key stakeholders in the country in the process of formulating the
country’s development strategies.” The responsibility to initiate a participatory process and
design its scope rests with the government, but the World Bank can facilitate, support, and advise
on the engagement.

66.     Government-led CE in DPL can help achieve several objectives: informing the design
of the reform program, improving implementation effectiveness, and improving the monitoring
and evaluation of reform programs. The World Bank’s 2012 DPL Retrospective found that all
DPL operations had reported, in varying degrees of detail, on the country’s consultation and
participatory processes related to the program supported by the operation. In consultations on the
2012 Retrospective, stakeholders encouraged the Bank to think how DPL can contribute to
further progress in transparency, accountability, and participation.

67.     DPL mainly supports reforms in public sector governance; explicit prior actions
related to participation and civic engagement are less prevalent. The 2012 DPL
Retrospective found that 40 percent of prior actions of the 221 development policy loans
reviewed are related to public sector governance, 18 percent to financial and private sector
development, 12 percent to social protection and management, and only 1 percent to
participation and civic engagement. At the same time, prior actions related to public sector
governance, such as procurement reforms, may include measures that promote transparency and
enable CE at the country level, such as third-party procurement monitoring as part of a new
procurement law. Box 3.5 shows how consultations in a series of DPL operations focused on
public financial management can contribute to results in this area. A review of 51 development
policy loans approved in FY11 and FY12 also found that the vast majority of prior actions were
related to information activities; very few of the loans had prior actions related to consultations,
citizen feedback, or GRMs; and even fewer included prior actions related to participatory and
collaborative processes with citizens.

Box 3.5. Consultations in the World Bank’s Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional DPL Series in Guatemala
Objectives. In addition to other development objectives, the WBG Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional DPL Series
for Guatemala has since 2009 provided support for the following:
  • Improving governance and transparency of public financial management and expenditures by creating
      institutional structures to promote public accountability and reduce corruption.
  • Strengthening the effectiveness of the Mi Familia Progresa CCT program through testing to identify eligible
      beneficiaries and improving procedures for verifying beneficiaries’ co-responsibilities (i.e., confirming school
      and health check attendance).
CE mechanisms include consultations between Congress, the Executive branch, and civil society, with the following
results:
  • Adoption of the Access to Public Information Law, leading to the creation of specialized public information
       offices in 85 percent of central government agencies.
  • Creation of the Vice-Ministry of Fiscal Transparency and Evaluation within the Ministry of Finance, opening
       avenues for improved accountability, public participation and social auditing, and fighting corruption.
                                                                                                                  30
    •     With improved targeting and transparency, the Mi Familia Progresa program was extended into more than
          270 municipalities to reach over 900,000 families in a short timeframe. Improved execution resulted in 100
          percent of beneficiaries sending their children to school and attending required health check-ups.

68.     Opportunities exist to leverage DPL to strengthen country processes for CE. Such
opportunities can be informed by the SCD and will need to be discussed with governments in
countries that qualify for DPL and have supply- and demand-side conditions that are conducive
to strengthening country systems for engagement. Box 3.6 provides examples of prior actions
that have been used to support country systems for participation in recent DPL operations. In
addition, DPL has been used to support ad hoc participatory mechanisms. For example, the 2010
development policy loan to Rwanda included a prior action related to completion of an
assessment of local-level service delivery, using citizen report cards and community scorecards.

Box 3.6. Examples of DPL Prior Actions Supporting Country Systems for CE
•       Instruction issued to set forth guidelines and procedures for procurement under community participation method
        (Vietnam, FY11).
•       Instruction issued related to a manual on participatory planning by communes as well as minimum participation
        by women (Vietnam, FY11).
•       Circular issued establishing a participatory process for systematic monitoring of the performance of the public
        service by civil society, citizens, and service providers (Tunisia, FY11).
•       Borrower has created regional committees to pilot processes for citizen participation aimed at identifying
        regional priorities within the borrower’s public policies (Brazil, FY13).
•       Decrees issued to strengthen urban governance by broadening participatory mechanisms for budget execution
        (Brazil, FY13).

E. Beneficiary Feedback: Citizen Engagement in Investment Project
Financing
69.      CE in IPF can improve outcomes in service delivery, public financial management,
governance, natural resource management, and social inclusion. The World Bank has long
experience in CE in IPFs in service delivery projects, demand for good governance projects,
CDD projects, and projects supporting reforms in public financial management. Engagement
mechanisms include consultations; GRMs; collecting, recording, and reporting on inputs
received from citizens; collaboration in decision-making; citizen-led monitoring, evaluation, or
oversight; empowering citizens with resources and authority over their use; and citizen capacity
building for engagement (Chapter VI provides examples of each of these approaches).
Consultations and grievance redress are mandatory engagement mechanisms in projects that
trigger World Bank safeguard policies. There are additional context-specific opportunities for CE
in projects that support reforms in areas where CE has been found to contribute to improved
results. When choosing the appropriate engagement mechanism, context factors need to be taken
into account (see Table 3.2).




                                                                                                                      31
70.     To maximize the impact on project outcomes, CE needs to be embedded in project
design and continued throughout the project cycle, including during implementation and
evaluation (see Box 3.7). Mandatory consultations—for example, on environmental
assessments—typically take place during project preparation. While consultation summaries are
included in project documents, it is not always clear how the feedback received has informed the
final project design. Typically, consultations are not continued during project implementation,
although they could be useful to detect and address environmental and social implementation
challenges early on. In contrast, CDD projects involve participatory planning, implementation,
and oversight during the life of the project. For projects in sectors such as transport, ongoing user
feedback and oversight can contribute to, for example, improved quality of road construction or
an improved system to report and address road maintenance issues. Engaging with citizens over
the life of the project can improve project risk management, promote continuous learning, and
allow for corrections as needed, all facilitating better outcomes.

Box 3.7. Tracking Beneficiary Feedback: CE in World Bank-supported IPF Projects with Clearly Identifiable
Beneficiaries
The World Bank’s IPF operations aim to promote poverty reduction and sustainable development of member
countries by providing financial and related operational support to specific projects that promote broad-based
economic growth, contribute to social and environmental sustainability, enhance the effectiveness of the public or
private sectors, or otherwise contribute to the overall development of the member states. Except for loans to
financial intermediaries, all of these investments (which typically happen in sectors such as agriculture, health,
education, and infrastructure) have direct beneficiaries. The World Bank President’s commitment to include
beneficiary feedback in 100 percent of projects with clearly identifiable beneficiaries is being implemented by
including CE activities in IPF.

The World Bank aims to integrate CE mechanisms in IPFs with direct beneficiaries across all sectors, regions, and
outcome areas, with a focus on engagement during project implementation to allow for continuous learning and
adjustments as needed. The choice of CE mechanism will vary according to the country and sector context,
development objective of the project, and capacity of governments and beneficiaries to engage. A focus on results
ensures that engagement mechanisms planned at design are being implemented and that beneficiary feedback
provided receives an adequate response. For this purpose, project teams are required to include at least one CE
results indicator in IPF during project design and report on it during project implementation. Progress on including
CE results indicators and reporting on them will be monitored at the corporate level through the Corporate Scorecard
and the IDA17 Results Measurement System.

In FY13, the ISR results frameworks of 32 percent of IPFs reported on beneficiary feedback and engagement three
years after project approval. The target is to achieve 100 percent.

Scaling up CE across IPFs can leverage several entry points. A number of sectors (such as health and social services,
agriculture, education, and public administration) already incorporate a high share of CE results indicators in their
project design. In these sectors, the focus is on improving the quality of reporting during project implementation.
Other sectors, such as energy and transport, use a relatively low share of CE results indicators during project design.
In these sectors, the focus is on including CE mechanisms in project design and ensuring reporting during project
implementation. Certain World Bank regions have a long history of CE in IPF operations and are already working
with a relatively high share of CE indicators and reporting on them to various degrees. Others may start from a
lower base but have developed action plans for scaling up CE in IPF going forward, building on regional windows
of opportunity.

71.     CE mechanisms should, as much as possible, build on and strengthen existing
national, regional, and sectoral processes for participation and feedback instead of creating
project-specific engagement mechanisms. For instance, feedback mechanisms in utility sectors
                                                                                           32
should support utility-based engagement mechanisms; participatory budgeting processes should
be embedded in national legislation; and third-party monitoring mechanisms should be anchored
in existing institutions. As an example, the Village Investment Project in the Kyrgyz Republic is
a series of CDD projects that have contributed to building decentralized structures and capacity
for village-level participation and engagement. Some of these quasi-governmental structures are
now being used by other sectors to implement their development projects. Similarly, several
CDD programs in countries such as Indonesia, Senegal, the Philippines, and Afghanistan include
capacity building for governments, for example, in the area of decentralization reform or social
reforms.


F. Program-for-Results
72.     Program-for-Results (PforR) financing aims to promote sustainable development
and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures by financing the expenditures
of specific client development programs. PforR operations disburse on the basis of the
achievement of key results under the development programs; and, where appropriate use and
strengthen the program systems and strengthen the institutional capacity for such programs to
achieve their intended results. OP 9.00 requires the World Bank to consult stakeholders on its
environmental and social systems assessment, and all PforR operations have carried out such
consultations. The focus is largely on system-level issues, per the design of the instrument.

73.    Feedback from TTLs and regional pilots to mainstream CE have pointed to
opportunities to scale up non-mandatory CE in PforR operations, including in the area of
supporting systemic approaches to CE in specific sectors.


G. Advisory Services and Analytics
74.    World Bank advisory services and analytics aim to influence policy choices and
programs, enable and empower clients to implement reforms, strengthen institutions, and
improve development actions. World Bank knowledge services include economic and sector
work, technical assistance, external training, and impact evaluations.

75.    Advisory services and analytics are frequently used to engage with citizens to build
consensus, raise awareness, and influence public debate. The World Bank’s FY13 Client
Feedback Survey on knowledge and advisory services included feedback from
academic/research institutions, media, and nonprofit organizations, which together accounted for
28 percent of respondents. The majority of respondents stated that the knowledge used led to
change. A 2013 review by the WBG Independent Evaluation Group on knowledge-based country
programs found that the primary use of WBG knowledge activities is raising stakeholder
awareness. The review recommended involving “local experts, partners and local think tanks
extensively in knowledge services to help understand better the political economy of reform,
bridge the gap between international good practices and local conditions, enhance the
applicability of the recommendations, and build local capacity to achieve longer-term impact”
(IEG, 2013).



                                                                                              33
76.     CE in advisory services and analytics is a newer area for the World Bank. In general,
potential entry points for CE in knowledge products include consultations with citizens/CSOs,
local academia/research institutions, think-tanks, or media during the design of knowledge
products; collaboration with local academia/research institutions and think-tanks in the
elaboration of knowledge products; and participation in the evaluation of knowledge products.
For example, to assess the impact of knowledge and advisory work to support the review and
design of social policies in Turkey between 2008 and 2010, the Bank used surveys to elicit not
only the feedback of the government but also that of academia and CSOs (World Bank, 2011b).

77.     Guiding lessons can be drawn from the experience of participation in Poverty and
Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs). Besides informing Bank operations, such as DPL, PSIA also
informs government policy processes and the national policy debate. PSIAs determine the
distributional impacts of reforms, as well as the processes by which appropriate stakeholders are
engaged in policymaking and integrated into country processes. To enhance policymaking and
transparency and strengthen country ownership of reform, it is good practice to involve key
stakeholders in PSIA design and implementation. Key stakeholder groups typically include
different government ministries, CSOs, parliamentarians, the media, and national think-tanks.
For example, the PSIA process in Lesotho helped to mediate what had been a heated national
debate about electricity reform. The inclusion of participatory processes in the PSIA contributed
by not only better informing stakeholders about the objectives and envisaged measures of the
reform but also by integrating their views into the reform proposal, which then reduced their
opposition and made successful implementation more likely (World Bank, 2008c).

78.     Going forward, the World Bank plans to scale up CE in its advisory services and
analytics for improved results. This will entail (a) identifying the development objectives of
knowledge work for which CE can help improve outcomes; and (b) developing guidance for task
teams for CE during the design and implementation of advisory services and analytics, and
training staff to use stakeholder participation to, for example, define the problem to address;
collaborate with citizens, CSOs, academia, and others in the analytic work; crowd-source
knowledge; and conduct interactive dissemination of findings. Where relevant, analytic work can
also be conducted on country or sector systems for CE, such as the degree of responsiveness of
service delivery systems to citizen feedback.


H. Grant Programs
79.    Capacity building provides an entry point for CE. Capacity building for governments,
CSOs, and citizens to collaborate in development interventions can be a component of various
operational products, including investment lending or knowledge products. Chapter V.G
provides examples for capacity building for CE as part of IPF.

80.    In addition, the World Bank supports capacity building for the CE work of CSOs
and other non-state actors through various grant programs: the Development Grant Facility,
the Statebuilding and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF), and the Japan Social Development Fund.
Examples include the SPF-funded Program to Enhance Capacities for Social Accountability in
Cambodia and the SPF-funded Program on Accountability in Nepal.



                                                                                              34
81.    Launched in 2012, the Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA)
provides strategic and long-term (3-5 years) support to CSOs to strengthen transparency
and accountability. Grants are made directly to CSOs for capacity building, research and
knowledge dissemination, networking, and programmatic activities related to social
accountability, including activities supporting the enabling environment for social accountability.
GPSA support is available to legally registered CSOs in the 39 countries that have joined the
GPSA. GPSA has an existing grant funding volume of US$26.5 million, 11 and to date has
awarded grants to 22 CSOs in 17 countries through two calls for proposals.


I. IFC
82.    IFC and its private sector clients engage with citizens who are directly or indirectly
affected by their operations in a variety of ways. This section describes the instruments the
IFC uses to engage: the Sustainability Framework and the Independent Recourse Mechanism: the
Compliance/Advisor Ombudsman.

83.     The IFC Sustainability Framework, an integral part of IFC’s approach to risk
management, helps articulate IFC’s and its clients’ strategic commitment to sustainable
development. The framework helps clients to do business in a sustainable way, promoting sound
environmental and social practices, encouraging transparency and accountability, and
contributing to positive development impacts. The Sustainability Framework applies to all IFC
projects (investment and advisory) and consists of (a) the Policy on Environmental and Social
Sustainability; (b) Performance Standards 1-8; and (c) the Access to Information Policy, which
articulates IFC’s commitment to transparency (IFC, 2012).

84.    The Sustainability Framework, originally adopted in 2006, has recently been
updated following an 18-month consultation process with stakeholders around the world.
The update reflects the evolution of good practice in sustainability and risk mitigation over the
past five years. 12 It incorporates modifications on challenging issues that are increasingly
important to sustainable businesses: supply-chain management, resource efficiency, and climate
change, as well as business and human rights.

85.     The IFC Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability and Performance
Standards 1-8 include a commitment to effective stakeholder engagement. They are IFC’s
efforts to carry out all investment and advisory activities to enhance the sustainability of private
sector operations and the markets they work in, and to achieve positive development outcomes.
Through them, IFC is committed to ensuring that the costs of economic development do not fall
disproportionately on those who are poor or vulnerable, that the environment is not degraded in
the process, and that renewable natural resources are managed sustainably. Performance
Standard 1 establishes the importance of (a) an integrated assessment to identify the
environmental and social impacts, risks, and opportunities of projects; (b) effective stakeholder
engagement through disclosure of project-related information and consultation with local

     Stakeholder groups participated through consultations with more than 160 private companies; extensive meetings with
     government agencies around the globe; bilateral meetings with various stakeholder groups; 25 public consultations; and
     community consultations in nine countries. The reviews by the Board’s CODE and numerous meetings and discussions with
     Executive Directors and their advisors also contributed significantly to the process. IFC received and systematically
     considered over 300 written submissions from different groups representing a broad range of interested parties.
                                                                                                                       35
communities on matters that directly affect them; 13 and (c) the client’s management of
environmental and social performance throughout the life of the project. Performance Standards
2 through 8 establish objectives and requirements to avoid or minimize impacts. When residual
impacts remain, the Standards are used to compensate for/offset risks and impacts to workers,
affected communities, and the environment. 14 Implementation of the environmental and social
plans is reported annually to IFC by clients, and verified by IFC environmental and social
specialists during site visits.

86.    A positive impact of the Performance Standards is the Equator Principles, which
have increased attention to and focus on social/community standards and responsibility,
including labor standards and robust standards for consultation with locally affected
communities and indigenous peoples (see Box 3.8). They have also promoted convergence
around common environmental and social standards. Multilateral development banks, including
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and export credit agencies through the
OECD Common Approaches, are increasingly drawing on the same standards as the Equator
Principles. The Equator Principles have also helped spur the development of other responsible
environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry: the
Carbon Principles in the United States, and Climate Principles worldwide. They have provided a
platform for engagement with a broad range of interested stakeholders, including NGOs, clients,
and industry.

     Box 3.8. The Equator Principles
     More than 79 banks worldwide have adopted the Equator Principles, which are a set of good practice guidelines
     for environmental and social risk management in project finance based on the IFC Performance Standards. In
     financial markets worldwide, IFC Performance Standards have been catalyzing the rapid convergence of
     standards for cross-border project finance.

     The Equator Principles are a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions, for determining,
     assessing, and managing environmental and social risk in projects. They are intended to provide a minimum
     standard for due diligence to support responsible decision-making. The Equator Principles apply globally to all
     industry sectors and to four financial products: project finance advisory services, project finance, project-related
     corporate loans, and bridge loans.

     There are Equator Principles Financial Institutions in 35 countries that have officially adopted the Equator
     Principles, covering over 70 percent of international project finance debt in emerging markets. These
     institutions commit to implementing the Equator Principles in their internal environmental and social policies,
     procedures, and standards for financing projects, and they do not provide project finance or project-related
     corporate loans to projects if the client will not, or is unable to, comply with the Equator Principles.

87.    The Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) 15 reviewed the IFC’s adoption of the
Policy and Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability and its
Disclosure Policy (Sustainability Framework) as a marked shift in the way in which IFC

      Stakeholder engagement is an ongoing process that may involve, in varying degrees, the following elements: stakeholder
      analysis and planning, disclosure and dissemination of information, consultation and participation, grievance mechanisms,
      and ongoing reporting to affected communities. The nature, frequency, and level of effort of stakeholder engagement may
      vary considerably and is commensurate with the project’s risks, adverse impacts, and phase of development.
14
      When environmental or social risks and impacts are identified, the client is required to manage them through its
      Environmental and Social Management System, in accordance with Performance Standard 1.
15
      The CAO has three roles: dispute resolution, compliance, and advisor.
                                                                                                                           36
addresses environmental and social risks.16 The review noted that the philosophy inherent in
these new policies and standards signaled a move from satisfying a set of prescriptive
requirements to an “outcomes-based” approach that requires client companies to engage with
host communities early, to build constructive relationships, and to maintain them over time. It
added that sound company-community engagement creates predictability for host communities
around project-level impacts and mitigation measures, and can help to prevent conflict around
private sector projects. 17 The review also noted that gaps in project-level engagement around
impact mitigation activities and development impact reporting undermine efforts to build
constructive relations and secure community support. 18

88.     IFC brings the private sector perspective to the WBG CE model, including the
sector’s view on actions by governments, the World Bank, and other development partners.
Two important trends have emerged in the field of international development. First, companies
are increasingly engaging strategically in helping to address complex country development
challenges in ways that harness their core business competencies, skills, and interests and that
aim to create value for both shareholders and society. Second, for-profit companies, social
enterprises, NGOs, foundations, public donors, and governments are moving beyond one-to-one,
project-based collaboration to multi-stakeholder alliances through which to deliver solutions at a
more systemic level in particular development sectors or locations (Bulloch and others, 2011).
Thus the private sector can play an important role in increasing prosperity and opportunity,
which requires that the market system operate within effectively regulated and broadly accepted
governance frameworks, spearheaded by principled companies and leaders (Jackson and Nelson,
2004).

89.     For the private sector, there are many good business reasons to ensure that business
activities are ethical, responsible, and environmentally and socially sustainable (IFC, 2009).
Experience has shown that a demonstrated commitment to values and sustainability can help
companies 19 achieve a variety of benefits, including the following:
           •    Gain and retain loyal customers while avoiding boycotts or other undesirable
                consumer actions;
           •    Be perceived as more desirable places to work and able to effectively recruit and
                retain talented staff members;
           •    Identify ways to increase efficiency and reduce costs in their operations, such as
                through more sustainable energy use and waste management, or reduced employee
                absenteeism;
           •    Forestall legislation or regulation by adopting voluntary programs, allowing them to
                develop discretionary standards according to their particular circumstances and
                challenges or to adopt industry agreed codes of practice; and
16
     Office of the CAO (2010).
17
     Drawn from CAO caseload over the past 10 years, and illustrated by CAO’s body of advisory work.
18
     Aside from CAO work on the IFC Sustainability Framework, it provided advice on project-level engagement though its
     advisory work on grievance mechanisms and participatory water monitoring.
19
     Ultimately, companies are developing more mature social business capabilities by focusing on key social business challenges.
     Businesses that have more developed social business capabilities do not view social business solely as an application or tool.
     They have integrated it into many functions, such as strategy and operations, and use it in daily decision-making. Although
     the discipline of measurement is still evolving, more mature companies do not let measurement challenges halt progress.
     Finally, social business changes the way work gets done, and processes need to be designed to assure its adoption and success
     (Kiron and others, 2013).
                                                                                                                               37
        •      Win the support of the communities where they operate and jointly solve problems
               that affect the company as well as the local population.

90.     Over the past years, a few clients have sought IFC support for measuring the
social/development impacts of their work. This support included advice in defining
nonfinancial key performance indicators and the use of feedback tools such as poverty
scorecards, narratives, and consumer research. Clients saw value in results measurement and
feedback tools, which enabled them to articulate the effects they have on consumers and
suppliers—which is important for their “license to operate”—and also assisted them with impact
reporting to investors and development institutions (see Box 3.9).


 Box 3.9. Feedback from Consumers of a Water Company, an IFC Client in Ghana

 The Ghana project provided evidence of the attitudes of over 6,000 water consumers. This evidence was used to
 underpin business decisions submitted to the company’s investment committee, help benchmark communities,
 and anticipate consumer reaction in new communities. It was used as an additional tool in the company’s toolkit
 of proxies—e.g., size of population, taxes paid, and economic activity.

 Using a multi-tool approach including simple poverty scorecards and narratives, the project also provided IFC
 and other investors with evidence of developments that the client is achieving beyond a particular outcome—
 such as drinking potable water that is healthier than the alternatives available to these poor communities (e.g.,
 wells, river, rainwater). For example, the community relations team provides the communities with extensive
 and effective education campaigns. The pilot provided evidence that these education efforts have been successful
 as people can now correctly identify the difference between “pure” / treated water, and other sources. This
 outcome demonstrates that people in the served communities are aware of the diseases that drinking untreated
 water might cause.

91.     Working with interested clients, IFC will test potential tools and methodologies to
provide evidence of the impact of stakeholder engagement, including social impact metrics
related to several dimensions of supplier and consumer feedback. These efforts build on two
practice traditions—participatory development and consumer research—that have been widely
used for over 60 years but have not yet been fully combined. They draw on a succession of
participatory development techniques that emerged in the 1950s—rapid rural appraisal,
participatory evaluation, appreciative enquiry, and others—and on the customer research
industry. In these pilots, the following guidelines will apply:
        • Focus on client companies;
        • Emphasis on adding value to existing/potential IFC investment clients;
        • Implementation in one or two regions, with each region managing its own projects
            but coordinating with the other; and
        • Provision for clients to share some of the cost of these pilots.

92.     In February 2013, IFC conducted a global survey of its investment and advisory
staff to gauge perceptions regarding clients’ demand for results measurement services. The
survey results showed that clients require support on results measurement and stakeholder
feedback tools, and that they are willing to pay for these services.

93.    An IFC-commissioned report that looked at the latest tools and approaches used by
businesses to consult stakeholders concluded that these tools allow businesses to move from
                                                                                          38
compliance to competitive advantage. By helping them to measure simultaneously what
matters for business and for development, the use of such tools has led to the following benefits
Dalberg, 2012):
       • Monitoring compliance with regulation to avert legal or social consequences of
           noncompliance;
       • Capturing marketing and public relations value from social or environmental
           compliance;
       • Attracting capital from impact investors and socially minded investors; and
       • Gaining strategic advantage in the marketplace, increasing profitability and
           efficiency.

94.     These efforts are also aligned with the current focus of agribusiness companies on
listening to consumers and suppliers. The Committee on Sustainability Assessment, the
International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling Alliance, Rainforest
Alliance, the Ford Foundation, the Center for Development Innovation at Wageningen, and the
Sustainable Food Lab believe that advancing a shared approach to measuring a core set of
sustainability indicators within smallholder supply chains will enable better learning
opportunities, increase the ability to compare data across diverse initiatives, and allow cost
savings (Seas of Change, 2012). A growing number of companies are expanding their
smallholder sourcing programs, including the use of third-party certification. 20

95.     The IFC Strategic Community Investment team focuses on developing community
investment strategies, strengthening supply chains, addressing environmental and social
risks, and conveying benefits through tax/royalty payments (Box 3.10). Working with the
IFC natural resources, agribusiness, forestry, and infrastructure sectors, it provides services such
as the following:
        • Facilitation of corporate-community engagement and communications;
        • Design of participatory planning and monitoring processes related to land use, water
            use, and local benefits;
        • Building company capacity to design initiatives that benefit both the company and the
            local community;
        • Conducting economic evaluation and scenario analysis of community investments;
        • Ensuring gender and minority mainstreaming;
        • Building local government capacity to manage tax/royalty payments to improve
            community welfare; and
        • Supporting CSOs to ensure that local governments are accountable for how they
            spend tax resources.

     The Seas of Change International Learning Workshop, held in The Hague in April 2012, brought together 100 leaders from
     business, government, NGOs, and research and farmer organizations to discuss scaling the benefits of agri-food markets that
     are inclusive of smallholder farmers. One of the key takeaways from this workshop was the need for better monitoring and
     assessing of social impact (Woodhill and others, 2012).
                                                                                                                            39
Box 3.10. One-Stop Shop for Local Communities and Skills Development for Mining Suppliers

One-Stop Shop for Local Communities. The IFC-developed CommDev.org website aims to increase the
access of companies, civil society, and local and regional governments to practical knowledge and tools
for navigating complicated, community-focused, social, environmental, and economic development issues
related to extractives, agribusiness, forestry, and infrastructure sectors. With over 2,000 visitors each day,
it fosters the exchange of knowledge and practical experience on social, environmental, and economic
development issues faced by the private sector as it engages with communities around the world.

Skills Development for Mining Suppliers. In South Africa, IFC worked with a mining client to create a
program focused on skills development for local suppliers and contracting of local businesses as suppliers
to the IFC client. More than 305 contracts have been awarded to 45 small and medium-size enterprises,
totaling US$45.4 million and creating approximately 330 direct jobs.

96.     The commodities roundtables contribute to broad-scale market transformation in
key commodities as multi-stakeholder forums where all stakeholders (farmers, traders,
suppliers, processors) engage. Such roundtables aim to reduce risk by developing commodity
standards and environmental and social practices through the supply chain that all stakeholders
can accept and adopt. IFC participation is consistent with the emphasis of its Performance
Standards on the use of certification by clients and their primary supply chains, where credible
standards are available. IFC is actively engaged in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, the
Roundtable on Responsible Soy, and the Better Sugar Cane Initiative. IFC provides support and
thought leadership in areas such as smallholder inclusion mechanisms, standards, positioning for
new geographic frontiers (e.g., Africa, Asia), and making the business case for greater impact
and its measurement.

97.    Throughout the life of a project supported by a MIGA guarantee, MIGA consults
with communities and indigenous populations affected by the project in a manner
consistent with the requirements defined in the Performance Standards. 21 Stakeholder
engagement is a guiding principle of MIGA’s Performance Standards. 22 While managing
environmental and social risks and impacts in a manner consistent with the Performance
Standards is the client’s responsibility, MIGA seeks to ensure, through its due diligence and
monitoring efforts, that the business activities/projects it supports are implemented in accordance
with the requirements of the Performance Standards (see Box 3.11). Through the Performance
Standards, MIGA requires project companies to engage with affected communities through
disclosure of information, consultation, and informed participation, in a manner commensurate
with the risks to and impacts on the affected communities. Consultations, community
engagement, and GRMs are requirements under several Performance Standards. 23


21
     MIGA operations are subject to the same performance standards as IFC’s operations.
22
     Performance Standard 1 stipulates stakeholder engagement in the assessment and management of environmental risks and
     impacts.
23
     Performance Standards 1, 2, 5, and 7 require one or more of the following: consultations, community engagement, and
     GRMs.
                                                                                                                     40
98.     MIGA is committed to working with the private sector to put into practice processes
of community engagement that ensure informed consultation of and participation by the
affected communities as well as the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples.
Informed consultation and participation involves an in-depth exchange of views and information,
and an organized and iterative consultation, leading to the client’s incorporating into its decision-
making process the views of the affected communities on matters that affect them directly—for
example, proposed mitigation measures, sharing of development benefits and opportunities, and
implementation issues. The consultation process should (a) capture both men’s and women’s
views, if necessary through separate forums or engagements, and (b) reflect men’s and women’s
different concerns and priorities about impacts, mitigation mechanisms, and benefits, where
appropriate. The client is expected to document the process, in particular the measures taken to
avoid or minimize risks to and adverse impacts on the affected communities, and to inform those
affected about how their concerns have been considered. If indigenous peoples are affected,
MIGA expects the client to enter into free, prior, and informed consent negotiations with the
affected peoples, with the help of external experts, to identify and mitigate project risks.

Box 3.11. Successful Grievance Redress in the Context of a MIGA-supported Project

MIGA has developed a special environmental and social review process for complex projects in difficult
contexts. One of these projects is a green field nickel development project with complex social and
environmental impacts, including on 16 directly and indirectly affected villages with indigenous and
vulnerable groups; primary tropical forest; cultural habitat; and endangered and vulnerable species and
water resources. As a result, the project attracted strong NGO attention and opposition, while the investor
was new to the country and had limited experience in effective grievance mechanisms in complex
settings.

MIGA worked closely with the investor to put in place a GRM that could respond to the complex
challenges of the project. The GRM includes multiple channels for communities, the availability of local
field officers, and close coordination with traditional authorities, creating trust between villagers and local
field officers. The GRM provides an integrated system for all types of complaints as well as systematic
registration and follow-up.

By linking the GRM for the project to its community engagement, the investor was able to gain the trust
of the villagers, develop a constructive relationship with local NGOs, and set a working precedent for
other mining operations.

                                     IV. Citizen Engagement Approaches

99.        This chapter describes the main approaches to CE in World Bank operations.


A. Consultations
100. Meaningful consultations can contribute to improved design, implementation, and
sustainability of development interventions. The objectives of citizen consultations include
receiving input for improved decision-making about the design and implementation
arrangements of a development program or project, to contribute to improved results and
sustainability. In this context, consultations can potentially give voice to the needs of different
population groups, including vulnerable and marginalized groups; improve risk management by
identifying opportunities and risks from and to a project (World Bank, 2012b); and increase
transparency, public understanding, and citizen involvement in development decision-making
(World Bank 2004b).

101. Consultations with key stakeholders, including project-affected people and civil
society, are mandatory in a number of World Bank instruments, including in CASs/CPFs,
PforR financing, and IPFs that trigger certain safeguards. For CPF and PforR, the World Bank is
the interlocutor in the required consultations. For DPL and IPF, the government consults, and the
World Bank can support and facilitate the consultation. (Box 4.1 provides an example of
consultations during project preparation triggered by OP 4.01, Environmental Assessment.)
Consultation methods include public hearings or meetings, focus group discussions, household
surveys and interviews, electronic consultations, and advisory/expert groups. In addition,
consultations can include informal structures at the local level, such as village councils and
women’s groups.

102. Safeguards-related consultations are the most frequent CE mechanism in World
Bank-supported operations, and they take place mostly during project preparation. As
Chapter III pointed out, almost 90 percent of consultations for IPF are motivated by safeguard
requirements. However, there are significant opportunities to consult with citizens during project
implementation for joint learning, risk management, and course correction as needed.

103. Good practice approaches to consultation, including closing the feedback loop, need
to be applied more systematically. The WBG consultation guidelines lay out good practice
principles such as clear subject and purpose, adequate stakeholder representation and methods of
consultation, and disclosure of and timely access to understandable, relevant, and objective
information and documentation (World Bank, 2013d). Meaningful consultations also require
stakeholder identification and analysis, including due consideration of representativeness and
inclusion of women and disadvantaged or vulnerable groups. In addition, safeguard policies
require adequate documentation of consultations as part of the project documentation (see Box
4.1). 24 These principles are not always applied consistently. Consultations without apparent
outcomes are a complaint from CSOs engaged with the Bank, 25 pointing to scope for
24
     For projects of environmental Category A, OP 4.01 stipulates that an annex to the PAD includes a summary of the borrower's
     consultations with affected groups and local NGOs, including the issues raised and how they have been taken into account.

     CIVICUS IGO Scorecard, included in State of Civil Society Report 2014.
                                                                                                                           42
improvements in reporting back to those consulted and in monitoring and documenting the
outcomes of consultations.

104. Going forward, more systematic use of results indicators will allow for tracking and
documenting outcomes of consultations during the implementation of programs and
projects. Guidance and training will be made available to help teams identify objectives and
track the outcomes of consultations during program or project implementation. The inclusion of
outcome indicators in project results frameworks can improve the quality of consultations and
subsequent results monitoring during project implementation. Indicators can track increased
participation from women and marginalized or vulnerable groups, satisfaction with the
consultation process, or changes to policies or projects affected as a result of consultations.


Box 4.1. Consultation Mechanisms in the WBG Niger Basin Water Resources Development and Sustainable
Ecosystems Management Adaptable Program Loan
The objective of the Water Resources Development and Sustainable Ecosystems Management Adaptable Program
Loan is to enhance regional cooperation, development, and sustainability of water resources management in the
Niger River Basin. Major environmental impacts of the program include the loss of terrestrial natural habitat due to
flooding; the loss of mostly rain-fed agricultural land; and induced environmental, human, and health risks
associated with the construction and operation of a dam.

Extensive public consultations on the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment started in 2005 and continued
throughout project preparation. Civil society, project-affected people, vulnerable groups, and various stakeholders
were consulted on the preparation of all safeguards documents. Safeguards documents were disclosed locally and
through the WBG Infoshop. An independent panel of environmental and social experts provided advice during the
preparation of the safeguards documents and the public consultation process.

Key issues raised during the consultations included the need to (a) gain access to drinking water, (b) improve access
to health and education infrastructure, (c) learn irrigation practices, (d) ensure access to jobs and activities for youth,
(e) obtain access to land, (f) strengthen human resources for adult men and women (through functional literacy),
(g) gain access to credit, agricultural equipment, and marketing infrastructure, and (h) fulfill women’s requests for
access to equipment for processing agricultural products and island village women’s request for training for new
opportunities in the resettlement sites.

These issues have been addressed in project design through detailed planning on the resettlement process, including
with host communities; local development activities (establishment of new livelihoods, training, capacity building);
establishment of services for the resettlement sites (electricity, water, sanitation, transport, health, education, etc.);
and environmental management aimed at the sustainable use of resources (water, land, fisheries, agriculture, etc.).

B. Collaboration

105. Collaboration with citizens in decision-making processes and events can make
decisions more responsive to citizens’ needs and improve the sustainability of program and
project outcomes through increased ownership by citizens (see Box 4.2). Mechanisms for
collaboration include citizen/user membership in decision-making bodies, integrity pacts,
participatory planning and budgeting, and citizens’ juries.


                                                                                                                       43
Box 4.2. South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo: Mobile Technology in Participatory Budgeting Gives
Citizens a Voice to Mobilize Resources for the Poor
Context. As part of the decentralization process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the law mandated that
budgetary funds would be transferred from the provincial to the local governments. As such laws had been widely
ignored for years, the process of participatory budgeting was perceived as an effective means to make the budget
transfer from provincial to local levels and to increase the legitimacy of the actions of local politicians from the
perspective of citizens.

Action. In April 2010, with the assistance of the WBI open development technology alliance ICT4Gov Program in
the province of South Kivu, a capacity-building workshop was carried out with the participation of 50 key actors
from provincial and local government, civil society, academia, and local IT companies. The workshop introduced
the concept of participatory budgeting and showed how ICT could support participatory processes. In August 2010
the provincial government invited all local governments to a meeting and informed of its decision of starting to
transfer the funds to the local level. One condition, however, is that local governments start to consult their citizens
informally and develop a strategy for the implementation of participatory budgeting. Through the process of
participatory budgeting, local governments could now specifically allocate money to provide services to the poor,
such as repairing classrooms and roads, and building health centers.

Result. As a result of the ICT-mediated participatory budgeting process in South Kivu in 2011, tax collection
increased up to 16-fold in participating local communities as citizens saw that projects started to be implemented,
and the provincial government increased transfers of funds to local governments up to fourfold as it saw a more
legitimate process to elaborate the budget. In October 2012, the provincial government passed a law to
institutionalize participatory budgeting. Other provinces are following suit and are starting to replicate the process.

C. Collecting, Recording, and Reporting on Inputs from Citizens
106. Citizen feedback can be collected periodically on various dimensions of public
services provided, such as effectiveness, inclusiveness, quality, delivery time, transaction costs,
and targeting, as well as on resource utilization or engagement processes. Tools include
satisfaction surveys, focus group discussions, hotlines, community scorecards, citizen report
cards, or SMS/online feedback. Box 4.3 provides an example of a utility-based hotline that was
initially designed with grant funding and contributions from the utility and the government
counterpart. Following the successful pilot, the government requested WBG assistance in
mainstreaming utility-based feedback systems to improve the quality of energy distribution
services.


Box 4.3. User Feedback in Service Delivery — Example: Vozelectrica, Dominican Republic
Context. For decades, the Dominican Republic power sector has suffered from poor service, inadequate generation
capacity, and frequent power cuts. Consumer frustration translated into pillage and vandalism, with nearly half of
usage being illegal. At the same time, lack of transparency and accountability at the provider level opened the door
to corruption and irregularities. Poor service adversely affects people, especially in underserved areas. Their
feedback, if systematically collected, analyzed, published, and responded to, could help improve service provision.
Action. This was the rationale behind Vozelectrica, a pilot project that developed a citizen-feedback system for the
Dominican electricity sector inspired by a World Bank-organized session where mayors, municipal staff, and civil
society organizations showed how the so-called 311 citizen response platforms were being used in Boston (USA)
and Serbia. Following the session, a multisectoral team (energy, social, transport, ICT) set out to test whether ICT-
enabled feedback platforms could be scaled up in Latin America. The online platform Vozelectrica was launched in
Santo Domingo in July 2013. Users were invited to send their feedback on issues ranging from warnings of power
shortages to complaints about rude technicians or reports of neighbors stealing electricity. This could be done via e-

                                                                                                                      44
mail, social media, and a mobile app, but also through phone and in person to ensure the participation of older (and
less internet-savvy) people. Each report would then pop up on a map on the Vozelectrica website in real time. In
turn, the participating electricity distribution companies assessed the reports and had the option to post their
responses in public.
To convince citizens their reports would be taken seriously, given the low level of trust in the electricity companies,
the team agreed on a new approach—design the platform jointly with local civil society, and let civil society
independently manage it. The companies and eight voluntary civil society groups went through training sessions
together, negotiated a protocol to handle feedback and complaints, and held regular meetings up to the launch of the
pilot.
Results. As a pilot, Vozelectrica, the first of its kind in the Dominican Republic, has proven valuable for all actors. It
provided rich information to the utilities about how best to reach customers, what channels to use, the profile of
participants, and the equity of service provision. The utilities have requested that the platform be mainstreamed
beyond the pilot areas, with views to fully integrate it in their customer-response system. Civil society gained
experience in the use of an ICT tool for social accountability and became more involved in the oversight of
resources spent in the sector. More important yet, several organizations are considering adapting it to other areas:
health, the environment, violence against women, and education. The experience is now being replicated by the
Ministry of Transport and Public Works in Uruguay for transport and road users, by the new Quito Metro (with
requests to expand to the municipal level), to the water sector in Honduras, and to the energy sector in Jamaica, and
discussions have started with clients in other countries (Peru, Argentina) who are interested in using the same type
of citizen interaction system.
When combined with other social compacts (agreements between users and the utility in specific electricity circuits)
and more traditional technical improvements, these citizen-focused systems produced better citizen satisfaction
(from 8% to 92% in pilot areas), better income to the utility (via loss reduction), and better hours of service as
citizens no longer vandalized meters shortly after rehabilitation.

D. Grievance Redress Mechanisms

107. World Bank IPF projects that trigger the indigenous peoples and involuntary
resettlement policies (OP 4.10 and OP 4.12, respectively) require GRMs. Any project
involving involuntary resettlement needs to prepare a Resettlement Action Plan, which includes
grievance procedures (i.e., affordable and accessible procedures for third-party settlement of
disputes arising from resettlement). Such GRMs should take into account the availability of
judicial recourse and community and traditional dispute settlement mechanisms, which are
particularly relevant in investment projects affecting indigenous peoples.

Box 4.4. Key Findings from the 2014 Review “Grievance Redress Mechanisms – On Paper and in Practice”
In 2013, The World Bank’s Dispute Resolution and Prevention team conducted a first “Global Review of Grievance
Redress Mechanisms in World Bank Projects.” A more detailed review was conducted in 2014 to assess the
prevalence of GRMs on paper and in practice. The following summarizes the key findings of this review:

GRMs are on the rise in IPF projects. They are included in 66 percent of new projects (FY12), up from 50 percent
in FY11 and 28 percent in FY08. Seventy percent of GRMs were outlined extensively in projects approved in
FY12—that is, the project documents contained more than a perfunctory reference such as “the project will have a
grievance redress mechanism.” Roughly half of the GRMs designed for FY12 approvals contained commitments to
collect the data that the mechanism generates, but only 22 percent of projects had committed funds for GRMs.

However, implementation remains a challenge. Of projects that commit to creating GRMs in design, 40 percent do
not end up creating one in practice. This points to opportunities to use GRMs earlier in the project cycle to address
grievances before they escalate. Furthermore, almost half of all GRMs reported to be working either receive no
complaints or have no data on complaints. While service standards are included in a majority of working GRMs,
their inclusion is far from complete. A variety of modes are being used as uptake channels, but technology/SMS lags
                                                                                                                      45
as a method of receiving complaints.

Regional and context-specific differences exist. The South Asia region has the highest percentage of projects
reporting working GRMs during implementation when such a mechanism had been planned in design. In fragile
states and conflict-affected situations, projects were far more likely to include a GRM in project design but less
likely to report a working GRM than the rest of the portfolio.

Source: World Bank (2014a).



108. Generally, GRMs succeed when the client and the task team are both committed to
using such a mechanism and follow good practice principles: providing multiple channels for
soliciting complaints; registering complaints in a log; publishing timely and service standards for
acknowledgement, response, and resolution; and ensuring transparency about the grievance
procedure as well as options for mediation and appeal. The capacity of local and national
institutions to address grievances also needs to be assessed. Staff training on GRMs is being
rolled out.

109. Recognizing the benefits of identifying and responding to complaints early, the
World Bank is adopting a more proactive approach to focus systematically on GRMs in
projects and encourages opportunities for alternative dispute resolution, where
appropriate (see Box 4.4). GRMs are increasingly recognized as a means to address complaints
early on and manage risks in project preparation and implementation before they escalate (see
Box 4.5). For example, the Upper Cisokan Pumped Hydroelectrical Power Project in Indonesia
engages an independent monitoring agency to track implementation of project commitments.
Grievance forms a central part of the monitoring process, with grievance tracking forms and
indicators for a number of cases, meetings and field visits, and satisfactory disposition of cases
(World Bank, 2013g).

Box 4.5. Feedback and GRMs in the Pakistan Flood Emergency Cash Transfer Project
Background. In July and August 2010, Pakistan experienced the worst floods in its history, affecting nearly 10
percent of its population across a vast geographical area. The Government of Pakistan set up a rapid response cash
transfer program to support flood-affected families—the Citizen’s Damage Compensation Program (CDCP). Phase I
provided immediate relief to 1.8 million families, and the World Bank’s Flood Emergency Cash Transfer Project
provided technical assistance and helped finance emergency cash grants for Phase II. Among the improvements
agreed upon for Phase II were stronger GRMs and a robust public information campaign.

Grievance redress mechanisms. Each of the program’s facilitation centers includes a grievance redress counter
staffed by the National Database Registration Authority to address complaints related to computerized national
identification cards, eligibility/targeting, payments, maladministration, or lack of response. A public information
campaign disseminates information about the grievance redress process through television, radio, and print, as well
as word-of-mouth communication facilitated by NGOs and community networks. In addition to the facilitation
centers, the grievance redress system receives and channels complaints through text messages and phone calls.
Depending on the nature of the grievance and related appeals, different stakeholders are responsible for providing
solutions: the National Database Registration Authority, local authorities, the District Administration, and Provincial
Disaster Management Authority

Results. While setting up the GRM took time, as of December 2012 the results are as follows:
    • 49% of eligibility appeals and 85% of complaints have been resolved.
    • 1.087 million eligibility appeals have been logged.
    • 536,846 eligibility appeals have been resolved.
    • 139,841 of these resolved appeals were accepted for inclusion and issuance of cash transfer debit cards.
    • 5,500 complaints (nonworking cards, requests for bribes, etc.) have been logged.
                                                                                                                   46
Lessons learned. The project team has identified a number of points for improved outcomes:
    • A well-executed and effective public information campaign is critical to participation.
    • Developing standard practices: given the large and multinodal grievance redress structure, standard
        practices are essential for successfully administering the case load.
    • Training for all parties to the GRM: all nodes of the grievance redress process must have the same
        understanding of the process.
    • Ownership by District Administrations is essential for efficacious functioning of the oversight body.

110. The World Bank will continue to track the successful resolution of grievances
received in projects. According to data for projects approved in FY12, 75 percent of grievances
received by projects have been resolved. However, this data point needs to be qualified by the
fact that only about one-half of projects reporting a working GRM received any complaints. Data
collection remains a challenge, but ongoing corporate monitoring is expected to enhance the
adoption of the core sector indicator on grievance redress to make this easier in the future.

111. Corporate recourse mechanisms supplement project-level GRMs. The World Bank's
Grievance Redress Service receives complaints and supports teams in addressing project-related
grievances that affected communities or individuals may raise directly with Bank Management.
In addition, the World Bank’s Inspection Panel is an independent complaints mechanism for
people who believe that they have been, or are likely to be, adversely affected by the World
Bank’s failure to comply with its policies in a World Bank-funded project and who wish to
request an independent compliance audit.

E. Citizen-led Monitoring

112. Involving citizens in monitoring service delivery, revenues, budget execution,
procurement, contract awards, and reform policies can increase transparency, improve
efficiency of service delivery or budget execution, and reduce opportunities for corruption.
Some mechanisms for citizen-led monitoring include public expenditure tracking surveys, social
audits, or citizen report cards. In addition, beneficiaries and CSOs at times participate in the
supervision of World Bank projects. A pilot effort in eight countries in the Africa region, the
External Implementation Status and Results Report Plus (E-ISR+), aimed to obtain feedback
from non-state players on project progress and results, and to systematically reﬂect external
feedback in implementation reporting (Box 4.6 summarizes the main lessons learned from E-
ISR+). Additional entry points for CE in monitoring World Bank operations include
collaboration with local CSOs, communities, local academia, or think-tanks in gathering results
data and conducting joint evaluations of project results after project completion (including in the
preparation of project Implementation Completion Reports).




                                                                                                        47
Box 4.6. Lessons learned from the E-ISR+
Background. In 2010, the main sections of a World Bank project’s Implementation Status Report (ISR) became
accessible to the public, reflecting the Bank’s new access to information policy and an effort to open up more
information about Bank operations to the external public. The Bank’s Africa team spearheaded the E-ISR+ effort in
eight countries: Burkina Faso, Congo-Brazzaville, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra
Leone, and Zambia. The E-ISR+ pilot was intended primarily to disclose current project information to external
stakeholders, to obtain feedback from non-state players on project progress and results, and to systematically reﬂect
external feedback in implementation reporting.

Methodology. Assessment teams generally tended to use a combination of in-depth key interviews and focus groups
with project beneficiaries and other stakeholders to gather information. The majority relied on qualitative rather than
quantitative inputs in their assessments. With respect to contracting out the work to the assessment team itself,
methodologies among Bank country management units varied. Some outsourced the task to market research firms,
others to civil society groups that had experience working with the World Bank or to individual in-country
consultants with civil society experience.

Lessons learned.
 • In general, beneﬁciaries and stakeholders expressed awareness and understanding of project objectives,
     although in some cases awareness of project objectives was low. Levels of satisfaction among stakeholders on
     the quality of consultations before and during project implementation varied.
 • Stakeholders identified obstacles to project implementation, such as delays in fund disbursement; lack of clear
     communication among project managers, government, and beneﬁciaries; and lack of understanding by
     community leaders of the potential negative impacts of projects.
 • CSOs build capacity in ﬁnding and analyzing information as well as the technical aspects of monitoring and
     evaluation of projects. To scale up citizen-led monitoring approaches such as E-ISR+, the capacity of civil
     society, and the pool of civil society players that have the technical capacity to carry out monitoring and
     evaluation of projects, both need to be increased.

F. Social Inclusion and Empowerment
113. CDD projects empower beneficiary communities with resources and control over
planning decisions and investment allocation. Over the past decade, CDD projects have
become a key way for many national and international aid agencies to deliver services, as
participation of affected communities can better meet the needs of communities and thereby
increase the efficiency of resource use. The World Bank supports approximately 400 CDD
projects in 94 countries, valued at almost US$30 billion. Over the past 10 years, CDD
investments have represented between 5 and 10 percent of the overall World Bank lending
portfolio (Wong, 2012). World Bank impact analyses found that such projects demonstrated
mixed results on achieving targeted outcomes. In the study by Wong (2012), on a positive note, a
small subset of projects was found to have achieved a measurable decline in relevant poverty
indicators such as incidences of food insecurity, unemployment, or increase in per capita
consumption. In addition, impact related to access to services was generally positive. However,
impact related to governance and social capital was mixed to nonexistent. Mansuri and Rao
(2013) found equally mixed evidence. Local officials have been found to target poor recipients
better, though this is more prevalent in rural than in urban areas. Similarly, while community-
based natural resource management has been found to improve sustainability, this impact is more
evident for forests with limited livelihood improvement opportunities. Participation in local
infrastructure development has been found to improve project maintenance, except in technically
complex projects. While additional work is required to better understand the causal chains of
impact at the local level, these findings highlight the potential challenges associated with CDD,
such as limited capacity, elite capture, or the interplay of local politics and resource allocation.

Box 4.7. Lessons from Decades of Citizen Engagement through CDD: PNPM, Indonesia, and KALAHI, the
Philippines
The experience of the PNPM CDD program in Indonesia and the KALAHI program in the Philippines is instructive
in understanding better how communities get engaged but is critical to understanding how they stay engaged.

•   Transparency in decision-making and the use of funds to ensure accountability, promote community
    engagement, and empower beneficiaries as central stakeholders. Information and transparency strategies
    include both written and oral methods of communication: (a) publicizing project and financial information
    including audits through village boards, websites, and the press; (b) transparency of fund transfer, amounts,
    holding, and control of funds, including proactively in village meetings; (c) a community communication
    platform, including active monitoring by NGO watchdogs and the media ICT mechanisms through social tools
    and ICT, and geomapping; and (d) literacy toolkits to help participants operationalize information for the
    benefit of their village.
•   Local controls to promote financial accountability. PNPM relies on communities taking control of funds and
    holding the account managers accountable. Financial management is placed close to the beneficiaries.
    Communities are empowered through simplified systems of disbursement, contracting, program documentation,
    and grievance handling. Procurement procedures promote choice; communities are empowered to negotiate
    locally for the best price. Disbursements are linked to public accountability meetings. Villages also carry out
    cross-village social audits.
•   Planning and oversight by women in separate women’s groups. In PNPM, women’s groups have proven
    particularly effective in monitoring the use of funds and materials. The separate planning stream for women is
    effective, with rules that women are required not only at planning and information-gathering meetings but also
    at decision-making meetings. In KALAHI, consistent efforts toward gender awareness are needed to break old
    patterns. Internal gender assessments found that, although women make up 40-60 percent of the Barangay
    assemblies, they have minimal participation in the KALAHI decision-making bodies. Moreover, women’s
    contributions in implementation frequently go unrecognized and uncompensated. Gender awareness among
    project staff, and especially field staff, is crucial in mainstreaming gender equity.
•   Facilitators are a cornerstone of effective citizen engagement. Facilitators are the agents of change. As a
    leader, trainer, and advocate for participatory, transparent, and accountable decision-making, the facilitator
    should address local power relations. The competencies of facilitators are crucial, and their professional
    development needs to be taken forward as a sustainable effort. Capacity to assist the community is vital, but so
    is the facilitators’ ability to pass on the tools so more empowered communities can do it themselves.
•   Community leaders emerge from groups of ordinary citizens. The experience of working as KALAHI
    community volunteers provided an effective training ground to transform community members into community
    leaders. Volunteers emerged as a new pool of leaders who are more service-oriented and committed—ordinary
    citizens trained and skilled in community mobilization and not drawn from elite groups in local communities.
•   Citizen engagement strategies need time and flexibility to shift engrained social norms. The processes through
    which communities participate in decision-making and implementation tend to disrupt the equilibrium of the
    existing social systems that enable resources to be managed in a manner that serves the interests of entrenched
    elites. Breaking down these social systems is necessarily a slow and gradual process and must be done with care
    and full knowledge of both beneficial and adverse consequences.
•   The involvement of NGOs adds legitimacy to CDD activities, but capacity is a limiting factor. The
    involvement of civil society can take several forms: (a) policy dialogue at the national level, mainly through the
    participation of NGO representatives; (b) independent monitoring of field implementation, (c) providing
    training for staff and community volunteers, (d) conducting learning exchanges among communities and
    facilitation in a few pilot municipalities, (e) discussions between staff and individual NGOs at local level to
    identify areas of collaboration, and (f) engagement in operations and maintenance. Greater involvement was
    hindered, at least in part, by difficulties in identifying competent NGOs and civil society groups.

114. CDD projects typically have a longer implementation time and can contribute to
sustainable country systems for participatory community development. A number of CDD
projects are being implemented under an adaptable program structure, allowing for follow-on
projects with an overall longer duration. The average duration of CDD projects included in the
World Bank’s impact analysis was close to 12 years (Wong, 2012). Iterative cycles of
engagement have several benefits: they build capacity in both the local community and
government agencies, they build trust and ownership of the participatory approach through a
realistic timeframe to achieve results, and they allow for learning and course corrections. They
can also contribute to sustainable country systems. For example, the planning structure and
delivery mechanisms put in place through the Indonesia PNPM project have become part of
Indonesia’s national poverty reduction program.

G. Capacity Building for Citizen Engagement
115. Capacity building for citizens, CSOs, communities, government officials, and
national accountability institutions to engage and participate in service delivery, natural
resource management, public financial management, or CDD projects can also contribute
to improved project outcomes (see Box 4.8). Capacity-building components are therefore
included in a number of World Bank-supported operations. Capacity building for all relevant
stakeholders is particularly necessary and needs to be systematically integrated into WBG-
supported operations where CE approaches are introduced for the first time at scale at the
national, sectoral, program, or project level. A focus on building government capacity is also
important to ensure the sustainability of engagement processes beyond the life of a project
intervention.


Box 4.8. Building the Capacity of Community Procurement Committees in Fragile Areas to Enhance
Transparency in Community Subproject Investments
Context. Two decades of armed conflict in Northern Uganda had led to economic stagnation and weakening of the
community safety-net systems and the traditional social and economic fabric. In response to these factors, the
Government of Uganda initiated the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) project to empower
communities in 18 districts of Northern Uganda by enhancing their capacity to systematically identify, prioritize,
and plan for their needs through subprojects; implement sustainable development initiatives to improve
socioeconomic services and opportunities; and, by placing money in the hands of communities, contribute to
improved livelihoods. The second NUSAF project further strengthened bottom-up accountability with a support
program provided as part of a Transparency, Accountability, and Anti-Corruption Program.

Actions (2009-present)
• NUSAF 1 made an effort to build the capacity of community project management committees and community
   procurement committees in their core duties, including by conducting executive committee and general
   community meetings; selecting and undertaking viable procurement options; monitoring the progress of
   subproject implementation; and managing contractors. These efforts were all geared toward ensuring high
   subproject completion rates and promoting the use and sustainability of community investments or their spin-off
   benefits. To enhance the involvement of communities in monitoring their subprojects, the project held trainings
   with subcounty technical staff. In turn, the trained staff mentored local community members in basic monitoring.
• NUSAF 2 instituted community project management committees with the primary responsibility of handling
   grievances at the grass-roots level. These committees are also trained to use community scorecards — a
   qualitative tool used for local-level monitoring of how inputs and expenditures match with entitlements and
   budget allocations. It also provided support to government to investigate reported cases of corruption and abuse
   of office during project implementation, including violations of project rules and procedures. Preventive
   measures include routine monitoring, inspections, education, and raising awareness among citizens; enforcement
   measures include the investigation of complaints about NUSAF 2 projects and, when necessary, the prosecution
                                                                                                                 50
     of criminal acts.

Results
• Improved utilization of community funds. The direct involvement of communities in monitoring enhanced
   subproject completion rates and promoted the utilization and sustainability of the investments.
• Reduced leakage in funds. The strengthened capacity of communities to perform oversight functions helped
   minimize some forms of malpractice at the community level, such as corruption, elite capture, and waste of
   community resources.
• Increased responsiveness of local governments. Despite variations in capacities across and within districts, local
   governments at the district and subcounty level have been responsive about appraising subprojects, providing
   technical support during implementation, and supporting the certification and commissioning of funded
   community investments.
• Enhanced capacity for grievance redress. A total of 3,695 community project management committees have
   already been instituted and trained in subproject implementation and grievance handling; 31 percent of the
   committee members were women. The SMS Corruption Reporting System (Report2IG), which will enable
   citizens to send SMS text messages to report cases of corruption, has been developed and tested.

H. ICT
          1. Impact of Technology on Citizen Engagement

116. Growing access to information and communication technologies in developing
countries holds the potential to make participatory processes more transparent, inclusive,
scalable, and cost-effective. The impact of ICT-mediated CE initiatives can be reviewed from
two angles (a) the effect of technology on participation, and (b) the effect of digital engagement
initiatives on public policies and service delivery.

117. However, there are conflicting findings regarding the effects of technology on levels
of participation and on biases in participatory processes. A number of digital engagement
initiatives show low levels of participation, while only a minority have shown significant success
in terms of uptake. Regarding participation biases, assessing two Ugandan mobile-based
accountability initiatives related to public service delivery and access to safe water, the Institute
for Development Studies found that participants are often “the usual suspects”: male, urban
dwellers, and the most educated individuals (McGee and Carlitz, 2013). By contrast, a field
experiment in the same country studying the use of mobile phones in enhancing engagement
between constituents and their representatives found that the use of ICT leads to greater
participation of marginalized groups when compared to traditional channels (Grossman and
others, 2014).

118. Similarly, the majority of digital engagement initiatives to date have had limited
impact on decision-making and service delivery (see Box 4.9). 26 Nevertheless, a few ICT
initiatives show positive results, with clear impact on policies and services, such as collaborative
policymaking efforts and participatory budgeting initiatives supported by mobile and web-based
applications (Peixoto, 2009; Alvarez and others, 2009). The evidence suggests that the
shortcomings in digital engagement initiatives are more than a matter of technological choices;
rather, they are the result of a poor understanding of the interplay among technology, institutions,

and contextual factors (Macintosh and White, 2006; Papadopoulos and Warin, 2007; Grönlund,
2010).

 Box 4.9. Digital Engagement and Limited Responsiveness
 While the 2011 launch of the Kenyan crowd-sourcing and monitoring platform, Huduma, was much celebrated
 by the development community, a recent assessment shows that of the 3,000 reports submitted via SMS, email,
 and Twitter, none had been resolved. Scholars have expressed concern about such tokenistic outcomes. Failures
 in creating meaningful digital engagement processes may undermine citizens’ willingness to participate and
 evoke further public skepticism about participatory processes.

        2. Role of Technology in CE

119. ICT can be used to support CE processes if it is designed to leverage the identified
CE approach. Technology can play a variety of roles, such as facilitating transparency,
mobilization, feedback, or responsiveness/closing the feedback loop. To identify at which stage
what type of technology can be applied in the specific context of a given CE initiative, the
following factors should be considered:

        •    Build on existing institutions, processes, and systems. ICT is most likely to produce
             its expected benefits when articulated with existing institutions, processes, and
             systems (Chadwick, 2011; Grönlund, 2010). A major source of failure in digital
             engagement initiatives is a tendency to position ICT as a solution in itself, giving it
             priority over institutional design matters, often to the detriment of both. Building ICT
             into existing institutions, processes, and systems reduces the risk of duplication of
             efforts and associated implementation costs for governments and increases the
             likelihood of meaningful engagement by citizens at lowered participation costs. ICT
             mechanisms for CE range from data visualizations to the use of mobile phones. While
             the selection of technological solutions matters, their effectiveness is dependent on
             the design and quality of the participatory processes in which they are embedded. ICT
             has been used successfully for such processes as participatory budgeting, citizens’
             councils, petitions, or part of an existing intervention within a government or Bank-
             supported project, such as the digital collection of citizen feedback to inform
             performance-based management processes, or to feed into ISRs.
        •    Adopting user-centric and hybrid approaches. The selection of appropriate
             technological solutions should be context-sensitive (Van Reijswoud, 2009). Clearly
             understanding how a population routinely uses technology can lower barriers to
             participation. For instance, research suggests that the use of SMS solutions may affect
             the inclusion of rural populations (see Box 4.10), who have lower incomes and
             educational attainment. The use of alternatives such as voice-based technologies may
             increase the likelihood of including marginalized groups. Furthermore, different ICT
             tools (e.g., mobile, web) may mobilize different demographics (see Figure 4.1). The
             inclusiveness of digital engagement initiatives is increased by adopting a multi-
             channel approach, diversifying the paths for participation and collaboration, and
             combining digital with offline processes.
        •    Iterative and incremental approach. To ensure scalability and sustainability of
             digital engagement initiatives, the deployment of ICT tools should follow an iterative
                                                                                                            52
             and incremental approach—that is, identifying the best solutions as they are
             developed and used, allowing for a process of continuous learning that informs the
             design of subsequent features and solutions. To reduce costs, avoid vendor lock-in,
             and increase opportunities for collaboration across projects, digital engagement
             initiatives should, whenever appropriate, give priority to the use of open-source
             software over proprietary solutions.

 Box 4.10. Mobile Phones, SMS, and Inclusiveness

 A study looking at SMS use among the low-income mobile owners in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka,
 and Thailand found the following:
     •    Approximately 32 percent of the mobile owners have ever used SMS.
     •    While the distribution of MS) users is similar between urban and rural, a large proportion (73 percent)
          of the non-SMS users live in rural areas.
     •    The users’ reported daily income was higher than that of the non-users.
     •    The non-users tend to have lower education; 83 percent had only primary schooling or no formal
          education.

         3. The World Bank Approach to Digital Engagement

120. ICT can play an important role in CE as a means to support scalable, sustainable,
inclusive, and cost-effective participatory processes. This requires bringing together different
types of expertise and capabilities relevant to activities found at the intersection of technology
and CE. The following strategic points will guide the Bank’s approach to digital engagement in
support of mainstreaming CE in its operations.



                                                                                                               53
121. Bank operations can support governments in learning how to use ICT to support
CE. To avoid the pitfalls highlighted in the previous sections, areas of support to governments
may include the following:

           •    Assistance for governments and task teams to select appropriate technologies
                reflective of national and subnational engagement contexts, following incremental
                and iterative approaches.
           •    Identification of suitable entry points for ICT in a specific results chain design for
                CE.
           •    Design and implementation of ICT solutions that can increase transparency,
                participation, and inclusiveness, and adapting them for specific contexts, including
                capacity building.
           •    Monitoring and evaluation of digital engagement initiatives.
           •    Bridging the government/digital civil society gap by bringing together government
                demand and civil society expertise.

122. Knowledge generation and knowledge sharing: the Bank will develop a digital
engagement evaluation framework to assess the effect of ICT in participatory processes as well
as the impact of these processes on public policy and service delivery compared to non-ICT-
based processes. The Bank will also partner with actors in the field of digital engagement to
promote knowledge sharing and collaborative research efforts. To meet TTLs’ demand for
guidance on the use of ICT for CE, the Bank will strengthen existing services and knowledge
and learning programs in the area of digital engagement in coordination with the broader
knowledge management for CE.

123. ICT-enabled CE will be integrated in projects. The development of ICT components
to support CE projects where such engagement can improve results will follow an incremental
and iterative approach, prioritizing the use of open-source software to promote the scalability and
cost-effectiveness of digital engagement processes. The Bank will also partner with collaborative
efforts that aim to reduce the costs of developing digital engagement solutions, ultimately
reducing the barriers for the implementation of ICT-supported CE initiatives. 27

                            V. Improved Monitoring and Results Reporting

124. Better understanding and monitoring of the outcomes of CE in WBG-supported
operations is an objective of this framework. As Chapter III outlined, monitoring and
reporting on the outcomes of CE in World Bank-supported operations is not systematic. As part
of the results-focused approach, this framework will be followed by work on results chains 28 for
CE across various outcome areas. Relevant staff guidance which suggests indicators to be used
in IPF results frameworks to track progress on implementing CE activities has been issued 29.


27
     See, for instance, Poplus: A Global Federation for Civic Tech, http://poplus.org/.
28
     In the context of WBG operations, results chains include inputs/activities, outputs, and intermediate and final outcomes that
     an operation can reasonably be expected to achieve. In CE and social accountability literature, the alternative terms causal
     chains or theory of change are being used to describe similar thinking.
29
     See Updated Investment Project Financing Project Preparation Guidance Note and the Results Framework and M&E
     Guidance Note.
                                                                                                                              54
Building adaptive capacity and evaluating the long-term impact of CE in WBG-supported
operations is equally relevant.

A. Results Chains and Proposed Indicators
125. Illustrative results chains will be made available for the five outcome areas of
improved service delivery, public financial management, governance, natural resource
management, and inclusion and empowerment, as well as enabling information activities to
help operational teams and clients identify how tailored CE activities can best contribute to
improve specific outcomes in a given context. For the purpose of developing these results chains,
CE approaches have been grouped into seven areas: consultations; complaint and grievance
redress-handling mechanisms; collecting, recording; and reporting on inputs received from
citizens; collaboration in decision-making; citizen-led monitoring and evaluation and oversight;
citizen empowerment over resources and their use; and capacity building for CE. For each of
these activity areas, a list of indicative CE indicators has been made available to teams that can
be included in project results frameworks and reported on during project implementation.

126. Measuring CE outcomes and impacts is challenging because of the difficulty of
isolating the different contributing factors, the direction of causality, and the important
role of context and enabling conditions. Building on recent research, the results chains are
based on certain assumptions that would need to be validated when preparing specific project-
level results frameworks—assumptions related to citizens’ ability to access timely and useful
information, as well as their capacity, incentives, and means to participate; public officials’
motivation and capacity to respond to citizens’ concerns; and the legitimacy of collective citizen
action. In addition, the results of these processes do not necessarily follow a linear process and
can depend on a number of context-specific, interrelated, and iterative factors. 30

127. An indicative list of outcome indicators to monitor and report on the results of CE
activities has been provided in an updated Results Framework and M&E Guidance Note to help
WB operational teams and clients develop results frameworks for IPFs. As a basis to select the
indicators, the team reviewed the results frameworks of 374 WBG projects and 44 CASs that
included CE-related indicators. 31 To systematically monitor CE outcomes in WBG-supported
operations other than IPFs where their inclusion can contribute to improved results, CE
indicators need to be developed, included in results frameworks, and reported on where
relevant—for example, in CPFs and DPLs. In addition, sector-specific CE approaches can be
piloted.

128. Internal and external indicators measuring aspects of CE were also analyzed. 32                                      In
addition, useful feedback was obtained from regional pilot projects in mainstreaming CE.

30
     For example, see World Bank, SDV Flagship (forthcoming, 2014)
31
     The review included 300 investment lending projects approved in FY11-12, 74 of the 199 DPL operations approved in FY10-
     12, and 44 of 66 CAS products.
32
     The following sources were reviewed to propose indicators: World Bank Core Sector Indicators; Afrobarometer; Bertelsmann
     Transformation Index; Countries at the Crossroads—Freedom House; CPIA indicators (World Bank); Global Witness Forest
     Transparency Scorecard; Global Corruption Barometer; Global Integrity Index; Global Right to Information Ranking;
     Human Resource Management Index; Indices of Social Development; OECD Better Life Index; Open Budget Index; Public
     Expenditure and Financial Accountability Initiative; Service Delivery Indicators (World Bank-Africa); Social Inclusion
     Indicators (World Bank); Sustainable Governance Index; Transparency International Corruption Perception Index; USAID
     CSO Sustainability Index; World Values Survey; World Justice Project-Rule of Law; and Worldwide Governance Indicators.
                                                                                                                         55
B. Internal Reporting
129. Progress on CE in IPF (“beneficiary feedback”) will be monitored by the
Presidential Delivery Unit by tracking (a) the integration of results indicators into project-
level results frameworks at design, and (b) reporting on the indicators during project
implementation in ISRs 33. Improvement in scaling up CE and implementation of grievance
redress will be monitored through World Bank Corporate Scorecard indicators on (a) IPF
operations with beneficiary feedback during implementation (percentage), 34 and (b) grievances
registered related to delivery of project benefits that are actually addressed (percentage). At the
institutional level, it is envisaged that such attention will strengthen incentives to improve
implementation of CE and GRMs. The IDA Results Measurement System will also track
progress on the percentage of projects using beneficiary feedback.

C. Long-Term Impact Analysis
130. An institution-wide approach to systematic impact evaluation of CE and beneficiary
feedback would provide greater understanding of the links with development outcomes.
World Bank-financed projects typically have an active life of five years, while long-term impacts
have a longer gestation period. In terms of approaches to impact evaluation of citizen
engagement, the emerging consensus from leading scholars points to a combination of
quantitative methods (such as randomized control trials) and qualitative methods, including
participatory methods or field-based case study approaches (Joshi, 2013). Such long-term impact
evaluations will need to be conducted outside the operational scope of a project to cover long-
term lessons learned across a critical mass of experiences.

131. Opportunities to build adaptive learning mechanisms into project implementation
are being piloted. Such potential mechanisms can build on data generated jointly by project
beneficiaries and government implementation agencies and can be supported by decision support
systems that enable project staff and participants to make real-time adjustments on the basis of
continuous feedback and learning. This approach is being piloted as part of World Bank-
supported livelihood projects in India (World Bank, 2013f).


D. IFC
132. IFC has recently developed and is testing a tool, the Performance Standard Achievement
Rating (PSAR), which measures progress toward higher-level objectives and key elements in the
Performance Standards over time. This tool is an index that allows monitoring of trends and
behaviors in different regions, sectors, and countries, and supports decision-making and
allocation of appropriate environmental and social resources. The PSAR describes the degree of
implementation of applicable elements of a given Performance Standard on the basis of a
structured approach and the professional judgment of environmental and social specialists. It

133. IFC has chosen Factor 4 (in Performance Standard 1) of the PSAR to measure
progress in the context of this Framework. Each Performance Standard includes two to five
factors based on the key elements of the Performance Standard, and uses a six-point rating scale.
Factor 4 in Performance Standard 1 focuses specifically on stakeholder engagement for the
subset of IFC projects for which the concept of measuring stakeholder engagement is
meaningful. 35 Table 5.1 displays the description of Factor 4 Stakeholder Engagement and what it
means when it is fully achieved by a project, and Table 5.2 provides guidelines on how to rate
Factor 4. Consistent application of PSAR allows the comparison of the PSAR index at appraisal
and during the following project supervision cycles, and reflects the value-added of IFC
engagement. Additionally, PSAR enables IFC to demonstrate to its stakeholders how it is
delivering on its commitment to sustainable development in a way that is easy to understand and
aggregate. 36

35
     The methodology still needs to be adjusted to make it operational in the context of this framework; the PSAR in IFC is owned
     by the Environmental and Social Department.
36
     The PSAR design reflects these key criteria and characteristics: (a) it should have an appropriate balance between simplicity
     and thoroughness; (b) it must be based on key elements of each Performance Standard; and (c) given the diversity of
     investment products, it should have broad judgment criteria for grading the degree of Performance Standard implementation.
                                                                                                                              57
                                                  VI. Enabling Factors

A. Access to Information
134. Access to timely, user-friendly, reliable, and comprehensive information is a
necessary but not sufficient precondition for effective CE. As Chapter III pointed out,
evidence challenges the assumption that open access to transparent information automatically
induces participation and impact, which also depend on such context factors as enabling
legislation and grassroots activism (Pande, 2007; Keefer and Khemani, 2011; Lieberman and
others, 2014). At the same time, access to information is required as a basis for effective citizen
CE. Information formats and activities need to be part of the design of CE processes and be
based on an understanding of the target audience (e.g., regarding their access to ICT, literacy,
and so on). Good practice principles for information sharing as an enabler for CE require that the
information provided be relevant (responsive to citizens’ interests), timely (sufficient notice),
and understandable (language, format, and local context).

135. The World Bank champions a number of “openness initiatives,” including capacity
building for citizens, in the use of relevant information and data. Through its Access to
Information Policy, 37 the World Bank makes all operational documents publicly available via its
Operations Portal, unless certain exceptions apply. In addition, the World Bank is a founding
signatory of and regularly publishes data about its operations to the International Aid
Transparency Initiative (IATI). The World Bank also collaborates with and supports an extensive
portfolio of openness initiatives, including the following:
      •    The Open Government Partnership, which works with governments, CSOs, and others to
           develop an action plan, including measures to involve citizens in open government
           initiatives.
      •    The Open Aid Partnership, which works with governments and citizens to develop open
           and collaborative maps, and promotes the role of citizens/CSOs as infomediaries to make
           these maps more accessible and ultimately use them as a feedback tool.
      •    The Open Contracting Partnership, which aims to enhance disclosure and effective
           monitoring of government procurement and contracts, including through CE around the
           use of public resources (see Box 4.11).

136. The IFC Access to Information Policy sets out the scope of information shared with
interested stakeholders either routinely or upon request. 38 It also encourages all IFC clients
to be more transparent about their businesses to help broaden understanding of their specific
projects and of private sector development in general, 39 and it requires them to continuously
engage with communities affected by their projects through the disclosure of information. 40 In
accordance with these principles, the information that IFC makes available enables its clients,
partners, stakeholders, and other interested members of the public to better understand, and to

     In addition, IFC believes that when clients are committed to transparency and accountability they help promote the long-term
     profitability of their investments.
40
     In a manner that is also consistent with IFC’s Policy and Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability.
                                                                                                                             58

other impacts of IFC’s activities.41


Box 4.11: Open Contracting: At the Interface of Access to Information, Capacity Building, and CE
The former World Bank Institute (WBI), now the Leadership, Learning and Innovation (LLI) Vice Presidency of the
WBG, has led the incubation of the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP), a collaborative initiative that strengthens
transparency and monitoring of government contracts, from pre-award to award to implementation. WBI launched
this OCP through multi-stakeholder dialogues comprising leaders from government, civil society, development
partners, and the private sector, thereby building commitment to strengthen disclosure and participation in public
contracting for better service delivery in different sectors, such as health care.
Open Contracting in Extractives. The OCP is helping to build commitments to open contracting in more than 20
countries, including Afghanistan, Colombia, Iraq, Niger, Sierra Leone, Guinea, DRC, Liberia, Ghana, Peru,
Ecuador, East Timor, and the US. In Ghana, for example, all government payments to extractives industry actors
are now disclosed on a quarterly basis to enable citizens to 'follow the money' from government to the extractives
sector; government has also taken the step of disclosing many of Ghana’s petroleum agreements, to further enable
'following the money' of royalty payments back to the public. WBI has helped to accelerate these transparency
initiatives by launching the Ghana Extractives Industries Map, a free online, interactive mapping platform that gives
users access to and visualizes information about the mining, oil, and gas sectors in the country, including links to
contracts, company information and sustainability reports. WBI concurrently launched the Governance of Extractive
Industries (GOXI) platform as a space for dialogue, peer-learning, and collaboration for those actively working on
governance issues in the extractive industries. The Accra-based Civil Society Platform on Oil and Gas—hosted by
the Integrated Social Development Center—has been able to guide public sector progress toward a transparent
system for managing oil revenues and the inauguration of the Public Interest and Accountability Committee which is
tasked with monitoring compliance with the revenue law. Civil Society has started to pilot monitoring tools and
applications, to help strengthen accountability among extractives industries in Ghana, and ensure communities are
benefitting from extractives royalties, as mandated by law.


Transparent and accountable pharmaceutical procurement and supply chain management. Annual global
pharmaceutical expenditure is US$750 billion, of which consumers lose approximately US$300 billion to human
error and corruption. In Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, the OCP is aiming to support better health outcomes by
improving efficiency, competition, transparency, and accountability in the procurement and supply of essential
medicines. The OCP launched this support in 2010 by convening stakeholders from these countries’ pharmaceutical
procurement agencies, public procurement oversight authorities, ministries of health, civil society, academia, and the
private sector. In all three countries, the initiative has facilitated the design and application of innovative tools,
which are generating baseline data and providing an evidence base for joint (state and non-state actor) decision-
making on reform priorities in the sector.

      •    Uganda. The multi-stakeholder Medicines Transparency Alliance has completed an extensive survey on
           medicine availability and health service delivery, covering 200 facilities and 10 districts. The findings
           (http://blogs.worldbank.org/ic4d/files/Uganda_MeTA_Infographic.pdf) from the exercise are already
           guiding reforms articulated in both the national Health Sector Strategic Investment Plan and the Uganda
           Health Systems Strengthening Project, and they have informed the midsector review of the project. In
           direct response to the findings of the survey, the National Medical Stores has revisited its procedures and
           practices, with a view to expediting delivery of essential medicines to health facilities, especially at lower
           levels of care. At the request of the Ministry of Health, the coalition is also leveraging its experience in
           third-party monitoring to track progress in the implementation of interventions related to other areas of
           health service delivery, including maternal, newborn, and family planning services.


41
     IFC systematically makes available institutional information and project-level information regarding investments and
     advisory services provided by IFC to its clients. In determining the availability of any particular information, IFC first
     considers whether such information falls within the scope of its responsibilities under the Access to Information Policy; and
     if it does, IFC then determines whether there is any compelling reason not to disclose all or any part of such information. In
     making this determination, IFC considers whether the disclosure of information is likely to cause harm to specific parties or
     interests that outweighs the benefit of disclosure.
                                                                                                                               59
    •   Kenya. The multi-stakeholder Forum for Transparency and Accountability in Pharmaceutical Procurement
        collaborated with the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) to design and test-pilot a Mobile Drug
        Tracking System (MDTS), which provides citizens, community health workers, health facilities, and health
        management committees with real-time information on medicine availability in selected health facilities.
        Since the pilot in 2012, the coalition has received funding from Making All Voices Count (in 2014) to scale
        up MDTS and to develop a Medicines Price Reference Guide for essential medicines. Such a guide is
        necessary in the context of Kenya’s new devolution processes to ensure that (a) consumers continue to
        receive low prices on medicines; (b) counties secure competitive prices for medicines; and (c) the
        opportunities for corruption are minimized.
    •   Tanzania. The coalition has completed an assessment of procurement practices (for pharmaceuticals) used
        in the Dodoma region. It is now exploring—with the Regional Commissioner and the Public Procurement
        and Regulatory Authority—quick, high-impact interventions to address some of the emerging issues.

To facilitate collaboration and knowledge exchange among these stakeholders, the WBG launched the Electronic
Network for Procurement Practitioners (e-Nepp) platform; it has become a “safe space” to share challenges,
innovative solutions, and resources to help move sensitive reforms forward. In October 2014, the OCP will launch a
World Bank Study on Accelerating Health Reforms through Collective Action: Experiences from East Africa, which
distills key lessons and insights from building and sustaining multi-stakeholder coalitions in the health sector.


B. Capacity Building
        1. For Citizens/CSOs

137. Building adequate citizen/CSO capacity to engage is important for CE to achieve
results. Capacity building for citizens/CSOs that is required for a successful program or project
needs to be embedded in the operation. Capacity building for citizen/CSO engagement outside of
and complementary to WBG-supported operations can be provided through complementary trust
funds such as the GPSA, which provides capacity building to CSOs for third-party monitoring
and other social accountability initiatives. In addition, the World Bank has launched preparations
for a Massive Open Online Course to educate the public, including CSOs, about the benefits of
engaging with governments and the private sector in development interventions. The course will
be available in FY15. Additional regional training initiatives are planned (see Annex V).

        2. For Governments

138. Government willingness and capacity to engage with citizens and adequately
respond to their feedback is at the heart of successful CE initiatives. On the basis of an
assessment of the government’s capacity for sustainable CE, capacity building for governments
to respond to citizens in the context of WBG-supported operations needs to be included in the
design of the particular program or project. Capacity building provided through World Bank-
supported projects and programs can include training officials in the benefits of engaging with
citizens in various sectors and settings and the mechanisms for doing so, including knowledge
exchange with other governments that have successfully implemented CE initiatives; investment
in complaint management and other systems; and/or additional staff, as government officials
typically require time in addition to their existing duties to respond to citizens’ concerns.

139. Capacity building for governments should include support for building effective
national, local, or sectoral institutions for engagement, such as supreme audit institutions,
anticorruption agencies, or local government structures. This is particularly relevant in the
context of operations supporting improved outcomes in public financial management,
governance, or social inclusion. Capacity building for regulators is also relevant in the context of
                                                                                                               60
infrastructure service delivery projects. For example, the Cambodia Demand for Good
Governance Project built the capacity of government institutions by, among other things,
providing technical assistance to (a) the Ministry of the National Assembly in law dissemination
and complaints handling system under the Land Law; (b) the District Ombudsman Office on
complaints handling and resolution; and (c) the Arbitration Council on establishing partnerships
and stakeholder outreach and training. As a result, the Arbitration Council has handled nearly
1,000 cases with a 76 percent resolution rate, and the Government has established district
ombudsman offices throughout the country.

           3. For Staff

140. In the short term, a number of corporate and regional staff training initiatives are
planned to facilitate the rollout of this strategic framework. The LCR region has already
conducted staff training related to ICT-enabled CE; the MNA region is preparing a series of staff
training to support mainstreaming initiatives for CE; and the ECA region has launched staff
training. A number of existing training materials, such as the Social Accountability E-Guide, are
available for this purpose. 42 CE content will also be included in core operational training
programs.

141. During the rollout of this framework, it will be necessary to take a flexible approach
to leveraging the limited staff resources available to support scaling up CE. In this context,
experienced staff across the institution can take the lead in internal training based on their day-
to-day work experience in this area. In addition, the model of “engagement leaders” has proven
useful: experienced staff coach and work with TTLs to integrate CE mechanisms and tools into
their operations. In the medium term, the objective is to ensure that each Global Practice has
access to in-house staff skills on CE related to its sector and area of engagement.


C. Knowledge Management
142. A systematic approach to internal knowledge management is required to maximize
learning and facilitate mainstreaming CE in WBG-supported operations. To meet staff
demand for access to experiences, guidance, and resources, the MNA and LCR regions have
created a web space for regional task teams. In addition, the social accountability and demand for
good governance website provides an overview of materials, including case studies, training
materials, handbooks, reports, guidance and how-to notes, toolkits, and presentations. 43

143. Going forward, to take into account the new World Bank organizational structure
and to facilitate a coherent approach to institutional mainstreaming of CE, it is
recommended that the Bank pool all available and planned resources in one cross-cutting
CE knowledge platform. Responsibility for administering the platform will need to be aligned
with the implementation arrangements for mainstreaming CE (see Chapter VII.). A single
manager for the knowledge platform is recommended to, among other things, identify case

useful to share across the WBG.


                             VII. Implementation Arrangements
144. In addition to the enabling factors outlined above, the successful mainstreaming of
CE in WBG operations requires clear institutional responsibilities and ongoing work in
partnerships. This chapter lays out the planned approach to both.

A. Implementation Responsibilities
145. Regions and Global Practices need to be involved to mainstream CE in WBG-
supported operations. The guiding principles for this collaboration include the operational
principles identified in this framework—that is, results-focused, context-specific, focused on
strengthening country systems, and engaging throughout the operational cycle (see Chapter II.D.)
The regions will continue to play an important role in identifying country-specific entry points
and demand for CE, and in anchoring CE activities in country programs where such activities
can contribute to improved results. In this context, existing regional strategies and approaches for
scaling CE can be built on (see Annex IV). The Global Practices will need to prepare and
implement the technical operations and monitor progress on the corporate beneficiary feedback
target in IPFs. Mapping, consolidating, and scaling up staff skills as well as fostering knowledge
exchange among staff, clients, and CSOs are important elements in scaling up CE for improved
results in WBG-supported operations.

146. An implementation structure is being developed to mainstream CE in WBG-
supported operations, building on existing structures and institutional mandates, and including
a light coordination mechanism across responsible units. The structure will leverage existing
staff skills in the two GPs with substantial operational experience in CE—the Urban, Rural and
Social Development GP and the Governance GP—and will involve practitioners from other GPs,
regions, and relevant corporate units to facilitate institution-wide mainstreaming, knowledge-
sharing, and learning. Efforts will continue to allow for information exchange and training of
practitioners, including staff, governments, CSOs, and other partners, building on such efforts as
the social accountability community of practice.

B. Working in Partnership with External Stakeholders
147. During implementation of the framework, there will be opportunities to continue to
partner with and seek inputs from external parties. Building on the participatory approach to
the development of this strategic framework, the collaboration with the external Advisory
Council that has informed the preparation of this framework will continue during
implementation. The Advisory Council, which meets at least every six months, comprises
experienced technical experts from civil society, government, private sector, foundations,
academia, and development partners with proven experience in achieving improved development
outcomes through CE (see Annex VI). In addition, regular dialogue with external partners,
including CSOs, will be sought during implementation. Furthermore, implementation experience
can also be informed by lessons learned from the GPSA. As relevant, country-level dialogues

                                                                                                 62
with local stakeholders on opportunities and obstacles in implementing CE for improved results
as part of the World Bank’s country portfolio are also encouraged.


                              VIII. Conclusions and Next Steps

148. When designed carefully, CE has the potential to contribute to improved
development results at the country, program, and project levels. The literature review and
stocktaking conducted for this framework have confirmed that CE can contribute to improved
intermediate and final development outcomes in the areas of service delivery, public financial
management, governance, natural resource management, and social inclusion/empowerment. In
some cases, CE has also been found to contribute to higher-level development goals, such as
poverty reduction. In all cases, the results of CE were highly contextual, with outcomes being
affected by demand- and supply-side factors, such as the capacity and willingness of
governments and citizens to engage, as well as by political, economic, social, cultural, or
geographic factors. Additional research is required to further unpack the causal chains
underlying these contextual impacts. While the evidence points to certain recurring themes, such
as the importance of government ownership of engagement processes or citizen capacity to
engage, overall it highlights the fact that there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach for scaling up
CE in development interventions.

149. Successful mainstreaming of CE in WBG-supported operations requires several
preconditions. On the side of governments and citizens, they include the need for government
ownership, adequate capacity and knowledge to engage, and access to necessary information. On
the side of WBG staff, skills need to be scaled up to support CE across sectors and regions; a
Bankwide knowledge platform and approaches to knowledge exchange need to be created; and
adequate resources need to be provided to cover staff time for the preparation and supervision of
CE activities in operations, while funding for their implementation needs to be included in the
operation itself.

150. Going forward, the following steps are required to mainstream CE in WBG-
supported operations in the short term:

       (a) Systematically incorporating engagement mechanisms in IPF to move toward the
           corporate target of including beneficiary feedback in 100 percent of projects with
           clearly identified beneficiaries. This includes (a) systematically including CE and
           associated results indicators in all new IPF operations, and (b) improving results
           reporting on CE indicators in existing operations, with a strategic focus on projects in
           the sectors that have the largest share of projects (transport, energy, water,
           agriculture, health, education) and projects that include consultations and GRMs
           related to safeguards. In addition, GP-specific targets for CE in IPF operations need
           to be finalized and monitored.

       (b) Piloting CE activities in the rest of the portfolio—including in advisory services
           and analytics (e.g., SCDs), IFC investment operations and public-private dialogues—
           and capturing knowledge from these pilots.

                                                                                                63
       (c) Improving staff skills: A mapping of staff skills in the urban, rural and social,
           governance, and other Global Practices needs to be completed. Subsequently, staff
           skills need to be upgraded to incorporate a basic understanding of the building blocks
           of a results-focused approach to CE (context analysis, stakeholder mapping, clarity of
           objective, and monitoring of results). Staff time required both for training and for
           supporting and training country and task teams in the rollout of CE activities in their
           portfolios needs to be adequately budgeted for. Creating a comprehensive knowledge
           platform for CE and facilitating structured knowledge exchange is required.

151.   Over the medium term, areas for potential further work include the following:

       (a) Exploring how budget support operations can scale up support for the creation
           or strengthening of country systems for sustainable CE with governments and the
           private sector.
       (b) Developing an approach to improved results monitoring of and reporting on CE
           activities across additional operational products and sectors. To systematically
           monitor CE outcomes in WBG-supported operations other than IPFs where their
           inclusion can contribute to improved results, CE indicators need to be developed,
           included in results frameworks, and reported on where relevant—for example, in
           CPFs and DPLs. In addition, sector-specific CE approaches can be piloted.
       (c) Taking stock, consolidating lessons learned, and identifying additional strategic
           initiatives in support of mainstreaming CE in WBG-supported operations, such
           as sector-specific or programmatic approaches, where such engagement may be
           useful to help accelerate development outcomes.

152. The long-term agenda for mainstreaming CE in WBG-supported operations could
include the following:

       (a) A long-term impact evaluation of WBG-supported operations with CE;
       (b) Taking stock of adaptive learning pilots and lessons learned; and
       (c) Ongoing longitudinal research on the impact of CE, the role of context factors, and so
           on.


153. In mainstreaming CE, the WBG will continue to work with its partners. At the
global level, the External Advisory Council will continue to accompany the implementation of
this framework for 24 months. Additional opportunities for exchanges with development partners
and CSOs will be sought. At the country level, partnerships will be sought with governments,
development partners, and CSOs to support sustainable engagement processes at the country,
sector, and local levels.

        Annex I: Overview of CE Mechanisms, Definitions, and Uses


Budget literacy campaigns are efforts—usually by civil society, academics, or research
institutes—to build citizen and civil society capacity to understand budgets in order to hold
government accountable for budget commitments and to influence budget priorities.

Citizen charter is a document that informs citizens about the service entitlements they have
as users of a public service; the standards they can expect for a service (timeframe and
quality); remedies available for non adherence to standards; and the procedures, costs, and
charges of a service. The charters entitle users to an explanation (and in some cases
compensation) if the standards are not met.

Citizen report card is an assessment of public services by the users (citizens) through client
feedback surveys. It goes beyond data collection to being an instrument for exacting public
accountability through extensive media coverage and civil society advocacy that accompanies
the process.

Citizen satisfaction surveys provide a quantitative assessment of government performance
and service delivery based on citizens’ experience. Depending on the objective, the surveys
can collect data on a variety of topics ranging from perceptions of performance of service
delivery and elected officials to desires for new capital projects and services

Citizen/User membership in decision-making bodies is a way to ensure accountability by
allowing people who can reflect users’ interests to sit on committees that make decisions
about project activities under implementation (project-level arrangement) or utility boards
(sector-level arrangement).

Citizens’ juries are a group of selected members of a community that make recommendations
or action participatory instrument to supplement conventional democratic processes.
Community contracting is when community groups are contracted for the provision of
services, or when community groups contract service providers or the construction of
infrastructure.
Community management is when services are fully managed or owned by service users or
communities. Consumers own the service directly (each customer owns a share) when they
form cooperatives.

Community monitoring is a system of measuring, recording, collecting, and analyzing
information; and communicating and acting on that information to improve performance. It
holds government institutions accountable, provides ongoing feedback, shares control over
M&E, engages in identifying and/or taking corrective actions, and seeks to facilitate dialogue
between citizens and project authorities.

Community oversight is the monitoring of publicly funded construction projects by citizens,
community-based and/or civil society organizations, participating directly or indirectly in
exacting accountability. It applies across all stages of the project cycle although the focus is
on the construction phase.




                                                                                                   65
Community scorecard is a community-based monitoring tool that assesses services, projects,
and government performance by analyzing qualitative data obtained through focus group
discussions with the community. It usually includes interface meetings between service
providers and users to formulate an action plan to address any identified problems and
shortcomings.
Consultation, as distinct from dialogue, is a more structured exchange in which the convener
commits to “active listening” and to carefully consider the comments, ideas, and
recommendations received. Good practice consultations provide feedback on what was heard,
and what was or was not incorporated and why to ensure that consultations contribute to
improved policies and programs.

Focus group discussions are usually organized with specific goals, structures, time frames,
and procedures. Focus groups are composed of a small number of stakeholders to discuss
project impacts and concerns and consult in an informal setting. They are designed to gauge
the response to the project's proposed actions and to gain a detailed understanding of
stakeholders’ perspectives, values, and concerns

Grievance redress mechanism (or complaints-handling mechanism) is a system by which
queries or clarifications about the project are responded to, problems with implementation are
resolved, and complaints and grievances are addressed efficiently and effectively.

Independent budget analysis is a process where civil society stakeholders research, explain,
monitor, and disseminate information about public expenditures and investments to influence
the allocation of public funds through the budget.
Input tracking refers to monitoring the flow of physical assets and service inputs from central
to local levels. It is also called input monitoring.
Integrity pacts are a transparency tool that allows participants and public officials to agree
on rules to be applied to a specific procurement. It includes an “honesty pledge” by which
involved parties promise not to offer or demand bribes. Bidders agree not to collude in order
to obtain the contract; and if they do obtain the contract, they must avoid abusive practices
while executing it.
Participatory budgeting is a process through which citizens participate directly in budget
formulation, decision-making, and monitoring of budget execution. It creates a channel for
citizens to give voice to their budget priorities.
Participatory physical audit refers to community members taking part in the physical
inspection of project sites, especially when there are not enough professional auditors to
inspect all facilities. Citizens measure the quantity and quality of construction materials,
infrastructure, and facilities.
Participatory planning convenes a broad base of key stakeholders, on an iterative basis, in
order to generate a diagnosis of the existing situation and develop appropriate strategies to
solve jointly identified problems. Project components, objectives, and strategies are designed
in collaboration with stakeholders.

Procurement monitoring refers to independent, third-party monitoring of procurement
activities by citizens, communities, or civil society organizations to ensure there are no
leakages or violation of procurement rules.




                                                                                                  66
Public displays of information refers to the posting of government information, usually about
projects or services, in public areas such as on billboards or in government offices, schools,
health centers, community centers, project sites, and other places where communities receive
services or discuss government affairs.

Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) involves citizen groups tracing the flow of
public resources for the provision of public goods or services from origin to destination. It
can help to detect bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or corruption.

Public hearings are formal community-level meetings where local officials and citizens have
the opportunity to exchange information and opinions on community affairs. Public hearings
are often one element in a social audit initiative.

Public reporting of expenditures refers to the public disclosure and dissemination of
information about government expenditures to enable citizens to hold government
accountable for their expenditures.
Social Audit (also called social accounting) is a monitoring process through which
organizational or project information is collected, analyzed, and shared publicly in a
participatory fashion. Community members conduct investigative work at the end of which
findings are shared and discussed publicly.

User management committees refer to consumer groups taking on long-term management
roles to initiate, implement, operate, and maintain services. User management committees are
for increasing participation as much as they are for accountability and financial controls.




                                                                                                 67
      Annex II: Background Literature Review for Strategic Framework for
            Mainstreaming Citizen Engagement in WBG Operations
1.      This annex is a review of the current state of knowledge on the outcomes and impact of
citizen engagement initiatives, which draws on research and experiences of development
practitioners both within and outside of the World Bank Group (WBG). Section I provides a
brief introduction to the citizen engagement (CE) concept; Section II provides evidence of the
impact of CE activities for five outcome areas, including service delivery, public financial
management, governance, natural resource management, and social inclusion. Section III
discusses contextual factors that contribute to impact. Section IV presents lessons learned, and
Section V highlights existing gaps and proposed areas for future research.

                       I. CONCEPTUALIZING CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT

2.     While the growth of literature on CE attests to the interest in this area and its intrinsic
value, it increasingly recognizes the need to harness its potential to improve development
outcomes.

       The idea of citizen participation is a little like eating spinach: no one is against it in principle
       because it is good for you… (Arnstein, 1969).

3.      Open and inclusive policy-making is most often promoted as a means of improving
democratic performance and efficient and effective administration (Shah, 2007). By
enhancing transparency and accountability, it helps to build legitimacy and trust in government.
This helps to manage citizens’ expectations, build ownership of development processes, and
encourage compliance with policy decisions. It also contributes to improved utilization of public
resources and quality of policy outcomes and, in doing so, promotes greater equity of access to
public policy-making and services (OECD, 2009). Beierle and Cayford (2002) suggest that
citizens are recognized as a resource for problem solving, and that based on their practical
knowledge and day-to-day experiences, citizens can provide public managers with context-
specific information that might not otherwise be available, or notify them of unforeseen factors
and thus prevent costly errors. Moynihan (2003) asserts that citizens can provide ‘‘innovative
solutions to public problems that would have not emerged from traditional modes of decision
making”, and that citizen input can help managers improve public efficiency—either allocative
efficiency through better resource allocation choices or managerial efficiency through
information that leads to improvement of the process of public service provision. Neshkova and
Guo (2012) draw on data from state transportation agencies across the United States to show that
on average greater CE is strongly and significantly related to better performance of public
agencies, which can become more efficient and effective by seeking greater input from the
public and incorporating it in their decision making.

4.      From the perspective of citizens, Robbins and others (2008) note that opportunities to
engage directly in policy processes promote citizens’ active public spirit and moral character and
provide psychic rewards to citizens, including a sense of belonging to a community. It also helps
to protect citizens’ freedoms and provides them with a voice to challenge the existing power
structure. Nabatchi (2010) confirms the instrumental benefits for citizens including educative and

                                                                                                              68
empowerment effects through increased knowledge of the policy process and the development of
citizenship skills and dispositions, and instrumental benefits for communities through capacity
building within the community.

5.      Citizen engagement is an essential aspect of open and inclusive policy-making and is
shaped by both processes and outcomes. ‘Processes’ involve (a) the extent of interaction
between citizens and duty bearers (i.e., service providers and state institutions) and (b) the level
of citizen involvement in decision-making processes. ‘Outcomes’ require that such processes
motivate or compel state actors to address the feedback that citizens and their representatives
provide. Multiple iterations of sharing and incorporating such feedback would strengthen the
‘feedback loop’, and the responsiveness of state actors would help to improve policies and
development results.

6.      In order to strengthen the link between CE and better results, Fox (2007) and Joshi
(2013) have advocated the distinction between ‘soft’ accountability, which involves only
answerability, and ‘hard’ accountability, which combines answerability with sanctions
when citizens’ inputs and actions remain unheeded. Cognizant with this approach, Holland
and Thirkell (2009) and Tembo (2012) have suggested that citizen-led interventions should be
studied more closely, and linked more explicitly with desired development outcomes by using
results chains. The WBG strategy builds upon this need to strengthen the link between CE and
development outcomes, while taking into account the level of two-way citizen interaction and the
extent of citizen involvement in decision-making processes.

Box A2.1. Evolution of CE in development thought

The intellectual underpinnings of CE have evolved over several decades. Arnstein (1969) used the term
“participation” as the redistribution of power to “have-not” citizens excluded from political and economic processes.
Nie and others (1974) used a narrower definition by referring to “those legal activities by private citizens that are
more or less directly aimed at influencing the selection of governmental personnel and/or the actions they take”.
Subsequent efforts to define participation differed in the increasingly direct nature of collective action involved,
either to gain control over resources and regulatory bodies (Stiefel and Wolfe, 1994), or as a means of strengthening
the relevance, quality, and sustainability of projects and programs (Narayan, 1995).

Parallel shifts in other related streams of development thought during the 1990s also influenced the approach to
citizen participation. The emergence of the rights-based approach to development reframed participation as a
fundamental human and citizenship right, and a prerequisite for making other rights claims (Ferguson 1999).
Participatory development moved toward increasing poor and marginalized people’s influence over the wider
decision-making processes that affect their lives (Gaventa and Valderrama, 1999). And finally, the rise of the “good
governance” agenda and its concerns with decentralized governance and increasing the responsiveness of
governments to citizens’ voices (Goetz and Gaventa, 2001) naturally lent itself to increased social accountability.



                                    II. EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT OF CE

7.     Emerging evidence shows that CE can lead to improved intermediate and final
development results in suitable contexts, though its impact on broader development outcomes is
mixed. Citizen engagement initiatives have increased transparency 1 and citizen trust in
government (Cooper and others, 2006; Yang 2005), enhanced governmental legitimacy (Fung
2006), improved outcomes of macro-economic policies (Brinkerhoff and Goldsmith, 2003), and

    Open Budget Survey 2012. International Budget Partnership. www.openbudgetindex.org
                                                                                                                 69
raised the frequency and quality of governmental responsiveness (Yang and Holzer 2006). From
the perspective of development partners, Isham and others (2005) ﬁnd a clear positive
association between participation and project success by using evidence from rural water projects
across 49 countries to assess participation and project outcomes. Sara and Katz (1998) find that
greater participation is linked to more project sustainability, and Isham and Kähkönen (2000)
ﬁnd that CE leads to greater satisfaction with service design and also to superior health outcomes
(Winters, 2003).

8.      At the same time, CE literature is cognizant of instances where CE either had no
impact on development outcomes or led to adverse outcomes which were unintended. For
instance, Bräutigam (2004) concluded, based on a comparative study of five countries, that
participatory budgeting is neither necessary nor sufficient for making government spending more
pro-poor. Similarly, Shatkin (2000) found in his study of participatory planning of urban housing
in the Philippines that the influence of citizens on government decisions has not increased and
therefore the degree of government responsiveness has not changed. Lastly, Francis and James
(2003) found that decisions on resource allocation to villages in Uganda do not reflect villagers’
needs in spite of having been planned with them.

9.      This mixed state of evidence on broader development outcomes can in part be
attributed to its highly contextualized nature and the validity and sustainability of
intermediate changes that could induce improved policy, practice, behavior, and power
relations (Menocal and Sharma, 2008). However, it also demonstrates the need to strengthen
the evidence base in this area to address the following issues:

   •   Since CE is used to refer to a diverse set of initiatives and activities, there is lack of
       consistency in what is being measured.
   •   This area is highly contextualized, so it is hard to distinguish between endogenous and
       exogenous factors and to isolate the interaction of specific inputs and enabling
       conditions.
   •   Even specific CE initiatives lack a theory of change, which makes it more difficult to
       define successes and examine impact. In some instances they may lead to one-off
       outcomes; in other cases where such outcomes become institutionalized, there is a dearth
       of longitudinal research to assess whether such initiatives continued to work and what
       type of outcomes they achieved.
   •   Rather than sectors (e.g., education) or outcomes (e.g., pro-poor budgeting), the frame of
       reference is usually based on a tool-based approach (e.g., community scorecards).

   Box A2.2: Methods to Measure the Impact of CE

    • Randomized controlled trials. Properly conducted experimental designs, especially randomized
      controlled trials, are considered a good research method to consult when looking for clear quantitative
      measures of causal effects and in overcoming attribution problems faced by other evaluation methods.
      However, they can be narrowly focused and often do not address seriously the question of causality.
    • Qualitative case studies and case study analysis. There have been a number of qualitative case studies
      on transparency and accountability initiatives, using a range of ethnographic, historical, and
      observational techniques. However, case material can be more descriptive than analytical and requires
      the extraction of evidence on impact, rather than being impact-focused.
    • Participatory approaches. These have been used to a limited extent. In service delivery, for example,
                                                                                                                70
       community scorecard initiatives have lent themselves to participatory evaluations or assessments as a
       natural progression from participatory deliberation or dialogue between dissatisfied community users
       and service-provider representatives. While participatory evaluations are useful for highlighting impacts
       that are important for users, they are often criticized for bias in reporting successes.
    • Indices and rankings. These exist in various sectors. For instance, the International Budget
      Partnership’s Open Budget Survey assesses how far national governments offer public access and
      opportunities to participate in budget processes.

10.    The following sections present an overview of evidence for the CE impact on five
development outcome areas: (a) public service delivery, (b) public financial management, (c)
governance, (d) social inclusion and empowerment, and (e) natural resource management. These
areas have been selected based on an illustrative review of the literature on CE and social
accountability and stocktaking of nearly 420 World Bank projects for which improved
beneficiary feedback or CE features as project development objectives or as components of
various stages of the project cycle.

A. Service Delivery

11.     The framework proposed by the 2004 World Development Report: Making Services Work
for Poor People (World Bank 2003) defined a “long” and a “short” route to analyze
accountability relationships among policy makers, providers, and citizens. Citizens can adopt the
“long” route to influence policy makers who in turn influence service delivery through providers,
or the “short route,” through which they can—individually and collectively—directly influence,
participate in, and supervise service delivery by providers. There are multiple instances that
provide strong evidence for CE impact on service delivery in health, education, infrastructure,
water, and housing/urban development. In cases where it has had no impact, context and
operational modalities have been important to determine such outcomes. Citizen engagement in
this area can be particularly useful in countries (and sectors) where the government and the
private sector have been unable to provide essential services to citizens due to the misallocation
of resources and corruption, weak incentives or a lack of articulated demand (Malena and others,
2004).

   (a) Health
   • Cornwall and Shankland (2008) trace how Brazil’s universal health system has utilized
       innovative participatory practices to engage thousands of citizens to deliberate over
       health policy from the municipal level to the national level, and to track the
       implementation of these policies to improve both access and quality of healthcare.

   •    In Andhra Pradesh, India, Misra (2007) shows how community scorecards were used to
        highlight discrepancies in the self-evaluation of primary health-care service providers and
        their evaluation by the communities they served. Subsequent discussion of these different
        perceptions led to an action plan in which providers agreed to undergo training to
        improve their interactions with users, to change the health centers’ timings to better meet
        community needs, to institutionalize a better grievance redress system, and to display
        medicine stocks publicly.



                                                                                                                   71
•   In Gujarat, India, activation of social justice committees has mobilized the redistribution
    of government provided development services to meet the needs of dalit communities,
    including provision of water and electricity, land and housing, roads and infrastructures,
    and access to welfare services available for the poorest of the poor (Mohanty, 2010).

•   In Maharashtra, Murty and others (2007) document how a health and policy awareness
    campaign implemented in conjunction with the use of community scorecards led to
    increased clinic utilization rates and a decline in malnutrition in several villages over a
    period of just six months. Not only did client satisfaction improve, but several villages
    demanded that the scorecard process be repeated after three or six months, attesting to the
    value the local communities saw in the intervention.

•   In South Africa, new opportunities for participation in health facility boards led to
    changes in the overall health approach, “from being curative in nature to one that is
    primary and holistic, addressing the impacts of socioeconomic issues such as
    unemployment and poverty on the well-being of the community” (Williams, 2007).

•   Bjorkman-Nyqvist and Svensson (2009) found that when local NGOs in Uganda
    encouraged communities to engage with local health services, they were more likely to
    monitor providers. As a result, both the quality and quantity of health service provision
    improved as communities began to more extensively monitor the health providers. One
    year later there were perceptible improvements in the utilization of health services,
    significant weight-for-age z-score gains of infants, and markedly lower deaths among
    children.

•   In Zimbabwe, four wards with Health Centre Committees performed better than four
    without, including in level of health resources within clinics, service coverage, and
    community health indicators (Loewenson and Rusike, 2004). The association between
    Health Centre Committees and improved health outcomes was observed even in highly
    under-resourced communities and clinics (Molyneux and others, 2012).


In contrast
• In Benin, Keefer and Khemani (2011) trace how households exposed to radio
    programming on the benefits of using bed nets to avoid malaria ended up paying for these
    bed nets rather than holding local governments accountable for their distribution. These
    results show that in an environment with barriers to government responsiveness, greater
    access to mass media may not enable citizens to extract more benefits from government
    programs.

•   In Nigeria, interviewee comments suggested that community participation was enhanced
    through the Bamako Initiative, with committees being involved in health activities, the
    provision of equipment, and identifying those deserving exemption from fees
    (Uzochukwu and others, 2004). However, committee members complained of exclusion
    from the co-management of user fees and revolving funds, and from priority setting or
    decision making (Molyneux and others, 2012).


                                                                                            72
•   McNamara (2006) finds that the availability of publicly generated performance data
    through provider report cards in the USA health sector have not influenced citizens’
    decisions about which facilities to use even though better facilities may be available. In
    some cases, providers improved services in response to their performance on the
    indicators used in the report cards; in others, they improved their rankings by using
    strategies that improve scores but might undermine access and quality of healthcare. Key
    contextual factors that influence the effectiveness of such report cards include cultural
    characteristics (e.g., literacy rates, corruption indices, consumerism); health care market
    attributes (e.g., purchaser mix, provider supply); and information system capacity.

•   Abelson and Gauvin (2004) find that community-level advisory boards in Nova Scotia,
    Quebec and Saskatchewan, which have a legal mandate to provide citizen input into
    regional health system decision making, did not involve meaningful engagement and
    served better as platforms for ‘relationship-building’ (Abelson and Gauvin, 2004).

(b) Education
• In Bangladesh, parents with girls attending school mobilized to encourage other families
    in the community to send their children, particularly girls, to school. In addition to
    providing school fees and supplies to facilitate girls’ enrolment, parents also monitored
    teacher attendance to discourage absenteeism (Kabeer, 2005).

•   Duflo and Rya (2012) found that in India enhancing incentives for teachers combined
    with strong accountability mechanisms improved teacher attendance rates in schools.
    During a randomized control trial experiment, cameras were given to schools to take
    digitally dated pictures of teachers at the beginning and end of each day. Teachers were
    guaranteed a base pay with additional increments linked to attendance rates. Absence
    rates in participating schools dropped to 21 percent—compared with a little over 40
    percent at baseline and in comparison schools—and stayed constant even after 14 months
    of the program.

•   In Kenya, a randomized experiment found that compared to hiring teachers through the
    civil service or parent-teacher association committees, hiring teachers on short contracts
    and working with communities to monitor their performance had a significant positive
    impact on student achievements (Duflo and others, 2008).

•   Lassibille and others (2010) report on a random experiment in which different approaches
    were compared in schools in Madagascar. The findings showed that demand-led
    interventions led to significant improvements in teacher behavior and raised school
    attendance and test scores when compared with top-down interventions, which had
    minimal effects.

•   A field and laboratory experiment of community-monitoring interventions in schools in
    Uganda found that when community monitoring involved a participation component to
    help collective definition of problems and indicators, it had a substantial impact on pupil
    test scores as well as absenteeism rates of both teachers and pupils (Barr and others,
    2012).


                                                                                            73
•   A review by Jimenez and Sawada (1999) on outcomes for children who attended
    community-managed schools in El Salvador showed that community-managed schools
    had fewer absences than comparable schools that were centrally managed. They find that
    enhanced community and parental involvement in EDUCO schools has improved
    students’ language skills and diminished student absences, which may have long-term
    effects on achievement.

•   In Mexico, the Quality Schools Program which included parent associations in designing,
    implementing and monitoring educational improvement plans led to a decline in drop-out
    rates, failure rates, and repetition rates. Qualitative data suggested this was due to
    increased parent participation in the school and supervision of homework (Shapiro and
    Skoufias, 2006).

In contrast
• Banerjee and others (2010) conducted a randomized evaluation of three different
    interventions designed to promote community monitoring of public education services in
    Uttar Pradesh: providing information on existing institutions, training community
    members in a testing tool for children, and training volunteers to hold remedial reading
    camps. These interventions had no impact on community involvement, teacher effort, or
    learning outcomes inside the school. However, in the third intervention, youth
    volunteered to teach camps, and children who attended these camps substantially
    improved their reading skills.

•   In yet another example in Uttar Pradesh, village volunteers prepared report cards on the
    reading ability of children in 195 randomly selected villages, and a local NGO facilitated
    information-sharing sessions to share these findings with teachers, local government
    representatives, and residents in village-wide meetings. An evaluation found no
    difference in community participation, teacher effort, or learning outcomes in public
    schools between the villages where the meetings took place and 85 randomly selected
    “control” villages where no meetings were held. Reading scores did increase in 65
    villages (among the 195), but this was only where a local NGO held additional classes to
    improve reading skills outside the public school system (Khemani, 2008).

(c) Infrastructure
• Using data from Northern Pakistan, Khwaja (2004) finds that project maintenance
    improved substantially for infrastructure projects provided by the community in
    collaboration with the Agha Khan Rural Support Program, in comparison with similar
    projects provided by government line departments. At the same time he also cautions that
    maintenance for more technical infrastructure projects may be beyond the scope of the
    community.

•   Guided by the Uganda Debt Network (a civil society organization), community
    monitoring committees verified the quality of the building materials and the share of
    local taxes that were being utilized to identify and correct substandard construction of
    classrooms by contractors who were not abiding with construction requirements (De
    Renzio and others, 2006).


                                                                                           74
•   The Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Government, a civil society organization in the
    Philippines, has worked with local monitors in Abra province to verify that road and
    bridge construction projects are executed according to contract norms. Their activities
    have resulted in the reprimand of government officials charged with corruption, revised
    directives regarding the payment of road construction contractors, and a partnership with
    the National Commission on Audit to conduct participatory audits of road repair projects
    in Abra province (Ramkumar, 2008).

•   Over the course of two years, the multi-stakeholder group involved in the Construction
    Sector Transparency Initiative’s pilot in Ethiopia managed to persuade the government to
    change its legal requirements for disclosure of information in the construction sector
    (CoST, 2011).

In contrast
• Based on a randomized field experiment on reducing corruption in over 600 Indonesian
    village road projects, Olken (2010) shows how increasing government audits from 4
    percent of projects to 100 percent had a greater impact on curbing leaked expenditures by
    8 percentage points as compared to increasing grassroots participation in monitoring
    these projects. This case suggests that grassroots monitoring can be more effective in
    circumstances in which there is relatively little free-riding. For example, programs that
    provide private goods such as subsidized food, education, or medical care, where
    individual citizens have a personal stake in ensuring that the goods are delivered and that
    theft is minimized, may be appropriate candidates for grassroots monitoring. For public
    goods in which incentives to monitor are much weaker such as infrastructure projects
    studied here, the results suggest that using professional auditors may be much more
    effective.

•   Since 2006, the Civil Society Working Group for the Interoceanic Highway in Peru has
    raised concerns regarding major environmental impacts, an inadequate mitigation
    process, and a lack of transparency in funding ﬂows and decision-making. However,
    while they have succeeded in participating in the discourse on the construction of the
    highway, the impact of their involvement to date is unclear. Reasons for this include
    concerns regarding the group’s legitimacy since it includes more NGOs as compared to
    other stakeholders (such as local communities, local universities, or even the business
    sector), and the fact that it does not have grassroots support (Pieck, 2013).


(d) Water
• In post-war Angola, the formation of associational water committees led to improved
    water services in urban Luanda, and extension of civic engagement into other aspects of
    urban development, such as sanitation (Roque and Shankland, 2007).

•   In Hyderabad, Metro Water started a complaints hotline that enabled managers to hold
    front-line providers accountable by using this direct link with citizens. The findings of an
    evaluation of this intervention suggested that the performance of front-line workers
    improved, and corruption was considerably reduced (Caseley, 2003).


                                                                                             75
•   Lamers and others (2010) describe how, between 2005 and 2008, the
    Hoogheemraadschap De Stichtse Rijnlanden—a water board in the Netherlands—
    successfully developed a water management plan for the Kromme Rijn region in
    cooperation with other water authorities, user interest groups, and the wider public
    despite major conflicting interests and doubts of these stakeholders at the outset.

•   Narayan’s (1995) review of 121 rural water systems projects in 49 countries found that
    increasing beneficiary participation led to better project outcomes, including a higher
    proportion of water systems in good condition, overall economic benefits, a wider target
    population, and environmental benefits. Katz and others (1997) and Isham and Kähköhen
    (2000) attest that the performance of water systems across a variety of countries are
    markedly better in communities where households were able to make informed choices
    about the type of system and the level of service they required, and where decision
    making was genuinely democratic and inclusive.

•   Das Gupta and others (2004) compare the success of irrigation systems in South Korea
    and India. The Indian irrigation systems ended up being much less effective because the
    technocrats involved with operation and maintenance were not accountable to the farmers
    that they are supposed to serve; in South Korea, where participation resulted in a closer
    accountability relationship between the irrigation system administrators and the local
    farmers, service provision was superior (Winters, 2012).

In contrast
• The Molinos water project in Chile attempted to solicit feedback from community
    members about implementing a water treatment plant in the village but failed to integrate
    community inputs into decisions regarding the project and consult them regarding key
    project issues (Garande and Dagg, 2005).

•   In their study of the influence of water user associations in Nepal, Meinzen-Dick and
    Zwarteveen (1998) found that the all-male organization for the Chhattis Mauja system in
    Nepal faced difﬁculties in enforcing its rules on women. Female heads of farms in the
    head end of the system always took more water than their entitlements while contributing
    less labor than they should. In other parts of the system, village irrigation leaders also
    mentioned water stealing by women as a problem that was difﬁcult to solve because
    women were not included as members of the organization and could thus not be
    punished.

•   During the development of Morocco’s regional water master plan, the two river basin
    agencies involved the majority of stakeholders in the consultation process by establishing
    commissions, and publicized the master plan for discussion before submitting it for the
    approval of the National Council for Water and Climate. However, there was limited
    involvement of local associations, which represented all the groundwater users at the
    aquifer level, which decreased satisfaction with the consultation process (Wijnene and
    others, 2012).




                                                                                           76
(e) Housing/Urban Development
   • In South Africa, social mobilization led to the courts overturning certain restrictive water
      service practices in Johannesburg as unconstitutional, thus making water more accessible
      to poor people (Mehta, 2005b).

   •   The citizens of Vietnam’s Vinh City have been involved in improving designated housing
       areas and the city infrastructure from planning to construction and monitoring. In
       addition to supporting the approval of a detailed plan of wards and communes,
       communities have made investments to further the city’s urban development process
       (DELGO’SEA, 2011).

   In contrast
   • Also in South Africa, mobilization through the courts on issues of housing led to a major
       victory known as Grootboom judgment, which upheld the right to housing, water, and
       sanitation for homeless people. While the combination of a social movement with action
       in the courts was an important development, implementation of the judgment has been
       inadequate in many ways (Williams, 2005).

   •   In Venezuela, the World Bank’s Caracas Slum Upgrading Project outlined an enabling
       framework that would allow slum-dweller communities to effectively express their
       demands and participate in the relevant decision-making processes from the onset of the
       project. Nonetheless, over time the implementation of this framework suffered due to a
       resurgence of centralization in the country and the lack of independent social
       intermediaries who could work with communities (World Bank, 2004a).

12.     There are several contextual factors that are involved in shaping the outcomes of CE
interventions on service delivery. Lynch and others (2013) find that access to resources including
education and training and enhanced access to information are necessary for people to hold
service providers and policymakers to account. Thomas and Amadei (2010) focus on the
sustainability of citizen-led interventions and emphasize the role of cultural context, strong
leadership in a defined community, and direct compensation/benefits to ensure motivation for
continued use of processes and systems established during such interventions.

13.     Commins (2007) confirms that asymmetries of information across different sectors, and
depending on the nature of the service, even within the same sector, can determine the level of
difficulty of the monitoring of service outputs by citizens. For example, the nature of clinical
health services like the treatment of complex illness is different from a basic health service such
as encouraging the use of bed nets and hand washing; and community groups and local
governments especially can play a strong role in making sure these practices are being more
widely adopted. In contrast, clinical services are far more complex. Commins also refers to the
differing characteristics of each service that lead to different conditioning factors and
relationships between government and citizens such as technical-economic characteristics (e.g.,
monopoly, networked services), different levels of political salience, different balances of power
between principals (clients, citizens and policymakers) and agents (e.g., professions, unions), and
ideologies or values attached to specific areas of public life in particular cultures (water,
sanitation, education and healthcare).


                                                                                                77
14.     Commins (2007) also highlights the relevance of overarching institutional factors (e.g.,
political system, legal frameworks), which while relevant to all sectors, may have varying effects
due to the nature of the service systems. More specific local contextual issues (e.g., systems of
land tenure and land ownership, ethnic and caste relations) that directly relate to the structuring
and process by which community participation occurs are also relevant. Hossain (2009)
recommends that it is worthwhile to learn from informal means that poorer citizens may be using
to gain access to services.

15.     For the education sector, Westhrop and others (2012) outline contextual factors that have
implications for how citizen-led interventions can affect education outcomes. In addition to
adequate funding, an equitable national education policy, and bureaucratic culture, the role of
civil society institutions and local power relations that accommodate adequate participation of
diverse groups also has an impact on education outcomes. The nature of CE interventions (e.g.,
extent of capacity building, responsiveness to local priorities) and the nature and scale of
participation by parents, students, marginalized groups and local leaders is also relevant.

16.      For the health sector, Shayo and others (2012) indicate a substantial influence of gender,
wealth, ethnicity and education on health care decision-making processes and greater influence
of men, wealthy individuals, members of strong ethnic groups, and highly educated individuals.
Khan and van den Heuvel (2007) document how semi-authoritarian political structures have
limited broad participation in health policy-making, and how changes in governments have
disrupted health planning and implementation. An evaluation of participation in Malawi’s health
sector notes impediments to CE such as perceptions of ineffective responses by service providers
or the expectations of community members that their complaints will be met with retribution by
the health personnel on whom they depend (except in urban areas); insufficient distribution of
information on the availability of formal accountability channels and how to use them; and lack
of choice of health providers due to distance and the monetary and opportunity cost of travel.
Institutional capacity and incentives of health management structures and oversight committees,
which limit the internal mechanisms for monitoring of activities by citizens and implementation
of sanctions against poor performance, are also pertinent factors (NORAD, 2013).


B. Public Financial Management

17.     The literature consulted here shows that CE in public financial management processes
has produced strong intermediate and final results such as citizen mobilization, more inclusive
budget processes, and pro-poor fiscal policies. The majority of evidence in this area is based on
qualitative case studies and case study analysis, though there have been attempts to generate
empirical evidence and substantiate links between increased budget transparency and improved
governance (Islam, 2003); positive development outcomes (Fukuda-Parr and others, 2011);
improved socio-economic and human development indicators (Bellver and Kaufmann, 2005);
fiscal balances of national governments (Benito and Bastida, 2009); reduction in public debt and
deficits (Alt and Lassen, 2006); risk premia for financial markets (Bernoth and Wolff, 2008); and
higher credit ratings and lower spreads between borrowing and lending rates (Hameed 2011).
Torgler and Schneider (2009) find that citizens are more willing to pay taxes when they perceive
that their preferences are properly taken into account by public institutions. Frey and others
(2004) and Torgler (2005) suggest causal linkages between citizen participation processes and


                                                                                                78
levels of tax compliance, particularly when it comes to direct citizen participation in budgetary
decisions.

18.    There are several examples of how CE has led to improved budgetary outcomes at the
formulation, approval, execution, and oversight stages of the budget cycle as well as
procurement activities.

   •   Formulation. Among other examples, Wehner (2004) draws attention to how the South
       African Women’s Budget Initiative was set up in 1995 by the parliamentary Standing
       Committee on Finance and two civil society organizations. This partnership arrangement
       enabled parliamentarians to draw on civil society’s research skills to carry out gender
       analyses of 26 votes of the national budget, while the CSOs benefited from direct access
       to policymakers.

   •   Approval. By drawing on case study research on reproductive health in Mexico, child
       support grants in South Africa, and tribal development expenditure in India, Robinson
       (2006) describes how analysis carried out by independent budget groups has led to
       positive improvements in budget policies in the form of increased allocations for social
       welfare expenditure priorities.

   •   Execution. Reinikka and Svensson’s (2005) examination of education expenditures in
       Uganda using Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) showed that on average only
       13 percent of the expenditure meant for schools actually reached them. When this
       information was made public through an experimental information campaign, the transfer
       of funds to these schools increased by 90 percent.

   •   Audit. Cornejo and others (2013a) and the World Bank (2013a) highlight a number of
       examples where supreme audit institutions in Argentina, Costa Rica, Honduras, and
       South Korea have collaborated with citizens to plan and conduct audits successfully.
       Furthermore, in their case study to measure the impact of social audits in Andhra Pradesh
       on the implementation of the flagship National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme,
       Singh and Vutukuru (2010) examined the effectiveness of social audits to enhance
       accountability. They concluded that there was a statistically significant improvement in
       the overall uptake of the social audit program in Andhra Pradesh, and that the detection
       of corrupt practices during the implementation of the program led to the recovery of a
       total amount of Rs 20 million of program funds.

   •   Participatory budgeting. Available evidence suggests that participatory budgeting leads
       to significant shifts in priorities and policies and toward expenditures that directly benefit
       poor sections of society (Avritzer, 1999, Navarro, 2001, Blore and others, 2004). In a
       similar vein, quantitative analysis by Melo and Baiocchi (2006) finds that participatory
       budgeting is strongly associated with a reduction in extreme poverty and increased access
       to basic services. More recently, a World Bank report demonstrated that participatory
       budgeting is positively and strongly related to improvements in poverty rates and water
       services (World Bank, 2008). These findings are supported by Gonçalves (2014) and
       Touchton and Wampler (2013) who associate participatory budgeting with increased
       expenditure on health services and significant reduction in infant mortality rates across
       municipalities and cities in Brazil; as well as Díaz-Cayeros, and others (2013) who
                                                                                                  79
       confirm similar findings for participatory budgeting in the municipalities of Oaxaca,
       Mexico which gained increased access to electricity, sewerage, and education.

   •   Procurement. Ramkumar (2008), the World Bank (2013a) and Transparency
       International have documented how citizen oversight of procurement activities has led to
       less corruption, better service delivery, and more savings in contexts as diverse as the
       Philippines, Pakistan, Germany, and Colombia.

   In contrast
   • A study of participatory budgeting in China concludes that even though participatory
       budgeting experiments have promoted a degree of transparency and fairness in the
       interaction between government and citizens, the fundamentals of budget processes have
       remained the same, and in most cases the budget is still considered to be a state budget
       rather than a public budget (He, 2011).

   •   Boampong (2012) notes how the efforts of civil society organizations to improve the
       overall governance of mining revenues in Ghana’s Asutifi district failed due to the
       unwillingness of hierarchical authorities to be more accountable about their use of mining
       royalties and difficulties in supporting the creation of functional and multi-stakeholder
       consultative platforms among other issues.

   •   In Ireland, the National Economic and Social Council was composed of civil society
       partners and trade unions as well as government representatives and producers’
       associations. The fact that the Council’s efforts to negotiate changes in tax policy and
       expenditures did not lead to pro poor outcomes illustrated how, in addition to the
       participatory nature of the process, it is also important to address who is involved and
       whether the institutional framework in question promotes pro-poor participation
       (Bräutigam, 2004).

   •   In their case study of two Kansas cities in the United States that used a variety of input
       mechanisms in the budget process, Ebdon and Franklin (2006) find that citizen input had
       limited impact on budget decisions, and that neither city institutionalized participation in
       the budget process. The authors attributed these outcomes to the timing of the input,
       unstated or unclear goals, implementation difﬁculties, and political and environmental
       constraints.

19.      In terms of context, Ebdon and Franklin (2006) deem environment, process design, and
mechanisms as being critical to structuring citizen participation in the public budget process.
The environment refers to the structure and form of government, political dynamics and culture,
legal requirements, and population size and heterogeneity. For instance, cities with a council-
manager form of government may be more likely to encourage citizen participation, and
facilitate public participation in policy-making through methods that are not speciﬁcally related
to the budget such as citizen surveys and strategic planning. Process design includes timing, type
of budget allocation, participants, and gathering sincere preferences when designing the budget
participation process. For example, timing is important because input that is received late in the
process is less likely to have an eﬀect on outcomes. Although participation is deemed to be more
beneﬁcial when it involves mechanisms that promote two-way communication, Ebdon alludes to
results of surveys and multicity interviews that show relatively little use of two-way input
                                                                                                80
mechanisms in the budget process. LaFrance and Balogun (2012) refer to the number of
opportunities citizens are given to voice their budget preferences; whether the nature of
government efforts to solicit citizen input is passive or proactive; and the relationship between
citizen attendance of prior budget hearings and the outcomes of those hearings.

20.      For participatory budgeting, Zhang and Liao (2011a; 2011b) note that relevant contextual
factors to engage communities in such initiatives include municipal officials’ attitudes and
perceptions of general public involvement in the budget process, diversity of stakeholders, and
healthy politics that is more likely to embrace a two-way dialogue. Franklin and Ebdon (2013)
attest to the importance of legal guarantees, including citizen participation, municipal autonomy,
and access to budget documents; active civil society organizations capable of mobilizing
participation in budget processes; and a commitment to shared decision making. Shah (2007)
confirms the relevance of these factors as well as the capacity for participation both inside and
outside government and the existence of functional and free media institutions.

C. Governance

21.     Evidence that substantiates the positive impact of CE on corruption and improved
governance is still limited and uneven, partly because this area is so broad. Yet there are a
number of relevant interventions that attest to intermediate governance changes such as changes
in policy, regulation and reform, improved transparency, more active community-level
participation, and improved responsiveness to citizen demands.

   •   Using data from a specifically designed lab experiment, Serra (2008) suggests that
       “combined” accountability systems involving both bottom-up monitoring and top-down
       auditing are highly effective in curbing corruption in contrast to using purely top-down
       auditing.

   •   An in-depth empirical case study conducted by the World Bank and the IMF in Bolivia in
       2002 sought to identify the relative importance of the various determinants of governance
       at the micro-level. Voice-related variables were found to be a significant determinant of
       governance, corruption, and quality of public services, accounting for a much larger share
       of the variation than more traditional public sector management type of variables
       (Kaufmann and others, 2002).

   •   A public expenditure tracking survey (PETS) exercise conducted in Sierra Leone in 2002
       by the Ministry of Finance and repeated in 2005 by an independent civil society
       organization revealed that due to independent auditing of disbursements following the
       findings of the first study there was significant improvement in the delivery of fee
       subsidies and teaching materials at 28 randomly selected schools. (Transparency
       International, 2005).

   •   Banjeree and others (2009) assigned civil society organizations in Uttar Pradesh and
       Delhi, India, to conduct campaigns designed to reduce caste-based voting, persuade
       citizens to vote against corrupt politicians, and mobilize women to vote. In rural Uttar
       Pradesh, voter turnout increased. Further, survey data collected to track voting patterns
       showed that the likelihood that an individual would vote for the party that represented
       their caste decreased from 57 percent to 52 percent in villages which received this
                                                                                               81
    campaign. There was also a reduction in the vote share of candidates facing heinous
    criminal charges. In Delhi, voting patterns made it clear that the poor have distinct
    preferences for representatives who focus on issues that are important for them.

•   In Madagascar, a study regarding the role of media and monitoring in reducing capture of
    public expenditures by local officials finds that such types of elite capture could be
    constrained through a combination of media programs and intensive monitoring
    (Francken, 2009).

•   In Brazil, Ferraz and Finan (2008) find that publicized municipal audits reduced re-
    election among incumbent mayors found to be more corrupt than initially believed. Cities
    with local media were even less likely to vote for these corrupt mayors.

•   In Indonesia, when decentralization led to the capture of public resources by regional
    elites through budget misappropriations, a group of lawyers formed a civil society
    organization in the province of Padang, mobilized and, with the help of the provincial
    prosecutor’s office, secured the conviction and sentencing of a large number (43) of
    members of the Padang province legislature (Davidson, 2007).

•   A World Bank (2013a) stocktaking of social accountability mechanisms describes how,
    beyond detection/prosecution of corruption cases, citizen-led initiatives had an impact on
    mobilizing public opinion against corruption, increasing transparency of procurement
    processes and development projects, and influencing laws and policies.

In contrast
• Peruzzotti (2006) documents how members of the executive branch in Argentina bribed
    senators to support a piece of labor legislation. This incident led to a media scandal after
    a senator leaked information to a major newspaper about the bribes. Civil society
    organizations became involved and sought to trigger several different mechanisms of
    horizontal accountability. Despite hearings in the courts, three agencies from the
    executive branch, and a number of legislative commissions and committees, the incident
    did not lead to a single conviction.

•   In India, Rajasthan, an experiment to enhance police performance, improve public trust,
    and gather objective data on crime rates and performances involved researchers testing
    the impact of improving police training, freezing administrative transfers, introducing a
    weekly day off and duty rotation system, and community-based monitoring. Training and
    the freezing of transfers were found to be the most effective interventions in terms of
    higher job satisfaction and victims’ perceptions of police investigations; community
    monitoring had little to no effect on the public perception of police performance since it
    was not implemented in a sustained manner (Banerjee and others, 2010).

•   In another example from India, a civil society organization was selected by the
    government to monitor the attendance of assistant nurse midwives using time- and date-
    stamping machines and random unannounced visits. In addition, a district health officer
    altered the wage structure so that a large part of nurses’ wages was based on attendance
    bonuses. Initially the increased monitoring and incentives decreased absenteeism.

                                                                                             82
       However, this impact was mitigated over time as nurses got around the new regulations
       by getting absence approval from nurse managers and using more exempt days (Banerjee
       and others, 2008).

   •   In Liberia, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Tracking Network, a coalition of eight
       Liberian civil society organizations, monitored the implementation of the National
       Development Plan. The researchers and communities found that, despite the recent
       passage of the Freedom of Information Act, project beneficiaries could not access
       sufficient information about development initiatives that affect their communities or
       counties. In Lofa and Bong Counties, for example, participants responded that they
       cannot hold responsible bodies, including government and contractors, accountable
       because affected communities are often left out of the decision-making process
       (Schouten, 2011).

22.     There is a wide range of contextual factors that have an impact on citizen-led initiatives
for anti-corruption reform. Francken (2009) describes that an active and well-targeted media can
serve as a relevant factor to hold public officials accountable for corruption. However, examples
of less rigorous and less widespread information dissemination in India (Banerjee and others
2009) and Indonesia (Olken, 2007) found unsuccessful in reducing the election of corrupt
officials. Here Lindstedt and Naurin’s (2005) findings that the effect of press freedom on
corruption is dependent on the level of education prove that in addition to access to information,
an ability to process the information is necessary. Furthermore, Brunetti and Weder (2003) find
that the form of corruption determines citizens’ incentives to act on corruption-related
information. In cases where corruption is collusive private agents have no incentive to report
corruption, but when it is extortive effective channels of information (e.g., independent and
active media) can be useful to lower the costs of complaint for private agents.

23.      Grimes (2008) uses case study evidence to highlight the importance of effective
institutions, political will, and international organizations that can influence national
governments and viable political competition. She also notes that attributes of civil society
organizations and networks such as preexistence of community and regional associations,
precedence for collaboration, and the nature of such organizations (professional vis-à-vis grass-
roots) have a bearing on the effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts. Grießhaber and Geys (2012)
find empirical evidence, which associates perceived corruption in a country, is shown to be
significantly associated with a society’s degree of civic engagement in formal social networks.

24.     Several scholars have identified the potential of decentralization to reduce corruption. For
instance, Estache and Sinha (1995) report a positive association between expenditure
decentralization and levels of infrastructure provided by local governments, but only when both
revenue generation and expenditure responsibilities are decentralized. Fisman and Gatti (2002)
find a negative association between expenditure decentralization and perceived corruption using
cross-country data from 1980-95. Asthana (2008) points out that an increase in community
participation combined with effective decentralization may have greater success in reducing
corruption and improving public services as there is greater transparency and the community can
hold local elites more accountable.

25.     At the same time, the literature also underscores the risks of decentralization—overall,
the evidence indicates that corruption tends to be higher in communities that have low education
                                                                                                 83
levels, low exposure to media, and are more remote from the center. Asthana (2008) cautions
that anti-corruption efforts are unlikely to be successful when decentralization is introduced
abruptly into communities that do not have the capacity to direct the allocation of funds,
maintain regulations, and lead projects. Porter and Onyach-Olaa (2001), Crook and Sverrisson
(2002) and Devas and Grant (2003) draw attention to factors that are consequential for
decentralization to result in reduced corruption, which include local history, politics, tradition
and skills/capacity, central monitoring of performance, and the length of time that reforms have
been in place.

D. Natural Resource Management

26.      Based mainly on studies of transparency and accountability initiatives and community-
based natural resource management systems, the literature in this area upholds (with exceptions)
the influence of CE on process-driven outcomes such as increasing participation of civil society
organizations, promoting disclosure of contracts, and/or demanding increased revenue
transparency. Although community-based natural resource management has been recognized as
an effective governance approach for sustainably managing commons or common-pool resources
(Gruber, 2011), the literature is less clear regarding how citizen-centered initiatives have led to
institutionalized changes in policy outcomes or influenced corruption and poverty in resource-
rich countries.

27.     The fact that natural resource management is a cross-cutting theme—from non-renewable
resources, including oil, gas, minerals and metals, to renewable resources such as forests,
fisheries, and land—and that there are important variations in the challenges presented by these
sectors also makes it more difficult to assess impact.

   •   Mainhardt-Gibbs (2010) found that in a CSO survey, the EITI process was felt to have
       resulted in enhanced CSO engagement in the extractives industries sector. This especially
       relates to increased availability of information and government recognition of civil
       society as part of the policy-making process.

   •   Rainbow Insight (2009) finds that the EITI is making a number of direct and indirect
       contributions to good governance with respect to natural resource revenues. This is
       through establishing an emerging standard to report natural resource revenues; providing
       a model of multi-stakeholder dialogue on a critical public policy issues; and forging an
       international network composed of civil servants, corporate executives, and
       representatives of global civil society who share a commitment to revenue transparency.

   •   Aaronson (2011) concludes that EITI has had important spillover effects in terms of
       encouraging firms to listen to and respond to stakeholder concerns, and in building civil
       society capacity to engage in governance. Governments in some cases have used the EITI
       process to develop dialogue between policymakers and citizens on resources utilization.
       Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sao Tome, for example, have organized public forums and
       seminars to encourage citizens to participate in discussions and debates about extractive
       issues and governance. Civil society activists have also relied on the EITI process to push
       for government to sign on to EITI, as occurred successfully in Sierra Leone.


                                                                                                84
   •   Edmonds (2002) uses data from Nepal to determine the impact on the level of extraction
       of wood for fuel of a government-initiated program that transferred management of
       forests to local user groups. The evidence suggests that there was a signiﬁcant reduction
       in wood extraction in areas with forest user groups. In their study to assess the impact of
       local forest councils (van panchayats) on forest degradation in the Indian state of
       Uttaranchal, Somanathan and others (2005) found that community management was far
       more cost effective than state management.

   •   In east Cameroon, four villages formed a community forest association to oversee the
       Ngola-Achip Forest and to involve village inhabitants in the sustainable management of
       their forest to help poverty alleviation. Within the first five years, the forest association
       had made a profit that was used by the community development fund to build new
       houses; provide school fees and emergency medical care; and invest in a generator,
       satellite dish, and two television sets for the village (Kenneth, 2006).

   •   In Bangladesh, the efforts of Samata (a national CSO) to support landless poor to work
       for rights to land culminated in its substantial contributions to the Land Rights Program.
       Among other provisions, these included the recovery and redistribution of approximately
       93,000 acres of land and water resources among 1.9 million landless families, the election
       of 458 landless men and women group members to local government, and the amendment
       of government legislation related to land—Transfer of Property Act, Registration Act,
       and Specific Relief Act (Hinds, 2013).

   •   In India, research shows that in the early stages of the watershed management programs
       that were launched in the 1970s, financial leakages were of the order of 30-45 percent of
       approved amounts, with overestimation of costs by at least 15-25 percent. The
       government managed to reduce financial leakages to 20-35 percent of approved amounts
       by measures aimed at involving citizens in project implementation, devolving funds to a
       village body, and issuing new financial guidelines. This was largely achieved because
       beneficiaries became more aware of how much money was received and for what
       purpose (Chêne, 2009).

   •   In Kompong Thom, Cambodia, the community and the provincial Department of
       Fisheries have made fishing maps available to citizens showing lot boundaries and public
       access areas. The community undertakes patrols to enforce the regulations and has also
       argued for the right to arrest and fine wrongdoers, citing delays in the responses of
       authorities (Fisheries Action Coalition Team).

In contrast:
    • In an assessment of the impact of EITI, Ölcer (2009) finds that governments’ public
       endorsement of the EITI principles does not, on average, improve the corruption
       perception levels of the country; control of corruption in EITI countries is worse than in
       non-EITI resource-rich countries; and in both EITI and non-EITI countries World Bank
       Worldwide Governance Indicators scores have on average deteriorated between 2002 and
       2007 (Ölcer, 2009).



                                                                                                 85
   •   Suich (2013) refers to the evaluations of two community-based natural resource
       management interventions in Tchuma Tchato Project in Mozambique, and the Kwandu
       Conservancy in Namibia that found little or no impact in terms of reducing poverty. She
       notes that the lack of incentives or inability to deliver appropriate benefits that have a
       sufficient impact at the household level makes it difficult to maintain participation in
       such initiatives.

   •   Smith and others (2012) document how the lack of participatory mechanisms in
       Madagascar’s EITI processes has resulted in little participation of civil society and local
       populations in deliberation and decision-making and led to few projects with mutual
       beneﬁts. This poorly managed and exclusive process also has local communities that
       protest directly against mining companies rather than sharing their concerns through
       formal forums.

   •   The Oficina General de Gestion Social (General Social Management Bureau) created by
       the Government of Peru sought to address increasing public discontent with extractive
       activities by revising regulations to promote public participation in the hydrocarbon and
       mining sectors and by making it mandatory for developers to ensure public involvement
       in the Environmental Impact Assessment approval process. However, this resulted in a
       one-way information channel in which communities were duly informed of planned
       activities, but which provided no provisions for dialogue and consensus building
       (Barrera-Hernández, 2009).

   •   In Sierra Leone, Chiefdom Development Committees were created to ensure that project
       decision-making regarding the Diamond Area Community Development Fund was
       carried out in a more equitable and accountable manner. Even though each Chiefdom
       Development Committee was supposed to be composed of a wide, cross-section of
       elected Chiefdom residents so that a broad range of community interests could be
       represented, they have instead reportedly been composed entirely of rural elites such as
       section chiefs. This has undermined the concept of local ownership of the fund and
       further alienated many stakeholders such as women and youth. In addition, no reporting
       or oversight mechanisms have been established (Maconachie, 2011).

   •   Songorwa (1999) describes the ineffectual efforts of the Selous Conservation Program in
       Tanzania attempted to recruit communities to conserve wildlife on their lands. Since
       community interest in this program was incumbent on expectations of socioeconomic
       benefits, it waned quickly when such benefits did not materialize.

   •   In both Brazil and Indonesia, government efforts to implement decentralized coastal
       management has empowered local and regional authorities but has not resulted in the
       active participation and empowerment of communities. This is due in part to an
       inadequate framework to include them in institutional design and implementation
       (Wever, and others, 2012).

28.     In terms of relevant contextual factors, Claridge (2004) emphasizes the importance of
social capital in the forestry and water sectors that can improve the outcomes for natural resource
management through CE by decreasing costs of collective action; and increasing cooperation and
knowledge and information flows, more investment in common lands and water systems, and
                                                                                                 86
improved monitoring and enforcement. Pretty and Ward (2001) also support the notion that
where social capital is well-developed, local groups with locally developed rules and sanctions
are able to make more of existing resources than individuals working alone or in competition.
However, Koontz (2005) cautions that local contextual factors, rather than internal group
characteristics may be more relevant for policy changes in this area. Among such factors,
Mansuri and Rao (2013) identify the level of inequality within communities, prospects for
community members to benefit from natural resources, clear mechanisms for downward
accountability, and adequate local management capacity.

29.     Nelson and Agrawal (2008) find that stronger public institutions, notably lower levels of
corruption, and lower resource value that state actors could capture emerged as conducive factors
for central managers to devolve authority over wildlife to local communities. In the mining
sector, studies show that reforms succeed when interventions understand the needs of mining
communities and ways of involving them in research and policy development (Hilson 2006). In
the oil sector, Klassen and Feldpausch-Parker (2011) highlight the role of competent and
experienced interlocuters who can secure opportunities for community members to be heard,
enabling an otherwise neglected public to help set the local agenda while engaging with powerful
external stakeholders. Isham and Kähkjönen (2002) attribute poor project quality and
maintenance of infrastructure in the water sector to limited community capacity in understanding
the technical aspects of such projects, and Leino (2007) maintains that water projects are better
maintained when water management committees have access to funds for regular maintenance.

Schwarte (2008) on the other hand focuses more on supply-side challenges such as the culture of
secrecy within government bodies and the politics of patronage. This approach is also adopted by
Ribot and others (2010) who provide a comparison of the role of forest oversight committees in
Tanzania and Senegal and note the former case was successful because there was clear support
from higher levels of governments and mechanisms to sanction the grasp of local leaders. Baird
(2006) emphasizes the impact of donor and government reporting requirements and incentives on
the quality of local management, and cautions how they may have misguided effects despite
good intentions. It appears however that more often than not, increased public revenues for local
investment, which can be attributed to more effective management of common-pool resources,
serve as the biggest incentive (Ribot and others, 2010).


E. Social Inclusion and Empowerment

30.     Evidence regarding the impact of CE in this area is mixed. The literature acknowledges
the positive economic impact of conditional cash transfer (CCT) and community-driven
development (CDD) programs/projects subject to caveats, though their influence on promoting
inclusiveness and social cohesion is disputed. For instance, Menocal and Sharma (2008) find that
when voice and accountability interventions are targeted directly to women and marginalized
groups, there is some impact on empowerment. On the other hand, Mansuri and Rao (2013)
maintain that CDD efforts have had a limited impact on income poverty, cohesion, and
inclusiveness; and that the transfer of funds to communities without state oversight can result in
capture of decision-making by elites. For ease of analysis, this category has been divided into (a)
economic empowerment and (b) social empowerment.



                                                                                                87
    (a) Economic empowerment

•   Rawlings and Rubio (2005) reviewed results of CCT programs launched in Colombia,
    Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Turkey. They found “clear evidence of
    success from the first generation of programs in Colombia, Mexico, and Nicaragua in
    increasing enrollment rates, improving preventive health care, and raising household
    consumption”. Ferreira and Robalino (2010), Glewwe and Kassouf (2012) and Souza
    (2006) also provide evidence that CCT programs have improved enrolment rates and
    timeliness of school enrollment. However, these studies present more mixed evidence for
    CCT impact on repetition rates of school enrollment.

•   Based on analysis of the impact evaluation results of World Bank CDD programs over 25
    years, Wong (2012) found generally positive evidence for poverty welfare reduction,
    poverty targeting, and increased access to service. Evidence is limited and mixed on
    governance, social capital, and conflict resolution.

•   Through a randomized evaluation of a CDD program that delivered village-level
    technical assistance and block grants in Sierra Leone, Casey and others (2011) found
    positive impacts on the establishment of local development committees, local public
    goods provision, interactions between communities and local government officials,
    household economic welfare, and village-level market activity. However, the program
    had no impact on community social norms, the role of women and youths in local affairs,
    more egalitarian decision-making, or the capacity for collective action beyond the
    immediate sphere of the project.

•   In Bangladesh, Mahmud (2007) investigated two models of community management
    committees in the health sector: (i) Community Groups, set-up by elected local
    government body of the Union Parishad; and (ii) Health Watch Committees established
    with the assistance of advocacy CSOs. It was found that although both models were weak
    on exacting accountability, Health Watch Committees performed relatively better. In the
    villages with Health Watch Committees, awareness of health issues, available services,
    and the number of people accessing the services increased; and doctor punctuality and
    attendance improved in some clinics.

•   Blattman and others (2011, 2013) indicate that at the end of the second year of the Youth
    Opportunities Program in Uganda there was a gap of 157 percent between the
    intervention group and the control group in terms of income. Given their actual increase
    in income, the intervention group reported a 14 percent increase in perceived economic
    well being compared to peers. However, these perceived economic gains were significant
    only for men.

•   The fact that financial insecurity led a high percentage of orphaned children to drop out
    from school made the use of child savings accounts highly relevant to the SEED project
    intervention. SEED (Save for Education, Entrepreneurship and Down payment)
    encouraged families and caregivers to save for the young person’s education or business
    start-up costs, and they in turn received matching funds up to the equivalent of $20 a
    month. Findings from the SEED project suggest that a simple economic empowerment

                                                                                          88
       scheme eased the immediate financial burden on families and caregivers, kept young
       people in school and could potentially lift them out of poverty (Ismayilova and others,
       2012).

   In contrast
   • While Voss (2008) finds that the Kecamatan Development Program in Indonesia had a
       positive influence on household welfare and access to services, the redistributive effects
       of this intervention are mixed to negative. Traditionally disadvantaged groups, including
       female-head households and households with heads lacking primary education, did not
       see the same beneﬁts for measures of economic welfare.

   •   Hargreaves and others (2010) used a randomized, customized trial to assess the impact of
       the Intervention with Microfinance for AIDS and Gender Equity (IMAGE) program in
       South Africa. Their findings suggest that while the program had a strong capacity-
       building component, its impact in terms of economic capacity was unconvincing. The
       drop-out rate from the IMAGE cohort, although low at the beginning, was high: during
       the first 18 months of the trial, records of the pertinent microfinance organization showed
       that the drop-out rate was 11.1 percent, lower than its overall average (16.2 percent),
       although later the rate approached this average. Cumulatively, 134 out of 428 clients
       (31.3 percent) surveyed at 2-year follow-up were no longer members of the microfinance
       organization.

   •   Based on their review of more than 60 impact evaluations of CCT programs, the
       Independent Evaluation Group (2011) found that these evaluations mainly measured
       short-term achievements and found that while immediate goals (e.g., improving school
       enrollment or attendance) were achieved, there was no monitoring of long-term impacts
       such as learning outcomes.

   •   Bouillon and Tejerina’s (2007) review of evaluations of CCT programs in Brazil, Chile,
       Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, and Nicaragua reveals
       mixed evidence on the impact of these interventions. For nutrition, the evidence is
       positive in Mexico and Nicaragua, mixed in Brazil and Colombia, and ineffectual in
       Honduras. The impact on health indicators is more diverse across countries and clear,
       positive impacts on health indicators have been found only in Mexico.

(b) Social empowerment

   •   Blattman and Martinez (2011) examined the impact of the Youth Opportunities Program
       cash transfers on young underemployed people in Uganda. The diversity of skills and
       abilities in the group served as a strength to support the empowerment of the young
       people as a group, with stronger and more able members serving as role models and
       supporting weaker members. The intervention was shown to be effective in building
       social capital for youth.

   •   Friis-Hansen and Duveskog’s (2012) evaluation of the Farmer Field School (FFS)
       intervention in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda confirmed that FFS group-based learning
       could lead to empowerment and act as a pathway toward increased well-being. The fact

                                                                                               89
    that the data from the three countries all pointed toward the same trend, despite
    contextual differences in the countries studied, strengthened this finding.

•   In the study by Ismayilova and others (2012) on the SEED project, AIDS orphans were
    enabled by the child savings accounts to continue with education or training, and as such
    were given the opportunity to access the benefits of remaining within a supportive and
    caring community environment. Reports from teachers and community leaders suggested
    that this had a positive effect on their sense of self and their involvement in school and
    community life, and contributed to a reduction in risk-taking behaviors.

•   In Nigeria, the use of forum theatre provided a unique opportunity for villagers to express
    in the public sphere their grievances about divisions arising from traditional community
    hierarchies and wealth inequality (Abah and Okwori 2005).

•   In South Africa, participation in the Treatment Action Campaign became a way to
    challenge the stigma of HIV/AIDS and for members to gain a new sense of their own
    dignity and self-worth (Friedman 2010). Robins (2005) describes the importance of
    “experiential dimensions of belonging” for group members, many of whom are “often
    exposed to stigma and rejection from their families and communities”.

•   Kroecker’s (1995) case study of a state-sponsored agricultural cooperative community in
    Nicaragua and Aslop and others’s (2001) cross-sectional comparative study of the impact
    of collective community management of three natural resources projects in India reported
    that participants felt more empowered to report their views and concerns. Participants in
    these studies also reported that they felt that their opinions and views were important in
    shaping the direction and outputs of the individual programs.

•   Changing attitudes to domestic violence and making it much less acceptable behavior, the
    IMAGE program in South Africa resulted in enhanced capacity of the community to
    protect women. At the individual level, the skills and knowledge gained by individual
    women made them more confident and capable of protecting themselves against the
    threat of domestic violence (Hargreaves and others 2010).

In contrast
• Both Kroecker (1995) and Aslop and others (2001) also highlight that internal
    hierarchies, frequently shaped by socio-cultural norms, often meant that the most
    vulnerable members of the respective groups (most notably women and those from the
    poorest socio-economic backgrounds) were the least likely to assert their opinions and
    views.

•   Gugerty and Kremer (2008) conducted a randomized control experiment in a program
    supporting women’s community associations in Kenya to evaluate its impact on civic
    participation among the disadvantaged. There were no significant differences between
    treatment and control groups in terms of outcomes such as organizational strength,
    participation, assistance to neighbors, or contribution to public goods. However, there
    was substantial evidence that funding changed group membership and leadership. It led
    younger, more educated, and better-off women to enter the groups and for older, more
    socially marginalized to depart.
                                                                                         90
   •   Humphreys and others (2006) used a unique nationwide experiment in democratic
       deliberation in São Tomé and Príncipe in which the discussion leaders were randomly
       assigned across meetings. They found that “leader effects” (the possibility of
       manipulation by political elites) was extremely large, which led them to question whether
       participatory decision-making processes in other countries are as vulnerable to elite
       capture.

   •   In the Philippines, Labonne and Chase (2011) find that CDD projects increased
       participation in village assemblies and interaction between residents and village leaders
       but did not initiate broader social change and, in fact, may have crowded out other
       avenues for collective action

   •   Casey and others (2011) find that women who participated in the GoBifo initiative in
       Sierra Leone were no more likely to voice an opinion during observed community
       meetings after the project ended or to play a leading decision-making role. No evidence
       was found of any increase in the role of women in the capacity to raise funds or to “act
       collectively outside the project”, or any change in how decisions were made.


31.     Overall, Conning and Kevane (2002) conclude that communities are only more effective
than outside agencies in targeting programs to the poor when they are relatively egalitarian, have
open and transparent systems of decision-making or have clear rules for determining who is
poor. Other evidence also suggests that inequality can worsen access to private transfers. Galasso
and Ravallion (2005), for example, find that greater land inequality and geographic
inaccessibility significantly worsened targeting in their study on Bangladesh. Communities that
have a low capacity to mobilize information and monitor disbursements are more vulnerable to
corruption and elite capture as are more heterogeneous communities, where multiple and
conflicting identities can create competing incentives (Araujo and others, 2008).

32.     Wong and Guggenheim (2005) refer to project design and management structures,
conducive local social environments, and transparent direct fiscal transfers to communities as
determining factors for the effectiveness of CDD programs. Binswanger and Aiyar (2003) note
the need for rules, transparency, and accountability to prevent corruption or elite capture of
community resources; effective capacity building; field-testing of pilot projects in different
conditions; systems for sharing and spreading knowledge to clarify roles and help create
common values; relevant incentives aligned with the new roles of stakeholders; and ease of
replication. Strong political commitment to decentralization and local governments to facilitate
coordination across communities and allocate resources to encourage more inclusive and pro-
poor CDD initiatives is necessary (Grootaert, 2003).

33.     While CDD initiatives are vulnerable to elite capture, parameters that may be useful to
ensure that such initiatives are pro poor and inclusive include electoral incentives and capacity of
higher levels of government to enforce accountability on lower-level bureaucrats, adequate
managerial capacity and clear mechanisms for downward accountability among key
considerations and project investments in capacity building; and democratic and actively
contested selection of local leaders across a sub-district’s community blocks (Fritzen, 2007).

                                                                                                 91
34.     Among other groups, the risk of excluding females is a concern for community-driven
development for several reasons. Mansuri and Rao (2013) indicate that social norms exclude
women from participating in public spaces or relegating them to work on women-specific tasks.
Women also face negative stereotypes about their ability to contribute effectively to proceedings
that have public implications, and community groups may have exclusionary rules that are not
favorable for female participation such as allowing only one person per household to belong to a
forestry group, which effectively exclude women. However, incentivizing communities to
include women and young men in community governance structures and setting minimum quotas
for participation of groups (e.g., women) may improve the likelihood of female participation in
community-driven development interventions (Lynch and others, 2013).

                                    III. CONTEXT ANALYSIS

35.     Citizen engagement literature points toward a growing recognition that context-specific
factors are fundamental to achieving both intermediate and final development outcomes. The
majority of CE literature that has focused on the outcomes of specific types of interventions (e.g.,
CDD programs) or the use of specific mechanisms (e.g., the use of community score cards) has
been useful to identify contextual factors. However, it is only more recently that the issue of
context has being examined more closely by the World Bank (2014a) SDV Flagship, O’ Meally
(2014), Bukenya and others (2012), and Joshi (2013) to determine why certain interventions
work in some contexts but not others and how CE initiatives can be tailored to contextual
variations.

36.     One of these factors is the availability of timely, user-friendly, reliable, and
comprehensive information, a pre-condition for effective CE. Effective access to local public
information and institutionalization of participation mechanisms create a virtuous circle based on
relationships of trust that, in addition to giving legitimacy to the actions of local authorities,
reduces the gap between the local state and society thereby strengthening relations not only
among civil society actors but also with the local government and the private sector and among
the various citizens’ groups. This creates conditions conducive to local development and
improvement of development outcomes. For instance, Peisakhin and Pinto (2010) draw on a field
experiment on access to ration cards among New Delhi’s slum dwellers to demonstrate that
India’s Freedom of Information Law is almost as effective as bribery in helping the poor to
secure access to a basic public service. Pande (2007) documents how a Delhi citizens group used
the Freedom of Information Law successfully to address corruption and accountability issues,
and posits that this was due to the combination of a sensitive bureaucracy, enabling legislation
and grassroots activism. Similarly, field experiments on local accountability in primary health
care in Uganda suggest that efforts to improve beneficiary control of health care delivery and
performance would have no measurable impact on the quality of care without addressing users’
lack of robust information on the performance of the healthcare clinics (Björkman-Nyqvist and
others, 2014).

37.    On the other hand, Lieberman and others (2014) and Banerjee and others (2010)
describe information sharing and dissemination interventions that had no perceptible
impact on civic participation or service delivery. For instance, initially Reinikka and
Svensson’s (2005) examination of education expenditures in Uganda using Public Expenditure
Tracking Surveys (PETS) presented information explaining how on average only 13 percent of
the expenditure meant for schools actually reached them; this information was widely publicized
                                                                                                 92
through an experimental informal campaign after which the transfer of funds to these schools
increased by 90 percent that resulted in improved school enrolment and student performance.
However, a later re-analysis of the case questioned whether the observed changes were also
significantly affected by other concurrent changes, including abolition of school fees, and
increased requirements for fiscal accountability to donors (Hubbard 2007). This example attests
that outcomes of citizen participation are influenced by myriad factors besides information
provision.

38.      Baland and Platteau (1999) suggest that entrenched social inequalities and limited space
for civic engagement may deter poor and marginalized citizens from questioning the lack of
effectiveness and equity in the provision of public goods. Keefer and Khemani (2003) highlight
weak incentives for service providers to improve their performance based on the support of
political agents. Fox (2007) argues that transparency does not always translate into
accountability, and that the outcomes of citizen-centered interventions are contingent on whether
transparency is ‘clear’ or ‘fuzzy’ and whether accountability espouses sanctions in addition to
answerability. Hubbard (2007) cautions that while evaluating the outcomes of citizen-centered
initiatives other contextual factors besides information disclosure need to be taken into account.
Darch and Underwood (2010) draw on case studies from Angola, Guatemala, Philippines, South
Africa, and Zimbabwe to postulate that access to information has the potential to improve
democratic process only if (a) the bureaucracy is capable of collecting and managing politically
salient information but sufﬁciently professional to implement a law that cuts against its own
institutional interests and (b) the political elite is politically and ﬁnancially dependent in a
nontrivial sense on those subject to its rule.

39.     Another theme relevant for CE interventions is emphasis on the inclusion and
empowerment of females (in addition to other disadvantaged or marginalized groups). For
example, Agrawal (2009) uses data for forest management groups in India and Nepal to provide
evidence that groups with a high proportion of women in their executive committees (decision-
making bodies) show significantly greater improvements in forest condition in both regions.
Oxfam’s Raising Her Voice (RHV) program in Honduras confirms the value that female
participants contributed to the audit committee on public budgetary transparency and expenditure
by gradually gaining the trust of the men (Evans and Nambiar, 2013). In Mali women members
of agricultural producer self-help groups benefit from increased mobility and greater autonomy
over the use of agricultural incomes, and they were consulted more on community and
organizational decision-making.

40.     At the same time, some studies show that efforts to empower women have not
always led to positive development effects. While studying the effect of political reservation
for women running for local office on the provision of government services and local public
goods to households in West Bengal, Bardhan and others (2008), for example, find that women
in reserved positions are no more effective than officials in unreserved positions at getting
benefits to their villages. In fact, they appear to be worse at targeting benefits to landless
households and housing benefits to disadvantaged castes, and performed worse in generating
revenues. A field experiment in Kenya that aimed to increase women’s participation in the
maintenance of water sources by encouraging them to attend community meetings had no impact
on the quality of infrastructure maintenance as compared to control communities (Leino, 2007).



                                                                                               93
41.     Outcomes of female engagement in CE initiatives also depend on context. For instance,
Ban and Rao (2009) find that women presidents in reserved gram panchayats are unambiguously
more effective when they are more experienced and that they perform worse when most of the
land in the village is owned by upper castes. This suggests that caste structures may be correlated
with structures of patriarchy making the job of women particularly difficult when they are
confronted with entrenched hierarchies. They also find that women presidents in reserved gram
panchayats perform best in states where reservations have been in place the longest, indicating
the salience of the maturity of the reservations system (Ban and Rao, 2009). Results of Oxfam’s
Raising her Voice Portfolio indicate that women’s care responsibilities and lack of financial
autonomy have a substantive impact on their efforts to participate sustainably in project
activities, and their ability to assume positions of community or political leadership. The costs
involved, for community groups and national coalitions alike, in convening meetings, running
activities, and supporting women’s participation and attendance also impact heavily on the
likelihood of these spaces continuing to function once donor funding comes to an end (Beardon
and Otero, 2013). The 2012 World Development Report on Gender Equality and Development
(2011a) finds that female participation in civic or political initiatives can be strengthened through
both formal or informal channels, though which channels will be most effective depends on the
issue and the extent to which it challenges norms, beliefs, and social institutions.

42.     The remainder of this section provides a broad overview of other relevant contextual
factors (demand side, supply side, and other) for CE.

A. Demand Side

   •   There is limited scope for demand-side initiatives without the willingness of citizens
       to participate in such interventions. Irvin and Stansbury (2004) refer to instances where
       citizens are too complacent to participate, or when they have had to contend with
       instances of limited representation and strong pursuit of self-interest by other interest
       groups. Citizens may have difficulty in establishing a causal relationship between
       providers’ actions and final outcomes such as test scores or health status (Banerjee and
       others, 2010), or they may simply be too consumed with more pressing priorities such as
       securing food and meeting other basic needs to provide feedback on service delivery
       (Banerjee and Mullainathan, 2008). Women in particular may participate to a lesser
       degree due to their multiple responsibilities (Bräutigam, 2004). Alatas and others (2011)
       note the cost of time and a sustained attention span by alluding to a collaborative village
       meeting that ran longer than one and one-half hours.

   •   The issue addressed by CE initiatives needs to be of significant interest to citizens.
       For instance, Shankar’s 2010 study of social audits in the three Indian states of Andhra
       Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh finds that villagers were more likely to monitor
       the performance of public officials on the wage component of the National Rural
       Employment Guarantee Scheme—– implying that social audits are more effective in
       reducing thefts when citizens have a private stake in the outcome but less so when the
       supply of public goods is involved (Shankar, 2010).

   •   There is evidence that participation competence is positively associated with the
       outcomes of CE interventions. Yang and Pandey (2011) confirm that while competence
       is necessary, this does not imply that incompetent citizens should not be involved.
                                                                                                  94
    Competence can be improved through the participation process since citizens’ knowledge
    and skills for collective action are cumulative and can be enhanced with engagement
    (IDS, 2011). Furthermore, there is evidence that argues for expanding participant
    representativeness in policy-making (Yang and Pandey, 2011).

•   The authority and credibility of the lead actor(s) and interlocuters is crucial to
    shape the outcomes of CE interventions. Lead actors need to demonstrate that they can
    extract and present reliable data and can disseminate it regularly. For instance, in
    Robinson’s (2006) independent budget analysis work, the legitimacy of the budget
    groups came from the fact that the agencies were authoritative sources of information on
    budget issues and that “in several cases were the only source of information and expertise
    outside government”. Tembo (2012) also notes that since citizens’ actions per se may not
    lead to required outcomes in specific contexts; it is therefore necessary to identify
    interlocutors (individuals, organizations, or groups of organizations) within civil society,
    the private sector, or inside the state “that work with or alongside ordinary citizens in
    engaging with state actors at various citizen–state interfaces”.

•   The nature of civil society, in particular the depth, extensiveness, and character of
    the relationships among CSOs, plays a critical role in determining the success of CE
    interventions. This was the case for South Africa’s Treatment Action Campaign that
    worked with scientists, academics, and health professionals to generate scientific
    evidence in order to convince the government to change its HIV/AIDS policies. It also
    sent activists and health workers to villages to provide the medicine and care that HIV-
    positive people needed; used the media and public events to chastise inaction by the
    government and international pharmaceutical companies and to fight stigma; and
    mobilized citizens through awareness-raising campaigns.

•   There is an inherent risk that participatory initiatives may not end up benefiting the
    poorest and the marginalized sections of society. In this context Haque (2008)
    confirms that such interventions are subject to elite capture and benefit elites and men
    more than the poorest. Isolated and poorer localities benefit less from programs due to
    capacity barriers and limits on access to information and media. In South Asia, this is
    also reflected in the caste structure in that higher castes make up the local elites who have
    political representation and government posts while lower caste participation is low due
    to social hierarchy and economic status. One case in point is how a program supporting
    women’s community associations in Kenya precipitated the departure of older women,
    the most socially marginalized demographic group, which in turn led younger, more
    educated, and better-off women to join the community associations (Gugerty and
    Kremer, 2008).

•   Most available evidence of impact is based on collective rather than individual
    action because they are more likely to result in improved public good benefits as
    opposed to the private benefits that can be the outcomes of individual action (Joshi,
    2010). In this context, Olken (2007) shows how state audits were more effective in
    monitoring leakages for village road projects rather than grassroots monitoring. The
    community had fewer incentives to monitor public goods in contrast to private goods
    where individual citizens have a personal stake.

                                                                                              95
       •    Mobilization and advocacy may be necessary to induce when there is little
            willingness on the part of citizens or when there is a need to scale up citizen-led
            interventions. Goodwin and Maru (2014) indicate that programs involving use of
            advocacy strategies are most likely to influence participants’ willingness to take action.
            Sirker and Cosic (2007) draw attention to risk factors for poor mobilization and
            ineffective participatory interventions, including poor partnerships across different CSOs
            or between CSOs and government; difficulties building alliances with socio-political
            movements; and weak links with grassroots groups and communities resulting in limited
            to no engagement with poor marginalized groups.

       •    CE accountability or transparency mechanisms that have the potential to trigger
            strong sanctions are more likely to be used and improve responsiveness by
            providers. Without the threat of effective sanctions and resulting impacts, citizen
            mobilization is difficult to sustain in the long run. One example of this is the struggle of
            Muslims for Human Rights (MUHURI), a CSO in Kenya, which has gained access to
            constituency development fund (CDF) records and organized social audits to track
            whether these funds have been used for community development projects. Since there is
            no freedom of information law in Kenya, public officials have shared CDF records or
            have refused to do so at will without any repercussions, which has made it more difficult
            for MUHURI to sustain its activities (IBP, 2008).

B. Supply Side

       •    The willingness of state functionaries to either support or respond to citizens’
            demands and close the feedback loop will determine the outcomes of such efforts.
            For instance, Irvin and Stansbury (2004) question the assumption of open policy-making
            on the part of governments by citing cases where political suasion and avoiding litigation
            costs was the motivation to involve citizens in policy-making processes. Gaventa and
            Barrett (2010) describe examples where authorities either refused to respond to citizen
            demands, or made tokenistic concessions such as declaring policy changes but not
            implementing them. Some of these outcomes can in part be traced to underlying
            perceptions regarding the relevance or importance of CE.

            Matthews (1999) observes that fear of public involvement, which can be traced to
            potential difficulties, can result from the involvement process: for example, increased
            conflict in the political system, increased problems of government policy-making, and
            decreased equality in society (see also Kweit and Kweit, 1981). Instrumental difficulties
            such as overload and lack of resources are also sources of fear (Checkoway and Van Til,
            1978; Rosenbaum 1978). The relevance of public engagement in policy processes could
            also be in doubt if there is a sense that citizens are not competent in public decision-
            making (Rosenbaum 1978), that they have no definite preferences (Dahl 1966), and that
            they are too apathetic and uncommitted to participate (Rosenbaum 1978). 2

       •    Values and incentives of specific state actors regarding public participation in
            policy-making will influence their willingness to engage. For instance, Yang and

2
    See Yang, K. (2005).
                                                                                                     96
    Callahan (2007) find that bureaucratic values are more important than external political
    forces in determining government decisions and outcomes (Krause, 1999; Meier and
    O’Toole, 2006). Their values and priorities inﬂuence the participation process and can
    enable or constrain meaningful involvement (Yang and Callahan, 2007). They also
    confirm that communities in which elected oﬃcials are ranked high with respect to
    pressuring for citizen participation are likely to have greater citizen involvement eﬀorts
    by government. Therefore, elected oﬃcials signiﬁcantly aﬀect how administrative
    decisions are made with regard to official procedures and processes, including space for
    public participation.

•   Characteristics of ‘target’ state institutions can determine the space for CE. Yang
    and Pandey (2011) show that red tape and hierarchical authority are negatively associated
    with good participation outcomes, conﬁrming the argument that bureaucratic structures
    are a major hurdle for eﬀective participation (e.g., King and others, 1998). They also find
    that organization size is not a harbinger of limited opportunities for engaging with
    citizens since “small organizations can face burdensome circumstances that are not
    conducive to citizen participation, and even large organizations can be ﬂexible, ‘ﬂat,’ and
    ready for change resulting from citizen participation” (Yang and Pandey, 2011).

•   The majority of initiatives that have led to improved intermediate and development
    results have involved working across different sectors spanning the private-public
    divide. For example, Transparency International’s Integrity Pacts in Germany and
    Pakistan have been successful in bringing together governments, private sector
    companies, and citizens to monitor procurement processes and outcomes (World Bank,
    2013a).

•   State actors and providers cannot respond to citizen feedback without a
    corresponding increase in their capacity to respond to their demands. Limited
    capacity in terms of time and financial and personal resources can lead to inaction and
    frustration on the part of government officials and providers. For example, while integrity
    pacts turned out to be beneficial to curb procurement corruption in Colombia, during their
    implementation it became apparent that the time required of public officials to respond to
    contract-related queries and to ensure transparency of the procurement process had not
    been taken into account at the onset (World Bank, 2013a). Yang and Callahan (2007) also
    support this conclusion: managers feeling overloaded are less likely to involve citizens in
    decisions that relate directly to administrative power and require more administrative
    attention. At the same time they also find that administrative resources are not a major
    concern when government feels the need to involve citizens in dealing with urgent
    strategic problems that require broad participation and that in fact the results show that
    resource shortages had a positive impact on the use of involvement mechanisms such as
    public hearings, which do not normally require signiﬁcant ﬁnancial investments.

•   A higher level of democratization may help to facilitate better outcomes of CE
    activities, yet its influence on the emergence and effectiveness of such interventions
    remains unclear. Crook and Booth (2011) suggest that in addition to formal democratic
    institutions and frameworks, there are informal institutions and the underlying political
    settlement that explain what happens and why. Furthermore, different forms of social

                                                                                            97
       contract or developmental accountability can emerge within weakly democratic or semi-
       authoritarian regimes (Stasavage, 2005).

   •   The presence of certain legal accountability mechanisms and the extent to which
       they are legitimate and enforceable in a given context will shape the form and
       prospects of different types of CE initiatives. Barrera-Hernández (2009) documents
       how Peru’s revised regulations, Oficina General de Gestion Social, made mandatory the
       public involvement in the Environmental Impact Assessment approval process, but in the
       end officials paid lip service to these regulations by merely sharing information with
       citizens and providing no avenues for dialogue and consensus building.

   •   Competitive party politics can act as an enabling factor to encourage CE and
       associated policy outcomes. In an evaluation of a Revenue Watch Institute pilot program
       for parliamentary strengthening to improve extractive industries governance in Ghana
       and Tanzania, Acosta (2010) argues that members of Parliament acting in the more
       competitive (multi-) party system in Ghana have greater incentives to use their increased
       knowledge to advocate and hold governments to account because their own electoral
       prospects may benefit from delivering greater transparency outcomes to voters. At the
       same time, Fritz and others (2014) maintain that preoccupation with winning and
       maintaining electoral support makes it difficult for politicians to commit collectively to a
       consistent and sustainable policy approach.

   •   The CE results are more likely to translate into positive development outcomes
       when governments can make credible inter-temporal commitments. Barma and
       others (2012) maintain that a stable policy environment is conducive to develop rapport
       and a mutually agreeable course of action and for deviations from those agreements to be
       sanctioned.

C. Others

   •   A high degree of media competition can ensure good quality of available
       information necessary for public engagement. Kolstad and Wiig (2009) argue that the
       existence of effective channels of information such as a free and active media can lower
       complaint costs for private agents about issues of corruption and that it can play a
       significant role in shaping public policy debates (Callaghan and Schnell, 2001). On the
       other hand, the use of media may in fact discourage citizen participation; for instance,
       Yang (2005) ﬁnds that government criticism in the media leads to lower levels of
       willingness to implement citizen involvement and Gibson (2004) demonstrates that local
       reporters cover urban development debates from a perspective that advances the position
       of those in power. Finally, Goodwin and Maru (2014) discovered relatively limited use of
       media in legal empowerment interventions, and Wang (2001) found no relationship
       between a cynical media and government’s use of participation mechanisms.

   •   The private sector may be instrumental in garnering support for increased CE, but
       even its motivation to push for citizen involvement may be ambiguous. Since
       businesses will likely promote their interests, they may prefer exclusive participation
       forums. Nevertheless, businesses help create participation channels and opportunities that

                                                                                                98
    may work for other citizens and therefore contribute to an increase in overall
    involvement. Evidence also shows that business organizations play a role in community
    services since more than 50 percent of American business leaders meet regularly with
    charitable and other nonproﬁt leaders; give employees paid time oﬀ for community
    service; and serve on boards, commissions, and committees that address community
    problems (Yang and Callahan, 2007).

•   Citizen engagement interventions need to take into account the ‘cultural match’
    between existing and new institutions and processes. Brett (2003) proposes that people
    must develop their own sense of the benefit of participation for a participatory approach
    to be sustained and effective. Facilitating CE approaches within hierarchical and
    deferential cultural contexts—where social differences based on social class, customs and
    tradition, and gender are pervasive—may fail if this approach is radically different from
    existing norms and value systems. Swindler (2009) advocates that analysis of the
    structure of patron/client ties; practices that adapt culturally meaningful, local
    institutional forms to new purposes (i.e., building on and extending local patterns of
    organization); and the identification of local brokers/international actors with long-term
    local knowledge and contacts are all key to learning how to make existing structures
    more responsive and how to embed interventions within a particular community or
    locality.

•   Efforts to strengthen citizen-state interaction need to be based on the
    conceptualization of citizenship, which may vary across contexts. Cornwall and others
    (2011) recommend that such interventions need to analyze the history of colonial and
    post-colonial institutional reforms and how these have been shaped by or have impacted
    changing notions of citizenship. Rather than a strong sense of citizenship as individuals
    vis-à-vis the state, citizens in developing countries have multiple identities linked to
    class, gender, ethnicity, and religion, which shape the ways in which they engage in
    collective or individual action which usually involve multiple strategies for accountability
    and security. Joshi (2008) also advocates that any conjecture regarding the effectiveness
    of CE reforms should be based on the trajectory of reforms that have shaped collective
    action and outcomes to date.

•   Interactions among various CE interventions and multiple iterations of such
    initiatives may lend themselves to facilitate positive outcomes. For instance, Robinson
    (2006) notes how independent budget analysis had to be accompanied by targeted
    advocacy of key decisionmakers to improve budget processes and outcomes.
    Furthermore, a World Bank global stock-taking of budget transparency initiatives
    describes examples from South Africa where earlier citizen-led interventions that did not
    meet their objectives set the precedent for later initiatives to promote pro-poor budget
    outcomes more successfully (World Bank, 2013a).

•   The duration of CE interventions is relevant since they need to be sustained for
    results to emerge. This is necessary to ensure that reform commitments are implemented
    (Robinson, 2006), citizens gain trust in the initiative, and changes are institutionalized to
    the point that clear and positive results begin to emerge (Paul, 2011). While Blair (2000)
    agrees that many participation mechanisms may take a long time to begin to function
    effectively because of contextual constraints like entrenched local networks of power, he
                                                                                              99
    also presents the caveat that effectiveness is not always linked to the length of time
    reforms have been in operation. He does so by alluding to Bolivia’s more recent
    democratic local governance program that had a larger number of mechanisms for
    governance and civic engagement that were functional as compared to the system with
    the longest experience (Karnataka), which had performed less well.

•   If the timing is not right, CE interventions may not translate into desired outcomes.
    Political transitions, including upcoming or ongoing elections, measures to curtail fiscal
    crises, new legislation, policy commitments at the international and domestic levels, and
    high-profile corruption scandals can provide “windows” of opportunity to advance CE
    initiatives. The prospect of upcoming elections, for example, enabled MUHURI in Kenya
    to obtain previously unavailable constituency development fund records from one
    parliamentarian who had a political incentive to be transparent (World Bank, 2013a).
    However, whether citizens and other stakeholders utilize these windows depends on a
    number of contextual factors since they may already be contending with “feedback
    fatigue” or may be engaged in additional interactions with the state which they believe
    might be more relevant for them or which may have greater potential for successful
    outcomes (Joshi and Houtzager, 2012).

•   While ad hoc or one-off CE initiatives can make a difference, experience shows that
    impact is greatest and most sustainable when the outcomes of such initiatives are
    institutionalized. Where possible, the legal institutionalization of participatory
    mechanisms—from the level of individual programs and agencies through the overall
    system level—should be considered as a means to enhance long-term effectiveness and
    sustainability. An illustration of this is FUNDAR’s campaign to convince the Mexican
    Government to increase budget allocations for the Arranque Parejo en la Vida program
    that sought to reduce maternal and child mortality. FUNDAR, the Center for Research
    and Analysis, and its partners were able to successfully lobby the federal government for
    a tenfold increase in the budgetary allocation for the program in the 2003 budget.
    However, by 2004, the Government had included these funds in a highly aggregated
    budget for a blanket health-protection scheme, making it impossible to determine whether
    or not the resources for the program’s implementation had been impacted by that year’s
    budget cuts (World Bank, 2013a).

•   Sectoral characteristics, and the nature of the public goods involved can shed some
    light on the outcomes of citizens’ efforts to improve access and quality of public
    services. Mcloughlin and Batley (2012) highlight (a) whether the characteristics of a
    particular service can influence incentives for politicians, providers, and users to commit
    resources to produce it and for politicians to be accountable to citizens for service
    performance and to determine the balance of power between policymakers and other
    actors; and (b) whether they set the broad parameters for when and how citizens can
    collectively mobilize around services and make demands on delivery organizations.
    Goetz and Gaventa (2001) describe other factors such as (a) the level of service
    complexity (lower technology services may be easier for citizens to engage with and
    influence or co-deliver); (b) the cost of services or service disruption to the client (which
    may trigger greater client interest in influencing how fees are spent or collective action
    for improved quality); (c) the presence of a strong private market for the service (creating
    a greater chance of ‘exit’ pressures for responsiveness); (d) whether the service provides
                                                                                             100
    an individual or a collective good (the latter being more likely to provoke collective
    action); and (e) whether the service is delivered face to face (thereby creating greater
    opportunity for engagement on both sides).

    As an example, Khemani (2008) indicates that the varying outcomes of community
    monitoring in India and Uganda can be explained by the differences in the health and
    education services that were being monitored. Users can more directly observe poor
    health services than poor teaching, which can remain invisible to parents. As a result, the
    users of health clinics could be more easily motivated to demand better services they did
    not know they were entitled to.

•   The effect of decentralization on CE and inclusion is determined by other context-
    specific factors. DFID’s (2013) review of the link between decentralization and
    development outcomes alludes to both positive and negative instances in this regard.
    There are encouraging qualitative studies such as Dauda’s (2004) study in Uganda in
    which the adoption of school fees in a specific locality provided strong incentives for
    parents to assume school management responsibility, and Jones and others’ (2007) work
    on Andhra Pradesh found that health and education user committees enabled participation
    of a broad cross-section of villagers. On the other hand, Poteete and Ribot (2011) attest to
    the uneven effects of decentralization in Botswana and Senegal, which empowered
    certain local actors and weakened others. Gershberg and others’ (2009) comparison of
    two community-based education reforms in Guatemala revealed that schools allowing a
    greater level of parental involvement struggled more with human resource management
    issues.

•   Global actors and processes can support or undermine CE efforts to promote
    accountability and improve development outcomes. First, donor accountability and
    donor-state relations, especially in highly aid-dependent countries are relevant because
    aid conditions may create or limit space for national deliberation and accountability over
    appropriate policies and measures, or aid flows may provide (dis)incentives for political
    elites to be more responsive to local citizens and for tax bargaining. Second, the
    accountability of other international power-holders beyond the state such as multinational
    corporations or international nongovernmental organizations have been found to shape
    domestic accountability in more or less positive ways, especially when the state is
    unwilling or unable to regulate these actors’ activities. Finally, a range of international
    economic and political processes can help to shape domestic accountability such as the
    implementation of international human rights norms, which can exert pressure on certain
    states and open spaces for greater accountability and so on (Ringold and others, 2011).

•   Structural factors such as a country’s geography, resource endowments, or
    demographic dynamics can influence stakeholder incentives. These factors may also
    include elements that may be subject to change but that are outside the control of
    stakeholders such as shifts and swings in commodity prices that can have significant
    effects on stakeholder incentives and opportunities, for example, by increasing rents or,
    conversely, by contributing to growing fiscal pressures (Fritz and others, 2014).

•   CE interventions can be undertaken in fragile contexts. More limited space for civic
    engagement in fragile states may not lead to required development outcomes.
                                                                                    101
       Goldfrank’s (2002) analysis of the decentralization/participation program implemented
       by the Frente Amplio in the municipal government of Montevideo revealed that even
       though the program contributed to improvements in city services by providing the
       government with better information about citizens’ needs and preferences, it failed to
       boost civic engagement among city residents because the channels of participation
       offered did not convince average citizens that their input in public forums would have a
       significant impact on governmental decisions. Coelho and Von Lieres (2010) suggest that
       unlike in stronger democracies, associations are very important for citizenship building
       and processes of political learning in more fragile contexts, while social movements are
       less common and often focus on a single issue such as elections. Diani (2008) argues that
       collective action in such regimes is mainly based on the community and embedded in
       non-political forms of organization (Earle, 2011). The Citizenship DRC has identified six
       factors that, depending on the context, may be useful to design CE interventions. These
       include the institutional and political environment, prior citizen capabilities, the strength
       of internal champions, history and style of engagement, the nature of the issue and how it
       is framed, and the location of power and decision-making (IDS, 2011). Batley and
       Mcloughlin (2010) while acknowledging the urgency and prevalence of service delivery
       by non-state actors (including communities and CSOs) in several fragile and conflict
       situations, also caution against undermining the role of the state in this area and risks
       such as limits to scalable and sustainable local capacity as well as the accountability of
       service providers.


            IV. LESSONS LEARNED FROM EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

43.    The substantial level of expertise and knowledge that development practitioners and
academics have amassed in this area over the past few decades will continue to help in
implementing and learning from CE initiatives. This section draws on strategic and operational
lessons from external stakeholders.

   •   Build or sharpen ‘political intelligence’ in developing CE policies and undertaking
       such interventions on the ground. As a first step, this requires the recognition that
       development cooperation is political and not simply technical in nature. It also calls for
       greater awareness that paths of change are not linear, and there may be embedded
       tensions in some of the assumptions that donors make about what brings about (positive)
       transformations (Menocal and Sharma, 2008).

   •   Establish a set of clear rules in order to avoid frustration among participants. These
       should specify both the procedural aspects (e.g., time available for debate, length of oral
       or written submissions) and the respective rights and duties of the participants (Caddy
       and others, 2005). Maintaining public interest and involvement in CE initiatives will also
       require initiators to tighten the “feedback loop” and demonstrate how people’s
       contributions have been used. The challenge is two-fold: demonstrating efficacy and
       immediate results and building support and momentum over time (Caddy and others,
       2005).

   •   Think about the time and scale of CE interventions. Where possible, development
       providers should invest in longer-term and more flexible support. Strengthening CE
                                                                                                102
    requires longer-term commitments than those usually made in project planning. Building
    relationships with key strategic actors (both state and non-state) over the long term seems
    essential to ensure positive outcomes (UNDP, 2010). Mansuri and Rao (2013) also refer
    to this implementation challenge and caution that participatory projects should not be
    expected to follow the assumed trajectory and three- to ﬁve-year cycles as infrastructure
    projects.

•   Develop M&E systems to measure the impact of CE. The variability of local context
    and the unpredictable nature of change trajectories in participatory interventions
    underscore the need for effective systems of monitoring and assessing impact. Such
    projects require constant adjustment, learning in the ﬁeld, and experimentation in order to
    be effective—none of which can be done without tailoring project design to the local
    context, carefully monitoring implementation, and designing robust evaluation systems
    (Mansuri and Rao, 2013).

•   Focus capacity building not only on technical but also on political skills. Caddy and
    others (2005) recommend capacity building for civil society user’s committees or
    advocacy groups in techniques to assess service quality or introduce technology to
    monitor service quality as well as policy cycles, data systems, and modes of presentation
    that officials find accessible. They also advocate for support to independent media efforts
    to expose poor-quality service delivery or poor accountability of institutions. At the same
    time, there should also be efforts to address the lack of substantial political capacity of
    both state and non-state actors such as the capacity to forge alliances, develop evidence
    and build a case, and contribute to the decision-making and policy-making processes
    (Menocal and Sharma, 2008).

•   Work with a wider range of partners. CSO partners should be carefully selected with
    due regard to issues of integrity, quality, and capacity; it is also advisable to select
    experienced partners that have ties to the grassroots and can reach otherwise marginalized
    and isolated groups (especially in the rural areas). This is important to ensure that
    participatory processes are more inclusive and representative (UNDP, 2010).

•   Build both sustainability features and exit strategies into the design of CE
    interventions. There should be more attention to empower partners for taking over donor
    roles and working to build the sustainability of projects. In this context there is also a
    need for much greater donor coordination of CE initiatives—beyond the basics of
    information sharing and basket funding—with the aim of moving toward joint objectives,
    with activity streams focused on areas of donor comparative advantage. Improved
    coordination is highly desirable in order to maximize funding, reduce transaction costs,
    avoid duplication, allocate management roles, and develop M&E systems (Menocal and
    Sharma, 2008).




                                                                                           103
                          V. AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH

44.     The preceding review of CE relevance for development outcomes makes it clear that
there is room to strengthen this evidence base, not only to measure its impact but also to gain a
better understanding of how, when, and where CE can help to serve clients better and improve
development results. This section proposes areas for further research that would be useful in this
regard.

   •   There is a need to generate a much more extensive evidence base regarding how
       context shapes the impact of CE interventions. This focus on context needs to inform
       all stages of data gathering around such interventions, from the construction of baselines
       through M&E systems to impact assessments.

   •   The effects of sector characteristics on relationships of accountability and control
       should be tested systematically through further inquiry. Such examinations could
       focus on the following:

            (a) Links between the visibility, measurability, and attributability of different
            services and functions and the political dynamics that emerge around them;
            (b) Implications of task-related characteristics for political control and bureaucratic
            policy coherence; and
            (c) Influence of demand characteristics of territoriality and frequency and
            predictability on the scope for direct user accountability.

   •   More explicit investigation of the impact of CE interventions on the outcomes of
       services rather than simply outputs would be useful. These would involve efforts to
       focus on appropriate solutions such as the types of interventions that are likely to improve
       quality of education and learning outcomes, rather than simply dealing with teacher
       absenteeism.

   •   Further insight into the trajectory of citizen–state relationships as well as the
       influence of other citizen-led activities is important for macro-level, socio-political
       analyses. By tracing the extent to which collective actors engage in social accountability
       actions over time, one can trace the evolution of citizen–state interactions around
       accountability, including whether previous actions elicited positive or negative responses
       from the state. We can also understand the conditions under which state actors are likely
       to respond (for example, if they have the required resources and capacity, if they are well
       linked to social actors, or if they are the subject of trust). Another option in this regard
       could be to expand the number of robust studies and build the evidence base for
       conditions under which different mechanisms work; although this path is resource
       intensive and the payoff seems attainable only in the distant future.

   •   Even though the key expectation of CE initiatives is that they will lead to official
       responses, current literature provides limited understanding of why officials might
       take certain actions rather than others. Unpacking the assumptions in expecting
       official responses to citizen action would be important to understand the micro-contextual

                                                                                               104
    factors at play (Joshi, 2013). Along the same lines, the influence of local government
    institutions on the impact of CE activities on outcomes such as service delivery has not
    been studied adequately in theoretical or empirical literature.

•   Research and evidence on the link between horizontal accountability mechanisms
    and their ability to strengthen vertical accountability relationships could include
    focus on the role of the judiciary, legislature and government agencies such as anti-
    corruption commissions to strengthen citizen’s voice and accountability relationships.

•   Further research should also provide a deeper understanding of how CE initiatives
    fare when they target a diverse set of non-state actors. This is because increasingly the
    state is only one of an array of legitimate actors who exercise public authority and
    provide services.

•   It would be beneficial to identify different characteristics of the communities that
    tend to support social accountability measures compared to groups where these
    mechanisms do not evolve or work (World Bank, 2009). In the same context, evidence
    is lagging on how civil society could solve accountability problems in politics and
    thereby strengthen incentives of higher-tier governments to pursue appropriate
    interventions for improved compact and client power. For example, there is little rigorous
    impact evaluation of the role of mass media and cutting-edge communication
    technologies (Devarajan and others, 2011). In this context, is it necessary to isolate the
    impact of ICT on CE both on citizen mobilization/participation and, if possible, on final
    development outcomes.

•   Future research should generate case study evidence that includes a review of CE
    initiatives that have not managed to meet their objectives of contributing to
    development results. This will provide further insight about the problems and
    complexities involved and inform ongoing learning in this regard (Newig and Fritsch,
    2009).

•   CE interventions should be assessed comparatively for their durability, scalability,
    and contexts that are more amenable to specific mechanisms.

•   Analysis of the costs of existing and upcoming CE initiatives should be undertaken.
    The current lack of information on the true costs of such initiatives prevents any serious
    debate on their merits or drawbacks and does not serves the interests of either proponents
    or detractors of these new governance models.

•   There is need to better understand the risks of mainstreaming CE for all of the
    stakeholders involved, as well as potential unintended consequences.

                                       Annex III: Summary of Stock-Take

1.     This annex presents a synopsis of the lessons learned to date from existing World Bank
experiences in using citizen engagement (CE) approaches in projects. It includes an overview of
the stocktake of projects utilizing CE approaches in ongoing World Bank projects and some
lessons learned gathered from existing impact analyses of World Bank-supported community-
driven development projects and interviews with task team leaders (TTLs).

2.      The stocktake aimed to gain an understanding about the differences between CE in
project design with the actual implementation and to understand key challenges in
implementation from a TTL perspective. Methodology for the stocktake involved (a) a desk
review of project appraisal documents for 517 Investment Project Financed (IPF) operations
(IDA/IBRD) and 124 Development Policy Lending (DPL) operations (IDA/IBRD) approved in
FY11 and FY12; (b) results framework indicator analysis of 299 IPF operations (IDA/IBRD)
approved in FY10 and reporting in their Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) in
FY13; (c) 142 surveys of TTLs for projects that implement CE mechanisms; and (d) 68 in-depth
interviews of TTLs for projects that implement CE, identified by suggestions, TTL references,
and best-case examples.

A. Stocktake
3.      For the purpose of the stocktake, CE activities in Bank operations have been categorized
into seven types of activities: (a) consultations; (b) collaboration in decision-making; (c)
collecting, recording, and reporting on inputs received from citizens; (d) grievance and complaint
redress mechanisms; (e) citizen led monitoring, evaluation, and/or oversight; (f) empowering
citizens with resources and authority over their use; and (g) building citizen capacity for
engagement.

4.      The large majority of CE mechanisms in projects to date are motivated by
safeguard requirements, highlighting considerable potential for scaling up non-mandatory
approaches. Currently, 87 percent of IPF projects approved in FY10, FY11, and FY12 have
triggered any one of the three key mandatory safeguards (OP4.01, OP4.10, or OP4.12) that
require CE through consultations and grievance redress mechanisms, without clear reporting on
them in project appraisal documents (PAD) and ISR results frameworks. Figure A3.1 provides
the distribution of safeguards triggered for all IDA/IBRD IPF operations approved in FY10,
FY11, and FY12. As shown, an Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) was triggered in 84
percent of all projects approved, as compared to 53 percent for Involuntary Resettlement (OP
4.12), and 23 percent for Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10). With almost 90 percent of IPF projects
triggering mandatory CE mechanisms, safeguards-related CE provides one operational entry
point for mainstreaming results-focused CE. This entails (a) improved reporting on mandatory
CE mechanisms 1 and (b) significant potential for scaling up non-mandatory CE mechanisms in
Bank operations.

    The draft Environmental and Social Framework proposes that the Borrower will develop and implement a Stakeholder
     Engagement Plan (SEP) which will describe the timing and methods of engagement with project-affected communities and
     other stakeholders (See ESS10, para 14). This is a mandatory requirement. Additional details will be clarified in forthcoming
     procedures.
                                                                                                                             106

5.      Regional figures find CE across IPF in all regions, allowing for a cross-regional
approach to mainstreaming. Figure A.3.2 shows the regional distribution of IDA/IBRD IPF
projects approved in FY11 and FY12, which currently require CE through safeguards. The
highest share of CE activities in IPF (referred to as “beneficiary feedback”) currently derive from
Africa (33 percent), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (17 percent), East Asia and
the Pacific (17 percent), South Asia (15 percent), Eastern Europe and Central Asia (13 percent),
and the Middle East and North Africa (5 percent). While figures for regions such as the Middle
East and North Africa may appear low at 5 percent, this reflects the distribution of approved
operations per region and/or sector. Even in regions with a small number of operations, projects
with CE are currently operating in nearly every sector.




                                                                                               107
                              Figure A3.2. Regional Distribution of CE in IPF (%)




6.      Similarly, CE mechanisms in IPF are being utilized in all sectors of Bank
operations, highlighting opportunities for mainstreaming CE across sectors. The stocktake
shows that across all regions, CE activities in IPFs are most prevalent in the transportation sector
(17 percent); health and social services sector (14 percent); agriculture sector (13 percent); water
sanitation and flood protection sector (13 percent); and public administration, law and justice
sector (13 percent). This distribution can likely be attributed to the aforementioned safeguards
requirements or community-driven development projects, particularly in the case of the
agriculture sector. CE is also prevalent in the energy and mining sector (12 percent). Sectors
where CE activities are least common include education (7 percent), industry and trade (5
percent), finance (3 percent), and information and communication (3 percent) (see Figure A3.3).

               Sector                     %

                           Education     7%
                   Energy & Mining      12%
                             Finance     3%
            Health & Social Services    14%
                    Industry & Trade     5%
      Information & Communication        3%
Public Administration, Law & Justice    13%
                       Transportation   17%
Water, Sanitation & Flood Protection    13%

7.      The objectives of CE in IPF vary by region. Based on project development objectives,
the stocktake grouped IPF with CE into five common outcome areas: (a) service delivery; (b)
natural resource management; (c) public financial management; (d) social inclusion and
empowerment; and (e) governance. Regional differences exist. For example, Africa currently has
CE activities across all five development outcome areas, while CE is not being used in projects
across all outcome areas in other regions (see Figure A3.4).
                                                                                                108
     Figure A3.4. Regional Distribution of Bank Operations by Development Outcome Areas


8.      A review of project development objectives highlights that the majority of projects
with CE mechanisms are intending to improve service delivery. Among the five identified
development outcome areas, IPFs with the intended objective to improve service delivery (e.g.,
in infrastructure, health, or education) have the highest prevalence of CE activities across all
regions (56 percent). The regional distribution of projects that intend to improve service delivery
and have CE are proportionally similar to the regional distribution of projects that trigger
safeguards for CE—Africa has the largest share, followed by East Asia and the Pacific, Latin
America and the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East
and North Africa respectively. Figure A3.5 provides an overview of regional and sectoral
distribution.

                                         Service Delivery




                                                                                               109
9.      A comparison of IPF with DPLs that use CE reveals that these instruments support
different development outcome areas. Investment lending operations use CE approaches
mainly to improve service delivery and natural resource management and less in projects for
improved public financial management and governance (Figure A3.6, left). On the other hand, a
far higher proportion of DPL operations use CE in support of public financial management and
governance outcomes (Figure A3.6, right). These findings show that CE is being used in
different Bank lending instruments to achieve different outcomes. A comprehensive approach to
CE for results therefore needs to build on all available World Bank instruments for engagement
and not be limited to IPF only.

          Figure A3.6. Distribution of Investment Lending Operations by Outcome Area




10.     Outcomes of CE are not monitored systematically, and results reporting during
project implementation is irregular. A review of ISR reporting in FY13 for investment lending
operations approved in FY10 revealed that 32 percent of total approved IPF projects report on
CE results indicators in ISRs. This highlights opportunities for the use of CE results indicators to
set incentives for adequate monitoring and reporting by Global Practices/regions and sectors.

11.     Results reporting patterns differ by sectors. Several sectors (including health and
social services, agriculture, public administration and law and education) already include a CE
results indicator in the PAD-level results frameworks while other sectors (transport, energy and
mining, industry and trade) do this only in the minority of their projects. Similarly, some sectors
such as health and social services or public administration and law report on CE results
indicators during project implementation while reporting in others is weak to non-existent
(Figure A3.7). Similar findings apply when data is presented by Global Practice. While this can
                                                                                                110
in part be explained by the different nature of projects in the various sectors, not all of which
systematically involve citizens, it points nevertheless to an agenda of (a) systematically
integrating results indicators for CE activities in projects and (b) improving implementation
reporting on results indicators agreed at the project appraisal stage.

B. Lessons Learned

12.   This section summarizes key lessons learned from 142 surveys and 68 interviews with
TTLs and existing impact reviews of World Bank operations.

Context Factors
13.     The quality of mandatory CE can be improved. Eighty-five percent of TTLs
interviewed attest that consultations are the primary method of CE, but the breadth of these
consultations has been found to be highly variable. Consultations during design and
implementation of project operations vary from being highly engaging with multiple iterations of
consultation meetings to simple information dissemination. According to TTLs, a project’s CE
credibility is established through the quality of consultations during project design. For instance,
consultations that best articulate a common understanding among the citizens such as by
providing visual aids and information material in local, easily understood language fosters clarity
among the citizens and encourages higher citizen participation along with increasing willingness
to provide feedback.


14.    The majority of CE activities are undertaken during the stages of project design and
implementation and are relatively less prevalent at the completion stage. The predominant
mechanisms for beneficiary feedback are consultations, followed by public displays of
information, participatory planning, and citizen satisfaction surveys. Third party monitoring is
conducted most frequently through procurement monitoring and social audits, which are among

                                                                                                112
the most frequently used mechanisms at the project completion stage. However, the effectiveness
of third party monitoring has proven to be contextually based and necessitates a minimum level
of trust, otherwise it can even be counter productive by constraining the level of transparency at
project level. Community management, though more frequent for community-driven
development (CDD) projects, is less prevalent overall. Often, community management has
involved co-financing by the community of the project, which has demonstrated success in
sustaining activities post-project completion due to creating accountability within the
community.

15.     Early results help build buy-in and ownership for CE activities in projects.
According to TTLs, stakeholder buy-in increases significantly once initial CE results have been
achieved, typically close to mid-term, and can be a driver for scaling up CE activities. Trust is
necessary to foster an enabling CE environment and strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness
of CE activities. Task team leaders emphasize the need for citizens’ trust that governments will
take their feedback into account, to the extent possible, as well as confidence on part of
governments that citizen feedback reflects pressing needs and priorities. A collaborative
relationship among citizen monitoring groups, the government, and the project management
units increases the possibility of monitoring results to be incorporated into project
implementation. The World Bank’s experience in this area confirms the need at the onset of the
project to encourage and empower disadvantaged citizens who may feel too marginalized to
provide honest feedback and to ensure that a functional feedback loop is in place to avoid raising
expectations and leading to disillusionment (World Bank 2012b).

16.     The timing and degree of political transition influences CE success. Political
transition, depending on type, can create obstacles or opportunities for CE. In general, however,
TTL interviews highlight that a higher degree of political stability leads to higher degrees of CE
and within a shortened period of time.

17.     Local knowledge and capacity can contribute to the success of CE activities. Several
TTL interviews emphasized the importance of local knowledge, technical how-how and
convening power of the communities, CSOs, and schools/training institutes that proved to be
valuable during project design and implementation. Project team leaders cite that selecting staff
who are CE knowledgeable within the local context was often challenging and was done on an
ad hoc basis. Project implementation can benefit from a country-based CE specialist with
knowledge of the country context, contributing to building the trust and confidence of sometimes
skeptical government officials. Moreover, CSOs can be useful intermediaries between citizens
and governments. Team leaders emphasize the benefit of CSO capacity to engage and reach
those in the remote and rural areas. Citizen engagement has been found to be most successful
when the government counterpart has sufficient implementation capacity and operates in a
transparent manner. The most effective projects to institutionalize CE as part of country systems
achieved this in an environment where a willing government structure had strong capacity to
implement CE activities as well as the capacity to act on the feedback. If country capacity is not
readily available, “the Bank may be able to augment [current country] systems by bringing
technical expertise on how to generate meaningful and reliable responses.” (World Bank,
2014b).

19.   ‘Feedback fatigue’ can have an adverse impact on planned CE activities. According
to some TTLs, parallel ongoing CE activities (particularly due to limited harmonization among
                                                                                              113
development cooperation providers), time constraints, and limited or slow results ensuing from
their feedback have affected the willingness of citizens to participate in such activities. Some
project teams recognized this aspect and made accommodations for project beneficiaries (e.g.,
changing the timing of community meetings to encourage higher attendance by women who
were otherwise occupied with household chores at other times). There is a clear need to work
better with other development partners by leveraging one another’s resources to reduce project
cost, including for CE activities.

Operational Aspects
20.    There is strong demand from TTLs for guidance and support to CE mainstreaming
in WBG operations. Discussions with TTLs have confirmed the importance of designated
technical support on a sustained basis as well as improved accessibility of systematic Bank
knowledge on CE activities. The TTLs’ awareness of existing guidance (or how-to) notes and
resources for engaging with citizens is limited. Additionally, frequent TTL transitions have been
noted as obstacles in passing on institutional knowledge. Beyond project documents, TTLs have
named insufficient communication or knowledge transfer as key transition challenges. More
WBG-wide systematic knowledge management on CE activities has also been cited as a need.

21.     All TTLs stated that CE needs to be incorporated into the project design. This is
particularly important to determine whether CE activities can support project development
objectives; how to collaborate with partner governments in CE mainstreaming; which CE
activities or mechanisms would be better suited for respective Bank-lending instruments and
projects (including ICT); at which stage(s) of the project it would be relevant to incorporate such
activities; and how and to what extent such activities should be implemented to strengthen
project impact while not being overly taxing on implementation progress and resources.

22.     Regular reporting and monitoring of CE results indicators would facilitate rapid
CE mainstreaming into WBG operations. Feedback from TTLs confirms that it would be
useful to incorporate CE indicators based on their project’s intended outcomes rather than the
project’s sector. Since CE activities are not necessarily sector specific, a proposed list of sector
agnostic CE indicators accompanied by clear guidance would be helpful for TTLs to think
through the results-chain of their project, including the project’s results framework. Using such
CE indicators would also foster a culture for proactive CE integration into project design and
help to prevent cumbersome procedures to amend existing results frameworks to integrate new
CE indicators during project implementation. These indicators will be made available as part of
staff guidance.

23.     There is scope for projects to close the feedback loop more consistently. Overall,
interviews with TTLs confirmed willingness and responsiveness on the part of project teams to
make changes and undertake follow-up actions based on beneficiary/citizen feedback. At the
same time, systematic efforts to inform citizens about how or if their feedback was utilized were
found to be less prevalent.

24.     Currently technology is not widely used to support CE activities in operations. The
use of ICT depends on the nature of the project, the size of the project area, and the number of
beneficiaries. It also depends on approach and context since ICT is no substitute for personal
interaction with beneficiaries and citizens to build familiarity and rapport, particularly during the
                                                                                                 114
initial stages of the project. In projects where ICT is used to engage with citizens, the use of
websites/web portals is most prevalent, followed by mobile SMS. Currently, 39 percent of TTLs
interviewed said to have incorporated ICT into project implementation. The TTLs note that SMS
messaging and cell phone usage is more prevalent than Internet connectivity in rural areas. Call
centers are commonly used in WBG operations in sectors concentrated on service delivery in
urban areas or for projects that are undertaken throughout the country rather than in a particular
community or region.


Key Challenges

25.     Time is one of the most constraining factors. Lack of time has been cited by TTLs as a
key constraint. Citizen engagement requires adequate time for design, implementation, and
reporting back on the inputs received to close the feedback loop. This also points to the need to
adequately budget for staff time in all projects aiming to engage with citizens at any point of the
project lifecycle.

26.      Capacity building is key to obtaining results. The interviewed TTLs indicate that
initial engagement activities can be slow to produce results due to limited engagement capacity
of both citizens/community organizations and governments. The need for adequate capacity for
engagement at the community level has also been highlighted in the World Bank’s impact
analysis of community-driven development projects (Wong, 2012).

27.      Most CE activities are financed through project components, but a consistent
funding strategy and approach to costing is missing. Evidence also shows that TTLs do not
have a clear understanding with regard to available sources of funding for CE across the
institution. According to data provided by the 142 TTL surveys, 53 percent of CE activities are
financed by project components, 23 percent of activities are funded by Bank budget, 12 percent
are financed through trust funds, and 12 percent are funded by counterparts. Additionally, team
leaders pointed out that the government is willing to borrow and agree to CE activities for
projects operating in a sector of high priority. Team leaders cite the government’s willingness to
engage as being highest when CE is incorporated into the project components, which are
discussed and agreed upon at project design. Trust funds are primarily used to pilot CE activities
(Figure A3.8).

                     Annex IV: Summary of Regional Approaches
8.    The OPCS stocktaking and work in other parts of the WBG confirm that citizen
engagement (CE) mechanisms are being used by teams in all regions.

A. Africa
9.      The Africa region (AFR) adheres to the new corporate mandate to incorporate
beneficiary feedback mechanisms. The region has measured this experience by developing
Listening to Citizens: Learning from Projects in Africa—a robust knowledge base on the
modalities, enabling conditions, challenges, and outcomes of scaling up engagement with
communities and beneficiaries. With the information from this assessment, project teams in the
region will better understand the mechanisms of CE. This section provides a brief overview of
the assessment.

       1. Experience and Lessons Learned

10.     Listening to Citizens: Learning from Projects in Africa focuses on the use,
effectiveness, and outcomes of CE mechanisms used during project implementation. It
consists of a four-tiered study: (a) a review of 250 Project Appraisal Documents (PADs) in 10
relevant sectors; (b) a survey sent to task team leaders (TTLs) for 205 projects with CE
components; (c) semi-structured interviews with 21 of these TTLs; and (d) in-depth case studies
for six projects. The in-depth case studies involved follow-up interviews with TTLs and
interviews with other project team members, project implementation units (PIUs), other
members of government, relevant civil society organizations (CSOs), members of the country
management unit (CMU), and a sample of beneficiaries.

11.     The review reveals that the prevalence of CE activities varied according to the
nature/type of projects across the project portfolio. CE was more prevalent in country-driven
development (CDD) projects and projects involving government service delivery, resource
management, or promotion of economic activity, and less prevalent in energy and water, trade,
and transport projects.

12.     The issue of funding has also played a significant role in the implementation of CE
activities in the region. Approximately 27 percent of survey respondents stated that the most
significant barrier to executing CE tools was inadequate funding. Funding for CE is most
available when it is built into the project components; the next most available funding is other
Bank Budget that has not been earmarked for the CE mechanism at the design stage. In many
cases, projects used multiple sources of funding.

13.     The trends demonstrate that parallel funding—whether through counterparts, trust
funds, or other external sources—tends to supplement shortfalls in project-based financing
for CE tools. The successful implementation of CE mechanisms in projects with dedicated funds
also signals the importance of government buy-in, which is a requirement when financing is
allocated for CE at the design phase as part of the Bank Budget or is integrated into project
components.

              a. CE results and outcomes
                                                                                            116
14.     Given the small sample of projects and the many factors that contribute to the
success of CE and project results, an evaluation is somewhat speculative; randomized
controlled trials or, at minimum, detailed survey work at the beginning and end of a project
intervention would be required to draw rigorous conclusions.

15.      For the 15 projects that were not selected for case studies, the supervision
documents did not provide the evidence necessary to discern causality between CE
applications and project results. However, the Kenya Health Services Support Project and the
Ethiopia Productive Safety Nets Project, for example, offer some insights on linkages between
CE and project results. Assessing the impact of CE on outcomes is complex: in the Kenya
Health Services Support Project, for instance, although utilization rates of health services at
public facilities increased from 24 million to 38 million a year over the project period, attribution
to CE was not possible (although the TTL confirmed that it played an important role). Therefore,
it is likely that CE did have some impact on improved client/service provider relations. Finally,
individual visits to public health care facilities doubled from 1.7 (2004) to 3.7 (2013) per year;
confidence in health facilities likely influenced the behavior change.

16.    Beyond anecdotal testaments, the assessment rarely revealed concrete evidence of
CE measures leading to “course corrections” or other changes in project implementation.
Only five of the TTLs interviewed were able to name a specific change in project
implementation that could be attributed to CE. However, this does not mean that CE did not
make a difference.

17.     Most TTLs interviewed perceived that overall, CE has contributed positively to
project implementation and outcomes. In some cases, such as CDD projects in which contact
between citizens and implementing agencies is frequent, “feedback loops”—that is sharing of
information, preferences, and responses by both—were continuous, as, presumably, was
corrective action. In these circumstances, the “course” was being guided by CE interventions
throughout implementation rather than in midstream. Even when exchange between citizens and
service providers was less frequent, it is likely that CE was one input among others—financial,
technical, and organizational—that combined to induce shifts in implementation practice and
behaviors. The challenge once again is attribution—discerning what role CE played in informing
these practices.

               b. Factors affecting the performance of CE mechanisms

18.    This section reviews conditions or factors that promote or discourage the use of CE
interventions in relation to country context, as well as project-level and Bank-level factors.

                       (i) Country context

19.     In the sample of 21 countries, country context appears to have played a significant
role in willingness to include CE mechanisms in projects. Among countries that have adopted
vigorous decentralization legislation fairly recently, Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda
have all registered significant use of CE instruments. However, decentralization has resulted in
unevenness in embracing CE among local jurisdictions. Progressive local leaders found these
approaches to be useful in demonstrating their commitment to citizens, while more traditional
                                                                                                 117
local authorities (Benin, Ghana) or lower-level ministry staff (Nigeria) saw them as a threat to
their authority (or rent-seeking opportunities) or simply as petty nuisances.

20.   The following elements of country context are particularly important for the success
and sustainability of CE mechanisms:
    • Strengthening government capacity to engage. As good governance has been increasingly
      demanded in recent years, it is possible that governments have felt vulnerable or at least
      unable to understand the purpose and content of CE instruments.
    • Use of CSOs/NGOs in implementation. CSOs can be useful intermediaries between
      citizens and governments and could build communities’ capacity to engage with
      government.
    • Attention to vulnerable groups. CDD projects or general community consultation that
      addressed the local population at large sometimes initially overlooked vulnerable groups,
      including the extremely poor, women, and children.

                      (ii) Project-level factors

21.      Project type. Not surprisingly, CDD projects generally had the most “evolved”
instruments in terms of community involvement in decision-making. In addition, projects in
sectors whose primary purpose is delivery of services at the “retail” level (e.g., providing direct
services or stipends to individuals, such as local government, health and social protection) all
incorporated instruments for consultation, feedback, and some forms of monitoring. Projects in
irrigation and natural resource management (including promotion of income generation, as in
Uganda Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources) also included some of the same
approaches. The energy projects in the sample, all of which entailed large lump-sum
investments, either did not use CE instruments (Mali Energy Support Project), dropped them
almost entirely during implementation (Burundi Multisectoral Water and Electricity
Infrastructure Project), or provided no indication of acting on them in their Implementation
Status and Results reports (Regional Power). CE mechanisms in transport projects focused
almost exclusively on Project Affected Persons.

22.    Project design. The assessment shed light on aspects of project design that encouraged or
discouraged the effective use of CE approaches.
    • Pre-appraisal analysis. Analysis before launching a project has proved to be valuable to
       ensure that the project design is responsive to the local context and the preferences of
       beneficiaries.
    • Flexibility. The Kenya experience is informative. While each of the nine demographically
       diverse pilot sites was allowed to experiment with a flexible approach in using CE
       instruments, it appears that no systematic analysis was undertaken to determine what
       worked well, where, and why. Such an analysis could have provided guidance on which
       practices it would be more prudent to adopt in different localities.
    • Clear definition of CE instruments and associated indicators. In many cases, good
       preparation work permitted greater specificity of the CE mechanisms and also led to
       incorporating monitorable basic or intermediate indicators in the results frameworks of
       the PADs. TTLs emphasized that establishing indicators was very important to focus
       attention and resources on CE during implementation. It also helped to improve
       accountability, since CE issues were being tracked and reported on.

                                                                                               118
   •   Absence of instrumentality. Many projects did not articulate the objectives of CE
       instruments or did not specify an explicit relationship between project development
       indicators and CE objectives or components.
   •   Use of surveys. Some projects use built-in baseline and end-project surveys. However,
       even with surveys, it is difficult to discern the role of CE in attaining the project
       development objectives, particularly in the absence of an underlying hypothesis or theory
       of change.

23.     Budget for implementation. Some TTLs mentioned that implementation budgets were
constrained, and they therefore prioritized the actions required to monitor and take corrective
action related to the project indicators. Unless indicators related to CE are established at the
outset, CE activities could be more easily overlooked during implementation: TTLs may
perceive that there is not much to monitor or report.

                      (iii) Bank-level factors

24.     In overall responses to the assessment, there appeared to be a genuine commitment
to expanding CE practices, subject to adaptation to the sector at hand as well as to the creation
of a supporting environment within the Bank for doing so.

25.     Skills of the project team. Project team skills may be a project-level issue, but they
ultimately reflect Bank-level incentives and prioritization. In addition to a committed TTL, most
successful CE interventions can benefit from expertise by a social development or governance
specialist with CE credentials or a sector specialist with strong experience and allotted time to
work on CE issues.

26.   Leadership/management support. TTL responses varied as to whether support by sector
or country management was a more critical factor; some indicated the importance of
commitment by both.

27.      Funding. CE initiatives require funding, including additional time, at both preparation
and implementation stages. Adding mandates without supplementary funding is self-defeating, as
it results in cookie-cutter approaches and shortcuts that could jeopardize the legitimacy of CE
efforts.

       2. Going Forward

28.   To systematically mainstream CE into relevant projects, it is necessary to have a
coherent, overarching strategy that helps to create the right incentives, including
earmarked funding to engage with citizen beneficiaries. Staff training to build awareness of
CE and its importance to projects, written guidance, and training (e.g., self-paced online modules
and workshops) are all important aspects of this approach.

29.   It would be useful to link AFR’s efforts to mainstream CE at the project level with
ongoing support to strengthen country systems to ensure that the capacity and
performance of country systems to engage with citizens is factored in during the design of
Bank-supported operations. It is also advisable to clearly distinguish the Bank’s role from the

                                                                                              119
government’s in strengthening CE. The notion of mainstreaming this agenda has to consider the
enormous variations in country context, capacity, and political will in the countries of the region.

30.    A pragmatic, gradual, context-specific approach to selecting appropriate entry
points for CE would facilitate the process of mainstreaming. Therefore, it would be useful to
develop guidance that spells out what types of CE can be of benefit, and when and where.

31.     Developing a results framework or chain is important to specify what the CE
objective is, what CE instruments will be used, how this will help achieve overall project
results, and which indicators will be used to monitor implementation and results. At the
design stage, CE should be based on addressing the problem at hand and its value-added to
achieving the project’s objectives.

32.     Where the country context is constraining, the region also needs to pay attention to
identifying entry points for building an effective enabling environment in the country. This
means coordinating with governance specialists working on broader country environment issues
to both understand the challenges of the country context and assess how project processes could
create externalities for the country environment.

33.   Indicators to measure the impact of CE mechanisms need to be built into projects.
Adequate incentives could ensure that there is regular reporting on the effectiveness and impact
of CE mechanisms.

34.    Coordination with other regions to facilitate cross-regional learning would be useful
for sharing relevant approaches, experiences, and recommendations. In the immediate term,
launching a few pilots will assess how these shared insights can usefully contribute in the context
of projects. In addition, the Global Practices could be an important platform to facilitate this
Bankwide initiative.

B. East Asia and Pacific
There is a long history of CE in Bank operations in East Asia and Pacific (EAP). The
regional context offers experience in countries with different levels of receptivity to CE in
decision-making and voicing of concerns.

       1. Experience and Lessons Learned

The experience in EAP countries varies broadly. In some, CE is highly developed and
processes are refined as governments strive for openness and accountability; in others, the CE
processes are nascent, emerging in closed states with weaker governance; and in post-conflict
settings, CE processes are fundamental for peace and stability. The CE agenda draws on
experience in three areas: (a) community-driven development (CDD); (b) social accountability
activities in such sectors as health, education, agriculture, justice, and security; and
(c) beneficiary and citizen consultation and feedback for all people affected by a project as well
as for environmental and social safeguards.




                                                                                                120
               a. Community-driven development

35.     In CDD operations, CE is the primary driving force of the activities and outcomes.
There is a range of such operations: (a) national flagship programs with engagement, as in
Indonesia (1998-2017), the Philippines (2002-2020), and Cambodia (2003-2012); (b) operations
that are limited in scope but that have the potential (if not the stated objective) for national scale-
up, as in China, Myanmar, the Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea; and (c) operations that
are targeted to specific regions or vulnerable groups, as in Vietnam, Thailand, Lao, or the
Mindanao Region in the Philippines. The commonality here is the importance of continually
refining the integrated CE approach for empowerment and instrumental ends. Robust evaluations
have demonstrated the poverty impact of these programs and their contributions to the World
Bank’s twin goals.

36.      The region’s long history with this type of support means that the CDD projects of
Indonesia and the Philippines can share a vast range of lessons on community
participation. In over a decade of experience both PNPM (Indonesia) and KALAHI
(Philippines) have gained understanding of how communities become (and stay) engaged. This
takes the agenda further from the basics of CE to specific ingredients: what works, when, and
why. Project analyses and lessons have been shared among EAP countries and elsewhere on
facilitation as the cornerstone of effective CE, the importance of establishing a code of ethics,
information and transparency strategies for more empowered beneficiaries, localizing financial
controls to empower communities to oversee budgets and expenditures, strategies to enhance the
quality of women’s participation, and grievance-handling mechanisms that actively involve
villagers in the resolution of problems and disputes (see Box A4.1).

37.     Many EAP operations have progressed beyond broad-based community
empowerment and local investments to tackle critical areas of inclusion. The CDD portfolio
also constitutes a platform for engagement on aspects of governance, front-line service delivery,
inclusion, livelihoods, legal empowerment, violence, and fragility. In particular, work on
inclusion includes operations in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Lao that have developed strategies
to engage ethnic minorities and indigenous people. The Philippines’ outreach to marginalized
groups and Indonesia’s PNPM Peduli program have adopted an innovative approach to social
inclusion by supporting a range of specialized CSOs to strengthen and scale up their work with
groups living at the margins of society (street children, indigenous forest peoples, victims of
political violence, sex workers, etc.).

38.     EAP operations have also incorporated CE approaches in conflict and post-conflict
settings to improve project outcomes, and promote peace and stability. Through CDD
operations in conflict-affected areas of the Philippines, southern Thailand, Indonesia, and the
Solomon Islands, CE is particularly concerned with strengthening trust between citizens and the
state. Task teams’ experiences underscore the importance of information sharing, dialogue, and
citizen empowerment. In Indonesia, the Bank has acquired a wealth of experience in using CDD
platforms to deliver assistance to conflict-affected communities. Experience in post-conflict
Aceh included supporting civil society engagement in development planning, management of
public funds, and legal empowerment. The Bank also supports the development of a publicly
accessible violence dataset to help strengthen understanding and cooperation between
government and civil society, and thereby make more progress toward mitigating the adverse
effects of rapid economic, social, and political changes. In Myanmar, the Bank has contributed to

                                                                                                   121
the peace process by undertaking related analytical work and developing violence monitoring
systems.

                     Box A4.1. Shifting Gears: Bringing Accountability into CE

Cambodia. Bank support for CE was primarily established through the nationwide Rural Investment and
  Local Governance Project, in which 1,800 communes conducted annual participatory planning and
  operated a grievance redress system. A post-project review and political economy analysis in 2011
  noted that CE in the planning process was often tokenistic, and that the grievance redress mechanism
  (GRM) had little traction and credibility. A window of opportunity to enhance the consequence of CE
  in local-level development arose when the national committee responsible for local governance and
  local development harmonized and aligned donor projects. This created an impetus for an integrated
  platform/framework that would empower and engage citizens in key development processes that affect
  them, and linked well with the downward accountability vision of decentralization reformers.

   The landmark agreement between civil society and government on a Social Accountability Framework
   came about through an incremental, step-by-step approach. It builds on the results and lessons of three
   years of piloting through the Demand for Good Governance project, which helped clarify the space for
   social accountability in Cambodia and the areas where civil society and government could engage for
   development impact. The final version of the framework (which is now government policy) includes
   three substantive strategies: (a) improved local information and transparency, (b) open budgets, and
   (c) citizen monitoring of local administrations and basic services. In addition to prioritizing
   community facilitation, the framework defines complementary roles for both government (elected
   officials and service providers) and local civil society to meet objectives. The action needed by
   government, as well as by civil society, is presented in concrete terms, and the framework sets out
   dual, joint actions: government will generate data, and civil society will disseminate them;
   government will produce the budgets, and civil society actors will conduct budget literacy work;
   NGOs will conduct citizen monitoring (scorecard processes), and commune councils will see that
   action plans are agreed and carried out. The focus of the social accountability framework is
   multisectoral (it starts with local governments, health centers, and schools) in a rollout intended to
   reach 70 percent of rural districts in three to four years.

Myanmar. A key aspect of the National Community Driven Development Project (NCDDP) is the
  development of a comprehensive accountability framework to ensure that communities are identifying
  local interventions and funds are spent as intended. The project envisages a set of built-in checks and
  balances. The project accountability mechanisms and instruments, which are managed and carried out
  by staff, include (a) transparency and access to information, including the production and disclosure of
  project information and reporting; (b) a code of conduct for all project staff, including sanctions for
  noncompliance; (c) project monitoring and reporting, including project process oversight by township
  offices; and (d) procurement and financial management reviews and audits. These mechanisms are
  both ongoing and periodic. Under the umbrella of participatory beneficiary monitoring and oversight,
  the project also includes social accountability mechanisms and instruments: (a) transparency and
  access to information, including the village-level public display of all processes, decisions, budgets,
  and payments; (b) monitoring of project implementation by community subcommittees; (c) a GRM
  that allows the provision of feedback on noncompliance or complaints on any aspect of project
  decision-making or implementation; and (d) a “social audit” meeting that encourages the sharing of all
  project information and provides the opportunity for questions from community members. Given that
  all local stakeholders are new to these approaches in a new type of CDD project, the project design
  also envisages establishing a third-party monitoring process to check on project and social
  accountability mechanisms, and to provide an independent review/snapshot of project processes and
  outcomes.

                   b. Social accountability activities

39.      EAP has worked to enhance the quality of CE and the social accountability process.
There is increasing evidence of improved impacts when civil society efforts to bring about
accountability are linked to formal systems, and when government and civil society act together.
A key dimension in the approach to CE is fostering coalitions for change. Different actors bring
different dimensions and skills (citizens, NGOs, the press, watchdogs, and donors), and this
critical mass makes a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. The analytical findings on
voice and CE in Cambodia have now been operationalized through a social accountability
framework that involves state and non-state actors in coordinated activities aimed at enhancing
the quality and scope of CE in local service delivery and governance. Moving forward from
discrete participatory planning and grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) in CDD operations,
the framework includes a sequenced and blended set of mechanisms that includes open budgets,
access to (actionable) performance information, and citizen/beneficiary monitoring in local
governments, schools, and health centers (see Box A4.1). The EAP experience highlights the
importance of linking CE and social accountability with country systems to inform and empower
citizens to better engage in annual planning and budgeting processes, and to establish access and
working relationships with higher levels of government.

40.      This social accountability work has been increasingly embedded in the sectors.
Cross-sectoral collaboration has helped to enhance CE. For instance, Indonesia’s PNPM
Generasi Program highlights citizens’ involvement in planning, implementation, and oversight of
health, nutrition, and education services; and performance-based block grants encourage citizens,
service providers, and local governments to work together to address bottlenecks in local service
delivery. In Lao, China, Cambodia, and Myanmar, there are CE and social accountability
initiatives in operations in such sectors as health, education, urban (floating village
management), environmental protection, social protection, rural development, and agriculture. In
Timor Leste, the Bank’s Justice for the Poor Program has supported efforts to introduce social
audit/monitoring functions in the wake of decentralization efforts, to strengthen relationships at
the central level and local level (village). Linking grassroots efforts to the sector agenda is a
challenge in some countries.

                   c. Consulting with citizens and beneficiaries and collecting their feedback

41.     Finally, the EAP region has drawn on the environmental and social safeguards
components of its operations to engage in consultations with, and solicit feedback from,
beneficiaries and broader citizen groups that may be affected in any way. New efforts in
Vietnam and Lao aim to move beyond compliance to support the development and
implementation of domestic safeguards frameworks and strengthen national systems to manage
safeguards. In conjunction with a risk-profiling exercise, the EAP team is also working to build
country-specific capacity for effective CE. For example, in Vietnam and the Philippines, the
Bank is contributing to Centers of Learning that will host multidonor training programs to build
country capacity to manage social safeguards. In China, social reviews and safeguards are
supporting efforts to improve consultations and the participatory design of projects, and
enhancing complaints-handling mechanisms. In Myanmar, where in-depth knowledge on social
issues such as (legacy) land issues and ethnic minorities is still emerging, the CDD operation has
                                                                                              123
incorporated consultations with beneficiaries, grievance redress approaches, and mechanisms for
oversight and accountability (social audits, community scorecards, and third-party monitoring) to
strengthen the positive impact of community investments (see Box 4.1).

       2. Going Forward

42.     The EAP strategy for scaling up CE will be to expand and replicate efforts toward
systemic reform in client countries. The client engagement platform is already well developed
and will build on existing efforts. While this may mean fewer and smaller engagements, EAP is
now well positioned to move strategically to scale up CE. In Indonesia, the Law on Villages
ratified by Parliament in December 2013 incorporates key client engagement principles such as
participatory planning, community assemblies, social accountability, and community block-
grants. On the basis of this national law, citizens and communities can explore avenues to
actively participate in national development. Moreover, the institutionalization of PNPM gives
new impetus to the need to empower communities to access and use national accountability
systems, including legal and quasi-legal institutions such as courts, ombudsman, and public
information commissions, to channel and address grievances.

43.     EAP will continue strengthening CE through CDD operations. CDD projects are
transitioning from pilots to programs, or from programs to institutionalized country policy
(Indonesia). In this process, CE is not central just to Bank-financed operations, but also to the
community and local development efforts of governments in the region. Moreover, CDD projects
provide the primary platform for learning how to engage with citizens. Priority projects moving
forward are:
    • Indonesia: PNPM (2014-2017)
    • Philippines: KALAHI –CIDSS (2002-2014) and NCDDP (2014-2020)
    • Myanmar NCDDP (2013-2019)
    • Lao PRF (2011-2016).

44.     The EAP region intends to implement a CE strategy, with mechanisms that are not
tokenistic but are rooted in an understanding of context, and are more focused on inclusion
of women and vulnerable groups. To strengthen the links between CE initiatives and
government accountability structures to lend impetus to reform processes, task teams’ efforts
will be geared toward integrating demand- and supply-side activities through national programs
and work with multisector platforms. A central dimension of the facilitation/interface process is
the strengthening of civil society, including CSOs and NGOs. The quality of this engagement
will be informed by better understanding and use of vehicles for engagement, blended and
sequenced to suit the specific sector. As appropriate, ICT-based mechanisms will be used to
collect information and enhance opportunities for feedback from citizens.

45.     Work to enhance the quality of CE will not only occur in EAP’s CDD programs but
will focus on multiple sectors. The social accountability work in EAP is a critical piece of the
innovations in CE. Cross-sectoral collaboration, particularly with regard to front-line service
delivery, will be a priority. It will involve efforts to (a) improve services for all by ensuring that
they are responsive to local needs; (b) make the services/infrastructure more inclusive of women
and vulnerable groups; and (c) empower citizens and communities so that they become more
informed users/beneficiaries, more able to voice their needs and concerns, individually and
collectively. In this regard, based on the experience of PNPM Generasi and global efforts to
                                                                                                  124
improve local-level service delivery, Bank operations in Indonesia are increasingly geared
toward supporting the Government in improving services delivered on the front lines (i.e., by the
teachers and health workers who interact directly with rural community members in community
clinics, schools, and other local facilities). Recognizing that the myriad causes of basic service
delivery failures are not confined to a single sector or agency, Bank operations will focus on the
front-line facility, the set of priority services that this facility is expected to deliver, and the
people the facility is expected to serve. Therefore, priority projects will include the following:

   •   Cambodia: Social Accountability Framework, programmatic nationwide subnational
       rollout, multisector (health, education, local government);
   •   Indonesia: PNPM Generasi, programmatic nationwide rollout, multisector;
   •   China: social risk management in investment programs; farmers’ cooperatives;
   •   Solomon Islands: community governance, grievance management, justice work;
   •   Vanuatu: natural resource governance, Fair Land Dealings Project.
46.    To support this multisectoral approach, the EAP team intends to complete the
sector analysis of its project portfolio to profile and plan the design and implementation of
CE. A review of 50 projects in three countries has enabled the team to document how various
CE mechanisms have been used (i.e., whether they have been designed, implemented, tracked, or
budgeted). The remainder of this dataset will be completed in collaboration with country teams.

47.     Moving forward, the EAP team will strengthen country systems for safeguards--
which implicitly includes beneficiary monitoring. The shift from compliance checks to built-
in/integrated thinking about “safeguard” issues is central to Bank business, a core that needs to
be strengthened. The region has positive experience in Vietnam and Lao on capacity building
and mainstreaming and plans to develop its strategy around the lessons learned. To this end, it
will support specialized centers in Indonesia and the Pacific and will formulate a framework
agreement with donors to support EAP governments’ efforts to strengthen national systems for
safeguards. In China, the Bank team has provided training for country consultants and project
implementation units as well as local government staff engaged in safeguards. The team will also
build on current efforts to build multi-stakeholder platforms that create coalitions of change.


 C. Europe and Central Asia
48.     CE is not a new approach for Europe and Central Asia (ECA). Many countries in
ECA recognize the need to strengthen beneficiary feedback, not only to improve government
effectiveness but also to support inclusive growth and stability. ECA has a strong potential to
improve CE across its portfolio. The percentage of projects reporting on beneficiary feedback
has increased 14 points from FY13 (29 percent) to FY14 (43 percent). Today 88 percent of
projects refer to beneficiary feedback in the PAD.

49.     ECA has taken a gradual and targeted approach to fostering CE in its portfolio. To
understand the nature and scope of CE in ECA, it is important to acknowledge the heterogeneity
of the region, the legacy of the past, and the nature of the contract between citizens and the state.




                                                                                                 125
       1. Common Legacy, Great Heterogeneity

50.     Despite a common legacy, there is a great variation in the nature and level of voice
and accountability in ECA. Social services and infrastructure were well developed under the
communist regimes that many ECA countries experienced, and citizens expect functioning
services. However, decades of centralized decision-making, feedback-deficient environments,
and marginally responsive governance can result in a “low expectations” culture, characterized
by a citizenry less likely to complain (World Bank, 2014a). The service delivery entry point is
often considered a more legitimate, less politicized, and less threatening domain of citizen-
government interaction. However, there is great diversity among countries regarding CE (see
Figure A4.1).

        2. ECA Portfolio Review on CE

51.     In FY14 ECA undertook a portfolio assessment of CE practices to establish a
baseline for achieving beneficiary feedback in 100 percent of projects by FY18, and to compile
useful lessons for the future. The stocktaking used quantitative and qualitative approaches to
document the extent and range of CE approaches in the ECA investment lending portfolio. The
review of 212 active projects in the portfolio revealed that for 84 percent of projects, beneficiary
feedback activities are described in the PADs or Project Operation Manuals. However, only 38
percent of the projects have beneficiary feedback indicators in their results frameworks.

52.     The CE tools used in ECA are very specific. Focus group discussions, customer
satisfaction surveys, and GRMs represent about 73 percent of the tools deployed, while CDD
approaches and participatory monitoring represent only 14 percent (see Figure A4.2).

53.      Beneficiary feedback and CE levels differ significantly among the CMUs and the
Global Practices (GPs) (see Figures A4.3 and A4.4). The prevalence of beneficiary feedback
activities in the portfolio is relatively even across CMUs, except in the Turkey country program.
The distribution of beneficiary feedback and CE mechanisms varies among GPs. The practices
with the highest prevalence of CE activities in the portfolio are those that have more immediate
beneficiaries: Agriculture, Education, Health, Social Protection and Labor, Governance, Water,
and the Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practices. Portfolios that typically intervene
at the national, regulatory, and/or infrastructure levels—such as those of the Finance and
Markets, Poverty, Macroeconomics and Fiscal, and Energy Global Practices—score significantly
lower on beneficiary feedback (BF) and CE activities or the corresponding indicators in the
results framework.

54.     The structure of the ECA portfolio (large infrastructure and service delivery
projects and few CDD projects) favors beneficiary feedback over CE. Mechanisms that
potentially give beneficiaries and citizens a greater stake in decision-making are much less
frequent (2-7 percent of all mechanisms) than mechanisms seeking beneficiary feedback through
consultations, customer satisfaction surveys, and GRMs (respectively, 35 percent, 20 percent,
and 18 percent of the total number of mechanisms employed). However, in some instances, CE is
deemed useful to establish trust beyond the scope of the project. A small portfolio of CDD
projects (Kyrgyz Republic, Azerbaijan) has demonstrated the value of community involvement
as a platform for engagement on aspects of governance, front-line service delivery, inclusion,
and livelihoods.

55.     The review revealed the relevance of social safeguards as an entry point for CE
activities. Of the projects in the active ECA portfolio, 35 percent triggered OP 4.12, Involuntary
Resettlement, and all of these projects have beneficiary feedback mechanisms, particularly
                                                                                                                                                             128
GRMs. However, those GRMs rarely apply to the project as a whole and usually remain
restricted to resettlement. Effective GRMs can help both mitigate risk and manage expectations
around projects, but they can also greatly help advance project implementation. For instance, the
Odra River Basin Flood Protection project in Poland involved the resettlement of 161 families. A
GRM was designed to be managed at ministry level. Following strong opposition to relocation
from local communities, the GRM was assigned to the local mayor, who enjoys the trust of the
community. Complaints are now dealt with in a more timely, flexible, and transparent manner.
The improved GRM has supported the lengthy and complex consultation and negotiation process
that has culminated in communities finally agreeing to the resettlement.

         3. Pilot Approaches

56.    Over the last decade, pilots on governance and CSO engagement have taken place in
ECA. Since 2007, under the Governance Partnership Facility (GPF), studies and activities related
to governance and accountability in public finances, health, education, legal rights and closing
the feedback loop through an ombudsman, service delivery, and infrastructure have been
supported in Albania, Armenia, Croatia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Russia, Tajikistan,
Ukraine, and Uzbekistan (see Box A4.2). In Tajikistan, activities focused on supporting greater
CE in the budget process, and on improving the capacity of the Parliament, media, and citizens
to access and analyze budget information. In Turkey, the GPF grant component provided an
assessment of the Parliament’s oversight role in the budget cycle. The grant also enabled
examination of a gap analysis in relation to public finance reform.

              Box A4.2. GPF Example: Expanding Space for Local Accountability in Perm Krai

In 2010-2012, a GPF-supported project was implemented in cooperation with the Ombudsman of Perm Krai by the
Nicolaas Witsen Foundation (the Netherlands), with GRANY and other local NGOs, in four municipalities of Perm
Krai: Okhansk, Suksun, Kizel, and Kosa. The project became a milestone on the path towards e-development of
local accountability and facilitating citizens’ access to better public services. The key result of the project is the
transformation of a number of district libraries into unique communication platforms: meeting points and
information and advice centers for the local community, NGOs, and municipal staff. The project tested new
technologies for citizen outreach and public participation in local governance (such as public hearings, citizen
surveys, and “upgrading” sites of local administrations), as well as mediation for resolving local conflicts. In
addition, the project helped to create a unique troubleshooting technology that allows interaction between citizens of
Perm Krai and relevant authorities on the information and communication platform “Street Journal.” Another
important result of the project is “We act together,” – a web-based interactive platform for citizens, NGOs, and
officials.

57.     Of the 39 countries that to date have opted into the Global Partnership for Social
Accountability (GPSA) initiative, five are in ECA (Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic,
Moldova, and Tajikistan). In Moldova and Tajikistan CSOs have been awarded grants through
the first two calls for proposals. In Moldova, the GPSA is supporting monitoring of the
performance of hospital and health care centers through beneficiary feedback mechanisms to
ensure that the planned health reforms and performance-based financing will become more
transparent and patient-centered. In Tajikistan, the GPSA is supporting Oxfam Tajikistan to
strengthen the capacity of water associations to monitor the quality of water and sanitation.

        4. Targeted Technical Assistance to Support CE

58.     Over the past five years, ECA has developed a series of targeted technical assistance
projects (TAs) to support CE in projects. For instance, in Belarus and Georgia, TAs have
identified CE mechanisms that can improve the efficiency of municipal services. In Moldova and
Armenia, TAs have examined options to mainstream CE in rural services and the forestry
sectors. In Russia, the World Bank implemented TAs and a RAS to support the demand side of
open data and open government initiatives. In southeast Europe, municipal social accountability
audits were conducted in five cities in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and
Macedonia to encourage better access to municipal services through innovative citizen feedback
mechanisms (hotlines, crowd-sourcing, citizen charters, etc.). These TAs were all closely
coordinated with World Bank-supported operations to provide relevant operational
recommendations to scale up CE activities in projects.

        5. CE in Country Dialogue: the Central Asia CE Strategy

59.      In Central Asia, where CE has been integrated to the level of the Country
Partnership Framework (CPF), a systematic screening of the portfolio was conducted in
FY14. At the same time, the dialogue was reinforced internally (between GPs) and externally
with some governments and civil society on CE. For instance, in Tajikistan, the dialogue was
built on an earlier GPF initiative to engage with government counterparts and CSOs on
governance recommendations for the new CPF (FY15-18). Similarly, CE and governance have
emerged as central issues in the Kyrgyz Republic’s Country Partnership Strategy, and several
Bank-supported projects include community-driven approaches and governance dimensions.
World Bank teams working on governance, social accountability, and CE coordinated the launch
of a knowledge platform and established external partnerships with key CSOs. A joint work
program was developed in FY14 with two regional CSO umbrella organizations—ARGO and
Social and Ecological Fund—and a series of trainings and knowledge-sharing events on CE has
been organized for Bank staff and clients and stakeholders (including state officials and non-state
actors).

                     Box A4.3. Electricity Supply Reliability and Accountability Project

The Electricity Supply Accountability and Reliability Improvement Project (FY15 pipeline) aims to improve the
reliability of electricity supply in three target areas and strengthen the governance of the electricity company’s
(Severelektro) operations. The project supports the strengthening of consumer feedback and the company’s GRM
through the installation of a Management Information System (MIS). The MIS will help the company gather
accurate information about electricity use and inform customers about electricity outages through accessible
channels. The MIS will also document and track the complaints received about the service and response times, and
will help strengthen the customer hotline functions of the utility’s service centers. A customer satisfaction
survey—to be conducted before project effectiveness, six months after the incorporation of the MIS, and at project
closure—will measure the evolution of customers’ perception of the service. One of the core indicators of the
project results framework measures progress toward improving customer satisfaction in the project area through
targeted surveys (i.e., percentage improvements compared to the baseline).




                                                                                                              130
       6. Key Bottlenecks to Effectiveness

60.    Despite this considerable progress, ECA still faces several challenges:

       •   Many country contexts are not conducive to fostering beneficiary feedback and CE
           because of (i) the closed nature of the polities, and (ii) citizens’ limited trust in their
           ability to affect change.
       •   Counterpart agencies, project implementation units, and Bank staff have limited
           capacity to design and implement beneficiary feedback and CE mechanisms.
       •   Lack of resources and time: (i) many clients do not want to finance CE initiatives
           from loans and prefer to use grant funding (except for less ambitious mechanisms,
           such as customer satisfaction surveys); (ii) the pressure to deliver projects in very
           short timeframes leads to poor ownership and poor-quality CE activities.
       •   Not all planned project or monitoring activities are fully carried out. Discrepancies
           were noted between beneficiary feedback and CE mechanisms at the design and
           implementation stages. For instance, a GRM may be created but not used in practice.

       7. Going Forward

61.   ECA’s strategy for scaling up CE will be to systematically support beneficiary
feedback mechanisms in the pipeline portfolio while promoting more comprehensive
approaches in select client countries.

               a. Beneficiary feedback

62.     Beneficiary feedback mechanisms will be systematically mainstreamed in the
pipeline portfolio by ensuring that CE is considered during social assessments and project
preparation and monitored during implementation. This will entail integrating CE
mechanisms into the design and results frameworks of Bank projects; prioritizing compliance
with applicable safeguards requirements for grievance redress; and piloting beneficiary feedback
mechanisms for priority projects, particularly for large service delivery projects in key sectors.
Cross-GP collaboration will be a priority to ensure that the CE strategy’s scope and mechanisms
are better understood and more systematically used to improve project implementation, service
delivery efficiency, and citizen feedback.

63.     Learning lessons from the most frequently used CE tools. ECA will assess current
customer satisfaction surveys and GRMs to evaluate their quality and identify best practices. In
collaboration with the CE community of practice, an operational toolkit will be prepared to help
task teams implement these tools more effectively. Specific attention will be given to the ECA
context (middle-income countries, closed polities, legacy from the past). Findings and lessons
learned will be disseminated across GPs and CMUs.

64.     Reinforcing the safeguards beneficiary feedback loops and country systems. The
safeguard reform provides an opportunity to shift from compliance checks to more integrated
beneficiary feedback systems. There is a need for systematic relationship- building to ensure that
clients not only comply with requirements, but also understand the value of those requirements
with respect to meeting objectives. Special attention will be given to ensuring that minor
                                                                                                  131
complaints are addressed in a timely manner before they escalate, and to providing support to
agencies regarding beneficiary feedback mechanisms and reporting.

65.    Support ECA staff’s awareness of and capacity in CE. FY15 and FY16 will be critical
to develop the awareness and capacity of staff across the new GPs and CMUs on CE
mechanisms. As part of these efforts, systematic knowledge-sharing events, guidance notes on
CE strategy and tools, and careful monitoring of progress by CMUs and GPs will be essential.
ECA is involved in the CE community of practice and will support the creation of a knowledge
platform involving units working on CE, as well as external stakeholders, to share best practices
on CE. Those efforts will be carried out jointly with the other regions to ensure cross-regional
learning.

               b. A more comprehensive approach on CE in selected countries

66.     Lessons learned from the Central Asia CE strategy provide useful insights on how
to better integrate CE in dialogues and programs with clients. CMUs will provide knowledge
exchange events to inform Bank staff and clients about the CE strategy and tools and to address
country-specific context and programs. Upcoming Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs)
should include a diagnosis of citizens’ agency and voice and their ability to influence social,
economic, and political domains. CPFs can also provide opportunities to identify specific
programs for citizen feedback. Finally, efforts will be made to engage civil society, including
CSOs and local institutions, to reinforce the interface processes. The use of ICT will also be
considered and used where appropriate to create new opportunities for transparency and
beneficiary feedback.

67.     The CE strategy and mechanisms adopted should be rooted in a solid context
analysis and should give systematic attention to the inclusion of vulnerable groups (women,
ethnic minorities, youth, etc.). For this purpose, more efforts will be needed to link CE
strategies with government accountability structures and to lodge the in reform processes, as well
as to systematically incorporate CE into projects and engage with beneficiaries during project
design and implementation.


D. Latin America and the Caribbean
68.     Compared with other regions, Latin America and the Caribbean (LCR) has an
environment that is generally conducive to civic engagement. Its population is both highly
urbanized and highly connected: 98 percent of Latin Americans receive mobile phone signals.
LCR is one of the fastest-growing social media markets—in 2012 it had 168 million Facebook
users out of a population of roughly 581 million, 47 percent more than in 2011. On the whole, in
the past 20 years the region has enjoyed substantial improvements in civil liberties and freedom
of association, including the treatment of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). But since
2007, there has been some erosion in freedom of association, and in some countries citizens who
speak out risk retribution. At the same time, the region hosts a significant indigenous and Afro-
descendent population that is more likely to be marginalized and to live in remote rural areas.
Finally, in spite of significant gains in poverty reduction and a 50 percent growth in the middle
class between 2003 and 2009, trust in government at both the national and municipal levels is
stagnating or declining; this situation may stem from the initially high expectations following the
                                                                                               132
emergence of more robust democratic regimes in the 1990s, and it may also be due to the
availability of alternative sources of data (via social media) outside of government. Thus there is
scope for increasing direct feedback from citizens, rather than the parallel conversations that can
occur with growing social media. 1

          1. Experience and Lessons Learned

69.      In recent years, the World Bank’s involvement in CE in LCR has focused on
project-level consultations or participatory mechanisms (Boxes A4.4 and A4.5) and, in some
countries (Dominican Republic, Honduras, Colombia, Bolivia), more intensified approaches to
engaging citizens and civil society in social audit and third-party monitoring across a number of
operations in the portfolio. Some countries’ systems and legal frameworks already involve CE
(e.g., participatory budgeting at the municipal level in Brazil, which has been linked to more pro-
poor spending patterns). In other countries, legal frameworks exist but have not been fully
implemented to lead to inclusive engagement (for example, the participatory budgeting law in
the Dominican Republic). At the same time, a recent review of the use of grievance redress in
Bank operations involving social safeguards found that almost three-quarters of a sample of
projects triggering OP 4.10, Indigenous People, had either a brief or no mention of a grievance
redress mechanism in project documents, suggesting that the GRM was not being actively used
as a management tool. 2 Only about 44 percent of a sample of projects triggering OP 4.12,
Involuntary Resettlement, could show evidence of a well-functioning GRM.

70.     The three most common types of CE innovations used by Bank-supported
operations in LCR are (a) ICT-enabled geo-referenced citizen feedback platforms, which are
increasingly of interest to clients, to leverage more traditional and at times cumbersome forms of
paper-based feedback; (b) creation of national-level observatories and participatory policy
reform processes; and (c) discrete social audit by CSOs.

To date, the approach to scaling up CE in LCR has focused on identifying areas where
there are (a) positive impacts on development outcomes, and (b) possibilities to benefit
from economies of scale/replicability. With the establishment of the GPs, it is possible that
economies of scale will be manifested across regional boundaries, as well. Thus, for example, in
terms of sector-focused models (versus policies), Bank-supported operations have continued to
develop ICT-enabled platforms for the road transport sector (the largest share of the LCR
portfolio) in Uruguay, the urban transportation sector in Quito (including feedback on
safeguards-related issues in addition to service delivery issues), a CDD-type rural development
operation in Bolivia, and the energy sector in the Dominican Republic. Early lessons are already
being shared with similar operations across countries (e.g., replication of the energy platform in
Jamaica and in the water sector in Honduras, and sharing models for transport from Uruguay
with Argentina), and are informing work in other regions, such as ECA. At the policy level, the
Dominican Republic has emerged as one of the more active countries in this area, supporting a
participatory anticorruption coalition and a Caribbean Growth Forum, and pursuing open and
ICT-enabled procurement.

    This may stem in part from the focus on many other safeguards-related issues at project design, and in the over-triggering of
    OP 4.10. The higher percentage for OP 4.12 is still far from ideal.
                                                                                                                            133
       2. Going Forward

71.    In FY14, LCR initiated the development of a regional CE action plan for FY14–
FY16, staff and client training on both ICT-enabled and more traditional CE techniques,
and preparation of the building blocks for more widespread use of CE techniques. The final
form and targets in the strategy will depend on the resources available and on consultations with
the newly formed GPs. The draft strategy focuses on the following areas:

   (a) Support to mainstreaming CE in projects with clearly identified beneficiaries, for which
       integration of feedback is likely to be critical to program/project results and which offer
       economies of scale based on their prevalence and size in the Bank portfolio. For example,
       urban water, energy, and municipal services often depend on consumers for cost
       recovery, maintenance of community infrastructure, and conservation; thus water and
       energy utilities that are equipped with tools to systematically integrate and respond to
       consumer feedback—or that have a culture of service to citizens—are more likely to be
       able to meet these goals. Along similar lines, large-scale urban transport operations
       depend on cost recovery and also involve significant construction in high-density areas;
       thus they require systems to quickly identify and address citizen grievances and also to
       ensure a client-oriented service once under operation. For decentralized rural CDD
       programs, the burden of supervision and risk of elite capture is minimized when end-
       beneficiaries are empowered to provide independent feedback. For conditional cash
       transfer programs, end-user feedback provides valuable insights into program
       effectiveness.

       An integral part of this process will be to help clients more clearly define and publish
       standards of service delivery. By end-FY15, the objective will be to have at least one
       scalable CE model for energy, water, transport, urban, and social protection (assuming
       funding is available). Funding considerations for FY15 and FY16 will also determine
       support from the virtual CE team to proposals from among a list of priority projects
       identified during earlier regional consultations.

   (b) Compliance with consultations and grievance redress systems associated with World
       Bank social safeguards. Three actions can address this deficit: (i) developing an app that
       can be offered to clients to get feedback from affected peoples under OP 4.12;
       (ii) experimenting with CE mechanisms targeting indigenous communities that have
       specific needs; and (iii) reinforcing staff capacity and time to ensure that such
       mechanisms are operational. Each year, about 30 projects trigger OP 4.10 and about 25
       trigger OP 4.12. The priority will be to reach functional grievance redress and feedback
       systems (including more comprehensive institutional descriptions) for a majority of new
       operations triggering OP 4.12 by FY16. Where possible, it would be useful to integrate
       these grievance redress and feedback systems into platforms that solicit feedback on the
       services being provided.

   (c) SCD/CAS/CPS. Teams will collaborate with the Southern Cone, Andean, and other
       CMUs to identify upstream entry points where CE is likely to be central to program
       results through diagnostics carried out as part of the CPS/CAS/SCDs in FY15. The region
       will also focus on further developing the methodology for analyzing CE in the SCD for
       Costa Rica.
                                                                                              134
    (d) Taking stock to understand the baseline on CE in LCR. A more formalized survey will
        be used to establish a more systematic, LCR-specific baseline on CE.

    (e) Capacity building. One of the greatest challenges will be how to quickly make
        information on CE activities accessible, comprehensive, and user-friendly by using both
        more traditional, low-tech mechanisms (e.g., community scorecards) and higher-tech,
        ICT-enabled tools. During FY15 LCR is planning to set up a Spark page, establish
        building blocks (e.g., terms of reference) for the design of effective CE activities, and
        provide training sessions for staff on ICT-enabled CE and the use of community
        scorecards. With the creation of the GP structure, this regional Spark Page is being
        consolidated into a Bank-wide Spark page.

                 Box A4.4. The Use of Citizen Engagement to Shift Incentives in Energy

With high levels of clientelism in bill payment combined with years of consumers making illegal
connections, the Dominican Republic’s electric utility was not receiving adequate payments and therefore
did not consider itself accountable to provide a quality service. Consumers did not feel obliged to pay,
given the abysmal service levels; as soon as networks were rehabilitated, they had little incentive to
refrain from vandalizing new meters. An effort was needed to find a model that could reverse this
downward spiral.

Accordingly, with the Energy Sector Rehabilitation Project, the World Bank supported the country in
creating incentives both for consumers to pay, and for the utility to begin to focus on citizens as clients.
Community monitoring committees comprising diverse members from both major political parties and
consumers were offered 24-hour service if they could help to increase payment levels and reduce
vandalism in their geographic circuits. Since the results framework for this project included an indicator
on consumer satisfaction, surveys to gauge levels of satisfaction with the service were carried out before,
during, and after rehabilitation. In addition, because surveys showed that community committees could
reach only limited numbers of households, an ICT-enabled citizen feedback pilot, VozElectrica, was
piloted that allows neighbors to observe and comment on feedback/complaints from their localities, which
are continuously accessible to all. For the first circuits whose rehabilitation was completed, cost recovery
increased and citizen satisfaction with the hours of service increased from 8 percent to 95 percent.

      Box A4.5. Using Citizen Engagement to Promote More Participatory Policy Formulation

Under a multisectoral SWAp operation in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, the team used a
program called “The Government Asks” to crowd-source citizen feedback on policy solutions via
web, mobile phones, Facebook, vans equipped with Internet access, and face-to-face meetings to
elaborate policy proposals. Most recently, citizens were invited to co-design solutions to address health
challenges; over 1,300 citizen proposals were generated, and more than 120,000 votes were cast on their
prioritization. This contributed to an increase in the allocation for primary health care.

E. Middle East and North Africa
71.     Through the mass protests that swept several countries in the Middle East and
North Africa (MNA), citizens united across ideological, demographic, religious, and ethnic
lines to demand greater voice and participation and an end to elite capture and political
and economic marginalization. The Arab Spring has provided an opportunity for structural
change in this regard and has positioned citizen participation in policy-making processes at the
center of the regional agenda. Even in transition countries, space has been created for bringing
citizens into the policy dialogue. This has fundamentally changed the nature of the opportunities
for CE in MNA and the way the World Bank engages with its clients.

    1. Experience and Lessons Learned

72.    In the midst of the post-Arab Spring transitions, MNA countries are trying to
respond to citizens’ demand for greater voice and participation in policy reforms, service
delivery, and development programs. In this respect, the World Bank MNA region has
adopted CE as a new development approach in priority operations, seeking to incorporate citizen
feedback and input in policy reform programs and public service provision.

73.     The MNA initiative, “Mainstreaming Citizen Engagement in MENA” is one of the
World Bank’s flagship initiatives in this regard. The main objective of this initiative is to
identify CE entry points for MNA priority operations and adopt CE mechanisms that are tailored
to the country context and to the sector-specific issue(s) being addressed by the operation. In
close collaboration with all MNA CMUs, sector managers, and TTLs, MNA has identified 42
priority operations for FY14 and FY15 in which CE mechanisms are being integrated or
strengthened.

74.     The priority operations for this initiative were selected on the basis of (a) potential to
integrate and scale up citizen feedback mechanisms into country systems for more sustainability,
and (b) direct impact on citizens and the ability for a critical mass of beneficiaries to provide
feedback throughout project implementation. These priority operations have been endorsed by
the country directors. The pilot for the initiative is implemented through an inclusive process
across sectors and CMUs in MNA and in coordination with different units Bankwide. A CE team
for MNA, comprising representatives from these units, has established a roster of engagement
leaders, met jointly with task teams, and nominated an engagement leader for each priority
operation to support TTLs in identifying CE entry points and designing tailored CE mechanisms
in the project. Engagement leaders and task teams interact regularly to share updates and
experiences, discuss bottlenecks, and address challenges collaboratively.

75.     The MNA Citizen Engagement Briefing Note and Guidance Note for Mainstreaming
Citizen Engagement have been useful to provide technical support to task teams across
sectors. The MNA internal Engagement Web-portal is also updated regularly to raise awareness
on CE activities in the region and provide resources produced by teams across sectors and
departments Bankwide. Additionally, to raise awareness of the MNA region’s efforts to integrate
CE in priority operations and solicit feedback, the MNA CE Team participated in various Bank
events, including the 2013 Civil Society Forum’s session on “Engaging with Citizens for Greater
Development Impact” and the 2014 Social Development Forum and Citizen Engagement
Workshop at the Spring Meetings.
                                                                                              136
76.     MNA teams working with counterparts have defined several entry points and
designed mechanisms for “listening” to citizens’ voices and incorporating their feedback
into policy reform programs and service delivery projects. These mechanisms include
consultations, third-party monitoring, participatory decision-making, and GRMs. Examples of
projects from the MNA region’s portfolio that have incorporated such mechanisms follow:

   •   The Yemen CSO support project integrates a system of user feedback and information
       collection based on a network of help-desks to track and monitor transparency and ease
       of use of the online and offline CSO registration process to be introduced under the
       project.

   •   The municipal solid waste sector development policy loan in Morocco includes a two-
       pronged consultation process, a communication strategy, and the introduction of Citizen
       Report Cards. The consultation process was highly effective and resulted in incorporating
       several specific actions into the policy matrix, including adoption of the Citizens Report
       Card pilot by the client which will be implemented in four municipalities.

   •   The Yemen Social Fund for Development took a proactive approach in consulting with
       local populations to design projects to ensure that the needs of the poor and marginalized
       are accounted for. It actively solicited citizen participation during project preparation,
       reviving traditional forms of community-level decision-making in issuing municipal-level
       grants. The Yemen Social Fund for Development IV is integrating various CE tools in
       two or three urban areas to conduct participatory planning.

   •   The Djibouti Second Urban Poverty Reduction project integrated CE mechanisms in the
       project design to foster community voice and ownership through geo-referenced citizen
       reports on infrastructure, neighborhood committee reports on community activities
       funded by the project, and an effective GRM. These CE mechanisms aim to improve
       responsiveness to residents’ needs for improved access to urban services.

   •   Tunisia Urban Development and Local Governance project To strengthen governance
       through participation, transparency and accountability, a national web portal will be
       established to serve as a transparency platform, providing real-time information about
       financial transfers from central government to local governments (past, approved and
       planned). In parallel, the project will support the creation of venues for citizen
       participation at the local level. Municipalities will implement a participatory planning
       process, in which citizens will be consulted regarding the overall budget allocation at
       local level. They will also launch a participatory budgeting process that will allow
       citizens to decide on the allocation of a portion of the investment budget of the local
       government.

   •   Through the Morocco Youth Entrepreneurship Training Project, an e-platform was
       developed allowing for better monitoring of training and coaching activities across a
       large number of training facilities operated by different implementing partners across the
       country. The monitoring platform will be complemented by a SMS tool that will allow
       collection of beneficiary satisfaction data with regard to training activities as well as
       performance data on the micro-enterprises led by youth entrepreneurs.
                                                                                             137
   •   Egypt Labor-Intensive Public Works Additional Financing seeks to enhance the GRM
       at the village level and standardize the methods to collect citizen feedback on
       infrastructure service provision, operations and maintenance, and infrastructure usage to
       assess citizen satisfaction. A formal complaints mechanism will be established to
       benchmark and monitor bottlenecks at the local level.

   •   West Bank and Gaza Municipal Development Project II provides for integrating CE
       mechanisms to strengthen the implementation/functioning of citizen service centers and
       one-stop shops to enhance citizen satisfaction. It also introduces an e-governance
       initiative to improve the responsiveness and quality of public services for a larger number
       of citizens. The initiative will support four pilot municipalities, using an Internet-based
       system for delivering services and information to citizens. It will promote knowledge
       sharing; enhance awareness of and accountability in service delivery (specifically e-
       licensing, e-participation, and e-payment); and increase revenue generation for different
       public agencies.

    2. Going Forward

77.     The MNA team will continue to integrate CE mechanisms in project design to
enhance citizen feedback throughout project preparation and implementation, with the goal
of impacting country systems when the country and sector context allows it. MNA’s efforts in
this regard will continue across sectors during FY15, with the aim of incrementally integrating
CE in all its operations by 2018.

78.     Technical support to task teams will also continue through a series of clinics and
capacity-building sessions. During FY15 the team intends to focus specifically on fragile and
conflict-affected situations. Institution-building in transition contexts, and service delivery, are
important areas where the integration of CE mechanisms contributes to reducing social tensions
and to building public institutions’ legitimacy. Transition country contexts also provide a
window of opportunity to impact country systems.


F. South Asia
79.     The South Asia region (SAR) has a wealth of experiences with CE, many linked to
decentralization processes, access to information laws, management of public resources, and
service delivery at the local level. Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan have mandated
decentralization by law and have used social accountability mechanisms to improve local
governance. Most countries have adopted right-to-information laws, and civic groups and
governments have increasingly come to realize the value of timely and relevant information for
policy processes and outcomes. Laws such as India’s recently ratified Service Delivery Act focus
on the establishment of Citizen Charters, which inform the citizens about their rights, and local
governments and their municipal corporations have also adopted citizens’ charters. However, the
transition to decentralization or devolution is fraught with difficulty. Governments are
constrained by bureaucratic procedures, political interference, limited authority, lack of

                                                                                                138
accountability of service providers, and insufficient financial resources, while civil society
grapples with inadequate capacity to engage with citizens.


       1. Experience and Lessons Learned

In recent years, SAR has provided significant support to strengthen local governance and
empower communities to promote accountable service delivery and demand better
governance. Project Governance and Accountability Action Plans (GAAP) have strengthened
accountability mechanisms and promoted greater transparency and stronger grievance redress,
and helped increase awareness of people’s rights to know and seek information and make
government institutions accountable. Initiatives to strengthen CE include support for right to
information, use of social accountability tools and beneficiary involvement in projects, use of
grievance redress mechanisms, empowerment of communities, and participation in public
financial management.

80.     In Afghanistan, the World Bank is scaling up the integration of CE across its
portfolio. Since Afghanistan has been in conflict for over 30 years, the CE agenda has been
driven in many ways by the level of fragility and the weakness of state structures, both of which
have necessitated closer engagement of citizens and communities. These factors also determine
how the Bank engages with citizens in rural and urban areas, given the different tribes, gender
aspects, traditional structures, elite/power influence and displacement issues. Use of community
monitoring and third party supervisory agents has been important to facilitate this engagement.

The large-scale use of third-party supervisory agents across five national programs that use ICT
tools has been complemented by local monitoring in several projects to ensure immediate
reporting during the construction phase. First piloted for the Irrigation Rehabilitation
Development Project, local monitoring enabled the assessment of some 13 irrigation canal
construction projects, affecting about 20 communities in 9 provinces. Furthermore, local
monitoring has helped to ensure better social inclusion. Other projects including the National
Solidarity Program (NSP) have introduced voluntary community monitoring of its sub-projects
through citizen/community involvement during project planning, implementation and
monitoring. These projects have also succeeded in increasing women’s participation by making
incremental policy changes such as setting targets for women’s representation in community
development councils, school management committees etc., and the number of female office
bearers in community councils. The Bank has also supported the Ministry of Mines and
Petroleum to pilot a small social accountability project in the Aynak copper mine to foster trust
between the ministry, mining company and affected communities. There is an ongoing policy
dialogue regarding Community Development Agreements in the extractive industries, which has
also contributed to the recently amended Minerals Law.

81.     In Bangladesh, the current Country Assistance Strategy mainstreams attention to
good governance and citizen participation. For example, at the program level, the World Bank
initiated third-party monitoring by Bangladeshi CSOs to assess progress against CAS results
targets. This was the first time that the World Bank had opened its CAS to public scrutiny, with
the official endorsement of the Government of Bangladesh. This approach was intensified in
2012 through implementation of the Triple “S” Strategy, which aims to strengthen fiduciary


                                                                                             139
safeguards, build country systems for good governance, and let the sunshine in, through
increased transparency and use of domestic accountability mechanisms.

At the project level, Governance and Accountability Action Plans are customized to
sector/project circumstances, with the composition of “safeguards”, “systems” and “sunshine”
tailored to specific needs. A wide range of mechanisms to elicit citizen feedback are now
incorporated in project design, including community scorecards, social audits, focus groups, and
third party monitoring, among other social accountability tools. In a number of projects,
technology and social media are also being used to facilitate citizen engagement. Within
government, support is provided to implementing agencies to help them to comply with the
national Right to Information Act and proactively share information with beneficiaries.

The Bank is also working directly with Bangladeshi CSOs to promote civic engagement.
For example, the Citizen Action for Results, Transparency and Accountability (CARTA) project
applies social accountability tools in the context of third-party monitoring in five ongoing Bank-
supported projects in Bangladesh. This citizen-monitoring intervention is meant to improve the
quality of service delivery, support local CSOs in promoting citizen capacity to respond to
emerging issues, access information, identify vulnerabilities to corruption, and identify
unintended consequences, by tapping into the knowledge of local communities. Additionally,
Bangladesh was one of the first countries to opt into the World Bank’s Global Partnership for
Social Accountability (GPSA). The GPSA engagement in Bangladesh is focused on
strengthening citizen engagement in the open budgeting process at the lowest level of local
government and monitoring how participatory budgeting is operating in practice. Two NGOs,
CARE and the Manusher Jonno Foundation (MJF), received grants in the past year and work
began in 2014.

82.      In India, the Bank has supported, via a range of different sectors, activities focused on
citizen engagement with a strong emphasis on furthering inclusion and building on the
pioneering Right to Information movement. The Government of India has promoted several
landmark legislations that promote greater citizen engagement through the Right to Information
Act, Right to Employment (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), Right
to Education, Right to Food Security Act. The Right to Public Service Act has been enacted at
the national level as well as in several states. Enactment of the Right to Information Act has
encouraged several million requests for information disclosure from citizens, employees, users
and civil society each year, and is proving to be an effective instrument in the hands of the
citizens. Earlier, the constitutional amendments to local self-governance in Panchayati raj
institutions and urban local bodies established a strong institutional foundation for citizens’
participation in governance, planning and budgeting and service delivery. More recently, many
state governments have stipulated 50 percent representation of women in local governments.
This has resulted in more than a million women’s representatives being elected in villages,
districts, cities and states.

At the policy and program level, CSOs have been engaged in finalizing the Country Partnership
Strategy, updating Bank’s operational policies on Indigenous Peoples (Scheduled Tribes), and
Land Acquisition and other studies. The India Program has focused largely on enhancing the
voice of local beneficiary communities, service user groups and citizens in Bank-supported
projects. Project teams have worked to strengthen the demand side of governance through the
use of toolkits and state laws and mechanisms such as the Right to Information Act, citizen's
                                                                                              140
charters, and grievance redress mechanisms. The RWSS project in Uttarakhand has helped with
the processing of RTI applications. The World Bank financed Affiliated Networks for Social
Accountability (ANSA) supported two communities of practice in India on RTI and
Accountability Tools, leading to 12 pilots on strengthening social accountability, third party
monitoring, and NGO capacity building.

81.     There is a growing critical mass of operations linking CE, local
governance/decentralization and pro-poor service delivery in Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya
Pradesh and Mizoram for instance. Participatory Identification of the Poor has been a core
approach adopted by the rural livelihood projects, in which rural communities have collectively
appraised the wealth and well-being of households to identify the poorest beneficiaries and
prioritize their inclusion in project processes and benefits. This approach has worked particularly
well in Tamil Nadu, Orissa, and Andhra Pradesh.

82.     Strong beneficiary feedback and stakeholder engagement has been an integral part of the
social assessments carried out for rural roads, water and sanitation, livelihood, nutrition and all
other projects. During project preparation, all social assessments rely heavily on the feedback
and perspectives of project beneficiaries and primary stakeholders, which are then integrated into
the project’s gender and social inclusion strategy. The Rural Livelihood Portfolio used
community-based institutional platforms of poor women not only to access credit, plan and
implement livelihood interventions, but also to leverage their collective bargaining capacity to
access entitlements and services through panchayats. This approach has worked particularly well
in Tamil Nadu, Orissa, and Andhra Pradesh.

83.    In addition, a strong body of analytical work has been collected by the Bank on the role
and impact of the range of CE efforts, including the RTI and social audits, confirming India’s
continued role as source of immense innovation in the CE field.

84.     Going forward, capacity building has been identified as a key element in strengthening
citizen participation and social accountability in India. The Bank is designing a series of public
service delivery projects that linking CE, local governance/decentralization and pro-poor service
delivery, for instance in Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram. The
Governance and Social GPs would collaborate to use CE and SA approaches to improve gender,
equity and social inclusion outcomes for citizens. Efforts to enhance social accountability, citizen
engagement and demand for good governance will be implemented through investment projects
as well as AAA initiatives.


85.     In Nepal, the Bank has supported efforts to bolster social accountability activities in
public financial management, municipal governance, and public service delivery. Over the
past decade, the Government of Nepal has passed and promulgated a series of new acts, policies
and guidelines related to improving local governance and promoting citizen engagement. These
include: the Local Self Governance Act (1999), the Decentralization Implementation Plan
(2002), the Right to Information Act (2007), the Good Governance Act (2008), Good
Governance Action Plan (2012), Local Bodies Resource Mobilization and Management
Guidelines (2012) and the Social Mobilization Guidelines (2014). Although these documents
provide the critical institutional basis for strengthening transparency, accountability and
inclusion of local governance processes, many challenges continue to persist, especially at the

                                                                                                141
district and village levels, with vulnerable groups continuing to contend with limited
representation in decision making bodies, poor access to services and few opportunities to voice
their concerns.

86.     Recognizing the need to build civil society’s capacity to strengthen accountability
measures to improve governance in Nepal, the World Bank launched the Program for
Accountability in Nepal (PRAN) with support from the State- and Peace-building Fund. Since
2009, PRAN has been developing the capacity of civil society and government actors through
practical training, action learning, and networking. In addition, the multi-donor trust fund has
been supporting independent budget analysis by CSOs, think tanks and research institutes
through PRAN.

87.      PRAN’s recent work has led to increased citizen awareness about the local planning and
budgeting process in 80 VDCs, closer examination of the distribution of Social Security
Expenditures, greater participation by women and marginalized groups in local governance
structures, improved community management of government schools and even the refunding of
misused or misallocated funds back to the VDC and ward budgets. At the national level, PRAN
supported the Office of Auditor General in Nepal by fostering support for collaboration of the
Office of the Auditor-General with CSOs and media. The intervention has led to the
establishment of a widely respected and on-going OAG-CSO collaborative process that has
supported dissemination and follow-up of the OAG annual audit report, implementation of
performance audits with community participation at the local level, and an innovative regional
learning exchange process (led by the OAG in Nepal) among the senior staff of Supreme Audit
Institutions in South Asia with the support the “Advancing Public Participation in the Budget and
Audit Process” program.

88.     Throughout the Nepal portfolio, grievance redress is an integral part of not only
infrastructure projects but also human development and social protection projects. Recently, an
ICT based grievance redress mechanism was rolled out in one of the road projects. Through the
Citizen Action for Results, Transparency and Accountability (CARTA) program, social
accountability tools in the context of third-party monitoring were introduced in 6 projects.

89.    To operationalize the GAC II strategy, Pakistan undertook the following: (a) a
mapping of social accountability interventions in Bank projects and identification of two or three
pipeline projects to be supported with the design of CE components for demonstration effects in
sectors (infrastructure-related) and areas (KP, FATA or Balochistan); (b) an assessment of
external social accountability programs and mapping of CSOs at the province and district levels
using GIS to understand the enabling environment for social accountability work in Pakistan, and
to provide project teams with context-based information and potential for replication in Bank-
funded operations; and (c) an assessment of youth in rural Pakistan on their role in their
communities and their use of technology. The results and lessons learned were disseminated in
TTL clinics on social accountability approaches and through the donor roundtable on social
accountability, and were used in projects as part of Pakistan’s GAC strategy.

90.     The South Asia region has been using ICT tools to collect citizen feedback and
geocode project locations. In Pakistan, Punjab uses SMS and robocalls on public service
satisfaction, providing feedback in a structured manner to decision makers. The Punjab Model
represents a novel application to deterring corruption by collecting data on “bribe-taking” by
                                                                                              142
bureaucrats who administer basic services (e.g., property registration, the licensing of drivers,
providing glucose drips). In India, the SLB Connect, a service-level benchmarking initiative,
aims to strengthen CE in selected urban areas for provision of water and sanitation services and
thereby help improve service outcomes. In addition to tracking service outcomes for specific
projects and programs, SLB Connect allows for analysis by area, including the city’s poorest
neighborhoods. Following the success of a recent pilot initiative, plans are under way to expand
the effort to other cities. In Nepal, WBI has piloted the Poverty Alleviation Fund Project’s
OnTrack initiative, an ICT-enabled mechanism that allows citizens and civil society to directly
provide feedback to government implementing agencies and public service providers of Bank-
financed programs. OnTrack uses a multi-mode approach to collecting citizen feedback by using
innovations in technology (i.e., interactive mapping, SMS, mobile, and Web applications)
embedded in a broader process of civic engagement and participatory monitoring of development
outcomes. In India, IT-based governance schemes were embedded in about one-third of WB
projects. The National e-Governance Program improved service delivery across its 27 mission
mode projects, focusing on LISs. Efforts have also begun in some projects to leverage the UID e-
identity scheme to promote better access for the poor to services and reduce financial leakages.

       2. Going Forward

CE, if it is done well, has great potential in SAR, but since this region is complex and diverse,
approaches need to be tailored to the context, and government buy-in needs to be secured. CE is
not a new agenda in the region, and many activities already include it. To support overall
mainstreaming of CE, project teams will need to understand contextual constraints and
opportunities, and require technical assistance with incorporating CE in project design and
implementation. Scaling up beneficiary feedback requires consistent support from all parties and
better tracking. Advancing the CE agenda requires committed funding in projects and
incorporation into design at an early stage, so that it is developed with the other elements of the
project.

                               Annex VI: Engaging with External Stakeholders
91.     The Strategic Framework is informed by the long-standing experience on citizen engagement (CE) by
civil society, governments, and the private sector. The World Bank (WB) has actively sought inputs from them,
as well as individual citizens, to learn from their experience in the context of developing and implementing the
Strategic Framework. Three main avenues have been used to seek external inputs: online consultations, external
advisory council, and face-to-face meetings with representatives from civil society groups and other
stakeholders.

92.      Online feedback was sought through the Engaging with Citizens for Improved Results website created in
the World Bank consultations hub. This hub is a one-stop shop for all ongoing and planned World Bank
consultations. An online survey was included to seek inputs on examples of successful and unsuccessful CE
activities, specific contextual factors affecting their outcome, and areas for future research. The CE consultation
website was open for inputs from February 19 until June 13, 2014.

93.      An Advisory Council was established to offer expert external guidance and insights throughout the
development and implementation of the Strategic Framework. The diverse membership of the Advisory Council
captures a comprehensive range of global and specific stakeholder perspectives and specialized expertise. The
Council comprises representatives from civil society (2), academia (2), private sector (2), governments (2),
foundations (2) and donor organizations, including the WBG (2). The 12 members of the Advisory Council
were selected through a transparent process 1 based on the following criteria: (a) experience with undertaking
CE initiatives, combined with a track record of achieving improved development results through such activities;
(b) level of representation of their respective constituencies; (c) geographic diversity; and (e) knowledge of
WBG operations. The Advisory Council provides guidance and expertise on the development and
implementation of the Strategic Framework on existing evidence and experience from CE in development
interventions; how, where, and why CE has contributed to improved development outcomes; analyses of
context factors for success; and other issues critical to CE mainstreaming in WBG operations for improved
results. The Advisory Council meets every six months, or more often as needed, in person or virtually.

94.    A series of face-to-face and videoconference meetings were organized with relevant representatives
from civil society and the private sector to learn from their experiences. These dialogues took place in Accra,
Beirut, Brussels, Cairo, Freetown, Lima, London, Monrovia, Tunis, and Washington D.C. (Table A6.1).
Summaries of these dialogues are also available on the CE web site.

Overview of the Consultation Process

95.     As an integral part of the process to develop the Strategic Framework, the WB held global consultations
from February to June 2014. More than 200 organizations—representing stakeholders from government, civil
society, the private sector, and academia—commented on the development of this Strategic Framework in 9
face-to-face meetings around the world while another 22 submitted written comments through the on-line
survey. The majority of organizations were from Part II countries (Figure A6.1).

                                                                                 Part II




96.     As part of the consultations hub, the CE website provided background for the consultation process,
including a concept note, Power-point presentation, and issue brief providing an overview of the Strategic
Framework’s objectives and approach and the schedule of consultation meetings. Stakeholders were encouraged
to share their input through the online survey and a dedicated email account. Key materials were made available
in Arabic, English, Portuguese, and Spanish.


97.    Participants in the face-to-face meetings were led (via videoconferencing for regional consultations) by
either Mariam Sherman (Director, Results, Openness and Effectiveness) or Astrid Manroth (Operations
Adviser, Openness and Aid Effectiveness) and moderated by WB Communications Officers. Through the
consultations, Bank Management sought views from stakeholders in a range of areas:
    • Where have you seen CE contribute to development outcomes? In which sectors has it worked best?
       What types of engagement mechanisms were used?
    • Can you share examples of CE with impact in the following areas: service delivery; public financial
       management; governance and anti-corruption; social inclusion and empowerment; and natural resource
       management?
    • In what ways have you seen the private sector effectively engage citizens to improve product and service
       delivery and benefit the wider society?


                                                                                                           150
   •   In your experience, what contextual factors—such as civil society, political society and global
       dimensions—are critical to make CE efforts work effectively to enhance results?
   •   Where have you seen CE efforts fail? What happened? What lessons would you draw from these
       experiences?
   •   What mechanisms and context can best contribute to sustainable mechanisms for engaging citizens in
       service delivery, policy-making, and other development activities?
   •   Where do you see gaps in what is known about the contribution of CE in achieving development
       outcomes that could inform the future research agenda?

98.    Table A6.2 provides a summary of feedback, including online inputs and face-to-face meetings, received
during these consultations. A more detailed summary of each meeting as well a summary of written online
submissions are available on the Engaging with Citizens for Improved Results website. Points raised by a wide
range of participants, some less frequently heard reflect the concerns of specific constituencies. The summary is
