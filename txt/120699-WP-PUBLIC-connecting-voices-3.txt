Connecting Voices (CV) Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is a
regional initiative and partnership that promotes governance and
improved financial management practices in the public and private
sectors. The ultimate aim is to support the demands of citizens
throughout the Arab World for jobs, better governance, a voice in
public affairs, and social and economic inclusion as reflected in the
World Bank’s MENA Regional strategy.

CV MENA plans to seize on the windows of opportunity available in
the region. It will support capacity building in the area of financial
management, facilitate the development of a professional commu-
nity, as well as the sharing and transfer of knowledge both within
countries and within the region as a whole. CV MENA will help fos-
ter greater transparency and accountability, thereby engendering
enhanced public trust. In addition, building public and private sector
financial management capacity will also help attract and provide
comfort to much-needed foreign direct investment in the region.                     CVMENA won the World Bank’s 2013 MENA Vice President

"In the past year, membership in The IIA rose more than 100 percent in the Middle East. That's not only an astounding increase, it far and
away outpaced anywhere else in the world. At the same time, we found that more than 65 percent of chief audit executives surveyed by
The IIA are reporting both staffing and budget increases. What's more, internal audit staffing levels did not decrease at any Middle East
company responding to our survey, and none of the internal audit groups experienced a budget cut in the past year ... In the past four
years, in fact, there was a 278 percent increase in the number of Middle East auditors receiving the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) or other
professional designations from The IIA. Much of the CIA growth has been the direct result of the CIA exam being translated into Arabic."

the internal control system. This entails a
systematic analysis of the different
measures put in place and their effective-
ness. It is less concerned with testing indi-
vidual transactions.

The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) has
developed         internationally-recognized
standards for internal audit. They foresee
an internal audit function which evolves
from the testing of transactions to becom-
ing management’s trusted advisor. This
requires strong audit teams with a variety
of skills.

Internal audit is distinct from external audit,
which in the public sector is carried out by
the supreme audit institution (SAI). Internal
audit is carried out by staff within the or-
ganization that is being audited (or in the
public sector, sometimes by the Ministry of
Finance). It reports to the management of
the same organization. By contrast, the SAI
is a separate organization with its own staff
which reports to the Parliament and the                                Figure 3: The Change Challenge for Internal Audit

        Abstract:

        The acronym PFM stands for Public Financial Management: But
        what is public financial management? This short note tries to de-
        mystify the concept, drawing on perspectives of specialists in the
        area who work in different contexts and bring different views
        (from academia, the multilateral and bilateral development agen-
        cies, think tanks, government, and civil society). The note is not
        meant to be prescriptive but rather offers an entry point to a fuller
        discussion on the constituent elements of PFM systems, how and
        why PFM reforms have emerged, and where the gaps are for fu-
        ture attention.

                               Box 1: Recent Initiatives to Strengthen Resource Revenue Management in Resource-rich Countries

The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) has developed standards for disclosure and reconciliation of what companies pay and what gov-
ernments receive, that is, a distinct but crucial stage in the value chain. A set of requirements must be fulfilled for a country to become an EITI Candidate
and to maintain that position. The standards include obligations for both the government and for the natural resource companies (NRCs) in a candidate
country, and involve an independent institution as auditor or ‘reconciler’. Currently 39 countries implement the requirements, of which 23 are considered
to be ‘EITI compliant’. An update of the EITI Standard and requirements was approved in May 2013.

The IMF in 2005 issued the first version of the Guide on Resource Revenue Transparency, which provides a comprehensive framework for assessing trans-
parency and accountability across the whole value chain. The Guide on Resource Revenue Transparency is a companion document to the Fiscal Transpar-
ency (FT) Code and Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, and was re-issued in 2007 in connection with the revision of the FT Code
and ROSC in the same year. It delineates 24 good practices, arranged under the same four headings as the FT Code. As the FT Code and ROSC are currently
undergoing a revision, it would be expected that the Guide on Resource Revenue Transparency will be re-issued later in 2014.

The Revenue Watch Institute (RWI) promotes effective, transparent and accountable management of oil, gas and mineral resources for the public good.
The RWI developed the Resource Governance Index (RGI) — formerly Revenue Watch Index — to measure government disclosure in the management of
revenues from oil, gas and minerals extraction. It was first applied in 2009/10 in 41 countries. The second report on the RGI covers 58 countries and was
released in May 2013. The Index is based on 50 indicators under four clusters with a total of 71 main survey questions plus additional information, resulting
in 173 rated data entries per country. It is described by the RWI as largely a quantification of compliance with the good practices promoted by the IMF
Guide on Resource Revenue Transparency.

                                  Making Progress on Foreign Aid
  Abstract: Foreign aid is one of the most important policy tools that rich countries use for helping
  poor countries to improve population well-being and facilitate economic and institutional devel-
  opment. The empirical evidence on its benefits is mixed and has generated much controversy. This
  paper presents descriptive statistics which show that foreign aid to very poor countries accounts
  for very little of total global aid; reviews the evidence that foreign aid is often determined by the
  objectives of donor countries rather than the needs of recipient countries; argues that the evi-
  dence on the impact of aggregate foreign aid is hindered by problems of measurement and identi-
  fication, which are partly due to the heterogenous nature of aid; and discusses recent studies us-
  ing natural and randomized experiments to examine narrowed definitions of aid on more dis-
  aggregated outcomes.

        Revenues from Natural Resources
Natural Resources revenues, which are substantial in many countries, have major macro-fiscal rele-
vance. In 2011, these revenues accounted for over 50 percent of government revenues in petroleum-
rich countries, and approximately 20 percent in mining-producing countries and countries with both
mining and petroleum extraction industries (Figure 1). The importance of—and dependence on—the
NR sector is higher in developing countries. Indeed, the concentration of revenues in the oil sector can

            Thomas Paine (left); Edmund Burke (right)

Recently these writings have been revisited in two books, with the
first being: The Great Debate: Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine, and
the Birth of Right and Left by Yuval Levin. In his book, Levin reflect-
ing on the Burke versus Paine debate asks “Are great public prob-
lems best addressed through institutions designed to apply the
explicit technical knowledge of experts or by those designed to
channel the implicit social knowledge of the community?” The sec-
ond book by Arun Maira, Redesigning the Aeroplane While Flying:
Reforming Institutions, highlights the fact that both Burke and
Paine agreed that institutions must be reformed for society’s bet-
terment, however they disagreed about the method. Burke rec-
ommended a gradual process of evolution modelled on the way
nature makes changes. Paine preferred a revolutionary approach,
which displaces the old order entirely to make space for new insti-
tutions.

                                            Why Institutions Matter

Institutions are the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interaction. They
consist of both informal constraints (sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions, and codes of conduct), and formal
rules (constitutions, laws, property rights). Throughout history, institutions have been devised by human beings
to create order and reduce uncertainty in exchange. Together with the standard constraints of economics they
define the choice set and therefore determine transaction and production costs and hence the profitability and
feasibility of engaging in economic activity. They evolve incrementally, connecting the past with the present and
the future; history in consequence is largely a story of institutional evolution in which the historical performance
of economies can only be understood as a part of a sequential story. Institutions provide the incentive structure
of an economy; as that structure evolves, it shapes the direction of economic change towards growth, stagna-
tion, or decline.

women) is the highest in the world. These challenges relate to a
sense of vulnerability, exclusion, and lack of voice and opportunity
on the part of the citizenry. In particular, there is a high concentra-
tion of political and economic power by the governing elites and
those close to them— or a lack of inclusive institutions, as Ace-
moğlu and Robinson posit.

Compared to a number of other regions of the world, MENA’s gov-
ernance indicators tend to have lower scores, particularly in areas
such as transparency, government effectiveness, civil liberties, me-
dia freedom, participation and social accountability. As a conse-
quence, overall governmental accountability, trust in government
institutions, and public sector service delivery are all negatively
affected. Complicating matters, the volatile environment and insta-
bility present in many MENA countries compounds these difficul-
ties, bringing with them one crisis after the other. In some instanc-
es, this has acted as a trigger for embarking on reforms, while in
other cases it has made the design and implementation of pro-
grams much more challenging.

                                   When Institutions Flourish

Good institutions tend to flourish under two broad circumstances: an economic environment
that is not conducive to rent-seeking, and—related to that—the presence of appropriate checks
and balances on those wielding political power. Consistent with this, the econometric analysis
finds that the transition to good institutions is more likely to occur in countries that are more
open, have a greater degree of political accountability, have a higher level of education in the
population, and are in the same region as countries with relatively good institutions.

                           Governance & Democracy


As a starting point, I am going to define governance as a government's ability to
make and enforce rules, and to deliver services, regardless of whether that govern-
ment is democratic or not. I am more interested in what Michael Mann labels "in-
frastructural" rather than "despotic" power. The reason I am excluding democratic
accountability from the definition of governance is that we will later want to be able
to theorize the relationship between governance and democracy. The current or-
thodoxy in the development community is that democracy and good governance
are mutually supportive. I would argue that this is more of a theory than an empiri-
cally demonstrated fact, and that we cannot empirically demonstrate the connec-
tion if we define one to include the other.

Emirati SMPs
Recent data from the Ministry of Economy
states that there are 105 chartered account-
ing firms in the UAE. Considering global and
regional rankings, SMPs comprise the vast
majority of these firms in operation within
the UAE. Although there are strong num-
bers of SMP firms, the aforementioned chal-
lenges hinder SMPs competitiveness in the
market and may limit SMEs’ choices, and
possibly result in SME growth stagnation. In
recognition of these challenges facing SMPs
and SMEs, the AAA has designed and draft-
ed a high-level SME model which appropri-
ately captures the inter-relationship be-
tween SMEs and SMPs in the UAE. This
model demonstrates the position of SMPs at
the heart of SME business advisory needs
and access to finance. Additionally, in June

                        Subsidy Reform in MENA
“However, subsidies are often ineffective and biased against the poor. Generalized price subsidies—the most
common form in MENA countries—are neither well targeted nor cost-effective as a social protection tool. Though
they may reach the poor to some extent, they benefit mostly the better off, who consume more of the subsidized
goods, particularly energy products: in 2008, in Egypt, the poorest 40 percent of the population received only 3
percent of gasoline subsidies (Figure 2). Moreover, subsidies—especially those on energy products— impose wel-
fare costs by distorting relative prices in the economy, which fosters overconsumption and resource misallocation.
This, in turn, reduces exportable resources and thus limits wealth accumulation for energy-exporting countries,
and weakens the current account of energy-importing countries. In addition, overconsumption leads to adverse
impacts on traffic congestion, health, and the environment, and to inefficient specialization of domestic produc-
tion, often in less labor and high energy-intensive industries. Finally, subsidies hurt growth. Although they can be
used to provide short-term support to the productive sector, in the long run subsidies have a dampening effect on
growth potential, through price distortions, under-investment in labor-intensive and energy-efficient sectors,
crowding out of productive spending on human and physical capital, and higher inequality linked to inefficient
support of the poor.”

The Financial Management team of the Governance Global Practice (GGP) in MENA focuses on two strategic objectives:
•         Helping developing partner countries build their FM capacity, and
•         Providing reasonable assurance that financing provided by the Bank is being used for the intended purposes with economy and efficiency.
