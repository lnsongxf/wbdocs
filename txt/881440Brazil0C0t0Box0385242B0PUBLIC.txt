I.      Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank Group in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
       Brazil perceive the Bank;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Brazil regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Brazil;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank Group in Brazil;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results,
               knowledge work, and communication and information sharing in Brazil;
            Perceptions of the recent trends and the World Bank Group’s future role in Brazil.
    Use data to help inform Brazil country team’s strategy.
II.     Methodology
From June to August 2013, 10,200 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Brazil were invited
to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President, Prime
Minister/Minister, office of a parliamentarian, ministries, ministerial departments, or
implementation agencies; consultants/ contractors working on World Bank Group-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
state Government; municipal governments; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based
organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; academia/research
institutes/think tanks; faith-based groups, the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of
200 stakeholders participated in the survey (2% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via email and completed them online. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Brazil; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World
Bank Group’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with
the World Bank Group; the current trends and the Bank’s future role in Brazil; and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing in Brazil.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Brazil: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Brazil is headed
   in the right direction, what they thought were the top three development priorities in Brazil,
   and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic growth.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their
   familiarity with the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Latin American
   Development Bank, and the International Finance Corporation, their perceived effectiveness
   of these organizations in Brazil, and which of these organizations they work with the most in
   Brazil. They were asked to rate the Bank staff’s preparedness to help Brazil solve its
   development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding t he Bank’s work,
   and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued): Respondents were also asked
   to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, greatest weaknesses, the most effective instruments in
   helping reduce poverty in Brazil, in which sectoral areas the Bank should focus most
   resources, to what extent the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda,
   and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts. Respondents were
   invited to indicate at what level (federal, state, or municipal) the World Bank Group works
   mostly in Brazil. They were asked if the Bank is most effective when it works in one sector
   or multi-sectorally. Lastly, they were asked to indicate to what extent they believe the
   combination of financial, knowledge, and convening services provided by the Bank meets the
   national development needs of Brazil.
C. World Bank Group Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to
   which the Bank’s work helps achieve development results, the extent to which the Bank
   meets Brazil’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level
   of effectiveness across thirty-two development areas, such as education, public sector
   governance/reform, health, transport, and anti-corruption. They were also asked to what
   extent they believe that Brazil receives value for money from the World Bank Group’s fee -
   based services/products.
D. The World Bank Group’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate the areas on
   which the Bank should focus its research efforts and to rate the effectiveness and quality of
   the Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it
   makes to development results and its technical quality. Respondents were also asked whether
   they read/consulted the most recent LAC Flagship Report and whether it provided useful
   information in their work.
E. Working with the World Bank Group: Respondents were asked to rate their level of
   agreement with a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World
   Bank Group’s “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing
   reasonable conditions on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Brazil’s
   institutional capacity, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Brazil: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the World Bank Group should play in Brazil in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value. Respondents were asked to
   indicate to what extent they believe the World Bank Group has moved in the right direction
   in terms of the focus of its work in Brazil and how significant a role international
   development cooperation should play in Brazil’ s development in the near future at the
   federal, state, and/or municipal level.

G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   whether they used/had used the World Bank Group website, and whether they accessed the
   Bank’s social media channels. Respondents were also asked about their level of agreement
   that they know how to find information from the Bank, and that the Bank is responsive to
   information requests. Respondents were also asked to indicate what kind of e-services they
   are currently subscribed to.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, at what level (federal, state, or municipal) they primarily work at, whether
   they professionally collaborate with the World Bank Group, whether they worked with the
   International Finance Corporation in Brazil, their exposure to the Bank in Brazil, and their
   geographic location.


When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 423 respondents (49% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY 2006. All responses to comparable questions across years can be found in
Appendix D (see page 117). Notations and/or charts are included in the body of the report when
the differences between years are worth-noting.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Brazil, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the forty-one specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development result s increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Brazil. The areas determined
        to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at education;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at information and communications technology;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at public sector governance/ reform; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Brazil, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at natural resource management;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at education;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at climate change; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at information and communications technology.
