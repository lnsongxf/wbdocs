    INTRODUCTION



    1. Overcoming the twin challenges of child labour and the youth decent work
    deficit will be critical to Ghana’s progress towards realising its broader social
    development goals. Evidence presented in this report indicates that 1.9
    million Ghanaian children remain trapped in child labour. Of even greater
    concern, the evidence points to a very substantial increase in children’s work
    in recent years, contrary to the regional and global child labour trends.1 At
    the same time, young persons in the 15-34 years age range are concentrated
    overwhelmingly in low skill jobs in the informal economy that offer little
    prospect for advancement or for escaping poverty and exploitation. The
    effects of child labour and the decent work deficit facing youth are well-
    documented: both can lead to social vulnerability, societal marginalisation
    and deprivation, and both can permanently impair lifetime patterns of
    employment and pay.
    2. The current Report examines the related issues of child labour and youth
    employment in the context of Ghana. Guided by observed outcomes in
    terms of schooling, work activities and status in the labour market, the
    report considers the economic as well as the social determinants of child
    labour and youth employment. The sixth round of the Ghana Living
    Standards Survey 2012 (GLSS 6, 2012) is the primary data source for the
    report. Data from this survey permit a comprehensive and nationally-
    representative picture of the child labour and youth employment situations.
    The fifth round of the Ghana Living Standards Survey 2005 (GLS 5, 2005) is
    used to discuss the trends of child labour and youth employment.
    3. The Report was developed in collaboration with Government agencies
    (Ghana Statistical Service, Ministry of Employment and Labour Relations,
    Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, Ministry of Education,
    National Development Planning Commission and other members of the
    National Steering Committee on Child Labour) and with the UCW partner
    agencies (ILO, UNICEF and the World Bank). As such, it provides an important
    common basis for action in addressing child labour and the youth decent
    work deficit.
    4. Three related objectives are served by the report: (1) improve the
    information base on child labour and youth employment, in order to inform
    policy and programmatic responses; (2) promote policy dialogue on child
    labour and the lack of opportunities for decent and productive work for

        youth; and (3) analyse the relationship between early school leaving, child
        labour and future status in the labour market.
        5. The remainder of the Report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 reviews
        the national economic and social context. Chapter 3 reports estimates of
        child labour for the 5-14 and 15-17 years age groups. Chapter 4 of the report
        focuses on understanding children’s work in the 5-14 years age range,
        looking first at the extent and changes in children’s employment and then at
        its main characteristics. Chapter 5 addresses the extent and nature of child
        labour among older, 15-17 year-old, children. Chapter 6 examines the
        interplay between child labour and schooling. Chapter 7 then turns to youth
        employment, covering issues including job access, job quality, human capital
        and skills mismatches. Chapter 8 of the Report reviews current national
        responses to child labour and youth employment concerns. Chapter 9
        consists of a concluding discussion of policy priorities for accelerating action
        in the areas of child labour and youth employment.

The     inter-agency       research  programme,       Research on the work and the vulnerability of
Understanding Children’s Work (UCW), was initiated    children and youth constitutes the main component

The Programme is guided by the Roadmap adopted

                        GHANA AND ITS LABOR MARKET: RECENT TRENDS
                        AND MAIN CHARACTERISTICS



                 6. This chapter provides a general overview of the Ghanaian labour market
                 with the aim to better contextualize the specific issues of children’s work and
                 youth employment. To this end, after a short description of the country
                 context (Section 2.1), the rest of this chapter will be devoted to describe the
                 main features of the Ghanaian labour market, as well as its recent
                 developments.


2.1 The country context
                 7. Thanks to a prolonged period of sustained and broadly inclusive growth,
                 combined with relatively sound governance, Ghana is positioned among the
                 richer countries in the West Africa region (Figure 1). Ghana is the world’s
                 second largest cocoa producer behind Côte d’Ivoire, and Africa’s biggest gold
                 miner after South Africa. Since 2010, it is also a significant and promising oil
                 producer.

                 8. Formed by the merger of the Gold Coast (ex British colony) and British
                 Togoland, Ghana was the first Sub Saharan African country to gain
                 independence in 1957. Starting from 1983, Ghana shifted away from state
                 controls of productive activities and undertook a more open and liberalized

               economic system. At present, Ghana is a market-based economy with
               relatively few barriers to international trade. It is relatively rich in natural
               resources and is generally regarded among the strongest policy performers
               in Sub Saharan Africa. In this context, employment policy has progressively
               gained centre stage in the national policy agenda (see below).
               9. Two decades of sustained economic growth have translated into a sharp
               decline in poverty rates. The proportion of people living below the national
               poverty line more than halved from 52% in 1991/92 to about 24% in
               2012/13, while the incidence of extreme poverty dropped from 37% to eight
               percent over the same period. This is a remarkable result, which is almost
               unprecedented in Sub-saharan Africa, and looks consistent with the
               achievement of the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG, see below).
               However, though improving everywhere, poverty distribution still appears
               very heterogenous across the different areas of the country; rural poverty
               rates are almost four times as high (38%) as the corresponding urban ones
               (11%). In particular, poverty appears highly concentrated in the Northern
               regions of the country (Molini V., Paci P., 2015).

               10. Ghana has also registered substantial progress in the achievement of
               many other MDGs. According to the newly released National Development
               Planning Commission and UNDP report,2 Ghana matched some of the targets
               in achieving a universal access to primary education, in improving gender
               equality at school, and reducing child mortality (Table 1). Important steps
               have also been certified in improving maternal health and combating HIV,
               malaria and other diseases. However, slow progress has been recorded in
               reducing maternal mortality ratios, achieving full and productive

          population was accompanied by an increase in persons of working age, i.e.
          15 to 64 years old (from 53.5% in 1991 to 57.7% in 2014), whereas the share
          of children younger than 15 progressively declined (from 43.7% to 38.9%,
          respectively). Dependency ratios have correspondingly decreased (Table 2),
          since the oldest cohort (65 and older) - though growing - still represents less
          than four percent of the Ghanaian population.

          12. In more detail, between the early 1990s and 2014 the working-age
          population in Ghana rose at an annual growth rate of about 4.5%; as a result,
          people aged 15-64 years increased by almost 6.5 million persons (Table 3).
          Youths aged 15-24 years account for about one-third of the active
          population. This share, however, is declining over time (it was almost 40% in
          1991), due to the slow but on-going deceleration in fertility rates (Figure 3).
          Thanks to the significant increase recorded in life expectancy (from 57 years
          in 1991 to 66 in 2014, see Table 2), the share of both prime-age and older
          workers (i.e. 25-54 and 55-64, respectively) has instead increased in the last
          two decades. In particular, the highest growth rates have been observed
          among those aged 35-54 (Table 3).

                               13. These population trends – which will continue in the next decades (see
                               Figure 3) – is significantly affecting the structure of the Ghanaian labour
                               market. The sharp rise in the potentially active population has resulted in a
                               major increase in the Ghanaian labour force (see below), thereby raising a
                               growing concern about the concrete capacity of the Ghanaian economy to
                               create enough jobs to match a continuously increasing labor supply. The
                               following section will try to answer this question by providing a current
                               profile of both the supply and demand sides of the Ghanaian labor market. In
                               this context, the focus will not only be on the overall quantity of job creation
                               but also on its quality characteristics.


2.2 A current profile of the Ghanaian labour market3
                               14. In the last two decades, sustained economic growth has led to a
                               significant rise in total employment. Resorting to the evidence collected by
                               GLSS surveys, data show that employed persons in Ghana have more than
                               doubled since the early 1990s; the overall increase of about 6.5 million
                               workers corresponds to an average yearly growth rate of 12.3%. As shown in
                               Figure 4, most of the employment rise originated in the urban areas. Urban
                               jobs, which in the early 1990s only represented about one third of total
                               employment, now account for almost half of it. Correspondingly, total
                               unemployment – which, as in most other low and lower middle income
                               economies, is predominantly an urban phenomenon (Figure 4) – fell
                               significantly in the region of Accra (from 6.7 to 4.7%) as well as in the other

               15. Since the early 1990s, the Ghanaian labour force has more than doubled
               (Table 4) and the labour force participation rate has increased by three
               percentage points to just below the 80% threshold. Interestingly enough, this
               increase only involved the male segment of the labour force; women’s
               labour force participation appears has stagnated, mainly due to a significant
               rise in inactivity. Another change emerging in the recent years is the growth
               of informality; this change has occurred despite an accompanying rise in
               educational attainment.

   16. The progressive improvement in educational attainment and the rapid
   rate of urbanization are two other important trends impacting the labour
   supply in Ghana. As shown in Figure 6, significant progress has been
   recorded in enhancing the average level of education of the Ghanaian
   population: the share of people never attending any type of school has been
   halved since the early 1990s (Figure 6) as school enrolment and completion
   rates have risen steadily (Figure 7). The proportion of people living in urban
   areas rose from 37% in 1991 to 53% in 2012/13, and labour force
   participation in urban areas increased from 67% to 75% over the same
   period.

                                         17. The combination of an increasing working-age population and a rising
                                         rate of urbanization has led to a substantial growth in new urban job seekers,
                                         especially among the youngest segments of the population. Half of the
                                         population aged 15-34 years currently lives in urban areas; Greater Accra
                                         and the Ashanti regions host the highest share of youths (6.8 and 6.2%,
                                         respectively).

                                         experiencing a slow but steady structural transformation since the early
                                         1990s. Figure 8 shows that employment in the agricultural sector fell

            significantly from 62% in the early 1990s to 45% in 2012/13. In the same
            time span, the number of persons employed in services jumped from 28% to
            41%, with most of the increase taking place after 2005. Employment shares
            also grew – though at a much lower pace - in the industrial sector, which
            presently accounts for about 14% of the Ghanaian workforce.

            19. The shift from agriculture to services appears to have been relatively
            stronger for female workers, whose share in the tertiary sector (47% in
            2012/13) is about 13 percentage points higher than that of male workers. As
            expected, the sectoral distribution of employment varies considerably
            between urban and rural areas. In rural areas, agriculture still engages over
            70% of the available workforce, compared with less than 20% of the
            workforce in urban areas.
            20. These changes in the sectoral composition of employment did not
            translate into a corresponding reduction in the share of workers in the
            informal economy. In 2012/13, informal jobs represented about 88% of total
            employment. Informality is not only widespread in the agricultural sector,
            but also in services and manufacturing, especially in urban areas,4
            highlighting the inability of the formal economy (both private and public) to
            generate enough jobs to match the increased labour supply.

             According to the Ghana Statistical Service, informal sector activities “are more dominant in urban than in rural
            areas, with 61.5 percent and 23.3 percent of the population respectively engaged in the sector”. See GSS (2014b),
            page 23.

          21. As shown in Figure 9, in 2012/13 persons employed in the formal sector
          did not exceed 12% of total employment. Almost half of formal economy
          jobs (corresponding to about 687,000 workers) were in the public sector,
          which historically represents the first provider of formal employment in the
          country. However, since the early 1990s the Ghanaian public sector has been
          the target of the series of restructuring measures introduced by the
          Government to achieve fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability.
          This has led to a progressive downsizing of public employment,5 which has
          not been offset by a corresponding increase in the number of jobs created in
          the formal private economy.6 As a result, the relative importance of informal
          economy employment has increased over the last two decades (it was about
          80% at the turn of this century).7

            According to Twerefou D.K. et al. (2007), between 1960 and 1985 formal employment registered a considerable
          increase – from 4% to over 20% of the labour force, mainly due to the “government’s massive public investment
          programme”. Once the ERP/SAP programs were implemented in the early 1980s, however, formal sector
          employment again retreated due to public retrenchment, liberalization and privatization, as well as the
          withdrawal of previously existing subsidies for loss-making public enterprises.

               22. The majority of the Ghanaian workforce is made of self-employed
               workers both in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. About 53% of
               all adult workers are recorded as self-employed (Table 6), most of whom
               work as own-account workers. Persons in wage employment constitute less
               than one fourth of total employment (and only 13% of total female
               employment). As expected, the incidence of wage employment is much
               higher (25 percentage points) in urban compared to rural areas.

               23. According to international standards, own-account workers, together
               with those defined as “contributing family workers”,8 are usually considered
               as in “vulnerable employment”, i.e. workers more likely to lack decent
               working conditions, adequate social security as well as acceptable earnings.
               Vulnerable workers are usually engaged in low productivity jobs and face
               difficult working conditions. From Table 6 it is evident that vulnerable
               employment represents a crucial issue in the Ghanaian labour market: more
               than two-thirds of all employed persons are in jobs with vulnerable
               8
                 A contributing family worker is a person who holds a self employment job in a market-oriented establishment
               operated by a related person living in the same household, and who cannot be regarded as a partner because of
               the degree of his or her commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of the working time or other
               factors to be determined by national circumstances, is not at a level comparable with that of the head of the
               establishment.(Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses, Revision 1, United
               Nations, New York, 1998, para. 2.82.).

                 characteristics. The situation is particularly alarming for women working in
                 urban areas - 70% of the jobs of this group are vulnerable.
                 24. However, comparing these data with the situation in the mid-2000s
                 reveals a reduction in the relative weight of vulnerable jobs, from more than
                 75% to about 69%. At the country level, this decline is entirely due to the
                 reduction in the share of own-account workers (by almost 10 percentage
                 points; Figure 10), whereas those employed as contributing family workers
                 has increased somewhat.

                 25. Despite maintaining many traditional features of a rural developing
                 country, in the last two decades the Ghanaian labor market is slowly
                 undergoing a structural economic transformation, triggered both by long-
                 term demographics trends as well as policy decisions. Over the last 20 years
                 Ghana governments have progressively recognized the crucial role played by
                 jobs and labor markets in the development agenda. Employment promotion
                 has become an important goal in the national policy debate at least since the
                 end of the 1980s, with the implementation of the PAMSCAD (the Programme
                 of Action to Mitigate the Social Cost of Adjustment).
                 26. More recently, the growing concern about the capacity of the Ghanaian
                 economy to generate enough and better-quality jobs for a steadily
                 increasing, and relatively higher skilled, labour force led the current
                 Government to launch a National Employment Policy in 2014 to “address the
                 employment situation, and deal with decent work deficits, targeting in
                 particular, vulnerable groups, the youth, women and persons with disabilities
                 [….]9”. This strategy will prove crucial in the next years, in a context of

growing uncertainty and increasing economic difficulties at the
macroeconomic level. According to the latest estimates, real GDP growth in
Ghana is expected to significantly slow down in due to a series of
concomitant negative factors, such as the sharp fall in both oil and gold
prices as well growing difficulties in the electricity supply.

    CHILD LABOUR: THE OVERALL PICTURE



    27. Child labour in Ghana continues to affect an estimated 1.9 million
    children aged 5-17 years, about 22% of this age group. These numbers
    indicate clearly that the battle against child labour has not yet been won in
    the country, and that efforts in this regard need to be intensified and
    accelerated in order that the goal of child labour elimination is reached in
    the nearest possible future. In this chapter we briefly summarise estimates
    of involvement in child labour for the overall 5-17 years age group, based on
    national legislation and international child labour measurement standards.
    28. The case against child labour, set forth in the recent ILO Global Child
    Labour Estimates report, is as relevant in Ghana as elsewhere.10 Children
    who grow up free from child labour have the opportunity to realize fully their
    rights to education, leisure and healthy development, in turn helping them
    to make a successful transition into decent work upon completing their
    education and to be contributing members of society as adults. The costs of
    inaction are equally clear. Child labour can seriously endanger children’s
    immediate health and safety, as well as their health status later in life. This is
    particularly the case for the children engaged in the worst forms of child
    labour. Child labour also compromises children’s ability to enrol and stay in
    school, and to benefit from the time they do spend in the classroom. Turning
    a blind eye to child labour can erode the fabric of societies and can
    impoverish or even destroy the human capital needed for economic growth
    and poverty reduction. In purely economic terms, a separate ILO global study
    indicates clearly that the benefits of eliminating child labour vastly outweigh
    its costs.11
    29. The legal framework for child labour in Ghana is contained in the
    Children’s Act (Act. 560, 1998). The Act sets the minimum age for admission
    of a child to employment at 15 years (Sec. 89) and the minimum age of
    admission to light work at 13 years (Sec. 90.1), where light work is defined as
    work that is not likely to be harmful to the health or development of the
    child and does not affect the child’s attendance at school or the capacity of
    the child to benefit from school work (Sec. 90.2). The Hazardous Child Labour
    Activity Framework for Ghana, while acknowledging this Act, recommends a
    minimum age of 12 years for light work, and national statistical practice has

been to use this lower minimum age in child labour measurement.12 The
minimum age for the engagement of a person in hazardous work is set at 18
years (Sec. 91.1). Hazardous is defined as work posing a danger to the health,
safety or morals of a person (Sec. 91.2).13
30. Following national legislation and national statistical practices (in the
measurement of light work), children are classified in child labour on the
basis of the following criteria:
a)      For children aged 5-11 years: those in employment;
b)      For children aged 12-14 years: those in employment except those in
        light work14; and
c)      For children aged 15-17 years: those in hazardous forms of
        employment.
31. Children in employment, in turn, are those engaged in any economic
activity for at least one hour during the reference period. Economic activity
covers all market production and certain types of non-market production
(principally the production of goods and services for own use, excluding
water and firewood collection). It includes forms of work in both the formal
and informal economies; inside and outside family settings; work for pay or
profit (in cash or in kind, part-time or full-time), or as a domestic worker
outside the child’s own household for an employer (with or without pay). 15




12
  National statistical practice, as reflected in, for example, Ghana Living Standards Survey Round 6, Child Labour
Report (Ghana Statistical Service, August 2014), utilises the minimum age of 12 years for admission to light work
in the measurement of child labour. Paragraph 12 of the 18th International Conference of Labour Statisticians
Resolution II also proposes the age group of 12 to 14 years for permissible light work for the purpose of child
labour measurement.
13
   Hazardous work includes going to sea; mining and quarrying; porterage of heavy loads; manufacturing
industries where chemicals are produced or used; work in places where machines are used; and work in places
such as bars, hotels and places of entertainment where a person may be exposed to immoral behaviour (Sec.
91.3).
14
  Light work is defined as work that is not likely to be harmful to the health or development of the child and does
not affect the child’s attendance at school or the capacity of the child to benefit from school work.
15
  The concept of employment is elaborated further in the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment
and labour underutilization, adopted by the Nineteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October
2013). The resolution is available at: http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-

Notes: (a) Child labour for this age range consists of hazardous work. Working children are considered to be in hazardous work if they are found to be
in any one of the following categories: children working in designated hazardous industries (mining, quarrying and construction); children working in
designated hazardous occupations (they refer to the list of hazardous work established by the national legislation); children working long hours (42
hours or more per week); children working under other hazardous conditions such as night work, using hazardous tools and being in an unhealthy work
environment.

         32. Child labour measured on this basis is very common in Ghana. Some
         916,500 children aged 5-11 years, 564,500 aged 12-14 years and 411,500
         aged 15-17 years are in child labour. Summing these three groups yields a
         total of almost 1.9 million children aged 5-17 years involved in child labour,
         or about 22% of all children in this age range (Table 7). These overall
         estimates mask important differences by sex, residence and region. Boys are
         more likely to be involved in child labour than their female peers: there is a
         two percentage point difference between boys and girls for the overall 5-17
         years age range and an eight percentage point difference for the 15-17 years
         age range. The difference in child labour involvement between rural and
         urban children is even starker. For the 5-17 years age range as a whole, the
         rate of child labour in rural areas (30%) is more than twice that in urban
         areas (12%). Child labour varies by region from a high of 33 percent in Brong
         Ahafo and Upper West to a low of five percent in Greater Accra (Appendix
         Figure A2).
         33. It should be underscored in interpreting these numbers that they
         represent conservative estimates of child labour, because they exclude so-
         called "worst forms of child labour other than hazardous work." These forms
         of child labour include child trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation
         infant, child slavery and the involvement of children in illicit activities. In
         Ghana as in most countries, information on children involved in the worst
         forms of child labour other than hazardous is limited due to both
         methodological difficulties and cultural sensitivity.
         34. The Ghana Living Standards Survey and other similar surveys are not
         designed to generate information on children involved in worst forms of
         child labour other than hazardous work. Targeted research using specialized
         survey instruments is required to generate more complete information on
         this particularly vulnerable group of child labourers. Such research is

  As the current National Plan of Action against Child Labour (NPA, 2009-2015) is drawing to a close, a review of
the plan and the development of a new one are underway.

        CHILDREN AGED 5-14 YEARS



        35. This chapter analyses the extent and nature of child labour among 5-14
        year-olds in more detail, relying on the 2005 and 2012 rounds of the Ghana
        Living Standards Survey and on the measurement concepts outlined in the
        previous chapter. The headline finding of the analysis is a dramatic and
        worrying rise in children’s work in recent years, contrary to the regional and
        global child labour trends.18

4.1 Involvement in child labour
        36. More than one in five children aged 5-14 years (21%), almost 1.5 million
        in absolute terms, are child labourers according to GLSS 2012 (Table 8). The
        descriptive results presented in Table 8 indicate that overall estimates of
        child labour mask important differences by age and residence. In short, child
        labour increases with age and is much higher in rural areas than in cities and
        towns. Differences in terms of involvement between boys and girls, however,
        are negligible.

        37. We look in more detail below at how child labour (and schooling) varies
        in accordance with these and other background variables. This discussion
        draws on results of the econometric analysis presented in the Appendix
        (Table A2 and Table A3).19

           A simple economic model of household behaviour is used to guide the empirical specification. For detailed
        information on the model, see Cigno, A.; Rosati, F.C. 2005. “The economics of child labour” (New York, NY, Oxford
        University Press).

                    Age: Involvement in child labour increases with age (Figure 11). This
                     pattern is largely due to the fact that the productivity of children
                     increases as they grow older, meaning that the opportunity cost of
                     keeping children in school as opposed to the workplace also goes up.
                     This pattern notwithstanding, the numbers of very young, 5-7 year-old,
                     child labourers are by no means negligible. In all, more than 212,000
                     children in this age range are already engaged in child labour. These very
                     young children are especially susceptible to workplace hazards and
                     abuses, and they therefore constitute a particular policy priority.
                     It should be noted that from the age of 12 years, the definitions of child
                     labour and children’s employment diverge. As was discussed in the
                     previous chapter, while child labour includes all children in employment
                     in the age range 5-11 years, child labour excludes children in light
                     employment in the age range of 12-14 years.20 This more narrow
                     definition of child labour is the reason that child labour falls slightly
                     moving from 11 to 12 years.

Notes: (a) Compulsory schooling in Ghana begins at age four and is 11 years in duration. The school system is comprised of a 2-year pre-primary
cycle, a 6-year primary cycle, a 3-year lower secondary cycle and a (non-compulsory) 3-year upper secondary cycle.

                 Recall also that children in employment are those engaged in any economic activity for at least one hour during
               the reference period. Economic activity covers all market production and certain types of non-market production
               (principally the production of goods and services for own use). It includes forms of work in both the formal and
               informal economies; inside and outside family settings; work for pay or profit (in cash or in kind, part-time or full-
               time), or as a domestic worker outside the child’s own household for an employer (with or without pay).The
               concept of employment is elaborated further in the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and
               labour underutilization, adopted by the Nineteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October
               2013). The resolution is available at: http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-
               guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--

                                Gender: Child labour does not appear to have an important gender
                                 dimension, as boys and girls work in employment in roughly equal
                                 proportions. But it is worth recalling in interpreting this result that it does
                                 not include involvement in household chores, a form of work where
                                 typically girls predominate.21 For this reason, our estimates may
                                 understate girls’ involvement in child labour relative to that of boys.
                                Residence. Child labour among rural children (30%) is more than twice
                                 that of urban children (12%). The econometric results, in turn, confirm
                                 this pattern, indicating that children living in rural areas are more likely to
                                 work and less likely to attend school (Appendix Table A3).
                                Access to basic services. Access to public water and electricity networks is
                                 also very relevant. Children from households with tap water and
                                 electricity access are less likely to work. Basic services are important
                                 determinants in large part because they influence the value of children’s
                                 time outside of the classroom. In contexts where access to basic services
                                 is limited children must often shoulder a greater burden for tasks such as
                                 carrying water and fetching fuelwood.
                                Region. There are large differences in child labour (and schooling) across
                                 regions (Figure 12), pointing to the importance of area-specific
                                 approaches to addressing it. The Upper West region stands out as having
                                 the highest level of children's employment (36%). At the other end of the
                                 spectrum lies the Central and Greater Accra regions, where 9% and five
                                 percent, respectively, of children are involved in child labour. The
                                 Northern region has the lowest level of school attendance (73%); the
                                 region, fares relatively better in terms of child labour, ranking fifth
                                 (lowest) of the 10 regions.

                      Household poverty: Child labour is higher and school attendance is lower
                       among children from poor households, whether measured in terms of
                       expenditure (Figure 13a and 3b) or poverty status (Figure 13c and 3d).
                       The econometric results, in turn, confirm this pattern, indicating that
                       children belonging to poor households are more likely to work and less
                       likely to attend school (Annex Table A3). It should be noted however,
                       that the correlation between poverty and child labour is not large once
                       we control for other relevant covariates, underscoring the importance of
                       factors associated with poverty are driving the observed correlation
                       between household income and poverty. In policy terms, this result
                       suggests that a strategic response based on poverty reduction alone is
                       unlikely to be effective in eliminating child labour.

                      Education level of the household head. The effect of the level of
                       education of the household head in reducing child labour and increasing
                       school attendance is important. A higher educational level of the
                       household head makes it more likely that a child attends school and less
                       likely to be engaged in child labour (Figure 14). This relationship is also
                       confirmed by the econometric evidence presented in Appendix Table A3.
                       One possible explanation is that parents that are more educated might

   4.2 Trends in child labour
               38. How is child labour changing over time? Data restrictions unfortunately
               prevent the estimation of child labour for the 2005 round of the Ghana
               Living Standards Survey (GLSS). It is possible, however, to compare the
               estimates of children’s employment for the 7-14 years age range22 from the
               2005 and 2012 rounds of the Ghana Living Standards Survey. While
               children’s employment is a slightly broader concept than child labour,23 it
               nonetheless provides a useful proxy for assessing changes in child labour.
               39. The comparison of the results from the 2005 and 2012 GLSS rounds
               points to a sharp rise in children’s employment: the percentage of children in
               the 7-14 years age range in employment more than doubled from 2005
               (13%) to 2012 (29%)(Figure 15a). The increase occurred for both boys and
               girls (Appendix Table A1) and across the entire 7-14 years age spectrum
               (Appendix Figure A3). The rise in children’s employment occurred entirely in
               the sub-group of children combining school and work. The group only in
               employment (i.e., not also attending school) actually declined over the 2005-
               22
                 The 2005 round of the survey collected information on employment only for children aged 7 years and older.
               Earlier survey rounds are not included in the analysis of trends due to comparability issues.
               23
                  Specifically, as discussed above, child labour for children in the 12-14 years age range does not include children
               in light forms of employment.

              2012 period (Figure 15b). Children, in other words, must increasingly
              shoulder the burden of work in addition to their studies. These stark results
              underscore the need for more information on the causes of the rise in
              children’s employment, and the need to adjust policy responses accordingly.

              40. The rise in children’s employment was accompanied by an important
              change in terms of its make-up. As depicted in Figure 16a, the period from
              2005 to 2012 saw a significant decline in the relative importance of
              agricultural work and a major increase in the relative importance of work in
              the service sector. Agriculture as a share of total children’s employment fell
              from 92% in 2005 to 78% in 2012, while services as a share of employment
              rose from four percent to 18% over the same period. These figures, it should
              be emphasised, reflect relative shares: in absolute terms, the period from
              2005 to 2012 saw a dramatic increase in the numbers of working children in
              all sectors (Figure 16b). The distribution of working children by status in
              employment, a reflection of work arrangements remained largely
              unchanged; children were overwhelmingly contributing family workers in
              both 2005 and 2012 (Figure 16c).

 4.3 Characteristics of child labour
         41. Information on the various characteristics of child labourers is necessary
         for understanding the nature of children’s work and children’s role in the
         labour force. This section presents data on broad work characteristics that
         are useful in this context. A breakdown of child labourers by industry is
         reported in order to provide a standardised picture of where children are
         concentrated in the measured economy. A breakdown of child labourers by
         status in employment is reported to provide additional insight into how child
         labour is carried out. Average working hours is looked at as an indirect
         indicator of the possible health and educational consequences of child
         labour.

                        42. The largest share of children in child labour work in agriculture (80%).
                        The predominance of agriculture is a particular concern in light of the fact
                        that this sector is one of the three most dangerous in which to work at any
                        age, along with construction and mining, in terms of work-related fatalities,
                        non-fatal accidents and occupational diseases.24 Services is the second-most
                        important sector (accounting for 16% of children in child labour), followed by
                        manufacturing (3%) (Figure 17a). In terms of status in employment, children
                        are found overwhelmingly in unpaid family work (97%) either on the farm
                        (82%) or elsewhere (15%) (Figure 17b).

                        43. Gender considerations appear to play a role in terms of the nature of the
                        work assigned to children. As reported in Figure 18a, girls are more likely to
                        be tasked with work in the services and commerce sectors, and less likely to
                        be involved in farm work. While both girls and boys are overwhelmingly in
                        family based work arrangements, girls are relatively more likely than their
                        male counterparts to perform family work off the farm (Figure 18b).

                       44. Children aged 5-14 years in child labour log an average of 19 working
                       hours per week (Figure 19). It is noteworthy that working hours do not rise
                       appreciably with age; indeed, even children as young as five years work for
                       14 hours per week and seven year-olds for 19 hours each week on average.
                       Not included in these totals are the additional hours that most children
                       spend each week performing chores within their own homes. The significant
                       working hours logged by even very young children have obvious
                       consequences for their rights to education and leisure. Longer hours also
                       means more exposure to any hazards present in children’s workplaces.

4.4 Child labour in cocoa growing communities
    45. Child labour in the cocoa sector in Ghana has been subject of increased
    international attention and stepped-up programming efforts, spearheaded
    by the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group (CLCCG) under the aegis of the
    2010 Declaration and accompanying Framework of Action signed by the
    Governments of Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana.25 Children’s involvement in the
    cocoa sector in Ghana nonetheless remains a priority child rights concern, as
    discussed in this section and in more detail in a separate forthcoming UCW
    research report.
    46. To offer a preliminary indication of the incidence and evolution of child
    labour in cocoa growing areas we exploit the community level information
    collected in the 2005 and 2012 rounds of the GLSS survey. We define
    communities as cocoa growing if cocoa is one of the major crops grown in
    the community. In this way, 194 rural communities were classified as cocoa
    growing communities in 2012 and 139 in 2005, out of 690 and 376
    respectively.
    47. The statistics reported below refer to the rural areas of Ghana, and are
    broken down by cocoa growing communities and other communities.
    48. It is worth stressing that while the GLSS is representative at national and
    regional levels it is not representative neither at the community level nor of
    the major cocoa growing areas. Nonetheless, the descriptive statistics
    reported below serve as an initial step towards a better understanding of
    children’s activities (employment and schooling) in cocoa and non-cocoa
    growing areas.
    49. Estimates from GLSS 2012 indicate that more than one-third (40%) of
    children living in cocoa growing areas are involved in employment. These
    children number 403,000 in absolute terms, making up more than one-third
    of all children’s employment in rural areas (Table 9). 26




    25
       In September 2010, the Governments of Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, USDOL, and Industry joined as partners to
    sign the Declaration and the accompanying Framework. In the signing of the Declaration and Framework, these
    partners committed to take action to reduce child labour and the worst forms of child labour in cocoa production
    and to the goal of achieving a 70% reduction in the worst forms of child labour in the cocoa sectors of the two
    countries in the aggregate by 2020. The Child Labour Cocoa Coordinating Group (CLCCG) was established to
    coordinate efforts among the partners working under the Declaration and Framework.
    26
      We found similar results when we define an household as cocoa producer if cocoa is one of the major crop
    grown by the farm lands owned or/and operated by household members.

           50. Figure 20a and Figure 20b compare the employment and school
           attendance of children from cocoa-growing communities and from other
           rural communities across the 7-17 years age spectrum. Children’s
           employment is very similar at most ages in cocoa and non-cocoa
           communities. Differences in school attendance are larger and favour children
           in cocoa growing communities. The attendance rate of children from cocoa
           communities is at least 10 percentage points higher than that of children
           from other rural communities across the 7-14 years age spectrum.

             51. Table 9 looks in more detail at the interplay between work and school. It
             indicates that while children from cocoa communities and other
             communities work in roughly equal proportion, children from cocoa
             communities are relatively more likely to do so in combination with
             schooling. A higher proportion of children in other rural communities, on the
             other hand, work at the expense of school attendance. While caution should
             be exercised in reading too much into these descriptive findings, they
             suggest that work in the cocoa sector may be more compatible with school
             attendance than other forms of work performed by children in rural areas.
             This does not mean the cocoa work is not harmful to education in other
             ways, however, as the time and energy required for this work inevitably
             affects the ability of children to benefit from their classroom time and ability
             to study outside of the classroom.

             52. As we have seen in the previous chapters, child labour in Ghana
             increased substantially during period from 2005 to 2012. Figure 21a
             indicates that the rise in the incidence of children working in the cocoa
             communities was even greater than the rise in children’s employment in
             non-cocoa communities during 2005-2012. At the same time, Figure 21b
             reports that the gap in children’s school attendance between cocoa and non-
             cocoa communities narrowed during 2005-2012, but that children in cocoa
             communities still enjoy a substantial advantage in this regard.

                53. In both the cocoa and non-cocoa communities, the overall rise in
                children’s employment can be traced entirely to a rise in the share of
                children combining work and schooling (Figure 22a). The share of children
                working without also attending school, on the other hand, actually declined
                slightly in the cocoa and non-cocoa communities during the 2005-2012
                period (Figure 22b).

                54. Households in cocoa growing areas are less poor than households in
                other rural communities (Figure 23a). It is also noteworthy that a smaller
                share of children working in cocoa growing areas belong to poor households.
                Indeed, as reported in Figure 23b, almost three-quarters (72%) of children

           working in cocoa-growing areas belong to non-poor households against only
           44% of children working in other rural communities. This results suggests
           that labour market demand may be an important driver of children’s work in
           the cocoa sector. Many children work in this sector, in other words, not as a
           necessary household survival strategy but rather because labour market
           conditions make it worthwhile for them to do so.

           55. While the Ghana Living Standards Surveys offer little information about
           the dangers faced by children working in the cocoa sector, a separate
           research report published in 201527 suggests that work in the cocoa sector
           poses a direct threat to children’s health and safety. The report indicates
           that almost all children working in the cocoa sector are in hazardous work
           likely to harm their health, safety or morals. Land clearing, heavy loads, agro-
           chemicals, sharp tools, long working, night work are among the documented
           hazards faced by the child cocoa workers. In light of these facts, it is not
           surprising that the report has also found that work-related injuries among
           children working in the cocoa sector are very high28.

                Th report also found that more than half of these children sustained injuries performing work-related activities.

        ADOLESCENTS AGED 15-17 YEARS



        56. Adolescents aged 15-17 years are of interest to efforts relating to
        both child labour and youth employment. Even though this group is over
        the minimum working age they are still children in legal terms and still
        considered “child labourers” under ILO Conventions Nos. 138 and 182 if
        the work they do is hazardous. In other words, adolescents are legally
        permitted to work but only if this work is not hazardous in nature.
        Hazardous work in adolescence can create huge barriers – educational,
        physical, psychological, social – that impede a young person from
        competing successfully for good jobs in the future. A key goal for policy
        efforts in both the child labour and youth employment fields, therefore,
        should be to remove and prevent adolescents from hazardous jobs. In this
        chapter we address the extent of nature of child labour among children in
        the 15-17 years age range.


 5.1 Involvement in child labour
        57. Child labour in the 15-17 years age range is limited to hazardous and
        other worst forms of work. However, due to data limitations, estimates
        only include hazardous work, which is defined in accordance with Ghana’s
        legislation, i.e., work posing a danger to the health, safety or morals of a
        person (Children’s Act 560, 1998, Sec. 91.2). Hazardous work includes
        going to sea; mining and quarrying; porterage of heavy loads;
        manufacturing industries where chemicals are produced or used; work in
        places where machines are used; and work in places such as bars, hotels
        and places of entertainment where a person may be exposed to immoral
        behaviour (Sec. 91.3)29.

         58. Child labour among 15-17 year-olds is very high in Ghana. As reported
         in Table 11, almost 24% of all children in this age range, 412,000 in
         absolute terms, are engaged in child labour. Differences in involvement
         in child labour by sex and residence are also pronounced for this age
         group. Child labour among adolescents is higher for males – 28% of male
         15-17 year-olds are in child labour against 20% of same-aged females. As
         with younger children, child labour among 15-17 year-olds is in large part
         a rural phenomenon. The share of rural children in this age in child labour
         (34%) is more than twice that of urban children (14%); in absolute terms,
         rural child labourers outnumber their urban counterparts by 168,000
         (290,000 to 122,000).
         59. Another way of viewing the issue of child labour for the 15-17 years
         age group is its importance relative to overall employment for this age
         group. In other words, the share of employed adolescents in this age
         group that are in child labour. Globally, adolescents in hazardous work
         account for 40% of total employed adolescents.30 In Ghana, the figure for
         15-17 year-olds is much higher – almost 55% of those with jobs are in
         child labour (Figure 24). This share of jobs that are hazardous is even
         higher among male adolescents (59%). The high incidence of hazardous
         work among employed 15-17 year-olds is one indication of the size of the
         “decent work deficit” facing this group.31

                    60. Child labourers in the 15-17 years age range account for about one-
                    fifth of total child labourers of all ages in Ghana (Figure 25). This statistic
                    more than any other illustrates how the broad policy goals of eliminating
                    child labour and improving youth employment outcomes intersect for the
                    15-17 years age group. The fact that adolescents constitute such a large
                    component of the overall child labour population means that it will not be
                    possible to achieve child labour elimination without addressing the
                    employment outcomes of this group.

   5.2 Characteristics of child labour
              61. Most adolescents in child labour are working in hazardous conditions
              and for long hours (Figure 26).32 Hazardous conditions are experienced by
              73% of all those in child labour and the long hours by 28% of child
              labourers. This combination of long hours and hazardous conditions is a
              particular concern because the greater the length of time that a child is
              exposed to hazardous conditions the more likely they are to be harmed
              by them.

              62. About three-fourths (76%) of adolescents in child labour are found in
              the agriculture sector (Figure 27a). A distant second in importance is
              commerce, accounting for seven percent of adolescent child labour. It is
              interesting to note that this sectoral composition differs considerably
              from that of employment not constituting child labour for the 15-17 years
              age group. As also reported in Figure 27a, adolescents not in child labour
              are much less likely to be found in agriculture and more likely to be found
              in commerce. Figure 27b reports the distribution of child labourers and

              32
                Recall from Chapter 2 that we considered a number of criteria in estimating hazardous work – hazardous
              conditions, hazardous occupations or industries, night work and long hours. Adolescents are considered to be
              in hazardous work if they are found to be in any one of the following categories: children working in
              designated hazardous industries (mining, quarrying and construction); children working in designated
              hazardous occupations (they refer to the list of hazardous work established by the national legislation);
              children working long hours (42 hours or more per week); children working under other hazardous conditions
              such as night work, using hazardous tools and being in an unhealthy work environment.

               differences are evident: those in child labour are much more likely to be
               in wage work and much less likely to be in non-wage (family) work
               compared to their peers not in child labour.

    CHILDREN’S EMPLOYMENT, CHILD LABOUR AND
    EDUCATION



    63. The degree to which work interferes with children’s schooling is one
    of the most important determinants of the long-term impact of early
    work experience. Reduced educational opportunities constitute the main
    link between child labour, on the one hand, and youth employment
    outcomes, on the other. Clearly, if the exigencies of work mean that
    children are denied schooling altogether or are less able to perform in the
    classroom, then these children will not acquire the human capital
    necessary for decent work upon entering adulthood. This section looks at
    evidence of the impact of children’s work on their education. Links
    between child labour, human capital levels and youth employment
    outcomes in Ghana are explored in more detail in Chapter 7 of this
    report.
    64. One way of viewing the interaction between children’s employment
    and schooling is by decomposing the child population into four non-
    overlapping activity groups – children in employment only, children
    attending school only, children combining school and employment and
    children doing neither. This breakdown shows that 70% of children aged
    5-14 years attend school only, while 22% combine employment and
    school. Only three percent of children aged 5-14 years are exclusively in
    employment, while the remaining five percent are neither studying nor
    working (although likely to be engaged in other productive activities, such
    as household chores) (Table 12).

          65. It is worth noting that the interaction between work and school differs
          considerably between rural and urban children: one third of rural
          students also work, while the share of urban students that also work is
          only 14%. Rural children, in other words, face a double disadvantage in
          terms of schooling: a smaller proportion attends school (88% versus 96%),
          and those that do attend school are more likely to have to shoulder the
          burden of work at the same time.
          66. The interaction between work and school differs considerably for
          adolescents in the 15-17 years age group: a much smaller percentage
          (47%) only studies and a much higher percentage (13%) is in employment
          exclusively; 31% combine both activities and nine percent neither study
          nor work (Table 13). These differences between the 5-14 years and 15-17
          years age cohorts are not surprising as the age of 15 years corresponds
          with the time that adolescents begin their transition from school to
          working life. The difference in activity status between rural and urban
          children is also noteworthy for the 15-17 years age group. Again, rural
          children are less likely to be in school and, among those that are in school,
          more likely to have to work at the same time.

                     67. Child labourers are disadvantaged in terms of being able to attend
                     school. The school attendance gap between child labourers and other
                     children increases with age and is particularly marked at the end of the 5-
                     17 years age spectrum: for the age group 10-14 years, the school
                     attendance of child labourers is 10 percentage points less than that of
                     other children and for the age group 15-17 years their attendance is 15
                     percentage points lower (Figure 28). These figures underscore the
                     importance of child labour as a constraint to achieving universal basic
                     enrolment in the country. Data are not available in Ghana on the
                     regularity of school attendance, i.e. the frequency with which children are
                     absent from or late for class, but attendance regularity is also likely to be
                     adversely affected by involvement in employment.

                                 68. Ghanaian working children also have lower school life expectancy
                                 (SLE). School life expectancy (SLE) provides a measure of the total number
                                 of years of education that a child can be expected to complete. SLE,
                                 reported in Figure 29, indicates that working children entering schooling
                                 can expect to remain there for less time than non-working children. At
                                 each age up to the age of 10 years, the difference in school life
                                 expectancy is about one year. Differences in school life expectancy
                                 diminish after this age, but nonetheless continue to favour non-working
                                 children. This illustrates the different paths taken by working children
                                 attending school compared to their non-working peers. The former are
                                 more likely to drop out prematurely and transition into full-time work at
                                 an earlier age.

                                 69. There remains a significant share of children who are not in school,
                                 particularly at the upper end of the compulsory school age spectrum. The
                                 share of children who are out of school falls throughout the primary
                                 school age range but begins to rise thereafter, reaching 10% at the age of
                                 14 years (Figure 30). This pattern suggests that late entry is a key driver of
                                 school non-attendance in the primary cycle33 while drop-out gains in
                                 importance thereafter. In all, about eight percent of children in the
                                 compulsory schooling age range of 6-14 years, 485,000 children in
                                 absolute terms, are out of school.

                                 entering the system late than are dropping out prematurely.

Notes: (a) Compulsory schooling in Ghana begins at age four and is 11 years in duration. The school system is comprised of a 2-year pre-primary
cycle, a 6-year primary cycle, a 3-year lower secondary cycle and a (non-compulsory) 3-year upper secondary cycle (Source: UNESCO Institute of
Statistics).

                   70. Why are children outside of the school system? Feedback from
                   children themselves points to the importance of both supply- and
                   demand-side factors (Figure 31). More than one-third of out-of-school
                   children do not go to school because it is either too far away (19%) or too
                   expensive (17%). An additional 15% cite a lack of interest in studying as
                   the primary motive for being out of school, a response likely driven in
                   important part by perceptions of school quality and relevance. On the
                   demand-side of the schooling equation, 12% of out-of-school children are
                   not allowed by their parents to attend school, and 20% are out of school
                   in order to work as an unpaid worker (11%) or to perform household
                   chores (9%). Ten percent of out-of-school children indicate being too
                   young to attend school, suggesting a lack of awareness of the starting age
                   for compulsory schooling.34

                    71. The reasons for not attending school appear to be influenced by
                    gender. As reported in Figure 31, girls’ school attendance is relatively
                    more likely to be constrained by school costs, by negative parental
                    attitudes towards schooling and by the need to perform household
                    chores. For boys, school distance, lack of interest and unpaid work play a

                    72. Reaching out-of-school children with second chance educational
                    opportunities is important to ensuring that they do not graduate into
                    adulthood lacking the basic skills needed for work and life. Table 14,

children, suggests that second chance learning needs are significant.
Limiting our focus to out-of-school children aged 10-14 years,35 some
158,000, or 66% of the total out-of-school children in this age range,
suffer what UNESCO terms “education poverty”, i.e., possess less than
four years of education, the minimum amount of school time considered
by UNESCO as necessary for acquiring basic literacy skills. Of this group,
136,000, or 57% of total out-of-school children aged 10-14 years, suffer
“extreme education poverty”, i.e., possess less than two years of
schooling. It is likely that the education poverty indicator actually
underestimates second chance learning needs as basic literacy skills alone
are a less and less adequate “skills floor” for successful entry into the
Ghanaian labour market.




35
  A minimum age of 10, rather than six, years is used in light of the fact that many out-of-school children
aged 6-9 years are late-entrants, i.e., not currently in school but likely to enter school in the future.

Chapter 7.
       YOUNG PERSONS AGED 15-34 YEARS



       73. This chapter focuses on the labour market situation of Ghanaian
       youth. In accordance with the country’s National Youth Policy (2010),
       youth is defined as those in the age range from 15 to 34 years.36 Using
       data from the labour force module of the sixth round of the Ghana Labour
       Standards Survey undertaken in 2012 (GLSS 2012), the chapter first
       provides an overview of the activity status of Ghanaian young persons
       and then looks in more detail at job access and job quality and at how
       human capital levels influence both. The definitions of the key labour
       market indicators used in this chapter are presented in Panel 2.


Panel 2. Youth employment definitions
Labour force participation: The labour force participation rate is defined as the labour force expressed as a
percentage of the working age population. The labour force is in turn the sum of the number of persons
employed and the number of persons unemployed.
Employment: A person is considered employed if he or she worked during the week prior to the survey for
at least one hour for pay (or without pay), profit, in kind, or family business. A person is also considered to
be in employment if he or she was not working but had a job to go back to.
Unemployment: A person is considered unemployed if he or she did not work during the week prior to the
survey but is actively seeking work and is available for work.
Underemployment: A person is considered underemployed if he or she is working less than 35 hours. The
underemployment rate is the underemployed expressed as a percentage of the total employed population.
Inactive: A person is considered inactive if he or she is not in the labour force. The inactivity rate and labour
force participation rate sum to 100.
NEET: A person is categorized as NEET if he or she is not in education, employment or training. NEET is
therefore a measure that reflects both youth who are inactive and out of education as well as youth who
are unemployed.




 7.1 Youth labour force status: the overall picture
       74. Seventy-one percent of Ghanaian youth are in the labour force and
       31% are continuing with their education (Table 15). The two activities are
       not of course mutually exclusive: 12% of all youth continue in education
       after entering the labour force (Appendix Table A5). A substantial share of
       youth – 10% – are absent from both education and the labour force.

       36
         The policy defines “youth” as “persons who are within the age bracket of fifteen (15) and thirty-five (35)”
       (Sec. 3.2). However, the policy states that the following age categories of youth are considered: 15-19 years,
       20-24 years, 25-29 years, and 30-34 years (Sec. 3.4). This chapter therefore utilises the age range 15-34 years.

          Among those in the labour force, six percent are unemployed. “NEET”
          youth, who include both unemployed youth and youth absent from
          education and the labour force, make up 14% of the youth population.

          75. The youth definition in Ghana, however, covers a wider age spectrum
          (i.e., 15-34 years) and the headline labour force statistics for Ghanaian
          youth should be interpreted with this mind. The youth labour force
          picture changes considerably if we restrict our focus to the narrower 15-
          24 years age cohort used in most international statistics on youth
          employment. As reported in Table 15, labour force participation is much
          lower for this cohort (57%) while education participation is much higher
          (50%). Rates of NEET (16%) and unemployment (8%) are also higher
          among youth in the 15-24 years age cohort. The headline labour force
          statistics for the 15-34 years age range also mask large variations by
          residence and sex, as also reported in Table 15 and discussed in more
          detail in the remaining sections of this chapter.
          76. Comparable labour force statistics for one earlier point in time –2005
          – suggest a gradual improvement in the youth employment situation in
          the country. As reported in Figure 32, youth participation in education
          rose steadily over the 2005-2012 period (from 25% in 2005 and to 31% in
          2012), while the youth unemployment and NEET rates were almost
          halved over the same period. The youth employment ratio rose from 55%
          in 2005 to almost 67% in 2012. A breakdown of these changes by age
          cohorts indicates that they have been most pronounced among younger,

               77. The rise in the employment ratio was accompanied by a change in the
               composition of employment. As reported in Figure 33 and in Figure 34,
               this change involved a significant shift from the agriculture sector to the
               service sector, and from self-employment in agriculture to paid
               employment. Moreover, the increase in jobs was mostly due to an
               increase of jobs in the service sector, which is also reflected in the
               increase in paid employment. However, the agriculture sector still
               accounted for half of all youth jobs in 2012, as discussed further later in
               the chapter.

 7.2 Youth access to jobs
        78. This section focuses on youth labour market challenges as reflected
        by lack of access to jobs. Two main groups of young people are looked at
        in this context: youth not in education and not in the labour force; and
        unemployed youth. Taken together, these groups constitute the “NEET”
        youth population.37 Young people who are neither attaining marketable
        skills in school nor in the labour force, and particularly male youth in this
        group, frequently find themselves at the margins of society and more
        vulnerable to risky and violent behaviour. At a macro-economic level, they
        constitute unutilised productive capacity and a constraint to growth,
        especially as NEET youth enjoy higher level of education than non-NEET
        youth (Figure A6). Other risks borne by unemployed youth are also well-
        documented: unemployment can permanently impair their productive
        potential and therefore influence lifetime patterns of employment, pay
        and job tenure.




        37
          NEET is an acronym for “not in employment, education or training”; NEET is increasingly being used as an
        indicator of youth marginalisation and labour market difficulties.

                79. Almost 10% of all youth are not in education or in the labour force
                (Figure 35). This figure is driven primarily by female youth, who are nearly
                twice as likely to be inactive and out of school than male youth (13%
                versus 7%). The gender gap is in turn the result of both a lower level of
                labour force participation (69% versus 73%) and lower education
                participation (27% versus 36%) among female youth.                  Again, the
                differences between youth in the standard 15-24 years range and older
                youth are also noteworthy: those in the “younger” youth cohorts are
                much more likely to be inactive and out of education. Residence appears
                to be another important factor. The share of youth who are inactive and
                out of education is one-third higher among urban youth compared to
                their rural counterparts. This is in turn a reflection of the different nature
                of the rural and urban youth labour markets in Ghana, a point discussed
                further below.
                80. Six percent of young persons in the labour force are unable to secure
                jobs (Figure 36). This youth unemployment rate, although not high by
                global standards,38 is nonetheless three times that of Ghanaian adults
                (Appendix Figure A7), pointing to the existence of special barriers to
                youth employment in the country. Not all youth, however, face the same
                risk of unemployment - differences in youth unemployment by residence
                and age are especially marked. Unemployment is much more common in
                urban areas (9%) than in rural ones (4%), despite the lower levels of
                labour force participation in the former. In terms of age, unemployment

                38
                  According to ILO estimates, the global youth unemployment rate stood at 12.6 percent in 2013 (Source: ILO
                (2013), Global Employment Trends for Youth 2013: A generation at risk / International Labour Office ‐
                Geneva).

                       81. Fourteen percent of Ghanaian young persons are not engaged in
                       education, employment or training, a group expressed by the acronym
                       “NEET”. The group of NEET youth consists of both youths who are
                       unemployed and youth who are inactive and out of education, and
                       therefore NEET is a more comprehensive measure for assessing youth
                       labour market difficulties. The NEET concept is accordingly being
                       increasingly used in youth labour market statistics, particularly in
                       industrialised countries. Patterns by sex, age and residence are similar to
                       those for unemployment. The incidence of youth in the NEET category is
                       much higher for urban youth (17%), for female youth (18%) and for youth
                       in the 20-24 years age cohort (20%).

      7.3 Youth job characteristics
            82. Obtaining a job is of course an insufficient condition for successful
            labour market outcomes. This is because in countries such as Ghana
            where poverty is widespread, many youths simply cannot afford to
            remain without work altogether and must accept jobs regardless of the
            conditions and pay associated with them. The policy concern is not
            limited to whether young people are working but also extends to whether
            the jobs constitute decent work, offer a path for advancement and route
            out of poverty.

Panel 3. ILO and Decent Work
Decent work sums up the aspirations of people in their working lives. It involves opportunities for work that is productive
and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal
development and social integration, freedom for people to express their concerns, organize and participate in the
decisions that affect their lives and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men.
The Decent Work concept was formulated by the ILO’s constituents – governments and employers and workers – as a
means to identify the Organization’s major priorities. It is based on the understanding that work is a source of personal
dignity, family stability, peace in the community, democracies that deliver for people, and economic growth that expands
opportunities for productive jobs and enterprise development.
Promoting Decent work for all
The ILO has developed a Decent Work Agenda for the community of work. It provides support through integrated Decent
Work Country Programmes developed in coordination with its constituents. Putting the Decent Work Agenda into
practice is achieved through the implementation of the ILO's four strategic objectives, with gender equality as a
crosscutting objective:
Creating jobs – an economy that generates opportunities for investment, entrepreneurship, skills development, job
creation and sustainable livelihoods.
Guaranteeing rights at work – to obtain recognition and respect for the rights of workers. All workers, and in particular
disadvantaged or poor workers, need representation, participation, and laws that work for their interests.
Extending social protection – to promote both inclusion and productivity by ensuring that women and men enjoy
working conditions that are safe, allow adequate free time and rest, take into account family and social values, provide
for adequate compensation in case of lost or reduced income and permit access to adequate healthcare.
Promoting social dialogue – Involving strong and independent workers’ and employers' organizations is central to
increasing productivity, avoiding disputes at work, and building cohesive societies.
Making Decent Work a global goal and a national reality
The overall goal of Decent Work is to effect positive change in people’s lives at the national and local levels. The ILO
provides support through integrated Decent Work Country Programmes developed in coordination with ILO constituents.
They define the priorities and the targets within national development frameworks and aim to tackle major Decent Work
deficits through efficient programmes that embrace each of the strategic objectives.
The ILO operates with other partners within and beyond the UN family to provide in-depth expertise and key policy
instruments for the design and implementation of these programmes. It also provides support for building the
institutions needed to carry them forward and for measuring progress. The balance within these programmes differs
from country to country, reflecting their needs, resources and priorities.
Progress also requires action at the global level. The Decent Work agenda offers a basis for a more just and sustainable
framework for global development. The ILO works to develop “decent work”-oriented approaches to economic and
social policy in partnership with the principal institutions and actors of the multilateral system and the global economy.

83. Securing decent work, in other words, rather than work per se, is the
desired goal of the transition to working life, and therefore we need to
assess youth jobs against basic decent work criteria for a more complete
picture of labour market success.
84. Effectively measuring decent work is critical to assessing the
employment outcomes of young persons. Yet, the multifaceted nature of
the decent work concept – it combines access to full and productive
employment with rights at work, social protection and the promotion of
social dialogue – means that measurement is a complex task. This is
especially the case for the current report, because the data utilised only
contain limited information on current job characteristics. This section
presents the few available indicators of job characteristics in order to
provide a partial picture of the extent to which youth jobs constitute
decent work.
85. Youth underemployment,39 sometimes referred to as “hidden
unemployment”, affects over one-third (38%) of all Ghanaian youth with
jobs (Figure 38). The underemployment rate rises to 63% for youth in the
15-19 years age range, suggesting that part-time work is common entry
point in the labour market for youth. It is interesting to note that
underemployment is much higher in rural areas (46%) compared to urban
ones (30%), the opposite of the pattern seen for unemployment and
NEET. Rural youth, it follows, have an easier time securing work, but this
work is more likely to be only part-time in nature. The youth
underemployment rate in the agriculture sector, where much of rural
youth employment is concentrated, stands at 55%.




39
 Time-related underemployment, as the only component of underemployment to date that has been agreed
on and properly defined within the international community of labour statisticians, is the best available proxy
of the underutilized labour force. The time-related-underemployed as share of total employment is measured
as those who work less than 35 hours per week. The underemployment rate is defined here as the number of
employed persons in situations of underemployment expressed as a percentage of total persons in
employment.

               86. Youth are concentrated overwhelmingly in low-skill jobs, another
               indicator of their decent work deficit. Figure 39 reports the
               decomposition of youth jobs by skills requirements based on the four
               standardised International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO)
               skills. It shows that 92% of all youth jobs fall into either the lowest skills
               category (6%)40 or the second lowest skill category (86%).41 Low-skill jobs
               are slightly more common for employed female youth: almost 95% must
               settle for jobs in the lowest two ISCO skill categories compared to 89% of
               employed male youth. Low-skill jobs are more common for rural youth
               (97%) but also account for most (87%) of jobs held by urban youth
               (Appendix Figure A8). As discussed further in the next section of this
               chapter, the majority of even the most educated group of youth with
               tertiary education manage to only secure low-skill jobs (in the lowest two
               skills categories).

 Notes: Definitions of each of the four ISCO skill levels are as follows:

  Skill Level 1. Occupations at Skill Level 1 typically require the performance of simple and routine physical or manual tasks. They may
 require the use of hand held tools, such as shovels, or of simple electrical equipment, such as vacuum cleaners. They involve tasks such as
 cleaning; digging; lifting and carrying materials by hand; sorting, storing or assembling goods by hand (sometimes in the context of
 mechanised operations): operating non-motorised vehicles; and picking fruit and vegetables. Many occupations at Skill Level 1 may require
 physical strength and/or endurance. For some jobs basic skills in literacy and numeracy may be required. If required these skills would not be
 a major part of the job;

  Skill Level 2. Occupations at Skill Level 2 typically involve the performance of tasks such as operating machinery and electronic equipment;
 driving vehicles; maintenance and repair of electrical and mechanical equipment; and manipulation, ordering and storage of information. For
 almost all occupations at Skill Level 2 the ability to read information such as safety instructions, to make written records of work completed,
 and to accurately perform simple arithmetical calculations is essential. Many occupations at this skill level require relatively advanced literacy
 and numeracy skills and good interpersonal communication skills. In some occupations, these skills are required for a major part of the work.
 Many occupations at this skill level require a high level of manual dexterity.

  Skill Level 3. Occupations at Skill Level 3 typically involve the performance of complex technical and practical tasks that require an
 extensive body of factual, technical and procedural knowledge in a specialised field. Occupations at this skill level generally require a high
 level of literacy and numeracy and well developed interpersonal communication skills. These skills may include the ability to understand
 complex written material, prepare factual reports and communicate with people who are distressed.

  Skill Level 4. Occupations at Skill Level 4 typically involve the performance of tasks that require complex problem solving and decision-
 making based on an extensive body of theoretical and factual knowledge in a specialised field. The tasks performed typically include analysis
 and research to extend the body of human knowledge in a particular field, diagnosis and treatment of disease, imparting knowledge to others,
 design of structures or machinery and of processes for construction and production. Occupations at this skill level generally require extended
 levels of literacy and numeracy, sometimes at a very high level, and excellent interpersonal communication skills. These skills generally
 include the ability to understand complex written material and communicate complex ideas in media such as books, reports and oral
 presentations.

           87. Employed youth are concentrated overwhelmingly in non-
           remunerated jobs in the informal economy. Figure 40, which reports the
           status in employment of working youth, indicates that only around one in
           five youth jobs (22%) are in paid employment while the remainder involve
           a variety of informal work arrangements. Female youth are especially
           disadvantaged in this regard – only 14% of their jobs are remunerated.
           About 44% youth jobs involve either family-based farm work (29%) or
           self-employed farm work (14%), 20% of jobs involve self-employment off
           the farm, and the remaining jobs are distributed across non-farm family
           work (6%), apprentice work (5%) and casual work (3%). As emphasized by
           the ILO, although it is hard to generalize concerning the quality of

               informal employment arrangements, they often mean lack of adequate
               protection, unsafe working conditions and the absence of social benefits
               such as pensions, sick pay and health insurance.42 At the same time, while
               more formal paid job arrangements make it more likely that a worker
               enjoys a fair income, security in the workplace, social protection and
               other attributes of decent work, this type of job is by no means a
               guarantee of decent work.

Panel 4. Where youth jobs are concentrated in the economy
Sector of employment also provides insight into the nature of work performed by youth and to the question of decent
work. Youth jobs are divided across services, agriculture, and manufacturing in Ghana. Agriculture and services (the latter
includes commerce, transport and domestic work) each account for about 42% of employed youth, while about 10% are
in manufacturing and the remainder are spread across mining and quarrying, electricity, gas and water, construction
(Figure A). A small share of services sector jobs (about 17%) require higher-level skills (ISCO skills categories 3 and 4). The
remainder of service sector jobs, as well as almost all jobs performed by youth in agriculture and manufacturing, are low-
skill in nature (ISCO skills categories 1 and 2) (Figure B).

       7.4 Human capital and youth employment outcomes
              88. The most obvious connection between child labour and poor youth
              labour market outcomes is through compromised education. In Chapter 6
              of the Report, evidence was presented indicating that child labour is
              associated with compromised education. This section, in turn, looks at
              the role of education in youth labour market outcomes.43
              89. Levels of human capital remain low for many Ghanaian young people,
              compromising their future prospects. Forty-one percent of young persons

                A lack of longitudinal data and/or of retrospective questions on involvement in work as children prevents
              exploring the link between youth employment outcomes and child labour involvement directly.

               (12%). Low human capital is especially pronounced in rural areas, where
               57% have primary or less education, and among female youth, among
               whom almost half (47%) have limited or no education (Figure 41). A
               number of regions also lag behind national averages in this regard – the
               share of youth with primary or less education is greatest in the Northern
               (78%), Upper West (69%) and Upper East (61%) regions.

               90. Level of education is clearly linked with job quality. Figure 42 reports
               the composition of youth employment by level of education. It shows that
               the likelihood of wage work and of work in the services sector both rise
               consistently with more education, while work in informal arrangements
               and in agriculture move in the opposite direction. Involvement in wage
               employment rises from eight percent among those with least education
               to 83% among those with most education. Similarly, work in the services
               sector goes from 26% for the least educated to 87% for those with higher
               education. As discussed in the next section, educated youth are not
               surprisingly also likely to be found in jobs requiring higher skills, although
               a large share of even educated youth must settle for low-skill jobs.

             91. Higher education is associated with a very large earnings premium.
             Figure 43, which reports average labour income of young employees by
             education level, shows that successive levels of educational attainment
             are associated with higher earnings for male and female youth alike. The
             premium associated with higher education is especially large – those with
             higher education can expect to be paid more than twice that of youth
             with secondary education and five times that of youth with no education.
             Econometric evidence confirms the importance of higher education as a
             determinant of earnings (Annex Table A6).44




             44
               A wage equation was estimated in order to assess the importance of education and other individual and
             household characteristics on earnings of employees. Estimation results, Annex Table A6, indicate that the

                 92. The wage premiums associated with education enjoyed by male youth
                 are much higher than those enjoyed by female youth, another indicator
                 of the relative disadvantage that female youth face in the labour market
                 (Figure 44). However, the differences in wage premium by sex tend to
                 decline as the level of education increases and disappear for youth
                 equipped with tertiary education.

                 93. In summary, the balance of evidence points to substantial returns to
                 education in the labour market. The jobs that educated young persons
                 secure are likely to be of better quality and better paid. The positive links
                 between education and employment outcomes has important

           implications in terms of trade-offs between child labour and education
           earlier in the lifecycle. Theory and evidence suggests that positive returns
           to education can have an important feedback effect on parents’ decisions
           to invest in children’s education.45 In situations where there are
           opportunities for better paid jobs for educated young persons, parents
           have greater incentive to invest in their children’s schooling, and to not
           send their children to work prematurely.


7.5 Skills mismatches
           94. Skills mismatch is defined as the difference between workers’ skills
           (proxied by the level of education attainment) and the job/tasks actually
           performed. This decomposition of youth jobs by skills intensity, reported
           in Figure 45, shows that young people with up to and including secondary
           education are concentrated overwhelming in low-skill jobs. The picture
           changes somewhat for most-educated youth, but even in this group
           almost one-third (31%) are in jobs in the two lowest skill classifications.

           95. Under-education in particular appears to be a concern among young
           workers. Figure 46 looks at the issue of skills mismatches in more detail. It
           indicates that half of young workers are under-educated, i.e., have

     NATIONAL RESPONSES TO CHILD LABOUR AND
     YOUTH EMPLOYMENT CONCERNS



 8.1 Responses to child labour

8.1.1 National legal framework for child labour
     96. The Government of Ghana has made a number of important
     commitments in the area of child labour. Among the international legal
     instruments relating to children and child labour that the country has
     signed or ratified are the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
     Child (1989) and its two optional protocols,46 ILO Convention No. 138 on
     Minimum Age (1973), ILO Convention No. 182 on Worst Forms of Child
     Labour (1999) and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the
     Child (1990). Others are the ILO Forced Labour Convention (No. 29), the
     Abolition of Forced Labour Convention (No. 105), the United Nations
     Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice and
     the ILO Convention on Labour Inspection (No. 81). These international
     legal standards have been domesticated through Ghana’s national
     Constitution and more than 40 national laws.47
     97. At the apex of Ghana’s legal framework for realizing the rights of
     children is the 1992 Constitution. It provides the foundation and guidance
     for developing and amending all other laws of the state for the protection
     of children. Article 15 of the constitution speaks to the inviolability of the
     dignity of all persons. Other relevant articles include article 16, which
     prohibits slavery or servitude and forced labour; article 17 on non-
     discrimination; and articles 25 and 28 on children’s rights. The latter
     provides a framework for the enactment of laws on child care (including
     education, health and physical welfare), protection of children from
     engaging in work that is detrimental to their health, education and
     development as well as protection of the family as a unit of society.
     Article 38 spells out educational objectives towards the progressive
     realization of accessible, equitable and appropriate quality education
     system in Ghana.
     98. The Children’s Act (Act 560, 1998) has been described as “the main
     thrust of legislative reform concerning children” since the 1992

     46
        Optional Protocol on sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and involvement of children

Constitution came into existence.48 It is “An Act to reform and consolidate
the law relating to children, to provide for the rights of the child,
maintenance and adoption, regulate child labour and apprenticeship, for
ancillary matters concerning children generally and to provide for related
matters”.49 Section 5 of the Act proscribes the engagement of children in
labour that is exploitative. It defines exploitative work as work that
deprives the child of its health, education or development. Furthermore,
the Act defines hazardous work as work that poses danger to the health,
safety or morals of a person. Examples cited include going to sea, mining
and quarrying, porterage of heavy loads and work in manufacturing
industries where chemicals are used. The rest are workplaces where
machines are used and work in bars and other entertainment centres
which potentially exposes children to immoral behavior. Light work on the
other hand is defined as any work that is not harmful to the health or
development of a child and that does not interfere with school
attendance or a child’s ability to benefit from school work. In line with ILO
conventions, the Children’s Act defines the minimum age for admission
into employment as 15 years, 13 years for light work and 18 years for
hazardous work.
99. Human Trafficking Act (Act 694, 2005) prohibits the trafficking of all
persons including children. Section 18 (4) of the Act indicates that the
best interest of the child shall be taken into consideration in a bid to
rescue, re-habilitate and reintegrate a trafficked child. Other statutes that
form part of the legal framework for addressing child labour and youth
employment in Ghana include the Labour Act (Act 651, 2003), which
prohibits forced labour and hazardous work, Labour Regulations (L.I. 1833,
2007), which regulates employment of young persons and prohibits
trafficking, the Children’s Rights Regulations (L.I. 1705, 2002), which
devotes a section to child labour, the Juvenile Justice Act (2003), which
provides a framework for addressing children involved in breaches with
the law, and the Education Act (Act 778, 2008).
100. While significant progress has been made in developing a
comprehensive legal framework, this framework is not yet complete.
Stakeholders in this context, for example, cite the need for greater clarity
concerning hazardous work and for greater attention to legal standards
governing work performed by adolescents aged 15-17 year-olds (see also
discussion in Section 9.1.5).

8.1.2 National policies and programmes relating to child labour
        101. The fourth republican era, heralded by the coming into force of the
        country’s 1992 Constitution, saw a return to democratic rule, the
        development of democratic institutions and the consolidation popular
        participation. Besides the Vision 2020, a perspective plan launched in
        1996, Ghana’s development policy landscape during the period has been
        shaped by the Poverty Reduction Strategy series including the Ghana
        Poverty Reduction Strategy I (2003-2005), Growth and Poverty Reduction
        Strategy II (2006-2009), Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda
        (2010-2013), Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social
        Development Policies (2014-2020) and its offshoot – the Ghana Shared
        Growth and Development Agenda II (2014 -17). These frameworks
        espoused human development as a central theme. The latest of them are
        described below.
        102. The Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development
        Policies (CPESDP, 2014-2020) presents medium to long-term term national
        policy objectives and priorities in four key areas: investing in people,
        building a strong and resilient economy, expanding infrastructure services
        and promoting transparent, accountable and responsive governance. The
        Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA II, 2014-2017)
        represents an “operational framework” for the CPESPD and thus a
        medium-term development policy framework for the country.50 Key focus
        areas and issues captured include strengthening social development and
        social protection mechanisms, promoting effective child development and
        protection and addressing high levels of youth unemployment and under-
        employment.

Panel 5. Actors involved in the fight against child labour
The government of Ghana has been spearheading its child labour efforts mainly through sectoral Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and the National Steering Committee on Child Labour (NSCCL). The key
MDAs, who are also members of the NSCCL include the Ministry of Employment and Labour relations (including
the Labour Department, which hosts the Child Labour Unit); Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection;
Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. Others are the Ministry of Local Government
and Rural Development, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Lands and Mines, Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning (including Ghana Statistical Service), NDPC, among others. The about 40 member NSCCL further hosts
civil society organizations; workers’ and employers’ organizations; and development partners including ILO and
UNICEF, who have an observer status. The committee is primarily responsible for coordinating and monitoring
child labour interventions in the country. At the sub-national level, the Metropolitan, Municipal and District
Assemblies play a vital role either through established child protection committees or through key departments
such as Social Welfare/Development and Education. This is complemented by the work of non-governmental
organizations and other civil society groupings. Civil society coalitions and organizations such as the Ghana NGO


        50
           It is crafted around 7 thematic areas: ensuring and sustaining macroeconomic stability, enhancing the
        competitiveness of the private sector, accelerated agricultural modernization and sustainable natural
        resource management, oil and gas development, infrastructure and human settlements development, human
        development, productivity and decent work, and transparency, responsiveness and accountable governance.

Coalition on Child Rights, Ghana National Education Campaign Coalition, International Cocoa Initiative, World

 Cocoa Foundation, Child Rights International, Mondelez International, Afri Kids, Challenging Heights,
Amarjaro/Source Trust and the media play diverse roles ranging from sensitization to providing direct services
such as provision of school supplies to children, distribution of teaching and learning materials, provision of
social infrastructure and the implementation of community livelihood programmes . Key development partners
involved in the fight against child labor in Ghana include United States Department of Labour, ILO, UNICEF,
WFP, Canadian Government, Department for International Development, World Bank, among others.
The National Plan of Action on Child Labour defines the roles of lead and collaborating state and non-state
institutions involved in the fight against child labour.



        103. The country’s first attempt to develop a comprehensive national
        plan on children was in 1992, following the ratification of the UNCRC and
        the country’s participation in the World Summit for Children in 1990.51
        Since then, several policies and plans have been developed to deal with
        the special needs of children and youth.52
        104. The National Plan of Action against Child Labour (NPA, 2009-2015)
        represents the country’s first coordinated framework for the prevention
        and elimination of child labour and its worst forms. Endorsed by Cabinet
        in 2009, the overall goal of the NPA is to “reduce the worst forms of child
        labour to the barest minimum by 2015, while laying strong social, policy
        and institutional foundation for the elimination and prevention of all
        forms of child labour in the longer term”.53 Among the priorities
        addressed by the NPA are the enforcement of laws; broad-based
        awareness raising and mobilization; establishment of standard
        procedures and protocols for dealing with child abuse and exploitation;
        and the development of institutional capacities for effective application of
        standards and procedures. Each of the critical issues are further explored
        under an objective, a presentation of actions required, the lead and
        collaborating agencies responsible for action as well as the timelines for
        implementation envisaged. As the final year of implementation draws to
        close, a review of the current plan and the development of a new one are
        currently underway.

          The 10-year plan was to project a “long-term perspective” for the development of children, especially those
        15 years or younger, identified as the most vulnerable. (Source: Republic of Ghana, 1992, The Child Cannot

Panel 6. The Cocoa Communities Project (CCP)
Titled “Towards child labour free cocoa growing communities in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana through an integrated
area based approach”, the CCP project exemplifies the merits of sustained collaboration involving the
governments of both countries, the International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour of ILO,
Workers’ Unions, Employers’ Unions, CSO partners, the media and local citizens, including children. The four -
year project commenced in December 2010 with financial support from the United States Department of Labor
(USDoL) under the Declaration of Joint Action to Support Implementation of the Harkin-Engel Protocol, which
provides a Framework of Action for accelerating efforts towards the reduction of the worst forms of child
labour in the production of cocoa in Ghana and Cote D’Ivoire. The five re-enforcing objectives of the project
included creating awareness and implementing community action plans, improving access to quality education,
enhancing sustainable livelihoods within cocoa-growing communities, deploying an appropriate child labour
monitoring system (GLCMS in Ghana and SOSTECI in RCI) and improving the technical and institutional capacity
of partner organizations.
The implementation of the CCP project represents a successful testing of new and improved methods of
addressing child labour and a contribution to the NPA of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, using an Integrated Area-
Based Approach. Its design benefited from ILO’s past experiences with child labour elimination efforts in
various contexts. An evaluation of the project revealed improved technical capacity of ILO constituents and
partner organizations to address child labour and its worst forms, increased level of efficiency in meeting and in
some cases exceeding project targets (over 5,400 children in or at risk of child labour provided with educational
and vocational services and more than 2,200 households reached with livelihood services), improvement in
school infrastructure, adequate integration of gender issues, among others. Some of the key recommendations
for sustaining achievements included the need to scale-up the project interventions, in addition to reinforcing
community involvement towards strengthening and sustaining a community-based approach to addressing
child labour.



        105. The development of a Hazardous Activity Framework (HAF) for
        Ghana54 represented an important step in meeting the ILO Convention
        182 requirement of clarifying the sectors and type of work that
        constitutes hazardous activity for children.55 Its development was also in
        direct response to a gap identified in the NPA on the need to “… develop
        a framework that will clearly provide for the identification of hazardous
        tasks or activities within each of the identified sectors.”56 It provides a list
        of 34 activities or circumstances considered to be hazardous and 17
        priority hazardous occupations.57 These serve as the building blocks of the
        framework and thus helped to determine forms of work that are
        permissible for children versus those that are not. In addition, a sector
        specific HAF exists for the cocoa industry. This was published in 2008 as
        part of the roll out of the National Programme for the Elimination of Child
        Labour in Cocoa (NPECLC). The cocoa HAF was also developed in response
        to international concerns on the involvement of children in cocoa

agriculture in Ghana and how that was potentially aggravating the child
labour situation (see Panel 6).
106. The discussion around a Child Labour Monitoring (CLM) system
began in the 1990s in fulfilment of national development aspirations and
obligations under international laws. Since then, child labour monitoring
has evolved through upgrading and scaling-up and a national conference
in 2010 was organized to review, harmonize and standardize the design,
operations and management of the Child Labour Monitoring System. The
output of this conference was the Ghana Child Labour Monitoring System
(GCLMS), launched in 2012. The GCLMS involves direct observations,
repeated regularly, to identify child labourers and to determine risks to
which children are exposed, to refer child labourers to services, to verify
that they have been removed and to track them to ensure that they have
satisfactory and sustainable alternatives. 58
107. A set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) was developed to
provide to stakeholders, information, standard procedures and guidelines
for identifying, rescuing, rehabilitating, family tracing, re-integrating and
providing support to children involved in the worst forms of child
labour.59 It relies on international and national laws as well as the HAF in
defining permissible and non-permissible activities. It further provides a
host of supplementary information including available public and private
shelters for children throughout the country. The SOP is a key response to
the NPA’s objective of harmonizing standards and procedures for
addressing the worst forms of child labour. The National Children and
Family Welfare Policy60 and the Orphans and Vulnerable Children’s Policy
(and accompanying National Action Plan)61 also deal with the protection of
vulnerable children.

   The main goal of the policy is to create a more culturally-sensitive framework for developing child and
family welfare programmes and activities that effectively prevent and protect children from all forms of
violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. The seven specific objectives outlined to achieve the goal include
ensuring effective coordination of a child and family welfare system at all levels; empowering children and
families to better understand abusive situations and therefore make choices to prevent and respond to
situations of risk; building capacity of institutions and service providers to ensure quality of services for
children and families in urban and rural areas; and reforming existing laws and policies to conform to the child
and family welfare system. The policy looks at both the formal (i.e. regulated by laws, policies and delivery of
services by state agencies) and informal (delivered by community and traditional systems) child and family
welfare system.
61
  In 2005, the Government of Ghana developed the National Policy Guidelines on Orphans and other Children
made Vulnerable by HIV/AIDs, which later culminated in the development of a three-year National Action
Plan on Orphans and Vulnerable Children (2010-2012). The plan seeks to protect children from vulnerable
conditions and reduce their risk of being abused. The plan identifies three strategies – preventative,
protective and transformative - in addressing vulnerability among children. The preventive strategy aims at
supporting vulnerable children with social protection, health and early child hood development interventions
as a means of keeping them with their families in their respective communities. The protective strategy aims
at providing remediation for children who are separated, exploited or at risk in a bid to re-uniting them with

  8.1.3 Education policies and programmes
             108. Ghana has undertaken numerous education reforms of direct
             relevance to improving the relevance of schooling as an alternative to
             child labour.62 Among the key policies and plans shaping Ghana’s
             educational system since the 1992 Constitution are the Free Compulsory
             Universal Basic Education Programme,63 the Capitation Grants Policy,64
             Early Child Hood Care Development Policy and the Education Strategic
             Plans (2003-2015, 2010-2020).

Panel 7. Structure of Ghana’s educational system
 Ghana’s education system can be described as having a 2-6-3-3-4 structure: 2 years of Kindergarten, 6 years of primary, 3 years of
 Junior High School, 3 years of Senior High School and 3 to 4 years of tertiary education. The period spanning Kindergarten to Junior
 High School constitutes basic education.

             their families or providing special care. The transformative strategy aims at enhancing the capacity of state

coming into force of this Constitution, draw up a programme for
implementation within the following ten years, for the provision of free,
compulsory and universal basic education.” In line with this provision, the
government launched the Free Compulsory Universal Basic Education
Programme (FCUBE) programme with the aim to increase access and
participation, improve teaching and learning and improve management
and efficiency in the educational sector. Financial and non-financial
barriers were to be removed in order to facilitate the effective
participation and retention of children in basic schools.
110. The main goal of the Early Childhood Care Development Policy (ECCD)
is to promote the survival, growth and development of all children from
birth up to the age of eight years in Ghana.65 The policy is to serve as a
guide and also assign responsibility to stakeholders towards establishing
an effective coordination and monitoring framework for early childhood
development in the country. It identifies policy objectives related to
observance and enforcement of the Children’s Act and all other laws
against child abuse and socio-cultural practices that are inimical to the
wellbeing of children. Other objectives relate to the provision of pre-
school education in partnership with public and private stakeholders,
improving earning capacity of parents, strengthening the database on
children, among several others. According to the 2015 national budget
statement, a review of the policy is underway towards targeting children
aged from zero to three years.
111. The Education Strategic Plan (ESP, 2010-2020)66 is the latest strategic
framework for the development of the education sector in Ghana. A
review of the previous ESP (2003-2015)67 indicated that ensuring quality
outcomes on performance, pupil-teacher ratios and skills development
remained major challenges. The current Plan builds on broader reform
efforts68 to address these challenges in the education sector. Focus areas
identified by the 2010-2020 Plan include basic education, secondary
education and non-formal education. A series of strategic goals are
included in the Plan relating to each.69

65
  Republic of Ghana, 2004: Early Childhood Care Development Policy. Policy targets providing access and
quality ECCD programmes to 100% of children in Ghana by the year 2015.
66
     An Annual Educational Strategic Operational Plan (AESOP) is developed out of the ESP.
67
   ESP 2003-2015 was developed around four main themes/goals: education access; quality of education;
education management; and science, technology and technical, vocational education and training. A review
exercise in 2008 revealed that while significant improvements were achieved in the education sector,
including improvements in access and equity, this did not correspond with quality outcomes on performance,
pupil-teacher ratios and skills development.
68
  As reflected, inter alia, in the National Education Reform Programme, the 2008 Education Act, national and
sub-sectoral policies such as the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy II, Technical and Vocational
Education and Training (TVET) policy and Teacher Education Policy.
69
  Strategic goals include (a) Provide equitable access to good-quality child-friendly, universal, basic education,
by improving opportunities for all children in the first cycle of education at kindergarten, primary and junior
high school levels; (b) Increase equitable access to high quality second cycle education that prepares young

     112. The Education Strategic Plan recognizes complementary education as
     one of the key initiatives that ought to be sustained towards ensuring that
     every out-of-school child is returned to the classroom. Under its
     Complementary Basic Education (CBE) Policy, the Ministry of Education
     commits to expanding access to CBE throughout the country towards
     ensuring that every out-of-school child aged 8-14 years is put back into
     formal school.70 Under the latest ESP (2010-2020), CBE is identified under
     non-formal education, the third focus area.
     113. Comprehensive education programmes in Ghana have been
     implemented since 1995, largely led at the time of their inception, by
     non-state actors such as School for Life and Ibis Ghana. 71 In 2013, the
     government launched a Comprehensive Basic Education Programme
     under a public-private partnership and with the support of the
     Department for International Development (DFID). The aim is to reach at
     least 120,000 out-of-school children in Ghana’s most deprived
     communities. The programme has so far enrolled about 24,117 children
     under the first cycle (2013/2014), with plans to enroll another 55,000
     children by the end of the second cycle (2014/2015).

8.1.4 Social protection policies and programmes
     114. Ghana’s social protection programmes cover a wide range of options
     including cash transfers (e.g. Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty72,
     Ghana-Luxembourg Social Trust73); in-kind transfers (e.g. Free School
     Uniforms74 and the School Feeding Programme75); subsidies and fee

     adults for the various options available within tertiary education and the workplace; (c) Provide opportunities
     for those outside the formal education system to have free access to meaningful high-quality user-friendly
     education and training, whether through inclusive or complementary provision, approved or informal
     apprenticeships, distance education or technical and vocational skills development (TVSD); (d) Provide
     education for excluded children (including those who are physically and/or mentally impaired or disabled,
     slow/fast learners, orphans, young mothers, street children, those from deprived areas, slum children,
     poverty victims) by including them, wherever possible, within the mainstream formal system or, only when
     considered necessary, within special units or schools; (e) Increase equitable access to high quality tertiary
     education that provides relevant courses to young adults within Colleges of Education, Polytechnics and
     Universities, and for research and intellectual stimulus; and (f) To improve planning and management in the
     delivery of education by devolving resource management and decision-making to regions, districts and
     institutions, while retaining central responsibility for establishing norms, guidelines and system
     accountability.

National Health Insurance Scheme); youth employment programmes76
and labour-intensive public works77; contributory pensions and other
social services (free maternal services and free transportation for school
children and aged).
115. The underlying framework for delivering social protection
interventions is the National Social Protection Strategy, developed in 2007,
and revised in 2012. It served as a national blue-print for establishing
minimum guarantees for income security and the provision of basic social
services for the most vulnerable sections of the Ghanaian populace. As a
follow up to a rationalization study on social protection, Cabinet issued a
memorandum for the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection
in June 2014 to put in place mechanisms to ensure effective and efficient
delivery of social protection interventions. Recently, the Ministry of
Gender, Children and Social Protection has been developing a National
Social Protection Policy, aimed at creating a well-coordinated, inter-
sectoral social protection system to ensure effective implementation and
coordination, and enable people to live in dignity through income
support, livelihoods empowerment and improved systems of basic
services.78
116. The Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty Programme (LEAP) was
launched in 2008 as one of Ghana’s flagship social protection
programmes. It is a cash transfer79 programme targeted at empowering
the bottom 20% of the extremely poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable
populations to “leap” them out of poverty.80 Its specific objectives include
improving improving access (including attendance and retention) to basic
education for children aged five to 15 years.81 Households with children
less than 15 years fall under conditional cash transfer recipients and

  The key component of World Bank-Government of Ghana funded Ghana Social Opportunities Project aimed
at providing short-term employment for very poor and usually unskilled persons in rural communities during
the off-agriculture season. Areas of employment include rehabilitation and construction works on rural
infrastructure, afforestation, among others.

  The amount ranges from 24GHC (US $12.50) per beneficiary per month to a maximum of 45GHC (US24.60)

five years, the aged and persons with severe disability; and facilitating access to complementary services
among beneficiary households.

   than 90,000 households in over 100 political districts throughout the
   country. A recent impact evaluation of the programme shows that, while
   LEAP has had no impact on current enrolment, likely because primary
   school enrolment is nearly universal in Ghana, it had an important impact
   on other dimensions of schooling, reducing the likelihood of missing any
   day of school (8 percentage points) and reducing the chanche of
   repeating a grade (11 percentage points). The evaluation also shows a
   reduction in average number of days children spend working for pay.83

(CPESDP, 2014-2020)85 and the creation of decent work for youth is one of
four priority programmes articulated by the CPESDP. The CPESDP
recognizes the role and creative potential of youth key to fostering shared
growth, tackling social alienation and nurturing political stability. In
addition to the CPESDP, the policy framework for delivering decent work
for young people in Ghana is articulated in key policy documents such as
the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (2014-2017), the
Ghana Decent Work Country Programme II (2013-2016), The National
Youth Policy and Implementation Plan and the recently launched National
Employment Policy (2015).
118. Ghana’s National Employment Policy was launched by the President
at an International Jobs Summit in April 2015, jointly hosted by the
government and the International Labour Organization. The NEP86
embodies a multi-sectoral strategy with a goal to “create gainful and
decent employment opportunities for the growing labour force to
improve their living conditions and contribute to economic growth and
national development within the framework of equity, fairness, security
and dignity”87. The four key objectives outlined include: creating more
decent jobs to meet the demand for employment; improving the quality
of jobs for those employed; increasing labor productivity; and enhancing
governance and labour administration. It identifies youth unemployment
and child labour as key issues to be addressed and suggests a National
Employment Coordinated Council as the coordinating institutional
framework for implementing the policy. It is to be chaired by the Vice-
President. An implementation plan is to guide the roll out of the policy.
119. National Youth Policy (NYP) and Implementation Plan (2014-2017)
articulates a vision of empowering youth to contribute positively to
national development.88 This is to be achieved through six key policy
objectives in eighteen policy focus areas. The policy focus areas include
education and skills training, Information and Communication Technology
(ICT), youth employment (including modern agriculture), entrepreneurial
development and sports and recreation. Youths are defined as those
within the 15 to 35 age bracket. The Implementation Plan fits the focus
areas into four broad thematic areas (clusters): human development and
technology; economic empowerment; youth participation, governance
and leadership; and culture, sports and national orientation. An

accountable and responsive governance.

        prioritizes inter-sectoral approaches to promote increased employment
        and decent work opportunities and improving social protection, especially
        for women and informal sector workers. Efforts at job creation aim at
        improving the employability of the labour force as a whole but also
        focusing on key groups such as youth and women. Strategies to improve
        social protection include the elimination of the worst forms of child
        labour, addressing risks and vulnerability to HiV/AIDs at the workplace,
        promoting occupational safety and health and providing minimum
        guarantees per the social protection floor concept through effectively
        coordinating, delivering and expanding on existing social protection
        interventions. For each priority area, the GDWCP II provides outcomes,
        strategies, actions, indicators and targets for achievement.

121. As part of efforts towards building an efficient and effective technical
and vocational education and training (TVET) system in the country,
several projects have been rolled out; notable among them are the Ghana
Skills Development and Entrepreneurship Project, Development of Skills
for Industry Project, Ghana Skills Development Initiative and the Skills
Development Fund.
122. Development of Skills for Industry Project (DSIP) is a five year (2012-
2017) $125 million partnership between the Government of Ghana and
the African Development Bank with the development objective of
nurturing a high quality middle-level technical and vocational skills
expertise in the country. Some specific objectives include expanding
equitable access of females and the rural poor to public TVET institutions,
improving relevance and quality of TVET delivery and improving the
coordination and management of TVET. One of the components of the
DSIP is the “Student Entrepreneurship Business Model”, which aims to
assist students to begin and sustain start-ups as a way of developing their
skills and competences. There is also a National Bursary Scheme under
the project for needy but skillful students and apprentices. The third
component of DSIP provides support to public TVET partner institutions to
set up or strengthen production units for education, training and
innovation.
123. Ghana Skills Development Initiative (GSDI) is a Government of Ghana
and Germany (GIZ) collaboration aimed at improving the informal
apprenticeship system in the country. It is being implemented in pilot
regions in the Northern, Volta and Greater Accra Regions. The project
aims to introduce quality standards in apprenticeship training at the
workplaces concerned. In addition, apprentices have opportunity to
complement their training with structured courses at selected training
institutions leading to the award of a certificate.
124. Skills Development Fund91was set up by COTVET in partnership with
the Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation towards
providing a regular and sustainable resource base for rolling out a
national TVET system. Starting as a pilot with support from the World
Bank and DANIDA, it is envisaged that the project will serve as a model for
providing financial support to skills development and technological
innovation in the country. It is demand-driven and competitive, with entry
through submission of proposals. The fund targets different firm sizes
(micro, small, medium and large), labour unions, trade association,
educational and training institutions, among others. At the current phase,

the SDF focuses on five sectors: construction and housing, livestock,
horticulture, tourism and hospitality, and ICT. Since 2011, about 510
beneficiaries have been reached with GH¢87 million92. The fund continues
to provide support/grants to institutions although it is not clear how many
were supported in 2014 and how many were planned to be reached in
2015.93
125. The Youth Employment Agency (YEA) was launched by the
government in 200694 to tackle the challenges of youth unemployment,
underemployment and food insecurity in the country by providing skills
and job opportunities to the youth. This was on the back of a paper
presented to cabinet in March 2005 by the National Security Coordinator
on the security implications of the high incidence of unemployment in
Ghana. 95 The 10-module programme targeting 18-35 year olds was
expanded to 14-modules when a new government assumed power in
2009.96 In 2012, the NYEP was restructured into a Ghana Youth
Employment and Entrepreneurial Development Agency (GYEEDA).
GYEEDA was further restructured into the YEA under an Act of Parliament,
Act 887.97 The restructured agency is aiming to provide employment for
about 100,000 youth.98
126. The National Apprenticeship Programme (NAP)99 is a government
initiative for providing a year’s apprenticeship training to Junior High
School graduates who are unable to continue to the secondary level. It
aims at equipping beneficiaries with skills that could facilitate their self-
employment. Additionally, the programme is geared towards providing a
link between informal apprenticeships and formal TVET institutions. The
National Apprentice Programme is being managed by COTVET. It hopes to
tackle youth unemployment and livelihood deficits among early school
leavers. The programme began in 2011 with 5000 apprentices selected

  A Smiling Youth Initiative, somewhat an upgrade to the NAP and aiming at 15-17 year olds was proposed to
government (Mensah, 2014). It provides up to two years of training/apprenticeship and an additional year of
post-training employment before placement. It also offers opportunities for trainees to start their own
business.

from 75 districts nationwide. This has been completed. The second phase
started in 2012 with a target of 8,000 beneficiaries to receive training in
ICT, carpentry, block work, auto mechanics, electronics, among others. In
2014, 2,000 apprentices were enrolled and matched with master crafts
persons.
127. The National Youth Authority runs about 11 Youth Leadership and
Skills Training Institutes (YLSTI) spread across all the regions of Ghana.100
About 75 persons aged between 15 and 24 are enrolled in each institute
each year. They are provided with a two-year skills training programme
leading to an award of a Certificate or Diploma in areas such as
agriculture, carpentry and joinery, dress making, electrical works and
information and communication technologies, among others.
Beneficiaries are also taught subjects like Mathematics and English, in
addition to specialized courses on book keeping and leadership. Other
public training institutes such as the National Vocational Training
Institute, Opportunities Industrialization Centre-Ghana, Don Bosco
Technical Institute and GRATIS Foundation provide similar training with
target beneficiaries in a similar age bracket (14 years old and above).
128. Apart from the YLSTIs, the Ghana Education Service runs about 45
Technical and Vocational Institutes (TVIs); other ministries oversee about
75 others while private institutes total about 65. Total enrolment in the
120 public TVIs stands at almost 40,000 while the private institutes have
over 3,600 entrants.101 Generally, enrolment in the private sector
institutions has been on the decline in recent years. The share of females
in total enrolment in private sector institutions exceeds 50%, but female
enrolment in public TVIs is low; females account for only about one in five
students in public TVIs. Initiatives such as the Role Model Programme and
“Female in Electronics” are being rolled out by COTVET to address this
challenge.
129. Integrated Community Centre for Employable Skills (ICCES)102 is a
skills development and entrepreneurial training agency under the
Ministry of Employment and Labour Relations. It was set up by
government as a response to the challenges of youth unemployment,
rural-urban migration and the growth of micro and small-scale
enterprises. It has over 60 training centres throughout the country that
targets categories of youths between the ages of 15 and 25 years who
have or are unable to complete basic or secondary education,


100
   They include Sandema in the Upper East, Issa in the Upper West, Takrowase, Eastern Region; Ajumako
Afranse, Central Region; Wassa Akropong, Western Region; Asankare, Ashanti Region; Afienya, Greater Accra
and Avenorpeme in the Volta Region.

     unemployed adults and other vulnerable youths. The training, depending
     on the type, spans from three months to four years. Some graduates also
     have the opportunity of pursuing further technical education with
     polytechnics. Although ICCES has the largest number of training centres
     for any single agency not much is known about its work; additionally, it
     does not seem to command the attention and political interest compared
     to other TVET initiatives.103 According to the 2014 National Budget and
     Economic Policy Statement, ICCES, NVTI and OIC accounted for a total of
     21,802 trained artisans while 3,640 trainees were placed into internship
     programmes to acquire on-the-job skills.

8.2.2 Youth entrepreneurship,
     130. The Youth Enterprise Support (YES) Programme is a multi-sectoral
     Presidential Initiative involving other agencies such as the National Youth
     Authority, National Board for Small Scale Industries (NBSSI), Ministry of
     Finance, Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Youth and Sports
     aimed at promoting youth enterprise. A GH¢10 million Youth
     Entrepreneurship Fund has been launched to bolster the programme. It
     targets 18 to 35 year olds with the aim to honing their entrepreneurial
     skills, providing mentorship and supporting them to develop their own
     start-ups or grow their existing business. Out of 107 participants that
     were selected and provided with training, 42 beneficiaries had received a
     total of GH¢1.2 million by the end of September 2015.104
     131. The Venture Capital Trust Fund (VCTF) was established by the
     government in 2004 through an Act of Parliament, Act 680. The object of
     the Act is to provide financial resources for the development and
     promotion of venture capital financing for Small and Medium Enterprises
     in priority sectors of the Ghanaian economy.105 The fund’s mission is to
     make available low cost financial support to Small and Medium scale
     Entreprises (SMEs) towards aiding their growth, creation of jobs and
     wealth. Financial support to SMEs is usually done through Venture Capital
     Financing Companies (VCFCs), who invest equity for a period not
     exceeding 10 years. The VCFCs adopt an equity financing model which
     leverages other available technical capacities within towards growing the
     investee companies. While the Act establishing the VCTF makes provision
     for a 25% allocation from the National Reconstruction Levy, the repeal of
     the latter in 2006 meant that the fund has had to depend on direct
     allocations from the national budget. Since its inception, the VCTF has

mobilized in excess of GH¢100 million. It has created 5 VCFCs and over 46
investee companies.106
132. Local Enterprise and Skills Development Programme (LESDEP) was
launched in 2011 under the auspices of the Ministry of Local Government
and Rural Development as a public-private partnership programme aimed
at endowing unemployed youths with entrepreneurial and other
specialized skills that then puts them in a position to create and manage
their own business. The programme further supports these businesses
with start-up equipment and post-start up support services. A revolving
fund has been set up as a means for delivering equipment to beneficiaries
in the form of loans. The Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development exercises oversight over the programme with support from
the Ministry of Employment and Labour Relations, ICCES, OIC, NBSSI,
among others. In 2011 and 2012, the programme received about $8
million and $54 million respectively for implementation.107 However by
2013, the budget had reduced to about a third of the previous year’s
amount thus reducing the intake to about 15,000. Despite the fact that
the programme is still running, the 2014 and 2015 versions of the
National Budget Statement and Economic Policy Statement were silent on
its operations. There are concerns regarding the management of the
revolving fund as many beneficiaries have failed to pay back the support
they received. Funds are thus being withheld pending a review of the
programme, which was supposed to be completed in June 2015.
133. National Board for Small Scale Industries (NBSSI) is a public institution
under the Ministry of Trade and Industry set up by an Act of the
Parliament, Act 434 of 1981108. It exists to facilitate the growth and
development of micro and small enterprises. It provides business
development services through the 170 Business Advisory Centres it has
set up throughout the country. In 2014, a total of 21 797 entrepreneurs
(more than half were female) were trained to enhance their
competitiveness while 256 SMEs were supported to formalize their
business with the Registrar General’s Department and the Ghana

public-private partnership between the then Ministry of Employment and
Social Welfare and Graduate Business Support Scheme Limited with
support from Management Development and Productivity Institute,
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development
and the Ministry of Youth and Sports. The scheme aims at developing
young people with business-focused skills that enables them to begin and
grow their own start-ups. The four-tier process begins with an initial
10,000 unemployed graduates, who are taken through a five-day business
training on identifying opportunities and setting up start-ups. The number
is then reduced to 2000, and later 500 for more focused training,
including a three-month industrial attachment which also serves as an
incubation period for the latter. A final 100 is then selected to receive
additional training, a month-long international attachment and an
additional three months of incubation support. A financial support
package is then provided for their start-ups. The 2015 national budget
targets 4,000 unemployed graduates.
135. Rural Enterprises Programme (REP) is a micro and small scale
enterprise development collaboration involving the government of
Ghana, International Fund for Agricultural Development and African
Development Bank. The programme seeks to increase the number of rural
micro and small scale enterprises (MSM) that generate growth, profit and
employment opportunities.111 It is a scale up of two phases of a Rural
Enterprises Project implemented in 66 districts from 1995 to 2011. The
current programme, REP III, is expected to run from 2012 to 2017 in at
least 161 (i.e. including the 66 old districts) rural municipal and district
assemblies in all regions across the country. The programme emphasizes
on inclusive growth, youth employment and women empowerment and
plans to create about 100,000 new jobs.112 According to the 2015 national
budget, REP III will complete the establishment of 95 new Business
Advisory Centres in 95 rural districts, where NBSSI will provide the
required technical backstopping. Furthermore, about 30,000 rural poor
would receive training in community-based income generating activities,
small business management and marketing. All-year-round business
counseling services would also be provided to 16,500 operators of rural,
micro and small enterprises. A joint collaboration involving REP, NBSSI and
GRATIS Foundation would see 1,619 rural people trained to identify self-
employment opportunities.

creation of jobs. It was set up in 2006 with a vision of supporting local
entrepreneurs to grow and develop small and micro business startups
through the delivery of microfinance, loans and other business services.
According to the 2014 national budget statement, MASLOC imported and
distributed 1,000 outboard motors and 6,450 bundles of fishing nets to
fishing communities in the country as part of its collaboration with the
Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture. The distribution of the outboard
motors was expected to generate 13,000 direct jobs and 20,000 indirect
jobs. Other MASLOC interventions include a Vehicle Hire Purchase
Scheme for taxi drivers, Poultry Finance Scheme for poultry farmers, and
other input supply schemes for hairdressers, food crop farmers, among
others.
137. The Savannah Agriculture Development Authority (SADA) is a
government effort to tackle underdevelopment, poverty and vulnerability
in deprived regions of the country as revealed by national statistics. SADA
was set up through Act 805, 2010 to focus on the Northern Savannah
Economic Zone, which has consistently fared worst in rankings of various
socio-economic indicators. SADA has been involved in several business
development and job creation interventions. According to the 2014
national budget statement, SADA distributed about 2,075 tractors to poor
farmers during the 2013 farming season. It also provided agricultural
inputs to about 20,000 households. About 5,000 youths were engaged in
SADA’s tree planning programme.
138. Youth in Agriculture Project (YIAP) is a Ministry of Food and
Agriculture entrepreneurial development initiative started as a pilot in
1999 and then extended nationwide in 2009. The period marked a
significant decline in the share of employment in agriculture, falling by
about 20 percentage points between 1992 and 2010 (Schwegler-Rohmeis
et al., 2014). The objectives of the project include helping youths identify
and accept farming as a viable commercial business venture, improving
their incomes and therefore their livelihood as well as providing
motivation for youth to stay in rural areas for agriculture. The project
ensures that relevant inputs are supplied to beneficiaries at their farm
gate. The components of the project include block farming, livestock and
poultry, fisheries and aquaculture and agribusiness. Depending on the
component, beneficiaries are weaned off support after one to three
years. The project has had about 300,000 beneficiaries since its inception.
139. Technoserve was founded in Ghana more than four decades ago. It is
a private not-for-profit organization with the aim of reducing poverty
through developing competitive farms, businesses and industries. The
organization is currently running a four and a half-year business
enterprise project with a $4.1 million financial support from the

Department for International Development (DFID)113. Rolled out in the
form of a business plan competition, the project is aimed at developing
about a 1000 startups over the period. Other significant private sector-led
youth employment and skills training initiatives includes University of
Ghana’s Creative Enterprise Training Programme, the Junior Achievers’
Trust International Training Programme and the training and mentoring

                             ADDRESSING CHILD LABOUR AND THE YOUTH
                             DECENT WORK DEFICIT: POLICY PRIORITIES



                     140. This chapter discusses policy recommendations for addressing child
                     labour and the youth decent work deficit drawing on the evidence
                     presented above. Child labour and youth employment are closely linked,
                     underscoring the importance of addressing the two issues hand in hand,
                     following a lifecycle approach. The figure below illustrates key
                     components of an integrated response. A set of child-centred policies are
                     needed to promote schooling as an alternative to child labour, and,
                     following from this, to ensure that children enter adolescence with the
                     basic and life skills needed for further learning and practical living. This
                     foundation is in turn crucial to the success of active labour market policies
                     for promoting improved youth employment outcomes, and to ensuring
                     that youth successfully transition from education into decent work in the
                     labour market. This causal chain can also work in the opposite direction:
                     successful youth labour market outcomes can increase household
                     incentives to invest in children’s education earlier in the lifecycle.

 9.1 Addressing child labour: children aged 5-14 years
       141. Child labour in Ghana continues to affect almost 1.9 million children
       aged 5-17 years, or 22% of all children in this age group. These stark
       figures underscore the distance that the country must still travel to
       achieve child labour elimination, and highlights the need for accelerated
       action to reach this goal in the nearest possible future. Child labour is a
       complex phenomenon requiring a policy response that is integrated and
       cross-sectoral in nature. Evidence from Ghana and elsewhere point to a
       set policy pillars that are particularly relevant in this regard – basic
       education, social protection, public awareness, social mobilisation and
       advocacy – building on the foundation provided by comprehensive child
       labour legislation and a solid evidence base.

9.1.1 Education access and quality
       142. There is broad consensus that the single most effective way to stem
       the flow of school-aged children into work is to extend and improve
       schooling, so that families have the opportunity to invest in their
       children’s education and it is worthwhile for them to do so. School
       attendance needs to be made an attractive prospect for children and
       parents both by addressing the costs of school attendance and by
       ensuring that schooling is inclusive and relevant. Providing schooling as an
       alternative to child labour is important not only for the individual children
       concerned, but also for society as a whole, as children who grow up
       compromised educationally by child labour are in a poor position to
       contribute to the country’s growth as adults. Moreover, a non-negligible
       share of ghanian children (22 percent) combine school and employment,
       pointing to the need for specific policies targeting this group.
       143. The empirical results presented in this report indicate that Ghanaian
       working children are less likely to be attending school, and that the
       attendance gap increases as children grow older. In all, about eight
       percent of children in the compulsory schooling age range of 6-14 years,
       485,000 children in absolute terms, are out of school. These results
       underscore the need to address the school access and quality issues
       influencing decisions to enrol and stay in school, within the framework
       provided by the Free Compulsory Universal Basic Education Programme,
       the Capitation Grants Policy and the Education Strategic Plans (2003-
       2015, 2010-2020).
       144. Ensuring access to early childhood education (ECD). Evidence from a
       range of developing countries suggests that early childhood development
       programmes can promote learning readiness, increase school enrolment
       and school survival, and help children keep away from work in their early
       years. The Government is committed to extending ECD opportunities and



   Ghana INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and the youth decent work deficit: policy priorities   85
    has enacted a number of measures towards this goal. Ghana has seen
    important progress in terms of raising pre-school attendance, driven in
    important part by the extension of free and compulsory education to
    include a two-year pre-primary cycle, by the requirement that all primary
    schools have a kindergarten attached and by the introduction of
    capitation grants. But despite the increase in the number of KGs, access
    remains difficult in some locations, particularly in rural or remote areas,
    where young children may have to travel long distances to attend school.
    ECD services and opportunities for younger, 0-3 year-old, children also
    remain very limited. The extent to which KGs meet quality standards is
    not known, but KG observation visits undertaken as part of a UNICEF
    evaluation revealed quality problems related to overcrowding, poor
    infrastructure and an insufficient number of teachers with training in early
    education.114 The national Early Childhood Care Development Policy
    provides the broad framework for national efforts in addressing these
    challenges.
    145. Promoting education access and quality. Continued efforts are
    needed to remove access and quality barriers to schooling for all children.
    Increasing school access is a particular challenge at the upper end of the
    compulsory school age spectrum. Ten percent of all children are out of
    school at the age of 14 years, rising thereafter. Foremost among the
    factors for being out of school are distance and cost, together cited by
    over one-third of out of school children, and a lack of interest, cited by a
    further 15% of out-of-school children.115 School quality also remains an
    important challenge. Overcrowding, inadequate water and sanitation
    facilities, poorly-trained teaches and limited textbook supplies are among
    the among the issues affecting the quality of the education received by
    Ghanaian students.116 These quality challenges are reflected in students’
    results: only 16% of grade six students are proficient in mathematics and
    only 35% proficient in English, according to the 2011 National Education
    Assessment. Measures addressing school access and quality feature
    prominently in the Education Strategic Plan (2010-2020) but now need to
    be operationalised across the education system. The country’s success in
    reaching the education Millennium Development Goals provides a
    valuable template for efforts in this regard moving forward.

9.1.2 Social protection
       146. The importance of social protection in reducing child labour is well-
       established. Social protection instruments serve to prevent vulnerable
       households from having to resort to child labour as a buffer against
       poverty and negative shocks. There is no single recipe for expanding social
       protection programmes to reduce household vulnerability and child
       labour. Unconditional and conditional cash transfer programmes,
       including various forms of child support grants, family allowances, needs
       based social assistance and social pensions, are all relevant to ensuring
       household livelihoods, supplementing the incomes of the poor and
       reducing household dependence on child labour. Public works schemes
       can serve both the primary goal of providing a source of employment to
       household breadwinners and the secondary goal of helping to rehabilitate
       public infrastructure and expand basic services, both being potentially
       relevant in terms of reducing reliance on child labour. Micro-loan
       schemes can help ease household budget constraints and mitigate social
       risk.
       147. The Government has prioritized social protection expansion and in
       2012 issued a revised the National Social Protection Strategy to guide
       efforts in this regard. Foremost among social protection programmes
       targeting vulnerable households is the Livelihood Empowerment Against
       Poverty Programme (LEAP). LEAP provides direct cash transfers to poor
       families on condition that their children continue to attend school and
       that the family makes use of preventive health care and nutrition services.
       The programme aims at empowering the bottom 20% of the extremely
       poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable populations to “leap” them out of
       poverty.117 Other noteworthy efforts include other cash transfers (e.g.
       Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty118, Ghana-Luxembourg Social
       Trust119); in-kind transfers (e.g. Free School Uniforms120 and the School
       Feeding Programme121); subsidies and fee waivers (e.g. energy and
       agricultural subsidies, capitation grants and the National Health Insurance
       Scheme); youth employment programmes122 and labour-intensive public

      works.123 These and other efforts, taken together, provide key protection
      for vulnerable families but do not yet constitute a complete basic social
      protection floor. Further investment is needed evaluating their impact,
      and, on this basis, extending the most effective approaches to reach all
      vulnerable households.124

9.1.3 Strategic communication
      148. Strategic communication is needed as part of efforts to build a broad
      consensus for change. Child labour is a clear example in which both social
      norms and economic considerations are important, and strategic
      communication efforts need to be designed with this in mind. Households
      require information concerning the costs or dangers of child labour and
      benefits of schooling in order to make informed decisions on their
      children’s time allocation. But factors which influence decisions
      concerning children’s schooling and child labour can extend well beyond
      economics or work conditions. Cultural attitudes and perceptions can also
      direct household decisions concerning children’s schooling and child
      labour, and therefore should also be targeted in strategic communication
      efforts.
      149. Communication efforts are needed at both national and local levels.
      A mix of conventional (e.g., radio, television and print media) as well as of
      non-conventional communication channels (e.g., religious leaders, school
      teachers, health care workers) is important in order to achieving
      maximum outreach. Social media represents another increasingly
      important communication tool in the context of both national awareness
      raising and global campaigns against child labour abuses. Baseline
      information on local knowledge and cultural attitudes towards child
      labour is needed to tailor communication messages, and to evaluate
      changes in awareness and attitudes following communication activities.
      Providing information on national child labour legislation, presented in
      terms that are understandable to the populations and communities
      concerned, is another communication priority. For girls in particular, there
      is also a need to educate families on what are acceptable domestic chores

      123
          The key component of World Bank-Government of Ghana funded Ghana Social Opportunities Project
      aimed at providing short-term employment for very poor and usually unskilled persons in rural communities
      during the off-agriculture season. Areas of employment include rehabilitation and construction works on rural
      infrastructure, afforestation, among others
      124
          The ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation (No. 202) of 2012 provides a key framework for efforts
      in this regard. The Recommendation sets out that SPFs should contain basic social security guarantees that
      ensure that all in need can afford and have access to essential health care and have income security at least
      at a nationally defined minimum level over the life cycle. See ILO, 2011. Resolution and conclusions
      concerning the recurrent discussion on social protection (social security), International Labour Conference,
      100th Session, Geneva, 2011, in Record of Proceedings (Geneva, 2011), No. 24: Report of the Committee for

       for children and what are not. While doing light chores around the house
       can be important for the socialization of children, research shows that
       children are working very long hours in the home and have little time for
       rest, study or leisure.

9.1.4 Social mobilisation and advocacy
       150. Achieving sustainable reduction in child labour requires social
       consensus well beyond the level of the household. Policy responses to
       child labour are also unlikely to be effective in the absence of the active
       participation of civil society and of social partners in implementing them.
       Similarly, laws to protect children from child labour are unlikely to be
       effective if they are not backed by broad social consensus. Social
       mobilisation is therefore critical to engaging a broad range of social actors
       in efforts against child labour. Various social actors, including, for
       example, NGOs, faith-based organisations, teachers’ organizations, the
       mass media, trade unions, employers’ organizations, have important roles
       to play in a broader societal effort against child labour. The National
       Steering Committee on Child Labour (NSCCL), whose membership now
       includes some 40 members, including various Government Ministries,
       Departments and Agencies (MDAs),125 civil society organizations,126
       workers’ organizations, employers groups and development
       partners,127has a particularly important potential role to play in social
       mobilization efforts. The The National Plan of Action against Child Labour
       (NPA, 2009-2015) help define the roles of the various governmental and
       non-governmental actors involved in the fight against child labour.

9.1.5 Child labour legislation, inspections and monitoring
       151. Achieving sustainable reductions in child labour requires a
       supportive policy and legislative environment which is in line with
       international standards and effectively mainstreamed into national
       development plans and programmes. This has the important effect of
       signalling national intent to eliminate child labour and providing a
       framework in which this can be achieved.
       152. While significant progress has been made in developing a
       comprehensive legal framework (see discussion in Section 8.1.1), this

       125
          The key MDAs include the Ministry of Employment and Labour relations (including the Labour Department,
       which hosts the Child Labour Unit); Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection; Ministry of Education
       and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. Others are the Ministry of Local Government and Rural
       Development, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Lands and Mines, and Ministry of Finance and Economic
       Planning (including Ghana Statistical Service).
       126
          Civil society coalitions and organizations active in Ghana include the Ghana NGO Coalition on Child Rights,
       Ghana National Education Campaign Coalition, International Cocoa Initiative, World Cocoa Foundation, Child
       Rights International, Mondelez International, Afri Kids, Challenging Heights, and the Amarjaro/Source Trust.
       127
             ILO and UNICEF have an observer status on the Steering Committee.




   Ghana INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and the youth decent work deficit: policy priorities      89
       framework is not yet complete. For instance, there have been concerns
       about the lack of a stronger framework for articulating the scope of
       permissible versus non-permissible work among children across various
       sectors of the economy. While an existing Hazardous Activity Framework
       (HAF) attempts to provide this distinction, it does not have a legal backing
       to facilitate enforcement despite the fact that an action included in this
       regard in the NPA. The Government is currently working on amending the
       Children’s Act (Act 560, 1998) and there is a view of incorporating the
       HAF in the revision process. The Education Act is also currently under
       review in a bid to synthesize and consolidate key provisions regarding
       education sector. With respect to adolescents, there has been the
       concern that the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651) does not adequately address
       the special needs of 15-17 year-olds who, despite falling under the
       category of children under the Children Act, 1998 (Act 560), are entitled
       to work, having attained the minimum age of entry into employment.
       153. The effectiveness of legislation in protecting children from child
       labour also depends on establishing and strengthening mechanisms for
       monitoring and enforcing laws, including provisions for inspections and
       for the removal child labourers to safe places. Expanding the
       Government’s actual capacity to monitor formal workplaces remains a
       major challenge, and unregistered businesses in the the informal
       economy are largely outside formal inspection regimes. The labour
       inspectorate needs to be strengthened so that inspectors can effectively
       enforce labour legislation and workplace safety standards relating to child
       labour. But given the extent of child labour and resource constraints, it
       will likely continue to be difficult for the formal inspection system alone to
       be effective in protecting children from workplace violations. This
       highlights the importance of establishing effective community-based child
       labour monitoring systems as a mechanism for identifying children who
       are involved or at risk of engaging in child labour, referring them to
       appropriate social services, and tracking them to ensure positive
       outcomes.

9.1.6 Improving the evidence base
       154. Effective and well-targeted responses to child labour demand a
       strong body of knowledge on the issue, including an understanding of
       how many child labourers there are, which sectors and geographical areas
       they work in, the demographic characteristics of the children involved,
       and the type of work that they carry out. Despite recent national
       household surveys, data quality and comparability are uneven and
       significant information gaps remain, affecting understanding of the child
       labour phenomenon and the ability of policy-makers to address it. Better
       data is especially needed on programme impact, in order to identify good
       practices from the large number of child labour initiatives undertaken in
       the country, and, following from this, approaches with most potential for


   Ghana INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and the youth decent work deficit: policy priorities   90
       broader scale implementation. Promoting the use of the Ghana Child
       Labour Monitoring System (GCLMS) can contribute to an effective and
       sustainable monitoring of child labour, which in turn is critical for the
       development of a coordinated response to child labour. More evidence is
       also needed, inter alia, on the worst forms of child labour, recognizing
       that “the effective elimination of the worst forms of child labour requires
       immediate and comprehensive action”,128 and on child migration (in-
       country and cross-border).

 9.2 Addressing child labour: adolescents aged 15-17 years
       155. Even though young people aged 15-17 years are over the minimum
       working age they are still considered “child labourers” under ILO
       Conventions Nos. 138 and 182 and national legislation if the work they do
       is hazardous. As we saw in Chapter 5 of this Report, child labour among
       15-17 year-olds is very high in Ghana, affecting almost 24% of all children
       in this age range, or 412,000 children in absolute terms. Child labourers in
       the 15-17 years age range account for about one-fifth of total child
       labourers of all ages in Ghana. At the same time, almost 55% of all 15-17
       year-olds in employment are in child labour. Adolescents aged 15-17
       years are therefore of common interest to programmes addressing child
       labour and the decent work deficit faced by youth, but they have not to
       date been accorded priority attention in either. While the policies
       articulated above for younger children are also largely relevant for
       combatting child labour in the 15-17 years age range, there is also a need
       for additional policy measures tailored specifically to the unique
       challenges posed by child labour in this age group.

9.2.1 Removing youth from hazardous work in order that they are protected
      and afforded second chances for acquiring decent work
       156. In instances in which adolescents in the 15-17 years age range are
       working in sectors or occupations that are designated as hazardous or
       where there is no scope for improving working conditions, the policy
       requirement is clear – they must be removed from the hazardous job. In
       these instances it is imperative that there is an effective inspections and
       monitoring system for identifying the adolescents concerned and a
       strategy in place for providing withdrawn adolescents with adequate
       support services and opportunities for social reintegration. Community-
       based mechanisms close to where the child labourers are located are
       particularly relevant in this regard.
       157. Empirical evidence presented above on educational attainment and
       work conditions indicates that school enrolment declines sharply as

       1999.




   Ghana INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and the youth decent work deficit: policy priorities   91
       children enter the 15-17 years age range, and many of those leaving the
       school system end up in hazardous jobs. Options for reaching
       disadvantaged, out-of-school children with second change learning
       opportunities includes mainstreaming (i.e., providing returning children
       with special remedial support within the regular classroom) and
       “bridging” education (i.e., separate intensive courses, delivered within or
       outside the formal school system, designed to raise academic proficiency
       prior to returning to the regular classroom). Second chance policies need
       to take place within the context of a broader effort to improve secondary
       schooling access and quality, in order to make secondary schooling a
       more viable and attractive alternative to hazardous work.
       158. For out-of-school children whose circumstances mean that they are
       unable to re-enter basic education, experience in a range of countries
       suggests that targeted packages of active labour market policies can be
       effective in terms of providing withdrawn adolescents (and other
       vulnerable youth) with second chances for securing decent work. Many of
       the elements discussed in the next section of this chapter are relevant in
       this context, including vocational and technical training, apprenticeships,
       job search training and support, and entrepreneurial support, with the
       critical difference being that they are tailored to the special needs of this
       group of particularly vulnerable youth. Not infrequently, adolescents
       withdrawn from exploitative situations may also need a range of social
       services: emergency shelter, medical care, psychosocial counselling, legal
       support, family tracing and assessment and post-reintegration follow-up.

9.2.2 Mitigating risk in order to ensure that youth are not exposed to hazards
      in their workplace
       159. Risk mitigation is a strategic option in instances where adolescents
       are exposed to hazards in sectors or occupations that are not designated
       as hazardous in national hazardous work lists and where there is scope
       for changing work conditions. Such a strategy involves measures to
       remove the hazard, to separate the child sufficiently from the hazard so
       as not to be exposed, or minimise the risk associated with that hazard.
       160. The ILO speaks of this as “identifying hazards and reducing risks”.
       Strategies aimed at improving the working conditions of adolescent
       workers include various types of protective measures: hours of work can
       be reduced; work at night, or travel to and from work at night, can be
       prohibited; workplace policies against harassment can be established and
       enforced; adolescents can be barred from using dangerous substances,
       tools or equipment; and adequate rest periods can be provided.
       161. Especially important in the context of risk mitigation is training and
       awareness-raising on occupational safety and health for employers and
       their young workers, including on adequate and consistent supervision.
       Another priority is the implementation of adequate monitoring



   Ghana INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and the youth decent work deficit: policy priorities   92
       mechanisms. Trade unions, business associations, chambers of
       commerce, community organizations, social protection agencies – when
       properly trained and linked with the labour inspectorate – can monitor
       minimum age guidelines, the safety of the workplace and its adolescent
       workers.129 Risk mitigation should be seen as part of a broader effort to
       ensure that young persons receive equal treatment and are protected
       from abuse and exposure to hazards.130 The enforcement of labour laws
       and collective agreements should be strengthened, and the participation
       of young people in employers’ and workers’ organizations and in social
       dialogue should be enhanced.

 9.3 Addressing the decent work deficit: young persons aged 15-24 years
       162. The results presented in this Report highlight a number of challenges
       facing Ghanaian young people entering the labour market. Levels of
       human capital remain low for many Ghanaian young people,
       compromising their future prospects. Forty-one percent of young persons
       not in school have either no education (29%) or only primary education
       (12%). Fourteen percent of all youth are not in education, employment or
       training (NEET) and therefore at risk of social marginalisation and require
       specific interventions. Youth employment is dominated by low-skill,
       unremunerating jobs in the informal economy offering fewer chances for
       upward mobility. Underemployment, or “hidden unemployment”, affects
       38% of employed youth. These results point to the need for active labour
       market policies131 aimed at improving youth labour market outcomes,
       building on the knowledge foundation acquired during childhood through
       improved basic education and preventing child labour.

9.3.1 Skills development
       163. A variety of TVET programmes are in place in the country under the
       administrative umbrella of the Council for Technical and Vocational
       Education and Training (COTVET). Notable among them are the Ghana
       Skills Development and Entrepreneurship Project, Development of Skills
       129
          It is important to note that while we are focusing here on children, neither is hazardous work acceptable
       for adult workers. The ILO Conventions on occupational safety and health (OSH) and on labour inspection
       offer protection for all workers. In fact, nearly half of all ILO instruments deal directly or indirectly with OSH
       issues. It has long been recognized in this context that action against child labour can also be action for
       decent work for adults. In the case of hazardous work, where economic necessity or deeply ingrained
       tradition blocks attempts to improve conditions for adult workers, it is sometimes the call to stop child labour
       that can be the entry point to change. Eliminating hazardous work of children can help improve safety and
       health of all workers – the ultimate goal.
       130
           A recent learning package to support trade unions, employment services, education and training
       institutions, as well as youth organizations, in their initiatives aimed at raising young people's awareness of
       their rights at work, see ILO (2014): Rights@Work 4 Youth: Decent work for young people: Facilitators’ guide
       and toolkit (Geneva).
       131
          Active labour market policies are designed to improve labour market outcomes for young people within
       existing institutional and macro-economic constraints; the broader structural economic reforms needed to
       reduce youth unemployment in the long run are beyond the scope of this Report.




   Ghana INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and the youth decent work deficit: policy priorities          93
    for Industry Project, Ghana Skills Development Initiative and the Skills
    Development Fund. These efforts have led to progress in terms of
    increasing access to training for young persons, but both the quality and
    coverage of training nonetheless remain limited. The fact that half of
    young workers are under-qualified for their jobs132 is evidence of unmet
    training needs. Ensuring training opportunities extend to vulnerable
    youth, particularly for the 15-17 age group, with limited levels of formal
    education remains a particularly important challenge facing the TVET
    system. This group of vulnerable youth includes those whose education
    was compromised by involvement in child labour. Access is also especially
    limited for female youth and for the rural poor.
    164. This discussion points to the importance of continued investment in
    providing “second chance” opportunities to former working children and
    other categories of vulnerable youth for acquiring the skills and training
    needed for work and life. Empirical evidence presented above on
    educational attainment indicates that such policies are particularly
    relevant in Ghana context: many students leave the system prior to the
    end of the primary education cycle and many of those out of school lack
    the minimum amount of school time considered by UNESCO as necessary
    for acquiring basic literacy skills. Some 158,000, or 66%, of the total out-
    of-school children in the 10-14 age range age range, for instance, suffer
    what UNESCO terms “education poverty”, i.e., possess less than four
    years of education, the minimum amount of school time considered by
    UNESCO as necessary for acquiring basic literacy skills. What is more, it is
    likely that the education poverty indicator actually underestimates second
    chance learning needs as basic literacy skills alone are a less and less
    adequate “skills floor” for successful entry into the Ghanaian labour
    market.
    165. The Education Strategic Plan (2010-2020) includes as one of its
    central strategic goals providing “… opportunities for those outside the
    formal education system to have free access to meaningful high-quality
    user-friendly education and training, whether through inclusive or
    complementary provision, approved or informal apprenticeships, distance
    education or technical and vocational skills development.” There are
    already a number of second chance learning initiatives active in the
    country, offering useful models for expanded efforts in this regard moving
    forward. Effectively coordinating these wide-ranging efforts, and
    successfully extending them based on needs-based criteria to ensure they
    reach all unserved groups of vulnerable youth, however, remain key
    priorities. Integrating informal training and apprenticeships into the
    formal system is another priority. Currently, the array of informal training

    132
          UCW calculations based on the sixth round of the Ghana Living Standards Survey 2012 (GLSS 6, 2012).




Ghana INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and the youth decent work deficit: policy priorities   94
       and apprenticeships do not lead to formal certification or qualitifications,
       although National Apprenticeship Programme (NAP) is aimed in part at
       linking informal apprenticeships with formal TVET institutions. Additional
       investment is also needed in evaluating the impact of existing efforts and
       in tracing labour market outcomes of participants, in order to identify the
       approaches with most potential for expansion.

9.3.2 Job search support
       166. The high levels of skills mismatch among Ghanaian youth (see
       discussion in Chapter 7) is suggestive of a need for further investment in
       job search skills and in formal mechanisms linking young job seekers with
       appropriate job openings. It will again be especially important to ensure
       that at-risk youth are able to access these employment services
       programmes. This can be difficult because most at-risk youth live in either
       marginal urban or rural areas, while most employment services are
       offered in more central locations. One criticism of employment services
       programmes elsewhere has been that those who benefit from the
       programmes are typically more qualified and connected to begin with and
       therefore more likely to become employed. This points to the importance
       of targeting job search support to disadvantaged young people most in
       need.

9.3.3 Public works programmes
       167. The high percentage of youth who are not in education, employment
       or training (NEET) and who are underemployed (see discussion in Chapter
       7) points to the need for demand-side measures aimed at improving
       employment opportunities for young people. Labour-intensive public
       works programmes targeting young persons represent one important
       policy option in this context. Such programmes can provide both qualified
       and unqualified young people with an entry point into the labour market
       within broader efforts to reduce poverty and develop rural services
       infrastructure.
       168. There is a range of public works programmes already in place in
       Ghana, including the Ghana Social Opportunities Project.133 With some
       exceptions,134 these programmes do not explicitly target youth and
       opportunities for youth participation in employment creation
       programmes are limited. This discussion underscores the need to

       133
            The key component of World Bank-Government of Ghana funded Ghana Social Opportunities Project
       aimed at providing short-term employment for very poor and usually unskilled persons in rural communities
       during the off-agriculture season. Areas of employment include rehabilitation and construction works on rural
       infrastructure, afforestation, among others.
       134
          One exception is the Savannah Agriculture Development Authority (SADA), a government effort to tackle
       underdevelopment, poverty and vulnerability in deprived regions of the country. According to the 2014
       national budget statement, about 5,000 youths were engaged in SADA’s tree planning programme.




   Ghana INTER-AGENCY COUNTRY REPORT |Addressing child labour and the youth decent work deficit: policy priorities     95
      effectively “mainstream” vulnerable youth into public works programmes
      as part of broader strategy promoting youth employment. Experience
      from public works programmes targeting youth outside Ghana indicate
      that adding mandatory technical, behavioural skills, financial literacy, or
      job search training to the public works initiatives can further increase
      their impact in terms of improving youth employment outcomes.

9.3.4 Youth entrepreneurship
      169. Promoting youth entrepreneurship represents another important
      demand-side strategy for expanding youth employment opportunities and
      improving employment outcomes for the large proportion of Ghanaian
      youth currently underemployed or outside of employment and education.
      A wide array of efforts promoting youth entrepreneurship is currently
      underway in the country, guided by the national Youth Enterprise Support
      (YES) Programme135 and bolstered by the accompanying Youth
      Entrepreneurship Fund.136 These include the Venture Capital Trust Fund
      (VCTF),137 the Student Entrepreneurship Business Model,138 the Graduate
      Entrepreneurial and Business Support Scheme (GEBSS),139 the Rural
      Enterprises Programme (REP),140 Microfinance and Small Loans Centre

      135
         The national Youth Enterprise Support (YES) Programme is a multi-sectoral Presidential Initiative involving
      other agencies such as the National Youth Authority, National Board for Small Scale Industries (NBSSI),
      Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Youth and Sports.
      136
          A GH¢10 million Youth Entrepreneurship Fund was launched to bolster national Youth Enterprise Support
      (YES) Programme. It targets 18 to 35 year olds with the aim to honing their entrepreneurial skills, providing
      mentorship and supporting them to develop their own start-ups or grow their existing business. Out of 107
      participants that were selected and provided with training, 42 beneficiaries had received a total of GH¢1.2
      million by the end of September 2015.
      137
         The mission of the Venture Capital Trust Fund (VCTF) is to make available low cost financial support to
      Small and Medium scale Entreprises (SMEs) towards aiding their growth, creation of jobs and wealth.
      Financial support to SMEs is usually done through Venture Capital Financing Companies (VCFCs), who invest
      equity for a period not exceeding 10 years. Since its inception, the VCTF has mobilized in excess of GH¢100
      million. It has created 5 VCFCs and over 46 investee companies. (Source: Annual Report of VCTF, 2012.)
      138
         The student Entrepreneurship Business Mode, a component of the Development of Skills for Industry
      Project (DSIP), aims to assist students to begin and sustain start-ups as a way of developing their skills and
      competences.
      139
          The Graduate Entrepreneurial and Business Support Scheme (GEBSS) is a public-private partnership
      between the then Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare and Graduate Business Support Scheme
      Limited with support from Management Development and Productivity Institute, Ministry of Finance,
      Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development and the Ministry of Youth and Sports. The scheme aims
      at developing young people with business-focused skills that enables them to begin and grow their own start-
      ups. The 2015 national budget targets 4,000 unemployed graduates. (Source. Official website of GEBSS,
      http://www.gebssghana.org/cat_select.php?linkID=2.)
      140
         The Rural Enterprises Programme (REP) is a micro and small scale enterprise development collaboration
      involving the government of Ghana, International Fund for Agricultural Development and African
      Development Bank. The programme seeks to increase the number of rural micro and small scale enterprises
      (MSM) that generate growth, profit and employment opportunities. The current programme, REP III, is
      expected to run from 2012 to 2017 in at least 161 (i.e. including the 66 old districts) rural municipal and
      district assemblies in all regions across the country. The programme emphasizes on inclusive growth, youth
      employment and women empowerment and plans to create about 100,000 new jobs. (Sources: Ministry of
      Trade and Industry, 2012, Ghana Rural Enterprise Programme II, Executive Summary of Strategic

    170. These efforts notwithstanding, there remains a number of
    outstanding priorities for expanding youth entrepreneurship
    opportunities, particularly for vulnerable youth. Priorities in this context
    include supporting an entrepreneurial culture by including
    entrepreneurship education and training in school. Converting the Rural
    Enterprise Program into a national policy could contribute to targeting
    specific regions where the youth employment situation is worse. Easing
    access to finance, including by guaranteeing loans and supporting micro-
    credit initiatives, is also critical, as a major stumbling block for young
    entrepreneurs is the lack of access to credit and seed funding. Expanding
    access to effective business advisory and support services, and the
    capacity to deliver them, is another key element in promoting youth
    entrepreneurship, as isolation and lack of support prevent many potential
    young entrepreneurs experience from gaining a foothold in the business
    world. The formation of self-help groups, including cooperatives, by
    young people would also allow for better access to supplies, credit and
    market information.

        Microfinance and Small Loans Centre (MASLOC) is an initiative of government that seeks to build
    partnership among the youth towards mobilizing resources for the development of business enterprises and
    the creation of jobs. According to the 2014 national budget statement, MASLOC imported and distributed
    1,000 outboard motors and 6,450 bundles of fishing nets to fishing communities in the country as part of its
    collaboration with the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture. The distribution of the outboard motors was
    expected to generate 13,000 direct jobs and 20,000 indirect jobs. Other MASLOC interventions include a
    Vehicle Hire Purchase Scheme for taxi drivers, Poultry Finance Scheme for poultry farmers, and other input
    supply schemes for hairdressers, food crop farmers, among others.

        Youth in Agriculture Project (YIAP) is a Ministry of Food and Agriculture entrepreneurial development
    initiative started as a pilot in 1999 and then extended nationwide in 2009. The objectives of the project
    include helping youths identify and accept farming as a viable commercial business venture, improving their
    incomes and therefore their livelihood as well as providing motivation for youth to stay in rural areas for
    agriculture.. The components of the project include block farming, livestock and poultry, fisheries and
    aquaculture and agribusiness. Depending on the component, beneficiaries are weaned off support after one
    to three years. The project has had about 300,000 beneficiaries since its inception.
