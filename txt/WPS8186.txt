I.      Introduction

A wide strand of the economic development literature has addressed linkages between the spatial and
economic mobility of people. Early theoretical contributions viewed the mobility of labor from the rural
to urban sectors – fueled by wage differentials – as the key to growth and development (Lewis 1954),
while later models called into question the capacity of urban labor markets to absorb a large influx of low-
skilled workers (Harris and Todaro 1970). More recent work, meanwhile, viewed migration decisions
through the lens of the sending household, which seeks to diversify its income sources and insure against
risk (Stark and Bloom 1985; Rosenzweig and Stark 1989). However, despite the voluminous body of
theoretical and empirical work on internal migration in developing countries, a key question of policy
relevance remains: Is moving up the welfare ladder simply a matter of moving out of one’s household?
We aim to address this question in the context of Uganda, a country characterized by a relatively high
degree of spatial mobility. Previous analyses of nationally-representative data revealed that 1 in 10
household heads had migrated in the previous five years (World Bank 2006). Migration patterns are likely
tied to the country’s substantial regional and rural-urban wealth disparities, which shape the sets of
economic opportunities available to households.3 For example, the share of households who primarily
rely on subsistence agriculture for their income is particularly high among the bottom 40 percent of the
welfare distribution. An analysis of 2002 census data, meanwhile, found that – though rural and urban
populations are mobile – most migration events in Uganda occur within the same region and the majority
of migrants into Kampala come from the adjoining Central region (Mukwaya et al. 2012).
Despite the mobility of its population, most of Uganda’s rural migrants tend to move within their own
region or to another rural area, where the returns to moving are likely lower (World Bank 2006). This fact
poses a bit of a puzzle against the backdrop of Uganda’s urbanization patterns (de Brauw, Mueller, and
Lee 2014). While the bulk of Uganda’s 35 million inhabitants live in rural areas, the country is urbanizing
at a considerable pace. According to recent census data, the country’s overall population density grew by
41 percent between 2002 and 2014 and the share of Uganda’s population living in urban areas increased
by more than 50 percent (from 12.1 percent to 18.4 percent) over the same period (Uganda Bureau of
Statistics 2014). Yet some of this expansion is due to a redefinition of administrative boundaries for urban
areas. An alternative measure of urbanization that is comparable across countries, the agglomeration
index, suggests that Uganda’s urban share is even higher – at 25 percent (World Bank 2012).
While there are some studies that examine migration in Uganda, most rely on cross-sectional data that
pose methodological challenges for identification. Moreover, none of these analyses provides causal
evidence of the impact of migration on welfare. In this paper, we examine the relationship between spatial
and economic mobility in Uganda using data from 2005 through 2012. The paper makes two principal
contributions to the literature. First, it contributes to the policy and academic literature on internal
migration and structural transformation in developing countries through the use of multiple waves of
panel evidence. The use of longitudinal data confers an advantage over cross-sectional analyses which,
though more common in the literature, fail to properly account for time-invariant factors that can

  While economic considerations lead many of Uganda’s migrants to move, other factors also drive migration
decisions. For example, insecurity and conflict, particularly in the North of the country during the 2000s, prompted
the displacement and forced migration of large segments of the rural population (Mulumba and Olema 2009). A
period of reverse migration then followed, with an influx of displaced residents returning to the North (World Bank
2012).


                                                                                                                  2
influence migration decisions and outcomes. To shed light on the drivers of work migration, we further
exploit the time dimension of these data by using lagged explanatory variables that precede the migration
event. Second, the paper relies on a robust panel tracking exercise to contribute to the growing literature
on the causal impact of internal migration on welfare. We rely on exogenous variation in the intensity of
conflict, rainfall shocks for the main staple crop, distance from the capital city, and ethnic migrant
networks in urban areas to explain migration decisions and estimate their welfare impact. Given the
importance of rural-urban migration for the structural transformation of Uganda’s economy, we also
estimate the added marginal impact of moving to an urban area and compare it to that of moving to a
rural area.
Drawing on a rich set of nationally-representative panel data, we find that migrants experience a 58
percentage point gain in per capita consumption after moving. Moving to an urban area, meanwhile,
generates even larger returns: urban migrants enjoy a 65 percentage-point increase in per capita
consumption growth versus a 56 percentage-point increase in per capita consumption growth for rural
migrants during the 2005-2010 period. Despite these potential gains from urban migration, the bulk of
Uganda’s migration flows still occur within rural areas. Several key drivers of these moves emerge from
the analysis. Among young adults, rainfall shocks on maize production spur an exit from agriculture in
favor of urban areas. Meanwhile, living in a remote area constrains individuals from affording the long
and costly move to urban areas, leading them to migrate to closer rural destinations. The intensity of
violent conflict and thin ethnic migrant networks in urban areas are further found to facilitate rural
migration. Being a child of the household head, irrespective of gender, and being a more educated
individual is associated with a higher propensity to migrate. Policies to capture the welfare improvement
from rural-urban migration should thus address the development of road infrastructure and urbanization,
as well investments in the education of male and female children in rural areas.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II assesses the contributions from the
theoretical and empirical literatures on migration. In Section III, we provide a description of the panel data
being used for the descriptive analysis and an overview of the tracking survey data. Section IV uses the
full panel data set to identify the drivers of household-level work migration choices in Uganda. In Section
V, we exploit a tracking panel survey to identify the causal impact of migration on welfare. We provide a
set of conclusions in Section VI.

II.     Literature

Early theoretical contributions on migration focused on economic mobility as a one-way and one-off move
from rural to urban sectors to increase wages, while modern theories have placed an emphasis on
strategic household decisions to send a migrant, the reliance on kinships and networks, and the links
between migrants and their families through remittances.

The classical model for labor migration proposed by Lewis (1954), as well that of Harris and Todaro (1970),
attempted to characterize the effects of migration from the rural to urban sectors. According to the Lewis
(1954) model, labor surpluses in the rural sector can be reallocated to the urban sector through the rural-
urban migration of workers and reduced rural unemployment. Labor migration thus serves to increase
the marginal productivity of labor-intensive technologies in the urban sector and contributes to capital
accumulation and economic growth. While Lewis’ model and extensions find rural-urban migration
beneficial, Harris and Todaro instead critique the argument that the urban sector can exploit an unlimited
supply of excess rural labor. According to their model, as long as wage differentials are favorable in the
urban sector, rural-urban migration flows will continue and can lead to an increased unemployment rate

                                                                                                            3
in the urban sector. The model’s predictions thus suggest a more restrictive approach to rural-urban
migration. Beyond their divergent support for migration, both the Lewis (1950s and 1960s) and Harris-
Todaro (1970s and 1980s) schools of thought ignored rural-rural migration and return migration to rural
areas, as well as the social relationships that surround migration decisions.

In contrast, the new economics approach to migration, stemming from the works of Stark and Bloom
(1985), Rosenzweig and Stark (1989), and Stark (1991), postulates that migration decisions are part of a
collective household strategy to diversify family income and self-insure under missing and imperfect
markets. Migration accordingly represents an important socio-economic decision made by households to
not only maximize income, but also minimize risk, diversify income sources, and relax the constraints
existing in the markets for factors of production (capital, credit, land, and labor) through remittances
(Azam and Gubert 2006). In this view, migration can be international or internal – and go in any direction
(rural-urban, urban-rural, etc.) – for various economic and non-economic purposes. Moreover, whether
within or outside the country, economic migration requires an initial capital endowment to bear the costs
of leaving the original residence and a potential period of unemployment at the destination. Networks
thus play a strong role in lowering migration costs and risks, as largely evidenced in the international
migration literature (Ilahi and Jafarey 1999; Massey et al. 1993; D. McKenzie and Rapoport 2007).
Furthermore, remittances can take any form as part of the contractual arrangements between the
individuals sent out for migration and the rest of their families.

In addition to the theoretical contributions, there is a considerable body of empirical work on the welfare
effects of internal migration in developing countries. Much of this work, however, fails to establish a
causal link between internal migration and welfare. Perhaps the only available experimental evidence of
the impact of internal migration comes from Bangladesh, where Bryan et al. (2014) find large consumption
gains among households randomly chosen to receive a small monetary incentive for migration transport
costs. Recent work from Sub-Saharan Africa relies on panel data with tracking survey components to
assess the welfare effects of moving. Beegle et al. (2011) exploit multiple rounds of panel data over a 13-
year period to examine the links between migration and consumption in Tanzania. The study is novel in
its application of a rigorous individual tracking protocol: approximately 93 percent of baseline households
(and 82 percent of non-deceased individuals) were re-interviewed at least more than a decade after the
preceding survey. After accounting for individual and household fixed effects, the authors uncover a 36
percent impact on per capita consumption among migrants who left their original communities. Using a
similar approach, de Brauw et al. (2013) find even larger welfare gains from migration in Ethiopia.

The available evidence from Uganda, meanwhile, relies primarily on cross-sectional data sets. Using one
round of data from the 2002/03 UNHS, Herrin et al. (2009) observe a negative relationship between
wealth accumulation and the number of moves undertaken by a household head in Uganda. They also
find that long-distance moves are correlated with declines in asset values for migrating households. The
authors suggest that this finding could be linked to regional and linguistic differences in Uganda that
potentially raise barriers to wealth accumulation from migration. However, the reliance on cross-sectional
data raises questions about the robustness of these findings. Strobl and Valfort (2015) combine 2002
census data with weather information to examine the impact of weather-induced migration on
employment outcomes for non-migrants in Uganda. They uncover an adverse effect of migration on
employment outcomes for residents in receiving communities—particularly in areas with fewer roads (a
proxy for low capital mobility). Meanwhile, an unpublished analysis of the 2005/06 UNHS found a positive
correlation between labor mobility and per capita expenditure (World Bank 2008).

                                                                                                         4
Cultural and linguistic barriers may also contribute to the segmentation of migration destinations and
restrict the choice set for migrants in Uganda. Matsumoto et al. (2006) find cross-sectional evidence that
speaking multiple local languages is positively associated with migration status in Uganda. Muto (2012),
meanwhile, uses panel data from 94 rural villages across Uganda to explore the relationship between
information and ethnic migration networks. Using cell network coverage as an instrument, she finds that
households with a mobile phone are more likely to send out a migrant for employment and that this effect
is larger for households with smaller ethnic networks in Kampala. Mwesigye and Matsumoto (2013) also
find that communities with a higher relative share of migrants are more likely to experience land conflicts.

Recent work using panel data, meanwhile, offers new insights on migration in the Ugandan context. An
analysis on the links between migration and schooling, which uses the Uganda National Panel Survey
(UNPS) data sets, finds that attendance drops among schoolchildren whose households have lost an adult
due to migration. However, school attendance is found to increase when the child migrates either solo or
with his or her parents (Ferrone and Giannelli 2015). Gray (2011) analyzes panel data from three regions
in Uganda and finds a positive correlation between high quality soil and non-labor migration. And recent
unpublished work using the UNPS sample suggests that remittances can be a vehicle for financial
inclusion. The authors rely on household fixed effects estimations and uncover a positive relationship
between internal remittances and formal credit (Gross and Ntim 2014).

III.    Data

This analysis relies primarily on nationally-representative data from the Uganda National Household
Survey (2005/06) and the three successive panel waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS,
2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12). The multi-topic surveys elicit rich sets of information on a range of socio-
economic topics, including consumption and migration. The questionnaires were administered at the
individual, agricultural plot, household, and community levels. The original 2005/06 household sample
used for this longitudinal analysis is made up of 3,123 households. The final 2011/12 survey wave is
composed of 2,835 households, of which three-quarters are drawn from the original sample (Table 1).4

These detailed panel data sets allow us to examine spatial mobility in Uganda from a number of different
angles. First, in Section IV, we estimate the drivers of a household’s decision to send a permanent work
migrant. We focus our analysis on work migrants in that section given the importance of labor mobility
for individual welfare and for an economy’s structural transformation and development. To identify
households who have sent work migrants, we rely on questions in the household roster regarding the

procedure.

departures of previous household members and their primary motivation for leaving the household. Any
household that reported having at least one member (aged 15 or older) permanently leave the household
in the 12 preceding months for work is considered as having sent out a work migrant.

Next, in Section V, to identify the causal impact of migration on poverty, we draw on a sub-sample of the
UNPS panel data sets, using the 2005/06 and 2009/10 rounds, for which an intensive individual and
household tracking exercise was conducted. Two households per enumeration area (approximately 20
percent of surveyed households) from the 2005/06 sample were randomly selected for intensive tracking
during the 2009/10 UNPS round. Survey enumerator teams relied on available contact information and
local resource persons to locate those households within the tracking sample that had permanently
moved. In addition, any individuals who had left their original 2005/06 household during the intervening
period (referred to as “split-offs”) were also tracked.5 This yielded a total panel sample of 15,646
individuals who did not move, 1,163 individuals from intact mover households, and 1,791 split-off
individuals who had migrated from their original household during the intervening period. The
information collected by the tracking teams allows us to construct an individual-level panel of those who
remained in their 2005/06 place of residence (referred to here as “stayers”) and those who migrated
elsewhere (referred to here as “movers”). In line with the lag of four to five years between the first two
surveys, individuals aged at least 10 during the 2005/06 survey wave are retained in the panel sample as
they may be migrants during the 2009/10 survey wave. The structure of this tracking data set is presented
in greater detail in Section V.

To construct a set of explanatory variables for these analyses, we also draw on complementary data
sources, including the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data) database (Raleigh et al. 2010), the
WRSI (Water Requirement Satisfaction Index) computed using FAO data (World Bank 2011), 2002 national
census data (Minnesota Population Center 2015), and market price data collected by the Uganda Bureau
of Statistics.

IV.     Drivers of household migration decisions

In this section, we focus our analysis at the household level, arguably the central locus of decision-making
around migration, to examine the drivers behind sending out a work migrant. We draw here on
information from the UNPS household roster on the residential status of individuals in the household and,
for those who have left, their reason for out-migration.6 We use this information to construct our outcome
variable of interest, whether a household has sent a permanent migrant (aged 15 and above) for work in
the preceding 12 months. To analyze the potential drivers of this household migration decision, we rely
on a multivariate framework that exploits the panel dimension of the survey data.

To examine the correlates associated with a household’s decision to send a permanent work migrant, we
first consider the following linear probability model:


5
  The robust individual-level tracking exercise took place for those household members who no longer resided in
their original 2005/06 location and who were related to the household head biologically or through marriage.
Servants and non-relatives living in the household were not tracked.
6
  The reason for out-migration is reported by the household members still residing in the household. With the
exception of the sub-set of households and individuals included in the tracking sample, no information was collected
on these out-migrants after their departure from the household. Moreover, issues with missing observations and
limited information on the type (rural or urban) of out-migrant destination prevent us from analyzing the
household’s decision to send a migrant to a rural or urban area. This question is analyzed in detail in Section V.

                                                                                                                  6
                                 	       =      	   +    ×Χ      	   +       ×       	   +   	 	   						(1)	

where the outcome of interest        	     is an indicator variable for the decision of household ℎ to send a
work migrant at time t+1 (i.e., in the following survey wave). We define	Χ	as the vector of other observed
household characteristics that influence a household’s decision to migrate. These covariates thus serve as
lagged explanatory variables that predate the migration event and thus address the simultaneity problem
associated with regressing migration decisions on contemporaneous outcomes.7 Meanwhile,                     	
represents a set of exogenous factors, such as price and conflict shocks, which may drive a household’s
decision to send a work migrant. The model also includes region and year (to account for time trends)
dummies for time t, and clusters standard errors at the enumeration area level. Despite the reliance on
lagged predictors, this specification cannot account for unobserved factors that determine a household’s
migration behavior, nor can it control for the possible anticipatory changes in behavior that a household
might adopt in advance of sending out a work migrant.

To partially mitigate the concern of endogeneity, we also specify a model as follows:

                             	       =       	 	+       ×Χ   	   +       ×       	   +       +      	 	   				(2)	

where      represents the time-invariant household factors that shape a household’s migration decisions.
By applying a household fixed-effects approach in Equation (2), we are accounting for those household
characteristics – observed or unobserved – that do not vary across the survey waves and are correlated
with the error term in Equation (1). In addition, the parameter captures the within-household variation
of observed characteristics across time. While this non-experimental framework will not fully erase the
bias from our estimates, it will offer insights into the factors associated with a household’s decision to
send a migrant.

Before presenting the econometric results, we provide the household-level means for sending a
permanent work migrant (Table 2). While only 3 to 5 percent of households reported sending out a work
migrant during the first two survey waves, the corresponding share in the latter two waves is markedly
higher. This jump may be tied to a change in the way the household roster module was administered,
since 2010/11 was the first year in which the UNPS employed computer-assisted personal interviewing
methods for data collection. The increase may also be tied to survey fatigue among third-wave respondent
households, since the remainder of the roster would not be administered for that individual. To account
for this possible discrepancy, we include year dummies for all regressions that rely on Equation (1) and
Equation (2).




7
 Note that the reliance on lagged explanatory variables obliges us to ignore all household-level observations from
the 2011/12 UNPS data set, aside from the panel household’s decision to send a work migrant in the preceding 12
months.

Table 3 relies on Equation (1) and Equation (2) to estimate the lagged correlates associated with a
household’s decision to send a work migrant (while excluding the other potential drivers,            	 , as
            8
covariates). The results in column (1) reveal that, on average, migrant-sending households are more likely
to be headed by a woman9 and by men who are more educated. In addition, having a larger relative supply
of household labor, including adult women and men, is associated with a higher probability of sending out
a work migrant in the next survey wave. Living in an urban area, meanwhile, is not correlated with sending
out a work migrant. The OLS results also point to spatial variation in sending households: those found in
poorer regions of Uganda (Eastern and Northern) are three to five percentage points less likely to send
work migrants when compared with households in Kampala. The bulk of these variables fail to retain their
significance after controlling for household fixed effects in column (2).

Next, we examine in Table 4 the relationship between the decision to send out a work migrant and the
household’s welfare status prior to the migration event. We find evidence of a positive relationship
between welfare and sending a migrant for work. Even after controlling for a number of related factors,
such as education level and the size of the household, we still find that households who send work
migrants are better off economically. Indeed, we observe in column (1) a positive relationship between a
household’s per capita consumption level and its decision to send a work migrant in the next survey wave.
While poor households are as likely as non-poor households to send a work migrant (cols. (3) and (4)), the
poorest 40 percent of households are 2 percentage points less likely (col. 5) to do so. None of these
explanatory variables remains significant when household fixed effects are applied.

We now turn our attention to other observed exogenous factors, identified as              	 in Eqs. (1) and (2),
which could induce a household to send a permanent work migrant. The variables in Table 5 are grouped
into categories – such as prices, shocks, and access to networks – which have been previously identified
as potential push and pull factors for migration. While a number of these factors have been theorized and
identified in the literature, we still know comparatively little about their relative importance for migration
decisions (D. McKenzie and Yang 2012).

First, in columns (1) and (2) of Table 5, we examine the relationship between lagged market prices for
crops and a household’s decision to send a work migrant. We observe in col. (1) that a 1 percent increase
in the average price of maize, one of Uganda’s principal agricultural crops, is associated with a 0.09
percent higher likelihood of sending a work migrant in the next panel wave. After controlling for
household-level unobservables that remain constant across time, we observe in column (2) that a similar
positive relationship holds between maize prices and household migration decisions. There is, meanwhile,
an inverse relationship between the prices of matoke – a key staple that is also traded – and sending work
migrants. These results suggest that variation in agricultural market prices can influence household
migration decisions.

In cols. (3) and (4), we test whether household shocks shape future migration decisions. After controlling
for household fixed effects in column (4), we uncover a positive and significant 4 percentage point
relationship between a household experiencing a theft or fire and future out-migration, which suggests
that migration may be an economic coping mechanism for these types of households. Agricultural shocks
and the loss of a household member, meanwhile, do not induce a similar response. We also do not observe
a significant relationship between conflict and violence and the decision to send a work migrant (cols. (5)
and (6)). These null findings may be tied to the timing of these shock events (which can be acute but short
in duration) and the four-year time gap between the first and second survey panel waves. Indeed, the
relationship between fatality events and sending a work migrant is positive and significant when
examining the contemporaneous relationship with household fixed effects (results available upon
request).

Next, we test whether public service availability influences future household migration in columns (7)
through (10). A previous analysis from Uganda found that a lack of service amenities is associated with
greater out-migration (World Bank 2012). We find further evidence in support of this assertion. Having a
primary school within an hour of the household is associated with a two percentage point lower likelihood
(sig. at 10 percent level) of sending a work migrant in the next wave.

Liquidity and credit access can also shape household migration decisions. Panel evidence from rural South
Africa, for example, suggests that relaxing the credit constraints of households via transfer schemes can
boost employment through labor migration (Ardington, Case, and Hosegood 2009). We examine whether
these factors matter for the Ugandan context in columns (11) through (14). Having a formal loan and a
formal savings account increases the likelihood of being a migrant-sending household in the next wave
(by 3 and 6 percentage points, respectively). The results in columns (11) and (13) suggest that facilitating
households’ access to these savings and credit products could help them overcome liquidity constraints
to migration. We explore this question in further detail in Section V.

Access to information and migration networks has also been found to play a role in migration decisions in

migration (Table 5, columns (15) and (16)). However, we uncover a strong and positive relationship when
regressing a household’s current work migrant status on the share of migrants within the head's ethnicity
– along with a set of contemporaneous covariates (results available upon request). We also find in column
(17) that a household’s reliance on networks for insuring against shocks is associated with a 3 percentage
points lower likelihood of sending out a migrant in the next survey round. This finding suggests that
households with less robust local support networks could instead rely on spatial diversification (through
migration) to deal with risk. In line with Muto (2012), we further find that mobile phone ownership
positively predicts household migration decisions (col. (19)).10 This result suggests that information
received through mobile technologies can facilitate spatial mobility.

Finally, in column (21), we assess whether a household’s pre-migration distance from Kampala is
associated with sending out a migrant (fixed effects results are not reported here since this variable does
not change over time for most households). While holding all other covariates from Table 3 constant, we
find no evidence of a significant relationship between these two variables. Intuitively, we could expect
this insignificant result, especially for households not living in the Central Region, due to the prevalence
of intra-regional migration trends in Uganda.

  One may suspect that some of these household-level variables, such as access to formal savings and mobile
phones, are merely correlates of having a higher level of welfare (which is also associated with out-migration).
However, we find that these results are robust to the inclusion of lagged household welfare levels, suggesting that
these point estimates are not merely artifacts of higher pre-migration consumption levels.

V.      Impact of migration on welfare in Uganda

Measuring the causal impact of migration on welfare is not a straightforward task. McKenzie and Sasin
(2007) identify three main methodological problems. The first relates to selection bias as individuals who
elect to migrate tend to differ from non-migrants on a range of characteristics and dimensions, and these
differences may also shape welfare outcomes. The second problem is omitted variable bias, which arises
if there are certain unobserved or unobservable characteristics that simultaneously drive the decision to
migrate and welfare outcomes – but are unaccounted for in the estimation model. Another problem is
reverse causality, which can occur when an outcome of interest actually causes the migration event.
Moving out might result in one being less poor, but the non-poor might be those who are actually moving
out. McKenzie and Sasin (2007) thus propose the use of randomized experiments to surmount these
problems and measure a causal link between migration and poverty. In the absence of experimental data,
however, the use of migrant panel data can address most of these methodological concerns in assessing
the welfare impact of migration (McKenzie and Sasin 2007; Beegle, De Weerdt, and Dercon 2011).

This section draws on two rounds of longitudinal data to estimate the returns to migration through an
instrumental variables approach. We make use of an individual migrant panel sample covering the period
2005/06 to 2009/10. A panel sample of 18,600 individuals was tracked from 3,123 parent households
originally surveyed in 2005/06 (Figure 1). After restricting the individual panel sample to those aged 10
and above at baseline (2005/06), the final sample used in this section consists of a panel of 12,600
individuals, 10,850 (86%) of whom had remained in their original communities (“stayers”) and 1,750 (14%)
of whom had migrated to other communities (“movers”) by 2009/10. Among movers, 38% were rural-
rural migrants, 5% were urban-rural migrants, 29% were rural-urban migrants, and 28% were urban-urban
migrants. Descriptive evidence presented later in this section shows differences in per-capita
consumption between movers and stayers, and between movers to rural areas versus movers to urban
areas. However, these differences might not necessarily arise from migration itself or the migration
destination choice, and would hence require the use of an appropriate methodology for assessing the
welfare impact of migration.

To empirically investigate the causal link between migration and poverty during the period 2005/06
through 2009/10 in Uganda, we employ the instrumental variables methodological framework used by
Beegle et al. (2011) and de Brauw et al. (2013). We model the out-migration decision and assess the
welfare impact of moving out, and then we model the decisions to migrate to urban and rural destinations
to assess the welfare impact of those specific moves. While some variables affect both migration and
welfare, others (the excluded instruments) affect migration without directly influencing the consumption
paths of migrants and non-migrants. We include as endogenous regressors for migration and welfare the
following set of variables: marital status, individual’s level of education, household composition, gender,
and age. Unmarried individuals will face different propensities to migrate than married individuals, while
educated individuals will be more likely to move and grasp opportunities outside their communities, likely
leading to increases in their consumption levels relative to non-educated individuals. Household
composition variables may also interact with the gender and age of individuals, given their different
incentives for migration. Additional variables used in Beegle et al. (2011) such as the father’s level of
education and mother’s level of education are explored in the sample descriptive statistics, but are not
included in the estimations due to the frequency of missing values. We explore as well a measure of
financial inclusion that captures whether or not the individual has received a loan from any source (formal
or informal), as credit access may influence the initial capital for migration and generate different levels
of migration; however, we do not include this variable in the estimations due to the endogeneity problem
with migration.

McKenzie and Sasin (2007) discuss four common types of instruments found in the migration literature:
economic shocks; natural shocks; distance; and cultural, historical, community and political factors. We
rely on the latter three categories of variables as excluded instruments, which may influence an
individual’s migration decision without affecting consumption paths. We use the water requirement
satisfaction index for maize as a proxy for rainfall shocks on agricultural production and food security. The
motivation behind this variable is that rural individuals affected by rainfall deficits for a key agricultural
crop may rely on migration as a livelihood strategy. In addition to this natural shock instrument, one’s
distance from the regional capital is used as an instrument for migration because it may facilitate or
impede one’s spatial mobility. We also use the share of one’s ethnicity living in urban areas as a proxy for
urban migration networks. The motivation behind this variable is mixed in that individuals may find it
easier to move to areas where they have an established network, but according to the social identity
theoretical argument, they may also prefer to move to urban areas where they do not have a large ethnic
network. Another excluded instrument pertains to the intensity of deadly conflict as a proxy for the
existence of community or political violence, which may force or impede migration. The final set of
excluded instruments, drawn from Beegle et al. (2011) and de Brauw et al. (2013), consists of an
individual’s position within the household, including household headship – as heads or spouses likely face
different cultural and family pressures to move compared to other household members such as children.

The welfare impact of moving is specified as follows:

                   ∆          ,   =   +          +      +     ,                        (3)

where ∆         , 	is (         −       ) the change in the logarithm of per capita consumption in the
household h in which individual i is residing at time t or (t+1) – i.e., the growth rate of per capita
consumption.           is the dummy variable capturing whether the individual i has moved from the
household during the period t to (t+1). The difference-in-difference specification in equation (1) controls


                                                                                                           16
for       representing initial individual-level characteristics (marital status, individual educational
attainment, gender, and age) which might influence the level of consumption, and for ℎ representing
the initial household-level fixed effects on consumption. The inclusion of initial household fixed effects
aims to identify the impact of migration using variation between members of the initial household (Beegle,
De Weerdt, and Dercon 2011). The difference-in-difference approach eliminates all time-invariant
additive selection bias, and its combination with household fixed effects makes it possible to eliminate
observable heterogeneity in time-invariant individual characteristics within the household. The remaining
time-varying individual-level omitted heterogeneity is eliminated through the instrumental variables
approach.

For reasons introduced earlier, Equation (3) is not only estimated through an OLS procedure, but also
through a 2SLS procedure after identifying variables that influence the decision to migrate, but not
consumption growth. Exclusion variables that are used are those instruments not correlated with changes
in per capita consumption except through the migration channel. Several instruments are adapted to our
data to satisfy the exclusion tests.11 Five excluded instruments were retained. First, an individual’s position
within the household – whether he or she is a head or spouse of the head; child of the head; and male
child of the head – is used as an excluded instrument as this reflects the social and family norms that
generate variation in the likelihood of migration among household members. If a family were to choose
the member who will migrate, then the household would need to assess its impact on family labor needs
and weigh the expected costs and benefits of migration before choosing whether the head, spouse, or
other members would be the mover. Depending on the existing migration opportunities and the demand
for certain skills for jobs at the destination, the head or spouse could be the one to migrate. We can also
expect male children of the head or any child of the head – irrespective of the gender – to be more likely
to leave the home community than others in the household. These individual positions in the household
are used as excluded instruments because head or spouse, children, or male children will have the same
per capita consumption levels unless they migrate.

The second excluded instrument is the interaction between the share of migrants with their same
ethnicity in urban areas (based on census data) and being a young adult at baseline (aged 15 to 24 years).
This interaction term reflects one’s urban migrant network coupled with different migration opportunities
and incentives for young adults (male and female) to engage in low-skill labor or for young female adults
to migrate for marriage purposes. The use of the share of migrants with the same ethnicity in urban
areas—drawn from the 2002 census data—as an instrument is not only inspired by recent panel tracking
studies, but also by Muto (2012), who points to the importance of shared ethnicity as a factor for
migration destination decisions in Uganda. This instrument is expected to positively influence urban
migration or negatively influence rural migration. It can be assumed that, if two individuals with different
urban migrant networks have different welfare paths, it will be due to differences in their migration status
– after controlling for the individual characteristics in .

The interaction between the log of the number of fatalities from conflict and being a young adult (aged
15 to 24 years) is the third excluded instrument; a negative coefficient expresses that, in communities


11
  The interaction between an individual’s age rank in the household and being a young adult (aged 14-24 years)
was used to indicate a higher probability for older adults to migrate than younger adults. This variable did not
prove to be a valid instrument (IV model satisfying instrument relevance, lack of over-identification, and efficiency
over OLS).

                                                                                                                   17
subject to violent conflict, older adults migrate more easily than younger adults; a positive coefficient
expresses that, among young adults, those located in conflict-prone communities are more likely to
migrate than those not in such communities. The number of reported fatalities from conflict events is
sourced from the geo-referenced Armed Conflicts Location Events Data (ACLED). It captures the incidence
of violent conflict per year in a 25-kilometer vicinity of each household, and is thus not associated to
specific ethnicities but to spatial intensities of violence. This conflict-related variable was interacted with
being a young adult to express a lower probability of migration for younger rather than older adults, under
the same level of conflict. If we had not controlled for this conflict-age interaction, the level of spatial
intensity of violence might also determine the consumption growth of the household, rather than solely
through the migration channel.

The fourth excluded instrument is the interaction between the log of the Water Requirement Satisfaction
Index (WRSI) for maize and being a young adult at baseline (aged 15 to 24 years), as a proxy measure of a
push factor for the migration for young adults. The WRSI for a crop, in a given geographic region and
during a growing period or the entire season, represents a function of the water available in the soil
relative to the water required by the crop to grow; the lower the rainfall, the heavier the water stress for
the crop, and thus, the lower the WRSI (World Bank 2011). This rainfall shock-related variable interacted
with being a young adult in 2005/06 expresses a lower probability of migration among those of age to
migrate in 2009/10, should the rainfall be high or sufficient to allow for maize crop production. A negative
coefficient of this instrument is expected to be associated with migration. In a context of inexistent or
weak crop insurance mechanisms, rainfall deficits in origin areas will likely not drive rural migration
because it can be expected that the neighboring rural areas, which will be the most likely rural migration
destinations, will also face a rainfall deficit. As a consequence, a rainfall deficit would prompt one to leave
a rural area in favor of urban migration. While this instrument does determine migration, it does not
determine the consumption growth of the household outside the migration channel because poor
(respectively rich) households can still be found in high (respectively low) rainfall areas.

Finally, the interaction between the log of the distance to the regional capital and being a young adult at
baseline (aged 15 to 24 years) is used as a measure of the increased opportunities for young adults living
near the regional capital city when compared with young adults living further away. It can be expected
that, among males of age to migrate in 2009/10, an increase in their distance to the regional capital at
baseline will be associated with rural rather than urban migration. Distance to the regional capital is used
as an excluded instrument since distance to cities generates cost differentials among candidates for
migration without directly affecting their consumption paths.

The exclusion variables thus appear in the first-stage regression of the decision to migrate, but not in the
second-stage regression specified in Equation (3). As part of goodness-of-fit checks for Equation (3), the
relevance of the excluded instruments was assessed through the Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic and
Sanderson-Windmeijer multivariate F test of excluded instruments in the first-stage regression, the non-
over-identification of restrictions through the Sargan test, and the Hausman test for endogeneity of the
migration variable (Baum, Schaffer, and Stillman 2003).

To estimate the effect of moving to an urban destination (defined at the enumeration area level) on
consumption growth, Equation (3) is modified into Equation (4) by replacing   +1 , the dummy variable
for migration, with +1 , the dummy variable for migration to urban destinations, taking a value of 1 for



                                                                                                            18
movers to urban destinations and a null value for stayers;          +1 	is   not defined for movers to rural
destinations:

                   ∆         ,   =   +          +      +     ,                          (4)

Likewise, to estimate the effect of moving to a rural destination (defined at the enumeration area level)
on consumption growth, Equation (3) is modified into Equation (5) by replacing     +1 , the dummy variable
for migration, with +1 , the dummy variable for migration to rural destinations, taking a value of 1 for
movers to rural destinations and a null value for stayers;       +1 	is not defined for movers to urban
destinations:

                   ∆         ,   =   +          +      +     ,                          (5)


Equation (4) and Equation (5) are also estimated through a 2SLS procedure. The same explanatory
variables instrumenting mover status in Equation (3) are used in the first-stage regressions for Equation
(4) and Equation (5), with the same exclusion variables. Sample size limitations for the move direction do
not allow for heterogeneity analysis on the sub-sample of individuals initially living in rural areas and the
sub-sample of individuals initially living in urban areas (in other words, to estimate the welfare impact of
rural-urban and urban-urban migration); similarly, the welfare impact of rural-rural and urban-rural
migration could not be isolated. In addition, estimations on the sub-sample who move specifically to
Kampala were not possible due to sample size restrictions.

Differences in the baseline characteristics of individuals who stayed and moved between 2005/06 and
2009/10 are presented in Table 6. There are significant differences in welfare characteristics between
movers and stayers at baseline (2005/06) which need to be accounted for in the econometric analysis.
Baseline consumption levels are dissimilar. Although movers come from households that are just as likely
to be poor as stayers at baseline, movers to urban areas are less poor than stayers (18.2% versus 22.4%),
while movers to rural areas are poorer than stayers (29.6% versus 22.4%). Fewer movers are in the bottom
40 percent of the welfare distribution than stayers (13.8% versus 39.8%).

There are also differences in demographic characteristics between movers and stayers at baseline,
although movers and stayers have similar shares of males and females in their sub-samples (Table 6).
Movers are more likely to be young adults (15-24 age category) and less likely to be old adults and seniors
(35-49, 50-65, and 66+ age categories) than stayers. In addition, there are differences in the individual
position in the household between movers and stayers, with movers less likely to be a head or spouse, or
male or female child of the head when compared to stayers. In terms of marital status, movers are more
likely than stayers to be unmarried. Unmarried females are particularly more associated with urban
movers than stayers.

Educational differences also emerge between movers and stayers. While movers have completed 0.25
more years of schooling than stayers, the gap between movers to urban areas and stayers is more than
twice as large; in contrast, movers to rural areas have completed 0.21 fewer years of schooling than
stayers (Table 6). Fathers of movers tend to be better educated than those of stayers, while mothers of
movers have received less education than those of stayers.

In addition, compared with stayers, movers are less likely to have received a loan at baseline, suggesting
that those who migrate may be less financially constrained. The gap in credit access between rural movers


                                                                                                          19
and stayers is three times as large as the gap between urban movers and stayers, suggesting that
migration to urban areas demands more initial capital than migration to rural areas.

Furthermore, movers live closer to Kampala and to their regional capital at baseline when compared with
stayers – yet rural movers are located further away from Kampala and their regional capital than stayers.
Movers have a lower maize WRSI than stayers, indicating a higher rainfall deficit among movers; the
rainfall deficit faced by urban movers relative to stayers is twice as large as the one for rural movers.
Movers come from areas that are more prone to violent conflict than stayers, with an even larger
incidence of conflicts for urban movers than for rural movers. The share of urban migrants within one's
ethnicity is slightly larger for movers (14.1%) than for stayers (12.6%), with a larger share for urban movers
than for rural movers. At baseline, movers (especially urban movers) are more likely to have a high age
rank when compared with stayers. All the above baseline characteristics of movers and stayers, however,
are descriptive in nature and do not control for factors that may influence migration or consumption.

Cumulative distribution functions of consumption are presented for movers versus stayers (Figure 2) and
by move direction (Figure 3). Consumption levels of stayers and movers started off with relatively similar
distributions in 2005/06. In 2009/10, however, not all movers experience higher consumption levels as
compared to stayers. Indeed, the bottom 50% of movers fare the same when compared to stayers in
2009/10 (Figure 2). In fact, movers follow two different welfare paths in 2009/10, one corresponding to
moves to rural destinations and the other corresponding to moves to urban destinations. As compared to
stayers, movers to rural destinations had a consumption gap in 2005/06, which was almost closed after
migration in 2009/10. The consumption distribution of movers to urban destinations dominates that of
stayers in 2005/06 and 2009/10 (Figure 3). This descriptive analysis suggests that the welfare impact of
out-migration will be strongly positive, regardless of the move direction. Furthermore, it indicates that
the welfare impact of migration to urban destinations will be stronger than the welfare impact of
migration to rural destinations.

Drivers and welfare impact of out-migration

Earlier descriptive analysis suggests there are likely poverty differences across time between stayers and
movers. To estimate the drivers of moving out – irrespective of the direction – and its welfare impact, we
rely on the two-stage regression procedure described previously. Table 7 presents the first stage
regression results on the drivers of out-migration, and Table 8 shows the OLS and IV (second stage)
regression results on the welfare impact of out-migration.

Results on the drivers of out-migration show that movement out of one’s original residence is driven by
demographic-specific traits. We observe that, when compared with non-adults, individuals aged between
25 and 49 are more likely to be movers (Table 7), suggesting that migrants selected for the move tend to
be of an economically active age. We also observe that individuals selected for out-migration hold a
particular position in the household. While being a head or spouse is associated with a lower propensity
to migrate by 1.6 percent, being a child of the head increases the propensity to migrate (Table 7). In
addition, individual educational attainment influences out-migration. At a 5% level of significance, a one-
year increase in schooling leads to 0.1 percent increase in the incidence of out-migration. This suggests
that further human capital investments may be needed to facilitate out-migration.

Moving out is also driven by violent conflict shocks and distance to the regional capital. A one log-unit
increase in the number of fatalities leads to a 0.8 percent increase in the incidence of out-migration, for
young individuals of prime age to migrate. The same effect is observed from a one-log-unit increase in the

                                                                                                                                                                                          24
distance to the regional capital. Thus, migrants are those experiencing violent conflicts and living further
from the regional capital.

The results in Table 8 on the impact of migration over the 2005-2010 period highlight the strongly positive
welfare effects from leaving one’s original residence. Ignoring the move direction, IV estimations suggest
that, at a 1% level of significance, movement out of one’s original residence adds 58.2 percentage points
to consumption growth (column 2). Out-migration returns are found to be significantly larger when
individuals have completed more years of schooling and when they are seniors (50-65 and 66+ age
categories).

We assess the validity of the IV estimation in Tables 7 and 8 through a number of checks. First, the
excluded instruments are jointly significant in the first stage regression, based on results from the
Sanderson-Windmeijer F-test (Table 7). The regressions also do not employ more instruments than
needed as we failed to reject the null hypothesis of the Sargan test, according to which the instruments
are not correlated with the error process. Furthermore, out-migration proves to be endogenous to
consumption growth, in which case the OLS impact estimates in column 1 would be biased and
inconsistent, as opposed to the IV impact estimates in column 2 (Table 8).

Drivers and welfare impact of the move to urban or rural destinations

To account for the likely heterogeneity in per capita consumption among movers based on their move
direction, further two-stage models are estimated, one for urban migration following Equation 4, and the
other for rural migration following Equation 5. The first stage regressions are presented in Table 9, with
the drivers of moving to rural destinations (column 1) and those of moving to urban destinations (column
2). The corresponding impacts on consumption growth are presented in Table 10, with the OLS regressions
in columns (1) and (3), and the second stage regressions in columns (2) and (4).

Results on the drivers of migration to a rural area (column 1) complement the drivers of out-migration. At
a 1% level of significance, for individuals of prime age to migrate, a one log-unit increase in the distance
to the regional capital leads to a 0.6 percent increase in the incidence of rural migration (column (1) in
Table 9). A one log-unit increase in the number of fatalities leads to a 0.8 percent increase in the incidence
of rural migration, for individuals of age to migrate. The above results indicate that remoteness and the
intensity of violent conflict prompt a move to rural destinations. In addition, having a dense ethnic migrant
network in urban areas deters young adults from migrating to rural destinations. At a 10% level of
significance, a 1 percent decrease in one’s shared ethnicity in urban areas translates into a 6.7 percent
increase in the propensity to migrate to rural areas. (The corresponding point estimate for the move to
urban areas, while statistically insignificant, is of a similar magnitude but with the opposite sign.)

One’s age also drives one’s propensity to migrate to rural areas. Results show that, when compared with
non-adults, those aged between 25 and 49 are more likely to be movers to rural destinations (column (1)
in Table 9). Individual educational attainment, meanwhile, does not determine rural (or urban) migration
decisions.

Results also indicate that individuals selected for rural migration hold particular positions in the
household. Being a head or spouse is associated with a 1.1 percent decrease in the propensity to migrate
to rural destinations (column (1) in Table 9). In contrast, being a child of head is associated with a 1.2
percent increase in the propensity to migrate to rural destinations for females, and with a 0.6 percent
increase in the incidence of rural migration of males (column (1) in Table 9). These effects on male and
female children of the head, however, do not mean that females are assigned to rural migration and males
to urban migration. As can be found for the drivers of urban migration (column (2) in Table 9), being a
child of the head, irrespective of gender, is associated with a 2 percent increase in the propensity to
migrate to urban destinations. Females and males are thus equally likely to move to urban destinations.

Rainfall shocks on maize, meanwhile, serve as a strong predictor of urban migration (column (2) in Table
9). A one log-unit decrease in the WRSI (increased rainfall deficit) leads to a 5.2 percent increase in the
incidence of out-migration for young adults. Thus, in rain-fed agricultural areas and in the absence of crop
insurance, rainfall deficits lead some individuals to escape from rural areas and settle in urban areas. In
addition, when compared with non-adults (those aged 10-14), individuals aged 15 to 49 are more likely to
move to urban destinations (column (2) in Table 9).

When examining the welfare impact of the move to urban destinations, results indicate that, regardless
of the origin, at a 1% level of significance, moving to rural destinations leads to a 56 percentage point
increase in per capita consumption growth relative to staying during the 2005-2010 period (column (2) of

                                                                                                           28
Table 10). Meanwhile, the impact estimate of urban migration, at 65 percentage points, is markedly higher
(column (4) of Table 10). At a marginal level of significance, the urban impact estimate is stronger for
those aged between 50 and 65 years (relative to the reference category).

Overall, the findings suggest that migration generates substantial welfare gains – with even larger gains
accrued to those who migrate to urban areas. In terms of drivers, rainfall shocks serve as a push factor
for urban migration, while remoteness, violent conflict, and weak urban migrant networks induce
individuals to migrate to rural areas.

Discussion

Estimation results put forward in this section point to welfare gains of 58 percentage points due to out-
migration, gains of 65 percentage points due to migration to urban destinations, and gains of 56 percent
due to migration to rural destinations. The results also highlight a number of factors that determine which
households would send out migrants, which household member would leave the household, and to which
destination the member would migrate.

How do our results on welfare impact and factors for migration align with previous empirical findings?
Similar poverty and migration studies demonstrated the positive welfare impact of migration as well as
household-specific and individual-specific factors for migration. The findings from Beegle et al. (2011) in
Tanzania strongly support our results. They uncovered a 36 percentage-point growth in consumption
relative to staying, 18 to 27 percentage-point consumption growth for movers to rural areas, and 66
percentage-point consumption growth for movers to urban areas, which are very close to our impact
estimates of 65 percentage points for urban migration. Ignoring the direction of the move, de Brauw et
al. (2013) find even larger impacts, with migrants achieving 110 percent higher consumption than non-
migrants in Ethiopia.

Similar to other studies, our results also suggest that education matters for out-migration and
consumption growth. While the average individual in our sample has completed just 5 years of schooling,
we find that an additional year of schooling increases the incidence of out-migration by approximately 0.1
percent. Brockerhoff and Eu (1993) highlight evidence that educated females most likely migrate to cities.
In their analysis, Beegle et al. (2011) also highlight the positive influence (with a convex effect) of
individual education on migration and consumption. While our results focus primarily on individual
educational attainment and do not account for the likely effect of the educational attainment of one’s
biological parents ,they do not depart from the evidence from numerous poverty studies that a primary
level of education adds little to consumption levels (Haughton and Khandker 2009).

Previous studies also examine the role of insurance versus investment as drivers for migration. For
Kleemans (2015), migration may evolve as an ex-post risk coping strategy to survive in the face of negative
income shocks or as an investment strategy to increase future expected income after facing liquidity
constraints. Beegle et al. (2011) find that young people experiencing rainfall shocks migrate and that
physical mobility is not associated with financial constraints. Though not testing financial access as an
instrument for migration, our results indicate that, for those living far from regional capitals, a less costly
move to a rural area is the only viable option.

Previous work further suggests a positive effect of networks on migration, thus supporting our finding
that having a thin urban migrant network leads to rural rather than urban migration. Network
relationships build upon social connections of kinship, friendship, and shared community origin to reduce
the costs and risks associated with the movement, and increase the net expected gains from migration
(Massey et al. 1993). Evidence of reliance on networks for lowering migration costs and risks largely exists



                                                                                                            32
in the international migration literature (Ilahi and Jafarey 1999; Massey et al. 1993; McKenzie and
Rapoport 2007).

Moreover, our results indicate the importance of positional variables in the household – with heads or
spouses constrained from making the move – and the equal propensity of males and females to migrate
to urban areas. Contrary to the expectation that males would be more likely to leave their communities
for welfare improvement, our results indicate that females also benefit from urban migration
opportunities. Brockerhoff and Eu (1993), in their demographic and health studies of eight Sub-Saharan
African countries including Uganda, associate rural-urban migration with females in their twenties who
reach cities for marriage purposes. However, females may also leave their communities for reasons other
than marriage, such as independence from social and family constraints, employment, and education
(Chant 1992; Tacoli 1998).

In addition, our findings suggest that rainfall deficits, particularly on maize production, drive migration to
urban areas—where welfare gains are highest. In the absence of rainfall shocks, a rural household faces a
lower risk of food insecurity and consequentially relies less on migration as a livelihood strategy. After
experiencing a rainfall shock, urban migration – and an exit from agriculture – becomes a more salient
option for households seeking to escape this covariate risk. Meanwhile, one’s distance to urban areas and
urban migrant networks matter for making the rural move, suggesting that these factors lead to an inferior
choice relative to urban moves. People face difficulties in reaching cities when they live in remote areas,
given the long distances and high transportation costs, while those lacking urban ethnic-based networks
opt instead to move to rural areas. Finding ways to remove these constraints will enhance urban migration
opportunities for rural households, especially for those individuals of an economically active age.

VI.     Conclusion

Our findings indicate that migration, particularly to urban destinations, can offer considerable welfare
improvements as predicted by the traditional labor migration model. Yet the evidence presented here
suggests that push factors such as rainfall deficits for cereal production lead one to undertake urban
migration. In contrast, distance to the regional capital and thin urban migrant networks increase initial
migration costs, thus restricting migrant candidates to moves to rural destinations. The findings also
reveal that an increase in the intensity of conflict forces young adults to move to rural areas. In addition
to these migration factors that are external to household control, the findings expose how education
leverages higher consumption levels through out-migration, and how female children of the head are as
likely to move to urban areas as their male counterparts.

Drawing on these conclusions, the study can propose four key policy implications. First, the welfare impact
of migration strongly supports urbanization and pro-rural-urban migration policies for their linkage to
poverty reduction in Uganda and similar developing countries. Such policies can transform the lives of
rural individuals prone to shocks by offering them migration opportunities to boost their earning potential
in urban areas. Second, the development of road infrastructure, while increasing the connectedness of
rural areas and developing access to markets, would also likely reduce the financial burdens of migration
through a reduction in transport costs, thus increasing the capacity to migrate to urban areas. Addressing
this constraint could be of particular benefit to those who live in remote areas that are far from a city or
town, as well as those who have a weak urban migrant network. Third, to ensure females take full
advantage of urban migration opportunities for their own welfare and to facilitate remittance transfers
to their parent households, programs that to delay young women’s age at marriage – such as adolescent

                                                                                                           33
empowerment interventions (Bandiera et al. 2014) – should be considered. And finally, the results
highlight the importance of investments in the education of rural populations, which would increase
human capital and enhance the migration potential for future generations.
