    ~ WORLD BANKGROUP                        Governance Global Practice
The Governance Agenda in East Asia and Pacific
Officials in the East Asia and Pacific Region (EAP) have long recognized t hat good governance is essen-
tial for reducing poverty and building prosperity. The World Bank Group's EAP Regional Strategy for
2014 includes "Governance and Institutions" as one of five strategic pillars focusing on public financial
management. fiscal decentralization, and service delivery.

EAP also developed a Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) Implementation Plan for FY15-17 in re-
sponse t o the WBG 2012 Strengthening Governance Corporate Strategy. EAP's GAC Implementation
Plan is based on three principles: (1) clear government ownership of reforms, (2) bottom-up priorit iza-
tion, and (3) country partnership frameworks.

The EAP Regional Vice-Presidency and the Governance Global Practice are helping client s to:

 • Strengthen public institutions through governance-related sectoral engagements, support for de-
   centra lization of service provision, and collaboration on measures to enhance accountability;
 • Enhance transparency through expanded sharing of knowledge and information, and innovat ive
   uses of information and communications technology; and
 • Improve public resource management through support for core public resource management sys-
   tems and support for more robust natural resource management.

The Parliamentary Strengthening Program,
anchored within the GGP, aims to strengthen
the role of parliament as a governance insti-
tution. The Program includes two initiatives
that focus on open budgeting and staff train-
ing. The program supports the strengthen ing
of regional networks of publi c accounts com-
mittees (PAC) to act as platforms for knowl-
edge exchange and peer learning on good
practices in the oversight of public expendi-
tures. One such network is the Asia Regional
Association of PACs (ARAPAC).

    Governance Partnership Facility Trust Fund, was held on October 16, 2014 in Jakarta . A simila r sem-
    inar was organized in Brazil several weeks earlier.

    Representatives from MOF, National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), Ministry of Home Affairs, and
    other groups participated in the seminar. Over 50 participants heard from selected OECD countries
    (Australia, Austria, Canada, and the Netherlands) on good practice approaches and challenges of
    designing medium-term resource needs of spending agencies (bottom-up cost ing for mediu m-term
    expenditure frameworks). These OECD countries' experiences highlighted that even in advanced
    countries, the program costing is an area under development and is used in a targeted rather than
    universal way.

    Participants also learned about the costing initiatives in t hree subnational governments in Brazil
    and implementat ion challenges of the rolling fiscal plan in both the federal and subnational gov-
    ernments. Both Indonesia and Brazil share heritage financial management systems that are highly
    codified. Brazil's experiences helped the Indonesian government better underst and the challenges
    that wi ll need to be addressed in the country as equivalent reforms proceed.

    After the seminar, the joint Bank team
    discussed with the Directorate General of
    Budget how to improve the costing frame-
    work, moving away from the existing prac-
