EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In Ghana, the agricultural sector remains a backbone of the economy. Nearly two dec-
ades of productivity growth, beginning in the early 1990s, has helped put Ghana back
on a path to recovery following more than a decade of economic uncertainty. With
the exception of millet and sorghum, output for most crops has increased at a faster
rate than population growth. During the 18-year period between 1993 and 2010, the
sector experienced only 1 year (2007) of negative growth. During the same period, it
recorded 3 years when growth exceeded 7 percent. The sector’s remarkable recovery,
facilitated in part by sustained public and private sector investments, has helped pull
thousands of rural households out of extreme poverty. In the early 1990s, nearly two
out of every three (63.6 percent) rural Ghanaians lived below the national poverty line.
By 2006, the ratio had dropped to roughly two in ﬁve (39.2 percent), according to the
National Statistical Service. Ghana is now well on track to reach the ﬁrst Millennium
Development Goal to halve poverty by 2015.

Sustaining the sector’s growth trajectory is a top priority for the recently elected admin-
istration of President John Dramani Mahama. Success will depend, in part, on the
government’s ability to manage the country’s ongoing transition to a more diversiﬁed
economy while ensuring that the country’s smallholder farmers, food processors, and
other sector actors have what they need to remain competitive. It also hinges upon the
ability of all stakeholders to recognize, respond, and adapt to a changing landscape:
one characterized by climate change, increasing weather variability, increasing threats
from pests and diseases, and higher food price volatility, among other risks. The cata-
strophic ﬂooding of 2007 and more recent food price shocks served as stark reminders
of the importance of eﬀective risk management. The government recognizes more
than ever the need to strengthen existing risk management systems not to only ensure
continued sector growth, but also, and more important, to protect the most vulnerable
communities and strengthen their resilience to future shocks.

Improved agricultural risk management is one of the core enabling actions of the
Group of Eight’s (G-8’s) New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. The Agricul-
tural Risk Management Team (ARMT) of the Agriculture and Environment Services
Department of the World Bank conducted an agricultural sector risk assessment to

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
By most measures, agriculture remains a vital sector to the Ghanaian economy. The
sector in 2012 accounted for 23 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), 56 percent
of the labor force, and 35 percent of foreign exchange earnings.1 Following more
than a decade of economic instability (1980–1992) punctuated by 5 years of negative
growth, the sector has since grown at an average annual rate of 4.0 percent. Although
falling well short of growth targets under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture
Development Programme (CAADP), the sector has nonetheless made an important
contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction in recent decades.

Moving forward, raising agricultural productivity—particularly among smallholder
farmers who dominate the agricultural landscape—remains central to the govern-
ment’s rural sector growth and overall economic development strategy, as outlined
in its Medium-Term Agricultural Sector Investment Plan (METASIP). Continued
growth is expected, driven by new investments in productivity-enhancing technologies
and yield gains.

The above narrative, however, masks uncertainties that pose a notable challenge to
continued sector growth. The agricultural sector’s performance and share in most key
socioeconomic indicators has been declining in recent years amid strong expansion
in other sectors of the economy (ﬁgure 1.1; see also appendix H). Yields have mostly
stagnated with increases in output mainly due to the expansion of cultivated area.
The share of agriculture raw materials exports among total merchandise exports has
dropped by roughly half since the mid-1990s, whereas imports have increased nearly
ﬁvefold during the same period. This slide is partly due to a seemingly unbreakable
cycle of inadequate input supplies, inappropriate technology, low levels of savings and
on-farm investment, and low output and productivity growth.

Compounding these challenges is the high level of uncertainty that characterizes
all things agricultural. Owing to a strong reliance on rain-fed, small-scale produc-
tion systems that predominate, the sector is susceptible to downside risks. It is also

OVERVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL
SYSTEMS IN GHANA
Providing context for analysis and discussion of agricultural sector risk, this chap-
ter presents an overview of the agricultural sector in Ghana. Sector characteristics
most pertinent to risk are thus given particular attention. Analysis primarily covers the
period 1991–2010 to assess the frequency and severity of the most important risks.

The agriculture resource base is characterized by an abundance of land and diverse
agro-ecological conditions. Of the 13.7 million hectares of agricultural land, only
7.85 million hectares (58 percent) are under cultivation. Owing to the diversity of
agro-ecological conditions, crop production ranges from millet and sorghum in the
semi-arid north, to maize, cassava, and other root crops in central Ghana, and cocoa,
plantain, palm oil, and rubber in the forest zones of the south. These conditions also
facilitate surplus production of most crops. Livestock production is of lesser impor-
tance, representing 7.5 percent of agricultural GDP (including cocoa).

The high proportion of unused agricultural land also highlights some of the major
constraints that the sector faces: low levels of mechanization, low soil fertility, and
limited access to water for irrigation. Roughly 90 percent of farms in Ghana are small
(< 2 ha) and rely on manual labor or animal traction. Much of the land in the north
and center of Ghana (approximately two-thirds of the total land area) consists of highly
weathered soils with low fertility and low water-holding capacity. Only 30,000 hectares
are irrigated, equivalent to 0.2 percent of total agricultural land. These constraints
limit the ability to raise output and increase vulnerability to drought.

AGRO-CLIMATIC CONDITIONS
There are six agro-ecological zones (ﬁgure 2.1), of which ﬁve are important for agri-
culture. They range from the hot, dry savannah conditions in the north to tropical
and deciduous forests in the south and southwest (table 2.1). The northern savan-
nah regions are hot and dry with a uni-modal rainfall distribution, and a growing
season of 200 to 240 days. Agriculture is demanding in these regions. Agro-climatic

CHAPTER THREE
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR RISKS
The main sources of agriculture risk are reviewed in this chapter: production risk, market
risk, and a general set of risks associated with the enabling environment for agriculture.
The incidence and implications of multiple or successive shocks are also considered.

PRODUCTION RISKS
Drought, ﬂoods, bushﬁres, and pests and diseases are the main sources of production
risk. The incidence of these and other adverse events is shown in ﬁgure 3.1, based
on reports of adverse events for 1980–2011. Drought emerges as the most common
source of major production shocks, followed by pests and diseases and ﬂoods. Related
risk events may occur in isolation, but can also present as multiple, overlapping shocks,
with far greater impacts and higher associated losses.

WEATHER VARIABLES
Drought
An agricultural drought occurs when a deﬁcit of soil moisture signiﬁcantly reduces
crop yields. It can occur in response to low overall annual rainfall or to abnormalities
in the timing and distribution of annual rainfall. Inadequate rainfall at key periods
during the crop production cycle (seeding, ﬂowering, and grain ﬁlling) aﬀects crop
yields, even when overall rainfall is comparable to long-term norms. During these peri-
ods, a soil moisture deﬁcit as short as 10 days can have a major impact on crop yields.
Drought is typically deﬁned relative to some long-term average balance between
precipitation and evapotranspiration, which is considered “normal” for a particu-
lar location at a particular time of year. Drought is thus a relative concept in that
sub-optimal soil moisture levels and crop yields in one agro-climatic area may be
acceptable in another. For purposes of analysis, standardized cumulative rainfall
for the period March–October for each region was calculated for the period 1981–
2010, with drought deﬁned as rainfall less than one standard deviation from the
mean and severe drought as rainfall less than two standard deviations from the
mean. The results are presented in table 3.1. The authors also conducted an in-
depth analysis of rainfall patterns and crop production using data collected from
Ghana’s weather stations (box 3.1).

CHAPTER FOUR
ADVERSE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL RISK
The frequency, severity, and costs of adverse events are analyzed in this chapter as the
basis for prioritizing the various sources of risk. The conceptual and methodological
basis for analysis is outlined ﬁrst and then applied to production, market, and enabling
environment risks. The various sources of risk are then reviewed to discern the most
critical.

CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL
BASIS FOR ANALYSIS
For the purposes of this study, risk is deﬁned as an exposure to a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial
loss or other adverse outcome whose occurrence and severity are unpredictable. Risk
thus implies exposure to substantive losses, over and above the normal costs of doing
business. In agriculture, farmers incur moderate losses each year because of unex-
pected events such as suboptimal climatic conditions at diﬀerent times in the produc-
tion cycle or modest departures from expected output or input prices. Risk refers to the
more severe and unpredictable adverse events that occur beyond these smaller events.

This concept diﬀers from the common perception of “risk” by farmers and traders,
based on the year-to-year variability of production and prices. It should also be distin-
guished from constraints, which are predictable barriers or limitations to agricultural
production that farmers face every year. In Ghana, these constraints include poor
access to farm inputs, limited access to markets, limited credit, poor infrastructure,
and so on.


LOSS THRESHOLDS
As agricultural production is inherently variable, the immediate step for analysis is to
deﬁne “loss thresholds,” which distinguish adverse events from smaller, interannual
variations in output. This is achieved by ﬁrst estimating a time trend of “expected”
production in any given year, based on actual production, and treating the downside
diﬀerence between actual and expected production as a measure of loss. Loss thresh-
olds are then set for these downside deviations from trend, to distinguish between losses
due to adverse events and those that reﬂect the normal costs of doing business. Two

CHAPTER FIVE
ASSESSMENT OF STAKEHOLDER
VULNERABILITY
As highlighted earlier, Ghana’s agricultural systems vary within the ﬁve diﬀerent agro-
ecological zones and across the country’s 10 regions (see appendix A). As a result, the
nature and severity of agricultural risks can vary greatly from one area to the next.
The ability to deal with those risks among diﬀerent stakeholders also varies, based on
myriad factors, including prevailing production systems, household income levels, and
the relative diversity of income sources. Assessing levels of vulnerability among spe-
ciﬁc groups thus requires an understanding of their level of exposure as well as their
risk management capacity. This includes their capacity to cope with and recover from
resulting losses.

During the ﬁeld portion of the assessment, the team met with a range of stakehold-
ers13 and sought individual as well as focus group assessments of production, market,
and enabling environment risks. Discussions covered main risks, impact, relative rank-
ing in terms of severity, and mitigation measures undertaken as well as their relative
eﬀectiveness. Based on this input, this chapter identiﬁes common agricultural systems,
proﬁles some of the key stakeholders and their perceptions of agricultural risks, and
evaluates levels of vulnerability to risks (see appendix E for a broader discussion of
vulnerability among various livelihood groups in Ghana). It also presents some com-
mon strategies they employ to manage these risks.

Stakeholder groups included government and nongovernmental organization (NGO)
technicians, agriculturalists operating under rain-fed or a mix of irrigated and rain-fed
conditions, agro-pastoralists, commercial farmers, traders, and processors. As usual,
stakeholder groups were not homogeneous; for instance, some adjustments had to be
made to reﬂect the fact that a “government technicians” group often includes people

  The information covered in this chapter is largely based on interviews with 28 rain-fed farmers in two locations, 15
agro-pastoralists in three locations, 24 traders in Wa, 2 commercial farm enterprises in Tamale, and 3 processors in Wa
and Tamale as well as meetings with nearly 20 government technicians from MoFA, SADA, the Pong-Tamale livestock
station, and the Wa RDA.

RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT

RISK PRIORITIZATION
This assessment has highlighted key risks facing the agricultural sector in Ghana.
These risks are both myriad and complex. They manifest with varying levels of fre-
quency and severity, resulting in losses to crops and livestock and leading to income
volatility. To identify an eﬀective risk management strategy that maximizes available
resources, it is necessary to prioritize these risks. This requires an understanding of
which risks occur most frequently and which cause the biggest ﬁnancial losses.

Chapter 4 identiﬁes priority risks, using quantitative measures, for the crop and live-
stock sub-sectors. Owing to the paucity of data, some of the risks could not be quan-
tiﬁed. Chapter 5 further highlights key risks based on anecdotal evidence collected
directly from stakeholders. Based on the team’s combined quantitative and qualitative
assessment, table 6.1 prioritizes the most important risks for each crop, for livestock,
and for poultry. Overall, this prioritization identiﬁed 1) drought, 2) pests and diseases,
and 3) price volatility as the most important risks. Flooding from excessive rainfall and
bushﬁres associated with drought were also deemed important, but to a lesser extent.
Commodity proﬁles in appendix B oﬀer a more detailed sub-sector analysis of risks.

It is worth noting that a single type of risk can aﬀect one or several commodities (for
example, armyworms impacting maize, rice, and millet yields, or drought damaging
both crops and livestock pasture). However, as this report highlighted earlier, Ghana
at the aggregate level is not particularly vulnerable to agriculture risk while related
costs to the economy are relatively low. This is due to the diversity of agro-climatic
conditions and agricultural systems (that is, crops, seed varieties) across the country’s
10 regions. The probability that a single risk event could adversely impact a large num-
ber of commodities and regions at once is extremely low.

Despite this diversity, the analysis highlights that Ghana’s agricultural sector is
highly susceptible to downside risks associated with multiple shocks. This refers to,
for example, times when extensive pest attacks and bushﬁres cause further losses to
crops already damaged by prolonged drought conditions. Although less frequent, such

RAINFALL PATTERNS AND IMPLICATIONS
FOR CROP PRODUCTION

BACKGROUND
An analysis of rainfall data provided useful information on the level and distribu-
tion of rainfall by region and the impact of various rainfall characteristics on crop
yields.

Ghana has 99 weather stations located throughout the country, although some
regions have a higher density than others. Analysis was based on daily rainfall
data from 1981 to 2010. Figure C.1 shows the distribution of the weather stations
(orange diamonds).

As the weather stations do not have information on the region to which they belong,
distance from the centroid of each region (i) was calculated for each station (j) using
the Euclidean Distance formula:

                                                 2
                               Dist   xi    xj       yi   yj )

Where
Dist = Euclidean Distance
  xi = longitude from region’s i centroid
  xj = longitude from station j
  yi = latitude from region’s i centroid
  yj = latitude from station j

Each station was assigned to the region whose distance to the centroid was the small-
est. Reference marks for the centroids of each region are indicated by the navy dots
in ﬁgure C.1.

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT
OF AGRICULTURE IN GHANA

INTRODUCTION
Agriculture is vulnerable to climate change in Ghana, although the eﬀects are heteroge-
neous based on model assumptions and also across regions, socioeconomic groups, and
crops and livestock. Agriculture accounts for 25.6 percent of the GDP and 56 percent
of the labor force are involved in agriculture.21 The agricultural sector is composed
of crops (primarily rain-fed), livestock, and ﬁsheries. The single most important cash
crop is cocoa. Cassava and maize are the primary food crops. The agricultural sector
is largely composed of smallholders (more than 85 percent of holdings are 2 hectares
or less) (Masters, Baker, and Flood 2010). Cocoa in particular seems to be adversely
aﬀected by climate change and will have negative implications on development strate-
gies and the overall economy if left unaddressed.

In the Mapping the Impacts of Climate Change index under “Agricultural Productivity
Loss,” the Center for Global Development ranks Ghana 106th out of 233 countries
globally for “direct risks” due to “physical climate impacts” and 68 out of 233 for
“overall vulnerability” due to “physical impacts adjusted for coping ability” (Wheeler
2011).

The impacts of climate change on agriculture in Ghana vary widely based on what
assumptions are made, and which scenarios are played out. There are direct impacts,
such as changes in crop yields due to precipitation changes, and indirect impacts, such
as rising food prices due to production changes, and conﬂict over land tenure due
to shifting agro-climatic zones. The newest installment of the IPCC did not narrow
expected results from climate change, but rather widened the frame of variability.
This in combination with various approaches to impact studies makes it diﬃcult to

APPENDIX E
STAKEHOLDER VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION
The World Bank deﬁnes vulnerability as exposure to uninsured risk, leading to a
socially unacceptable level of well-being. An individual or household is vulnerable if
they lack the capacity or resources to deal with a realized risk. It is generally accepted
that in low-income countries, rural populations are both poor and vulnerable, and that
primary risks to these populations may include climate and market shocks (Sarris and
Karfakis 2006). Vulnerability is a useful lens through which to view shocks, as it allows
for determination of impacts on populations, and who will be most aﬀected. Vulner-
ability is discussed here particularly in the context of food security.

Ghana saw the number of people living in poverty halved between 1998/99 and
2005/06, but the depth of poverty has increased, and there are signiﬁcant regional
diﬀerences. According to the Ghana Living Standard Survey in 2005/06, 18 percent
of the population has an income less than the costs of the minimum food basket, mak-
ing them extremely vulnerable to food price shocks (Biderlack and Rivers 2009).

There is a signiﬁcant amount of information available in Ghana, including the Ghana
Living Standard Survey, the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, and the Demographic
Health Survey. Ghana also has a Food Security Monitoring System operated jointly
by the World Food Program, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and the Ministry
of Health, providing monthly updates on food security in three northern regions as
well as a frequent Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis. There-
fore, there are strong information systems related to vulnerability and food security in
Ghana.

AGRICULTURAL RISK FINANCING
AND INSURANCE FOR GHANA:
OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION

MICRO-LEVEL OPTIONS:
Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in Agricultural Insurance for Farmers
   1. Developing a viable PPP in agricultural insurance would require
      signiﬁcant public investments in data and would most likely need
      to be accompanied by substantial reform in credit utilization.
      Developing a PPP in agricultural insurance is a long-term objective, which
      requires long-term leadership and engagement as well as high levels of invest-
      ment from both sectors. In addition, to achieve sustainable and meaningful
      uptake, it relies on several key pillars. One key pillar is an eﬀective distribution
      channel to rural farmers, through which insurance can be sold. These distri-
      bution channels can take many forms, such as input suppliers or social wel-
      fare payment systems; however, the most commonly used, and which have the
      highest potential, are rural lending institutions. Despite this, there are several
      signiﬁcant challenges for this distribution channel in Ghana. Rural credit levels
      are low, with agriculture, forestry, and ﬁshing loans making only 5.9 percent of
      the total lending portfolio in Ghana24 and only 10 percent of rural households
      having access to credit.25 Rural ﬁnance has also experienced challenges in the
      past in terms of high rates of nonrepayment.26 Agricultural data make up
      another key pillar. Experience from other countries suggests that yield data are
      required to provide farmers with reliable protection, which can be enhanced
      by weather and satellite data. Currently, a limited amount of yield data is col-
      lected in Ghana by the Statistics, Research and Information department at
      the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and signiﬁcant increase in resources

   World Bank 2009 analysis of commercial bank lending by sector showed that the poorest performing sector was
agriculture, forestry, and ﬁshing with 23.1 percent of loans classiﬁed as nonperforming.

APPENDIX J
ASSESSING VULNERABILITY
IN NORTHERN REGIONS
The three northern regions account for just over 40 percent of the country’s land area
but less than 17 percent of its population (see appendix E). Located in the savannah
agro-ecological zones, in a typical year they produce all of the nation’s millet and
sorghum, 90 percent of its groundnuts, 68 percent of its rice, 30 percent of its yams,
and 17 percent of its maize. They also account for approximately 75–80 percent of
the national cattle herd.

According to the latest 10-year average data, the Northern Region receives about
1,200 mm of yearly precipitation. The Upper East and Upper West regions receive
less, approximately 940 mm. As shown below, however, rainfall distribution over the
uni-modal growing season is at least as important as cumulative levels.

Northern regions have consistently recorded higher incidences of poverty, food inse-
curity, and malnutrition. They are more rural, with household sizes larger than the
national average. Compared with a national income per capita ﬁgure of GH¢397
in 2008,28 ﬁgures were GH¢106 in the Upper West, GH¢124 in the Upper East, and
GH¢296 in the Northern regions.

Among the 8,400 households surveyed in 38 districts within the three northern regions
for the 2012 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment, almost half
(46 percent) derived their income from crop cultivation, whereas nearly one-third
(29 percent), as agro-pastoralists, relied on a combination of income from livestock
(49 percent) and crops. Surveyed households described their main cropping activities
as summarized in table J.1.

Most households manage diversiﬁed farms that extend over 11 acres of land that
belong, for the most part, to household members. The vast majority of remaining
households use land that is provided by extended family members. Yields for main

IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT IN GHANA
Ghana is drained by three main river systems: the Volta, Southwestern, and Coastal
river systems (see ﬁgure K.1):
     » The Volta river system consists of the Oti and Daka rivers, the White and Black
        Volta rivers, and the Pru, Sene, and Afram rivers—the basin covers 70 percent
        of the country’s area.
     » The southwestern river system comprises the Bia, Tano, Ankobra, and Pra riv-
        ers and covers 22 percent of the country’s area.
     » The coastal river system comprises the Ochi-Nakwa, Ochi Amissah, Ayensu,
        Densu, and Tordzie rivers, covering 8 percent of the country’s area.32
