                                      The Sustainability Framework articulates IFC’s strategic commitment to sustainable
                                      development and is an integral part of its approach to risk management. Originally
                                      adopted in 2006, the Sustainability Framework has recently been updated to incorporate
                                      valuable lessons from IFC’s implementation experience and feedback from our

                                        SUPPLY CHAINS
                                        The updated framework takes into account the complexities of supply chain management
                                        and requires clients to screen and monitor their supply chain risks.
