SUMMARY
         Female farm managersiin Ethiopia produce 23% less (in terms of gross value of output) per hectare than male managers on average.

         Women farmers have a smaller pool of household labour available, spend less time on agricultural activities and are less likely to cultivate a rented plot
         than men, all of which contribute to the gender gap. Furthermore, women see lower returns to their time spent on agricultural activities, extension services
         received and use of fertiliser and oxen.

         Policy interventions aimed at bridging the gender gap should promote women’s use of labour-saving technologies on their farms, provide better tailored
         advice on input use and take into account household responsibilities.

Policy Priorities
Future agricultural policy interventions should consider the following gender-related issues in order to reduce poverty and achieve inclusive agricultural growth in Ethiopia:

              Promote labour-saving technologies for women: Tools, equipment and machinery that reduce the amount of farm labour required could benefit female farmers.
              Policies that expand the labour pool available to women farmers should also be pursued.

              Provide relevant information to female farmers: Extension agents and other sources of agricultural advice should better customise their information to the needs
              of female farmers. In particular, women could benefit from information on the appropriate use of key agricultural inputs such as fertiliser.

              Ease the time burden of household responsibilities: Providing services to reduce the time that female farmers need to perform household duties could enable
              them to devote more time to productive farm activities.

ii
   This estimate does not account for gender differences in land size. In Ethiopia, as the size of the farm increases, its productivity decreases, a trend observed across many developing contexts (see the Country Profiles introduction for more
details). Because women farm smaller plots than men, this difference narrows the gender gap in yields.
iii
      This difference is no longer statistically significant, potentially due to the small sample size of female farm managers at the decile level (which is also the case for Niger and Tanzania).

SUMMARY
            On average, plots managed by womeni produce 25% less (in terms of gross value of output) per hectare than plots managed by men.

            Women use lower levels of agricultural inputs – including improved seeds, inorganic fertiliser and extension services – on their plots compared with men.
            This disparity accounts for more than 80% of Malawi’s gender gap in agricultural productivity. Differences in the quality of these inputs and the returns they
            yield drive the remainder of the gap.

            Policy interventions aimed at alleviating the gender gap should focus on ensuring equal access to and use of agricultural inputs, and should take into
            consideration women’s child-care responsibilities.

Accounting for malawi’s Gender Gap
On average, plots managed by women produce 25% less per hectare than plots                       fertiliser as women, suggesting that women may use inferior quality fertiliser,
managed by men. This gap ranges from 22% among less productive farmers (at the                   apply this input incorrectly or use it at the wrong time.

Several factors contribute to this difference:                                                •	 Efficiency of farm labour: Using household adult male labour generates greater

Policy Priorities
Future agricultural policy interventions should consider the following gender-related issues in order to reduce poverty and achieve inclusive agricultural growth in Malawi:

        Ensure that female farmers access and use the same amount of key productive inputs as male farmers: Ensuring that Malawi’s female farmers apply similar
        quantities of agricultural inputs including inorganic fertiliser, pesticides and herbicides, and are growing improved and export crop varieties, could reduce the
        average gender gap by more than 50%.

        Take into consideration women’s child-care and other household responsibilities: Policies that enable women to devote a greater proportion of their time to
        managing their farms could further boost their agricultural productivity.

        Encourage productive female farmers to engage in export agriculture: Supporting highly productive female farmers to cultivate export crops could narrow the
        gender gap.

SUMMARY
            In Niger, plots managed by womeni produce 19% less (in terms of gross value of output) per hectare than plots managed by men, on average.

            Men’s greater use of, and returns to, adult male labour explain the largest portion of Niger’s gender yield gap. Men also use greater quantities of fertiliser
            and are more likely to own land, further widening the gap. Differences in returns to organic fertiliser, land and the proportion of children in the household
            also contribute to the productivity difference, underscoring the importance of structural inequalities in shaping Niger’s gender gap.

            Policy interventions aimed at redressing the gender gap should focus on increasing women’s use of hired farm labour, enhancing their use of fertiliser and
            improving their access to and control over land.

Policy Priorities
Future agricultural policy interventions should consider the following gender-related issues to reduce poverty and foster inclusive agricultural growth in Niger:

              Facilitate women’s access to and use of hired farm labour: Policy-makers in Niger should consider policies to address female farmers’ labour shortage, as well as
              options that enable women to devote a larger portion of their time to managing their plots.

              Increase women’s efficient use of fertiliser: Women apply less fertiliser to their plots than men, and they apply this input less effectively. Policies that increase
              women’s use of fertiliser and improve its application could therefore help to bridge this difference.

              Support women’s access to and control over land: Women need better access to land, as well as the confidence and security that their land investments will
              benefit themselves and their families. For these reasons, policies aimed at strengthening women’s land rights should be considered.

SUMMARY
            Nigeria’s size and broad socio-economic diversity highlight the need for a regional analysis of gender productivity differences.

            In northern Nigeria, plots managed by womeni seem to be just as productive as plots managed by men when simple averages are compared. However,
            between men and women there are key gender differences in quantities across many important factors of production, such as land size, fertiliser use,
            labour and household characteristics. After accounting for such differences, plots managed by women produce 27% less (in terms of gross value of output)
            per hectare than plots managed by men. In addition to differing quantities of productive factors, differences in returns to such factors are also an important
            component of the gender gap, suggesting that simply providing women with similar quantities of productive inputs to men’s will not fully close the gap.

            In southern Nigeria, when simple averages are compared, plots managed by women appear to produce substantially less (in terms of gross value of output)
            per hectare than plots managed by men. However, after accounting for differences in quantities of key productive factors, this gender gap is no longer
            statistically significant. Unlike in the north, women in the south have similar average returns to productive factors as men. The findings suggest that if
            women in the south had similar quantities of productive factors to men’s, they could produce just as much and the gender gap might disappear.

            Future policies aimed at reducing the gender gap in Nigeria should focus on increasing women’s use of farm labour, labour-saving technologies and
            chemical inputs, while expanding female participation in commercial agriculture and tailoring policies to regional differences in agricultural practices and
            institutional factors.

Policy Priorities
Future agricultural policy interventions should focus on the following gender-related issues in order to reduce poverty and achieve inclusive agricultural growth in Nigeria:

      Help women overcome their labour disadvantages: Facilitating women’s use of farm labour and labour-saving approaches could narrow the male/female farming
      gap throughout the country.

      Improve women’s use of fertiliser and herbicides: Ensuring equal application of key chemical inputs could reduce the gender gap in both the south (herbicides)
      and the north (fertiliser). Moreover, the increased use of herbicides in the south could yield complementary benefits, as it may reduce the labour that women need
      for weeding.

      Expand female participation in commercial agriculture: Women in the north benefit more than men, in terms of returns, from cultivating cash crops and using
      purchased seeds. Policies aimed at encouraging and supporting female participation in high-value agriculture could therefore boost women’s agricultural
      production and narrow the productivity gap.

      Tailor policies to regional differences: In the south, policies should focus on ensuring that women access and use similar quantities of inputs, including labour
      and herbicides, to men. Meanwhile, policies targeting female farmers in the north should also take into account the structural disadvantages that prevent women
      and their households from fully benefiting from agricultural production.

SUMMARY
         In Tanzania, plots managed by womeni are on average just as productive as plots managed by men. Yet after accounting for key components such as
         manager, farm and household characteristics, a clear gender gap emerges: Plots managed solely by women produce on average 14% less (in terms of gross
         value of output) per acre than plots managed solely by men or jointly by other family members.

         An inadequate supply of farm labour, particularly adult male labour, and lower returns from labour inputs constrain the productivity of Tanzania’s female
         plot managers above all other factors. In addition, lower returns to the use of pesticides and organic fertiliser further dampen female productivity and widen
         Tanzania’s gender yield gap.

         Policies that expand women’s supply of hired labour and others that enable them to devote a greater proportion of their time to farm activities should be considered
         to bridge the productivity divide. These policies could be accompanied by better information on complementary input use and tailored regional interventions.

Accounting for tanzania’s Gender Gap
Across Tanzania, plots managed by women are on the whole just as productive as                                                   yields. One day of labour from a male family member or a hired labourer also

Policy Priorities
Future agricultural policy interventions should consider the following gender-related issues to reduce poverty and foster inclusive agricultural growth in Tanzania:

              Expand women’s access to and use of hired labour and labour-saving tools: Female farmers in Tanzania must overcome their critical shortage of farm labour
              before their productive potential can be realised. Policies that enable women to hire labour, reduce the amount of labour they require, or allow them to devote a
              greater share of their own time to productive farm work should be explored to bridge the agricultural productivity divide.

              Improve women’s use of complementary inputs: Differences in returns to productive inputs, including fertiliser and pesticides, explain most of Tanzania’s gender
              gap. While providing women with complementary inputs will not fully close the gap in yields, equipping them with information on their proper use and application
              should be a consideration for policy-makers.

              Develop targeted regional policies: The central zone of Tanzania has the lowest farm yields and, along with the eastern zone, the largest gender productivity gaps,
              heightening the need for targeted agricultural interventions that address the constraints particular to those areas.



ii
      When comparing plots solely managed by females and those solely managed by males using the same set of controls, the gender productivity gap stands at 16%.
iii
      This gap is statistically insignificant, perhaps due to the small sample size of farmers for each decile.

SUMMARY
             Plots managed by womeni produce 13% less (in terms of gross value of output) per acre on average than plots managed by men or jointly by other family
             members in Uganda.

             Relative to men, women’s lower levels of schooling, access to extension services and application of non-labour inputs on their plots, including pesticides
             and organic fertiliser, widen the gender gap.

             Policies aimed at targeting the provision of technical information to women, securing equal access to and use of non-labour inputs, and supporting
             women’s education and training will help to alleviate gender inequality in the sector and enhance productivity.



INTRODUCTION
Most of Uganda’s 36 million inhabitants1 reside in rural areas and depend on the                                                   that rely on women’s and men’s farm outputs for sustenance. Indeed, women play a

Measuring the Gender Gap in Agriculture
This profile is based on research by Ali et al., who examine the role of gender in                                                 2009/10 and 2010/11, implemented by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics with

the plot is defined as female-managed. If all or part of the output is controlled by male managers, the plot is considered to be male- or jointly managed.

     The plot sample is drawn from households in which there is variation in the gender of the plot manager either between or within years, and in which there is at least one plot observation within each year.

Policy Priorities
Future agricultural policy interventions in Uganda should consider the following policy priorities in order to decrease poverty further and achieve inclusive agricultural growth:

       Re-examine the extension services model: The current extension services model in Uganda could be strengthened to better address women’s information needs
       and skills. Experimenting with different delivery approaches should be encouraged. A farmer field school model, for instance, has already shown some promise in
       boosting women’s productivity.4 Implementing a targeted capacity-building approach that is better attuned to female farmers’ lower education levels may also help.

       Invest in adult education for women: While Uganda has already achieved gender parity in national primary and secondary school enrolment, the effects of
       previous gender gaps in schooling persist. Investments in literacy and adult learning for female farmers may yield tangible benefits for their productivity.

       Expand women’s use of improved inputs: Women’s lower levels of use of pesticide and organic fertiliser limit their productivity relative to men’s. Policy-makers
       should consider improving all farmers’ access to these inputs, with a focus on helping women overcome the specific barriers that currently limit their use of inputs.

  In Niger, men receive lower returns than women from the use of female labour on their plots. These female labourers may be the spouses of the plot managers. Because these women likely lack tenure security over their husbands’ plots, they

       A wide range of indicators can provide information on soil quality, but the level of soil fertility (the amount and composition of nutrients available in the soil) is perhaps the most critical for agricultural productivity.

Policy Lessons
In addition to identifying the main drivers of the agricultural productivity gap between men and women, the country profiles reveal three overarching lessons that should guide
policy action on narrowing this gap.

      First, closing Africa’s gender gap is about more than just ensuring that women farmers have equal access to key productive resources. While differences in
      access to land, fertiliser and other inputs remain important, differences in how a female farmer benefits from these resources (i.e. her returns to those
      inputs) often have a larger effect. This finding has important implications for policy-makers who seek growth dividends from greater equality.

      Second, farmers with different levels of productivity face distinct challenges of their own, and policy-makers should take this into account. The same policy
      response may not necessarily benefit both female subsistence farmers and highly productive female farmers, for instance.

      Third, regional differences matter. Even within the same country, the factors accounting for the gender gap may vary by region. In countries such as Nigeria
      or Tanzania, for example, policy-makers need to tailor their policy responses to the state or regional level.

The final section of this report presents specific policy recommendations to address the key drivers of the gender gap.

    While a wide range of indicators can provide information on soil quality, the level of soil fertility – i.e. the amount and composition of nutrients available in the soil – is perhaps the most critical for agricultural productivity.

     LSMS-ISA surveys in some countries include self-reported measures of soil quality.
