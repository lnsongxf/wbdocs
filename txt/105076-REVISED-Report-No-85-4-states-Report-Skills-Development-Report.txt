At a time when the world’s leading economies are rapidly greying, India is set to have the largest
and youngest workforce the world has ever seen. Indeed, by 2020, when the global shortage of
manpower soars to 57 million, India is expected to be the world’s leading provider of human
resources, with a surplus of 46 million working-age people. However, this window of opportunity
will not just be rare, it will also be short-lived, since it is predicted to only last until 2040. It is in this
context that Prime Minister Modi has made it a national priority to make India the skill capital of the
world.

Today, about 12 million young people enter India’s workforce every year and look for jobs in the
rapidly changing workplace. To meet their rising aspirations, as well as the needs of the Make in
India initiative, they need to be equipped with the skills required by today’s business and industries,
including by the diverse industries that make up the small scale sector and are one of the largest
employers in India today. Women too, need to be more equitably represented in the workforce of the
country. Towards this end, the National Skill Development Mission, launched in July 2015, aims to
skill 400 million young people by 2022, emphasizing scale, speed, and adherence to standards.

The task is not easy. For any country as large as India, the resources required for developing the
skills of such vast numbers of young people – the human, physical and financial resources - are
enormous. Moreover, these resources are distributed across multiple players. Today, for instance,
over 20 government ministries spend more than Rs.7,000 crore on implementing over 70 skill
development programs, in addition to over 200 private training providers, with many private sector
firms too entering the arena by spending their corporate social responsibility funds on education and
skills development.

In this diverse scenario, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has sought to chart
a strategic way forward. At their request, therefore, the World Bank, together with the Boston
Consulting Group, has conducted this study of four states - two states which see a large outmigration
of labor - Bihar and Rajasthan - and two which receive a large number of migrants - Gujarat and
Maharashtra.

A key lesson learnt is that skilling is a highly localized issue and needs to be adapted to specific
target groups. Extrapolating from this, and by bringing in global experience from Australia,
Germany, Japan and South Korea, the report endeavors to identify the institutional and systemic
structures that will be needed to improve the effectiveness of skills training across India’s states. The
report also seeks to pinpoint innovative best practices and outline ways to scale them up throughout
the country. We hope the reader will find the report useful as India defines its way forward on this
critical plank of its development agenda.

The challenge of skilling a large populace has been widely recognized in India over the last few
years. To address this, multiple initiatives have been launched at central and state levels to not just
fulfill the skilling requirement of the country (about 12 million people enter the workforce every
year) but also to make India the skill capital of the world – a recent example being the launch of the
"Skill India" Mission. However, despite these efforts, the current annual training capacity (of
approximately 5 million per year) is not even half the required rate. Further, although a huge amount
of money is being spent on skill development, the system is not able to reap the benefits of economies
of scale while providing quality training and optimizing existing resources.


Therefore, it has become imperative to make skill development central to the growth agenda and
make rapid strides in providing quality training at scale. This would be most effectively achieved by
optimizing existing resources and partnerships to skill the Indian populace while creating jobs
through initiatives such as Make in India, Digital India, and so on. The recently launched National
Skill Development Mission (NSDM) aims to provide the necessary policy support, and its "mission
mode" approach, through five (of seven) sub-missions – building institutional training capacity,
infrastructure development, convergence of all stakeholders, knowledge and funds, building capacity
and quantity of trainers, and leveraging existing public infrastructure as skill centers - is directly
linked to achieving this purpose.


To attain high quality skill development in India, there is a need to clearly identify a few priority
areas, and to detail out specific interventions to be undertaken within each area. With this objective,
the World Bank sought, as part of its technical assistance to the Ministry of Skill Development and
Entrepreneurship (GOI), to identify key implementation challenges at the state-level and to make
high-level recommendations to improve the quality of training at the grassroots.


A mix of demand-driven and supply-driven states were identified mutually by the Ministry and the
World Bank, viz. Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Bihar. The findings from these states can be
extrapolated, lessons can be learnt and adapted to other states as well.


In India, as in any large country, the resources required for skill development (for example,
infrastructure, content, trainers, finance and knowledge) are immense and usually distributed across
multiple stakeholders (central ministries, state departments, district bodies, corporates, public sector
undertakings and training providers, to name a few). This report endeavours to identify institutional
and systemtic structures for the implementation of skilling activities in states, and to recommend
potential additions and changes in order to effectively use resources (both human, physical and
financial) for the purposes of skill development.
                                                                                                      1
The report covers skill development institutional structures at the state level (in most cases, the State
Skill Development Missions), economic zones and future high-growth industries in those zones,
corporate engagement in skill development, and finally, innovation in skilling models by states and
the corporate sector. These innovative models bring together key stakeholders in an optimum manner
and/or leverage resources effectively. For instance, instead of building new infrastructure for skill
training centers (which would require large amount of money, clearances and time), using existing
infrastructure of colleges with unutilized seats.


In addition, the report also describes some best practices observed globally, especially from
Australia, Germany, Japan and South Korea. These models cover three areas of resource optimization
pertaining to increasing apprenticeships and industry participation, leveraging technology, and
providing training at the grassroots. The key lesson learned is that skilling is a highly localized issue,
and models need to be adapted to target groups rather than be force-fitted using a one-size-fits-all
kind of approach. For example, in the case of technology enabled learning, Japan’s colleges of
technology, Kosen, and South Korea’s technical schools provide highly customized trainings
depending on economic structures and demand-supply gaps, leading to high seat utilization.


Finally, it must be pointed out that high-level recommendations have been provided to enhance the
skill development landscape, particularly at the state level, from an institutional and systemic point
of view. The rationale for this stems from the fact that skilling is a highly localized/regional issue,
and each state must come up with its own institutional structures and implementation systems which
suit its needs. The recommendations provided in this report will provide directional guidance to state
leadership and to corporates on investing in the critical enablers required to improve the effectiveness
of skill training in states, and on identifying and scaling innovative best practices throughout the
country.

                  1. SKILL DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA – SETTING THE CONTEXT

Economic Development and the Need for Skills Training

The Indian economy is the world's seventh-largest by nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and
third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP) 1 - taking into account the relative cost of local goods,
services and inflation rates of the country. Between 2005 and 2010, India’s share of global GDP
increased from 1.8 percent to 2.7 percent, and 53 million people were lifted out of poverty. India’s
per capita income is USD 1,410 (2011). Progress on human development has been remarkable; life
expectancy more than doubled from 31 years in 1947 to 65 years in 2012 and adult literacy more
than quadrupled, from 18 percent in 1951 to 74 percent in 2011. India has already achieved the first
Millennium Development Goal (MDG 1) by halving the proportion of people living on less than
USD 1.25 a day: rural poverty has decreased by 14 percentage points. However, despite positive
developments, challenges persist. About 50 percent of India’s population lives in low-income and
special category states 2 where poverty rates are close to 40 percent. Over 200 million of India’s poor
people (over 60 percent) reside in low-income states.


India has been experiencing average annual economic growth of approximately 5 percent in the last
3-4 years. Manufacturing has been the hardest hit in terms of growth rates 3 which has impacted job
creation and employment. During this time, 3 percent 4 new jobs were being created in the economy
and the average unemployment rate was at 8 percent. 5 The scenario has changed since last year and
the economy is growing at a rate of 7 percent 6 annually. It is estimated that about 12 million 7 people
enter the workforce every year who need jobs as well as require adequate skills for those jobs. Given

the thrust on manufacturing in India, particularly with initiatives like Make in India, 3 million new
jobs are expected to be created in 2015 alone. 8


Beyond the national need of a skilled India, there are also global opportunities for skilled labour.
The country is expected to have half of its population under 28 years by 2030. While the ageing
economy phenomenon will globally create a shortage of skilled manpower of 57 million by 2020,
India will have a surplus of 46 million working people. As a result, India has a huge demographic
dividend. Owing to comparative cost advantage, due to its low dependency ratio, India can cater to
a large part of this 57 million requirement. 9 The country’s population pyramid is expected to bulge
across the 15–59 age groups over the next decade. However, this demographic advantage is predicted
to last only until 2040. 10 India, therefore, has a narrow time frame to harness its demographic
dividend and to overcome its skill shortages.


Many initiatives are underway to skill the Indian populace. Over INR 6000 Crore is spent on
skill development across 20 Ministries with over 70 programs and schemes (Annex 1 contains a list
of all skill development programs and schemes being implemented by major Ministries in India) and
the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) was created in 2014 to coordinate
all skill development related activities. At the state level, State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs)
are expected to act as nodal bodies to coordinate with central ministries and state line departments,
industry and private training organizations. Around 25 states and 4 union territories have set up
SSDMs and some have begun putting together a skills strategy to equip millions of persons over the
next few years. 11


Further, multiple corporates have begun spending their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
funds on development issues like education and skill development. Over $500 Million was invested
in CSR by top corporates in India (see figure below) – 44 of 100 companies analyzed invest in some
form of skill development. 12

However, the current annual training capacity in India is less than half the required rate and
stands at about 5 million persons being trained annually. Despite over 12,000 Industrial Training
Institutes (ITIs) run by the Government and by the private sector, and other privately run vocational
training centers, access continues to be a challenge in rural areas and in difficult to reach geographic
areas particularly in the North Eastern States. As a result, capacity utilization of training
infrastructure is impacted and over 50 percent of training seats go unutilized annually. In addition,
industry linkages are limited, in terms of contribution to content design or training delivery and even
final placements.


National Skill Development Mission: Policy Priorities Going Forward
In order to consolidate and rapidly scale skill development efforts in India, while focusing on quality
and outcomes, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) launched the
National Skill Development Mission (NSDM) on July 15, 2015. According to the National Policy
on Skills and Entrepreneurship, 2015, skilling capacity needs to Scale-up with Speed and Standards
while optimizing on existing resources and collaborating with all stakeholders in order to provide
skilling to over 400 million people; and the NSDM is expected to provide the overall institutional
framework to enable this.



                                                                                                      5
  The Mission’s Framework for Implementation is expected to provide strategic direction to state
  governments to establish a clear line of action to enable India to achieve its skilling targets. The
  framework outlines the overall vision and objectives of the Mission and its strategy (by focusing on
  the launch of its core sub-missions), specifies its institutional structure (at the national, state and
  district levels), and articulates its financial model.


  The Mission Statement is:
  To rapidly scale up skill development efforts in India, by creating an end-to-end, outcome-focused
  implementation framework, which aligns demands of the employers for a well-trained skilled
  workforce with aspirations of Indian citizens for sustainable livelihoods.


  In order to achieve this vision, the Government has identified seven sub missions in priority areas
  into which all future programs/projects of skill development in India will be plugged. These have
  been laid out in Box 1 below.

Box 1: Sub-Missions relevant for Resource Optimization for Skill Development

Sub-Mission 1: Institutional Training
Under this sub-mission the key focus is to drive quantity, quality and reach of training provision and outcomes,
and to change people’s perceptions about vocational training and make skill development aspirational with
opportunities for long-term career progression. It seeks to achieve this by setting up a number of branded
skilling centers together with the private sector, in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. Toward this end,
the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) has been catalyzing the private sector since 2009 – it
has over 200 private training providers who are cumulatively expected to provide skills training to about 150
million people by 2022.
Sub-Mission 2: Infrastructure
This sub-mission targets building capacity and ensuring high quality skill development in infrastructure,
including construction, to increase the productivity of workers in this sector through an emphasis on on-site
training.
Sub-Mission 3: Convergence
This sub-mission seeks to ensure the convergence and co-ordination of skill development efforts by multiple
stakeholders such as central and state ministries/departments, private training providers, assessment agencies,
industry bodies, and workers. Key enablers to achieve this include opening Kaushal Vardhan Kendras (KVKs)
to increase outreach and provide training that is linked to local needs.
Sub-Mission 4: Trainers
This sub-mission aims to improve the overall quality of instruction at training institutions across the country
and ensure adequate availability of trainers in the skills space.
Sub-Mission 5: Overseas Employment



                                                                                                        6
This sub- mission seeks to ensure that youth in India are trained as per the highest global standards in order
to enable them to access employment opportunities abroad and to ensure the international mobility of skilled
workers in the country.
Sub-Mission 6: Sustainable Livelihoods
Under this sub-mission, trainees will be empowered by providing them a pathway to access long-term
sustainable livelihoods, helping them maximize the potential of their skill training. Support activities will
include providing guidance counselling, mentorship and so on.
Sub-Mission 7: Leveraging Public Infrastructure
The objective of this sub-mission is to optimize the usage of existing public infrastructure to scale up skill
development efforts across India. A detailed mapping of existing infrastructure is required in order to set up
an implementation framework for this.


  With the new National Skill Development Mission taking shape, the World Bank together with the
  Boston Consulting Group has prepared this report to assess the current implementation of skill
  development schemes/programs at the state level, and to design a preliminary hypothesis on effective
  ways to improve implementation by strengthening institutions, engaging corporates and scaling
  innovation.




                                                                                                      7
    2. FRAMEWORK FOR STATE LEVEL ASSESSMENT OF SKILL DEVELOPMENT

An assessment framework was developed to give structure to the analysis and recommendations,
comprising key aspects impacting implementation at the state level. This included:


(i) Institutions: what governance structures would improve the efficiency                of the state‘s
implementation of skilling programs?
Institutions, both at the state level like the Department of Employment and Training (DET) as well
those at the local/regional levels like the district/municipal offices, play an important role in setting
policy for the state, identifying skilling needs, bringing together different stakeholders, as well
managing human and financial resources for on- ground implementation.


Chapter 3 and 4 seek to identify the broad contours, in terms of roles and responsibilities, of such
state level governance structures – in most cases, this would be the State Skill Development Missions
(SSDMs). These SSDMs should, in principle, be aligned in their vision/mission with the National
Skill Development Mission at the Center, with specific adaptations to their own state context when
designing implementation mechanisms.


(ii) Economic Zones: how can demand (or industry needs) be better mapped to align with supply (or
youth to be skilled) at the regional/local levels?
Different kinds of economic zones exist within each state which cater to different types of industries,
and therefore different types of skills from prospective employees/workers are required. This
alignment of demand and supply is critical to maximizing efficiencies in the skills landscape – be it
in the form of resources invested in training for high-demand job roles or in the form of increased
placements.


Chapter 3 and 4 lay out the different types of economic zones across India together with their
mapping in some representative states. A broad framework has been developed to identify high
growth industries and existing training centers which can be used by State Governments to bridge
the current demand-supply gap by involving different stakeholders.


(iii) Industry/Private Sector Engagement: what are the different ways in which corporate
engagement can be enhanced and convergence promoted at the state level?
Of the $500 million being invested in CSR in India today, only a small proportion is channeled to
skill development. In addition, there are over 200 private training providers who are currently
providing skills training in India. However, a large proportion of these are running financially


                                                                                                       1
unviable models, at least in the short run, which reduces private sector incentive to provide such
training going forward.


Subsequent chapters will look at different forms of engagements with the private sector, lay out some
case studies from existing good practices in India, identify best practices from other countries, and
suggest ways in which such engagement can be scaled in India.


(iv) Innovation: what is needed to scale some of the existing resource optimized models of skilling?
Given the National Mission’s impetus on skilling at scale, with speed, and adhering to standards,
there is a need to identify scalable models which are currently operating in India and abroad, and
identifying appropriate resources and implementation models to scale these in order to meet the 400
million target.


Chapter 3 and 4 identify some innovative models – in India and in other countries – which optimize
different kinds of resources, such as infrastructure, trainers or funds. There is also an indicative
costing and an implementation roadmap on how states should think about identifying and scaling
such models.




                                                                                                   2
                    3. CURRENT STATUS OF STATE IMPLEMENTATION

While the policy and coordination of skill development schemes and programs is being managed by
the MSDE at the national level, implementation at the regional/local levels are under state purview.
No recommendation to improve the skills landscape would be complete without an understanding of
how skill development schemes and programs will be communicated, comprehended and
implemented at the State level.


It is essential to assess the current status of implementation in states prior to developing
recommendations in order to make implementation most robust while keeping them sufficiently high
level so states can adapt the recommendations to their own context. Four States were selected by the
MSDE and the World Bank collaboratively – Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Bihar –
which are a combination of demand and supply driven states.


The team used a three pronged approach to develop an understanding of state level implementation
of skill development:


(a) Desk and Secondary Research
Multiple sources were used including national Government websites (like those of MSDE, DGET
and NSDC), Industrial Development Corporation websites (like RIICO, GIDC, MIDC, BIADA) 13,
state government websites for DET and SSDMs, as well as websites of corporates, foundations and
NGOs, and statistics portals like IndiaStat. The team also engaged in a press/news search.


(b) Interviews with Stakeholders and Experts
Discussions were held with 100 stakeholders and experts including staff at MSDE, state government
representatives (e.g. Principal Secretaries of Labour, heads of SSDMs), NSDC representatives,
Industry Association representatives, international and national skills experts, private training
providers (e.g. Centum Learning, ILandFS, Teamlease), corporate houses (e.g. Tatas, ICICI) and
NGOs (e.g. Pratham). The team also met with multiple heads and staff of government and private
vocational training institutes.

(c) Data Analysis
Data was analyzed to understand 4 key issues: (i) NSDC empanelled partners and the different
operating models being used by them; (ii) corporate engagement models for skilling (for example,
funding dedicated to skilling through CSR engagements); (iii) innovative, scalable models in India
with costs incurred; and (iv) identifying key economic zones in states and high growth industries.

Skill Development in Rajasthan

State Context:
Rajasthan, India's largest state by area, has a population of 73 million. Small scale industry forms
the backbone of industrial activity and employment generation in Rajasthan. Moreover, the
"Resurgent Rajasthan" initiative has brought significant investments into the state, and going
forward, it is expected to drive activity and employment in the secondary and tertiary sectors.


(i) Institutions
Rajasthan was the first state in the country to set up a state level body to coordinate skill development
programs. The Rajasthan Mission on Livelihoods (RMoL) was set up in 2004, although a stand-
alone "skilling" mandate was only introduced in 2010 when it was incorporated as a Section 25
company with the Chief Secretary as Chairman and renamed the Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods
Development Corporation (RSLDC). In 2014, there was a need felt to separate the implementation
function from the policy one, and RMoL was reconstituted as a "policy making" body – with the
Chief Minister as Head and the Secretary of the Ministry of Labour as the Deputy Head. RSLDC
was reconstituted as the "executing body" with the Chief Secretary as the Head of the organization.


RSLDC's core mandate is to coordinate skilling programs and build capacity at the state level. Its
functions include:
•   Building and disseminating knowledge including identifying best practices and innovations;
•   Policy reform and advocacy wherein it provides inputs to RMoL and communicates policy down
    the chain;
•   Capacity building of organizations on administrative as well as thematic issues of skill
    development, human resource management etc.;
•   Designing livelihood promotion strategies including analytics and data management;
•   Implementing pilot programmes to test if strategies developed work on the ground and can be
    scaled; and
•   Certification of trainees and providing a final quality check of all training programs




                                                                                                       2
While RMoL consists of a Steering Committee of about 30 Ministers, representatives of industry
associations, and other experts, the organization structure of RSLDC 14 is different (see figure 3.1
below) – with a large number of teams overseeing implementation at the local level. There are over
400 staff managing the Rajasthan skilling agenda (of which more than 300 work at the district level)
and operate on a budget of approximately INR 100 Crores annually (outlay since 2012). 15


      Figure 3:1: Organization Structure of the Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods Development
                                      Corporation (RSLDC)




RSLDC delegates the actual implementation of skilling programs to the respective Ministries
responsible for their schemes/programs. For example, to implement the Ministry of Rural
Development's Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana 16 (DDU-GKY), RSLDC signs
Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with Project Implementation Agencies (PIAs) which manage
implementation at the block level. Similarly, for Ministry of Labour schemes (DGET's Skill
Development Initiative, SDI), a Rajasthan Skill Development Initiative Society (RSDIS) has been
constituted for management, implementation and for monitoring. All skill training
institutions/agencies other than Industrial Training Institutes (both government and private) come

under the purview of RSDIS. ITIs are implemented by partner organizations but overseen/monitored
by the state PMU through RSLDC's district teams.


Other schemes and programs being implemented in Rajasthan are listed in Table 3.1 below. A key
feature of the state's skilling structure is its flagship program, Employment Linked Skill Training
Program (ELSTP), 2012, through which all other departments are routing their skill projects. This
helps reduce implementation challenges and minimise confusion resulting from multiple programs
running at the local level.

                                                                                                                                   4
RSLDC's training partner (TP) selection and monitoring model involves an Evaluation Committee
which reviews each proposal based on specific criteria (for example, minimum 10 centers across 2
states, at least 750 workers previously trained and over 500 placed, guarantee at least 70 percent
placement etc.), and centers are inspected for infrastructure and readiness prior to signing the MoU.
Monitoring and evaluation (MandE) is carried out by district teams (one visit to each center every 2
weeks) to maintain accountability. The entire process, from "expressions of interest" to final payment
post training completion, takes about 6-7 months – relatively less when compared with states like
Bihar which takes over a year to process contracts.


Monitoring of training centers and tracking of employment is managed by an Integrated Skill
Management System (ISMS) and a biometric attendance system. The ISMS tracks youth who have
registered online, trades taught at the Skill Development Centers (SDCs), and placement rates for
each SDC. It is being expanded to cover all skill training centers in the state – both government and
private. Figure 3.2 gives an overview of the key features and processes of the ISMS.


             Figure 3:2: Rajasthan's Integrated Skill Management System (ISMS)




Therefore, from an institutional point of view, the RSLDC (which substitutes the SSDM) acts as a
good coordination platform for skill development activities in the state of Rajasthan. With tools like
the flagship ELSTP program and the ISMS tracking and management system, the state seems to be
creating a solid foundation for skill development.


Two areas where the Rajasthan Government can invest in order to improve performance of its
skilling centers (government ITIs, for example, have about 1 in 2 seats unutilized) are:

                                                                                                    5
(a) Monitoring and evaluation at the grassroots with a strong feedback loop
While district teams exist to manage implementation, a dedicated MandE team conducting regular
checks at the field level, for both government and private skilling centers, will ensure greater
accountability in the vocational system. In addition, on-ground challenges can be observed, discussed
and dealt with in a decentralized and more efficient manner.


(b) Data collection on private sector engagement in state skill development activities
Collecting data on names of companies, their engagement models, the amount of funding being given
for skill development etc., as part of the existing ISMS system, will help the RSLDC/Rajasthan
Government understand trends in corporate and private sector engagement and design/adapt
incentives to align with private sector interests. This will ensure a higher corporate participation rate
which is expected to have multiple direct benefits like higher placements, greater aspiration for
potential vocational trainees, and so on.


(ii) Economic Zones
62 percent of Rajasthan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) comes from 12 districts (out of 33) – the
large ones being Jaipur (15 percent), Alwar (6 percent), Jodhpur (6 percent), Ajmer (5 percent) and
Bhilwara (4 percent). Specific details on the four major types of economic zones in Rajasthan are
provided in Figure 3.3 below together with their geographic mapping in Figure 3.4 to show the spread
of economic activity across the State 18.

Given that almost 40 percent of the Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) passes through
Rajasthan and that 60 percent of the total land area in the state is part of the Delhi Mumbai Industrial
Corridor (DMIC), the geographic areas surrounding the DFC/DMIC are expected to become a major
site for employment. The objective of this national program (i.e. DMIC) is to expand India's
manufacturing and services base and develop the designated region as a Global Manufacturing and
Trading Hub. The program is expected to provide a major impetus to planned urbanization in India
with manufacturing as the key driver. The figure below shows that the DMIC cuts through the state
of Rajasthan covering some major cities like Jaipur, Alwar, Ajmer etc.


           Figure 3:4: Geographic Mapping of Economic Centers across Rajasthan




While there are over 1500 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in Rajasthan catering to the skilling
needs of the populace and of industry, more than 90 percent of these are privately run. They are
geographically spread across the state with a large concentration around the DMIC. Given the large
opportunity in Rajasthan, particularly because of the advent of the DMIC, the Government/RSLDC
will need to assess if:
   a) The number of existing skill centers (with total number of seats available) and the trades
      taught are appropriate for the industries they are meant to cater to, and to identify if more
      skilling centers are needed;
   b) Private ITIs/skill centers are providing the requisite support needed for the locality in which
      they operate (the state could use performance metrics based on placements and accordingly


                                                                                                      7
        grade these ITIs), and to determine if more Government ITIs are needed to match future
        industrial demand.


NSDC's Skill Gap Study for Rajasthan assessed the current sectors generating high employment and
those that will in the future – see table 3.2 below.


                   Table 3.2: High employment industries: current and projected

    Current sectors with high employment                       Future growth sectors
    •   Agro Based Industries                         •   Retail
    •   Mineral Based Industries                      •   Tourism and Hospitality
    •   Handicrafts                                   •   Bio- technology
    •   Textiles                                      •   Auto Mechanics and Engineering
    •   Construction                                  •   IT/ ITES
    •   Healthcare                                    •   Gems and Jewellery


On a deep dive into some industries currently operating in existing economic zones, it was
observed that companies are already being set up keeping in mind future growth sectors. The
Mahindra World City (MWC) SEZ in Jaipur, for example, which is jointly promoted by the Mahindra
Group and RIICO, employs over 1 lakh people and spans 3000 acres of land with modern
infrastructure facilities. Keeping upcoming high demand industries in mind, MWC has set up
separate sub SEZs for handicrafts, engineering, gems and jewellery, IT and logistics with some major
companies including Genpact, Coca Cola and Infosys.


Similarly, the Bhiwadi-Neemrana Industrial Area (including the Japanese Zone at Neemrana), spread
over 545 acres, is reserved for Japanese investment, particularly for those companies which cater to
the automobile/ auto components industry. Almost 30 Japanese companies, including Nissin Brakes,
Toyota Gosei and Nippon, have invested about INR 2,5000 Crores in this industrial area.


(iii) Industry/Private Sector Engagement
Given the large presence of industry/corporates in any state, whether in established economic zones
or beyond, and the important role they play on the demand side of skills as prospective employers,
their engagement in the entire skill development process becomes equally important.


In this section, private sector engagement in the skill development space references two different
agents: one, private training providers who provide skills-related training and two,

                                                                                                  8
corporates/industry which invest in skill development either through their Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) mandate or through up-skilling/training of their existing employees.


In Rajasthan, although some large training providers like ILandFS, B-Able, and Dr. Reddy's
Foundation have started operations, their centers are primarily located around Jaipur, Jodhpur,
Udaipur or other relatively major towns. With greater institutional support being provided by the
Government and the higher demand for skills training, this trend is changing for the better. B-Able
is a case in point which has recently expanded to 24 districts (of 33 in Rajasthan) with centers in
each of them.
However, the trend in the type of skills training being provided is yet to change. Almost all
programmes focus on the service industry (retail, hospitality) with very limited investment in
hard skills like construction or auto etc. Given that skills training in these areas will be needed to
gear the workforce for future growth sectors in Rajasthan, the Government will need to invest in
training centers which can provide such training (for example, at the ITIs) although it may require
higher capex, as well as to incentivize training providers to provide high capex trainings.


The corporate sector, especially those companies which have large employment numbers, invests
heavily in education and skill development activities around their areas of operation. For example,
Mahindra World City in Jaipur organizes training programs for school dropouts and unemployed
youth. It has partnered with NGOs to conduct skill up-gradation cum entrepreneurship development
programs for electricians, plumbers, electronic technicians, security guards, computer operators,
beauticians, and spoken English courses among others. In addition, a large skill development campus
for Polytechnics has been constructed in MWC, which is equipped with requisite machines and
facilities to impart six to nine months training to unskilled workers who are already employed in the
machining industry. The training courses are focused on imparting practical skills together with
trade-related theoretical education.


Similarly, Honda recently got an approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) to
set up a vocational training institute (with an initial investment of INR 5 Crores) next to its upcoming
Tapukara plant, where it will conduct short-term modular courses in the field of manufacturing and
automobiles.


JCB India Limited, a large construction company, runs a world-class welding training school in
Jaipur which delivers a detailed 16-week induction program to train fresh graduates. As part of the
skilling initiatives, JCB also has Operator Training Centers that provide training to youth on safely
and productively operating JCB machines. They have successfully trained over 22,000 youth till date
(since 2010) in 14 centres across India.



                                                                                                      9
Engaging corporate houses in the skill development of local communities leads to a win-win
situation. If skills-related training is provided by prospective employers, then trainees will
understand company needs better, and the likelihood of their getting placed within the company
increases. On the other side, transaction costs involved in sourcing and recruiting labour is minimized
for the company. For example, when operating at full capacity, the Jaipur factory of JCB India will
employ around 1000 people; a large part of this manpower is expected to be recruited locally from
nearby Government polytechnics / ITIs and other private polytechnics.


A list of skill-related activities by select companies across multiple industries in Rajasthan is
provided in Annexure 2.


(iv) Innovation
Innovation is key to disrupt the existing skill development landscape and to increasing efficiencies
in the existing system. At the national and state levels, it is critical that innovative practices and
systems are identified, whether by a state, training provider or corporate, understood, adapted and
finally, implemented based on state and local population needs.


Innovation by Rajasthan Government:
One of the key areas in which the state of Rajasthan is seeking innovation is to target youth in lagging
regions. It started a project in 2007 called the Expansion of Technical Vocation Institutes in
Lagging Areas (by private partners) 19 wherein multiple incentives are provided to the private sector
(for example, land leased free of cost for 25 years, and if it’s a polytechnic college for women, the
Government will also reimburse cost of constructing the building, and provide free consultancy
services on any issue related to establishment of institute etc.). Rajasthan also very clearly set the
definition of lagging regions (i.e. a district that does not have even 1 engineering or polytechnic
college) in order to minimize any miscommunication.


Some of the key lessons learned from this project/scheme are:




19   FICCI Knowledge paper on skill development in India: Learner first, 2012

                                                                                                     10
      •    Clear targeting of "lagging zones" leads to less
           confusion in design and in implementation for
           partners and for the Government;
      •    Incentives provided to private sector are in line
           with their needs (for example, no land
           purchase/rent issues) resulting in over 50 such
           institutes being set up under this scheme in
           Rajasthan;
      •    States should design easy to understand and
           replicable models which can be used by other
           states and partners, adapted to specific state
           needs.

Innovation by the corporate sector:
In smaller towns and rural areas, the need for skilling is often fragmented, and is too low to scale for
any skill. There are about 45,000 villages in Rajasthan with small target populations of 10-15
thousand people. The challenge intensifies when setting up high capex centers for training in high-
skill trades (such as high end manufacturing). In addition, it is difficult to find good quality trainers
and assessors at the grassroots level. In effect, it becomes economically unviable to set up skill
centers from scratch.


In this context, when the ICICI Foundation took over some government banks in Udaipur and
Jodhpur, they were also asked to adopt two Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs).
The Foundation decided to try out a hub and spoke model in order to reach the interiors of
Rajasthan 20.


Key features of the model
      •    RSETIs are hubs with spokes (or satellite centers) in 13 villages
      •    There are residential facilities at hubs (students from the spokes visit the hub monthly for on-
           the-job trainings and placement support)
      •    Trainers are trained by ICICI and are accountable to the Foundation for placements
      •    Certification and placement is guaranteed by ICICI (making the training attractive and even
           aspirational for potential trainees)

Given the large number of small villages in the state, the scope is large to replicate this model.
Some key lessons learned to enable scaling up include:




20   http://statistics.rajasthan.gov.in/socio_Rajasthan.aspx; Visit to ICICI RSETI in Udaipur

                                                                                                        11
      •   Existing schools, block resource centers and other government buildings can be leveraged
          after operational hours as hubs/spokes to optimize infrastructural resources. The cost of
          refurbishment would be approximately INR 2 lacs/room.
      •   In addition, existing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) networks in these
          institutions can be used for technology-enabled learning – similar to the two-way BISAG 21
          for teacher training in Gujarat which uses existing networks in each school.
      •   The government will need to focus on advocating the cause; it will first have to create similar
          models and then, showcase their success


Summary
Rajasthan has strong institutional structures which manage the state skilling agenda. While the
RSLDC itself is a lean organization headquartered at Jaipur, it has a presence at the district level
given a large implementation team. With a management information system in place, data tracking
is possible at all levels. Going forward, creating dedicated monitoring and evaluation teams at the
grassroots with a strong feedback loop, and including private skilling centers/partners in the
monitoring framework, would enable greater accountability in the state skills mission.

Given the thrust of the state on economic growth (particularly because of the DMIC), there will be
significant demand for skill training going forward. The RSLDC/Government will need to assess if
the existing number of skilling centers (both government and private) are sufficient to meet the
expected industry demand, especially in the manufacturing sector.
While some innovation and corporate partnerships have been seen, there is scope for more of such
engagements. The state will need to provide targeted incentives to engage private players in the skills
space and promote public private partnership (PPP) models. It will also be critical to advance scalable
innovative models while encouraging the convergence of multiple stakeholders.

Skill Development in Gujarat

State Context
With a population of over 60 million people, Gujarat is one of the largest industrial hubs in India.
The state has seen a high average annual growth of 9 percent in the agricultural sector, whereas the
rest of India has an annual growth rate of around 3 percent. Tourism is also an important sector with
an annual tourist footfall of over 20 million.


(i) Institutions
The Gujarat Skill Development Mission (GSDM) was set up by a State Government Resolution
in 2009 as policy body to be led by the Education Department. The GSDM has a lean organization
structure (see Figure 3.5 below) with agencies set up by different Ministries managing the
implementation of skilling programs, and GSDM managing their overall coordination. Currently, the
Mission Director is the Director of Training and Employment at the Ministry of Labour, which
assures a strong partnership between the Departments of Education and of Labour.


         Figure 3:5: Organization Structure of the Gujarat Skill Development Mission




As a non-delivery entity with a mandate to coordinate and strategize, the GSDM has four key
functions:

   a) Developing an integrated skilling and employment strategy for youth in Gujarat;
   b) Undertaking surveys/research to identify existing skill gaps and opportunities in the state;
   c) Coordinating with other skill departments, for example, Labour and Employment,
      Education Department, Urban Development etc. to ensure optimization of resources and to
      streamline programs;
   d) Monitoring performance of schemes to measure impact and track targets.


                                                                                                  13
Different agencies under various ministries manage the implementation of skills-related schemes
at the district and block levels. For example, the Development Support Agency of Gujarat (D‐
SAG), 22 an autonomous society set up by the Tribal Development Department (TDD), manages
skill-related schemes for the Department. Its overall responsibility spans all aspects of the skilling
ecosystem from training and placement to monitoring and reporting. The actual implementation is
sub-contracted to training partners (using government and private ITIs as venues).

Over 20 Ministries are involved in Gujarat's skill development initiatives, although some large
national schemes are managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. These schemes include
the Craftsman Training Scheme (CTS), Apprenticeship Training Scheme (ATS), eMPOWER, and
Kaushalya Vardhan Kendras (KVKs). The KVKs in particular target rural youth through
Kaushalya Sabhas/Skill centers in villages with a population that is greater 5000. These KVKs
provide targeted trainings and incentives to SCs, STs, Women, and BPLand handicapped
individuals. Over 500 of such KVKs have been established, and have trained 12 lakh individuals,
of which 7.28 lakh are women trainees. (i.e. 62 percent).

In order to create appropriate skilling opportunities for its population and adapt skill training to
industry demand, Gujarat has also implemented its own state level schemes for skilling. Some
popular ones are UMEED, Society for Creation of Opportunity through Proficiency in English
(SCOPE), and Superior Training Institutes– a short description of these is provided in Table 3.3
below.

Between central and state sponsored schemes, over 1 lakh people are trained every year. However,
given industry needs and available supply of labor, there is a requirement and scope to do more. In
particular, to make Gujarat skill development initiatives more robust, two actions need to be
immediately taken:

(a) Creating a stand-alone State Skill Development Mission (SSDM)
Given the current arrangement of sharing responsibilities between the Department of Employment
and Training (DET) and the SSDM, there is an overlapping of resources (both human and
financial), and no clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities. A stand-alone SSDM with
earmarked funds and personnel will lead to increased ownership, defined accountability, and clear
monitoring/mentoring activities at the ground level.

(b) Establishing a robust Monitoring and Evaluation (MandE) system
This would entail allocating a portion of the skills budget to MandE activities, employing 2-3 staff
at the state level and 2-3 in each district (number of staff based on number of skilling centres in
each district), who could be attached to DIETs or district collector offices. In other words, given
33 districts in Gujarat, a total of about 60-70 staff would be required, who would be responsible
for overseeing the implementation of skill-related schemes, the quality of training being imparted
at centres, and for supporting/reporting any challenges being faced in the field. Further, the
                                                                                                   15
increased frequency of field visits would not only increase the accountability of skilling centres but
also reduce inefficiencies in the system due to unclear processes at the ground level.


(ii) Economic Zones
Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in Gujarat constitute approximately 50 percent of the total area
under SEZs in India. Specific details on the four major types of economic zones in Gujarat are
provided in Figure 3.6, and their geographic mapping to show the spread of economic activity
across the State is shown in Figure Y below.

                           Figure 3:6: Details on Economic Zones in Gujarat




A large part of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (almost 37 percent) passes through
Gujarat, covering about 62 percent of the area of the state,and 18 of 26 districts. This, taken
together with an investment potential of about USD 30 Billion 23 in this area, makes for huge
employment opportunities in Gujarat.

Gujarat trains less than 1 lakh people annually through its government skills training system in
Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). While government ITIs train more people than private ITIs,
the number of government ITIs (156 in all) is about two-thirds the number of private ones (220 in
number). Given the impending demand for labour in the state, state leadership will need to decide
on the number of additional training centers/institutes needed by trade. In this regard, it can also
inventorize existing, but unutilized, infrastructure – for example, engineering colleges with vacant
seats but with available classrooms, technology and labs – to optimize on resources.


NSDC's Skill Gap Study conducted an assessment of current sectors with high employment and those
that will generate high employment in the future – see Table 3.4 below.

        Current industries with large          Gujarat's future high growth sectors (according to
           employment numbers                               NSDC's skill gap study)

    •    Chemical and Chemical Products          • Non-metallic mineral based products
    •    Drugs and Pharmaceuticals               • Banking and Financial Services
    •    Machinery and Equipment                 • Hospitality and Tourism


A deep dive into some of these industries and Gujarat's economic zones showcases the fact that the
state already houses a large number of corporates in diverse industries/sectors. The largest
SEZ for example – the Mundra Port SEZ (Adani Power) in Kutch – given its effective access to
major international sea ports, caters to multiproduct industries from Alstom, Bharat Forge,
Hindustan Petroleum, Maruti Suzuki and Oriental Carbon and Chemicals Limited (OCCL).


The Gujarat International Finance Tech (GIFT) City SEZ in Gandhinagar is India’s first
globally benchmarked SEZ for financial services with the status of an International Financial
Service Centre. With a projected employment (at full capacity) in direct and indirect services
pegged at 1 million, this SEZ aspires to capture approximaterly 10 percent of Financial Services
and Information Technology (IT/ITES) sectors.


Some of the other large economic zones cater to petroleum chemicals and petro-chemical
industries, and include the PCPIR, Bharuch (including Dahej SEZ) as well as the Vadodara
Ankleshwar GIDC estates (the Ankleshwar industrial estate is one of the largest chemical clusters
in India). Some large companies operate out of these zones including Reliance Petrochemical,
Petronet, ABG Shipyard, ONGC, Hindalco etc. with projected direct and indirect employment at
over 1.5 million persons.


As some of the largest production sites in India are in Gujarat, and as an increasing number of
corporates are setting up industrial bases in the state, the Gujarat Government will need to
increasingly emphasise on setting up good quality skilling institutes as well as on ensuring high
quality and industry relavant training in existing ones.


(iii) Industry/Private Sector Engagement
Gujarat has about five large private training providers: TeamLease, Larsen and Tubro, Bosch India
Foundation, AISECT and Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (ILandFS). AISECT has
by far the largest presence in terms of reach with about 250 established training centres. Bosch and
LandT provide skills training as part of their CSR initiatives – making skilling one of three-four
priority areas (other priority areas typically include environment and education).

                                                                                                   18
Private sector involvement in skill development is mostly through CSR engagement in the State.
Each company tends to identify priority areas for skilling such as training for women, for rural
youth, and so on. For example, Essel Foundation extends support to an Apparel Manufacturing
Centre in Jamnagar which trains local women in tailoring and stitching, and creates new business
for them by establishing linkages with markets. It has also set up its own Advanced Welding Centre
in partnership with the Government which enables candidates to get a certificate from ESAB 25 (a
high end welding institute), greatly helping employability.


Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) which employs about 24 lakh people in the State, spends over
INR 700 Crore in CSR annually (pan India). In Gujarat, it invests in several skill up-gradation and
vocational training programmes for unemployed youth of villages around Reliance units to enhance
their employability. RIL has developed its own network of 12 schools in and around the
manufacturing units of the company at Jamnagar, Surat, Vadodara, Patalganga, Nagothane and
Nagpur, benefitting more than 15,000 students. To-date, about 62 percent of RIL’s permanent
workforce and 49.5 percent of its permanent women employees has received safety and skill
upgradation trainings through classroom as well as web-based training programmes.


Similarly, the Bank of Baroda which employs about 50,000 people in Gujarat spends
approximately INR 7 Crores in skilling activities through its CSR programme. The Bank has
established Baroda Swarozgar Vikas Sansthans for imparting training to unemployed youth, free
of cost, towards gainful self-employment and entrepreneurship skill development. This helps such
youth improve their economic status and also gives a boost to various regional economies in rural
and semi-urban areas.


In order to maximize scale of such operations and increase efficiencies in the skilling system
(currently, several piecemeal efforts are on-going in the State), the Gujarat government will need
to collate all these various activities conducted by the corporate sector as well as under different
government schemes. Based on stakeholder consultations, it can then be decided which trades,
sections of the population and type of skilling engagement should be carried out by which entity.
For example, if rural youth in a particular geographic zone can be better reached through an existing
company in the area (through CSR or private training provision), then the Government need not
set up an ITI in that area, but can instead discuss ways to support corporate efforts to
continue/expand its training operations.




25   Elektriska Svetsnings-Aktiebolaget, is a Swedish industrial company

                                                                                                    19
A list of skill-related activities by select companies across multiple industries in Gujarat is provided
in Annexure 3.


(iv) Innovation
Innovation by Gujarat Government
One of the key innovations being by the Gujarat Government is the skill voucher system 26 wherein
funds allocated for training reach actual beneficiaries who have the freedom to select the course
and institute of their choice, thereby incentivizing the supply side of skilling. The scheme is still in
the works and is expected to take off later in the year. Pre-paid vouchers would be purchased by
trainees from the GSDM. Therefore, the argument is that market forces would ensure that trainees
either get a certificate in the course of his/her choice, or the money would go back to the funding
entity if the voucher is not utilised. This, when implemented, will also ensure that accountability
and performance of each institute will increase.


Another innovation of the Government is the
Flexi-MoU system which gives companies the
flexibility to tailor training programs at ITIs to
meet their specific needs. 27 For example, the
Gujarat Industrial Power Company has adopted
two ITIs in the tribal-dominated areas of
Gujarat where it will provide train candidates
to become instrument mechanics (power plant)
or electricians (power plant), creating a win-
win situation for the company, the Government
as well as the trainee. 32 flex-i MoUs have been
signed to date. 28


The third type of innovation being implemented in the State are the Skill Upgradation Centres –
SUCs. These are outreach centres for bringing unorganized labour into the skilling framework.
These SUCs typically follow a PPP model where the infrastructure is provided by the Government

                                                                                                         20
and the content and training are provided by the private partner. These short-term certificate
courses go on for about three months. Approximately, 300 such SUCs were set up by 2013. 29


Innovation by the corporate sector: Industrial KVKs (iKVKs)
The Industrial Kaushal Vikas Kendras (iKVKs) were launched in 2014 in Gujarat, with a mission of
skilling in industry by industry for industry – akin to apprenticeships but shorter duration of training.
Currently, there are 47 functional i-KVKs and 62 additional coming up in 2015-16. Skilling programs
are industry run within company premises using own shop floors and approval of syllabus is
decentralized – 136 course modules in 22 sectors are prepared with industry consultation by different
companies. The course length varies between 1-3 months.


Trainees are from local neighborhood and top performers are recruited by companies after trainees
sit for assessment at the end of training and certified by company as well as Gujarat Council for
Vocational Training (GCVT) on clearing exam. State Government provides approximately INR 25
per trainee per hour – as part of the iKVK state scheme - all else is borne by the company.


Key aspects of the model
      •   Resources      are     optimized   as
          infrastructure and training equipment
          already exist with company

      •   A mutually beneficial model as training
          is on industry standards and company
          retains top talent. Therefore, this model
          is best replicated in States with high
          industrial growth given high ownership
          of companies and training on their shop
          floors for high capex trades.


In order to scale such a model, it will be important to advocate benefits of iKVKs to states, corporates
and PSUs. Existing repository of content will need to be created and shared by corporates for
different trades – adapted to context of stakeholder – and trainers. Further, based on the costs of

                                                                                                      21
trades and sectors, funding will be required wherein a proportion of required capex could be
financed 30.


Summary
Gujarat is in the process of setting up good institutional systems for skill development. A key step in
the right direction will be the creation of a stand-alone SSDM with dedicated funding and personnel.
A robust MandE system – disaggregated to the district levels – will ensure on-ground implementation
with a strong feedback loop and greater accountability of involved stakeholders.


Given the presence of a large number of corporates and industrial houses, and their existing
engagement in the skills space, Gujarat would benefit from coordinating these efforts and optimizing
resources (especially in terms of funds allocated to skill development). In addition, such coordination
would also provide learning lessons from existing best practices of implementation.

Building on the success of PPP arrangements like SUCs, the Government should identify other
incentives to the private sector (similar to "Flexi MoUs) which would encourage their participation
in the skills space. Expected benefits include not just increased allocation of funds for skilling, but
also support in skilling implementation in hard-to-access areas or for certain marginalised
communities (like tribal groups, women, rural youth and so on).




30Indicative costs are approximately 1-2 Cr. for high capex sector/trade and about 15-20 lacs for
low capex sector/trade and opex of about 10-15K per trainee.

                                                                                                    22
Skill Development in Maharashtra

State Context
Maharashtra, the world's second-most populous sub-national entity, has over 112 million residents, 31
which is 9.3 percent of the total population of India. The state is highly urbanised with 45.2 percent
of its population residing in urban areas. Maharashtra has 36 districts which are divided into six
revenue divisions for administrative ease given the large geographical area i.e. Konkan, Pune,
Nashik, Aurangabad, Amravati and Nagpur. 32 This state contributes about 25 percent of the country's
industrial output and over 13 percent of its GDP. The service sector dominates the economy of
Maharashtra, accounting for 61.4 percent of the value addition and 69.3 percent of the value of output
in the country. 33 The state's per-capita income is 40 pecent higher than the all-India average. 34


(i) Institutions
While the Maharashtra State Skill Development Society/Mission (MSSDS) 35 was established in
2011, skill development activities in the state have been on-going for over a decade. MSSDS was set
up as the state nodal agency to facilitate planning, execution and monitoring of the State Skill
Development Plan. Its vision is to equip 45 million people with employable skills by 2022, i.e.
about 45 lakh skilled workers per year -- the number is derived based on the state's contribution to
the Gross National Domestic Product (approximately 13 percent) and its share of the national
population (approximately 9 percent). The Maharashtra Government has also recently set up a
Department for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, similar to the Ministry at the Center.
However, inter-linkages between the Department and MSSDS are yet to be systematized.

Ten key departments within the State Government have been identified to provide skill
development related trainings with annual targets set for each. 36 The Higher and Technical
Education Department (HTED), Rural Development Department and the Industries Department are
mandated with delivering the highest number of annual trainings – at 10 lakh people to be trained
per year. Other departments include the Social Justice Department, the Tribal Development
Department etc.


The MSSDS has a comprehensive mandate which includes:

     •    Converging and coordinating all stakeholders including corporates, government
          departments, divisional and district level committees and so on
     •    Managing State Skill Gap Assessment Studies which are led by the industry, and setting up
          sector skill committees for high growth sectors (11 set up to date, of which 9 have prepared
          skill gap reports 37)
     •    Providing and overseeing skilling targets of state departments which need to manage central
          and state schemes as well as optimize the utilization of their existing education and training
          infrastructure
     •    Creating training infrastructure and accreditation, assessment and certification, and
          ensuring better utilization of existing infrastructure both in public and private sectors
     •    Ensuring the availability of qualified trainers
     •    Maintaining a dynamic LMIS and State Web Portal in order to store and manage real time
          skilling data
     •    Managing industry participation and designing incentives to engage them effectively

Given its large mandate and scope of work, the MSSDS becomes an important organisation. Hence,
at the highest level, the MSSDS is led by the Chief Minister and the Mission Director is the
Commissioner of Employment, Self Employment and Skill Development (ESEandSD) – see
Figure 3.8 below.

1. Higher and Technical Education Department

While policy and overall structure to the skilling agenda in the state is provided by the State Apex
Committee (structure shown on the right side of the figure above), the implementation of skilling
projects is managed by divisional and district level teams through vocational training providers
and the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). These divisional and district teams provide monitoring
and guidance support at the regional and sub-regional levels. The Government of Maharashtra
provides MSSDS with approximately INR 10-15 Crores to implement and oversee that these skilling
targets are met, and requires that each Department put aside 1 percent of their annual budget for skill
development activities. 39

In terms of central initiatives, Maharashtra implements three key schemes: the Modular
Employable Scheme (MES) managed by the Directorate General of Employment and Training
(DGET), Ministry of Labour and Employment; the National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM)
scheme managed by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation; and the Hunar Se
Rojgar Tak (HSRT) scheme, managed by the Ministry of Tourism. While funding is provided from
the central government for these schemes, the MSSDS/state is responsible for their implementation:
from registration of vocational training providers and re-imbursement of training costs and
assessment fees to the issuance of fund utilization certificate to DGET, entailing, inspection,
monitoring and supervision.


Maharashtra also implements some state level schemes catering to the state’s priority sectors.
These include the Pramod Mahajan Skill Development scheme, Lok Seva Kendra Yojana, Magel
Tayala Vivasay Prashikshan Yojana for scheduled castes and the Manav Vikas scheme.


In 2015, the state launched a Maharojgar and Mahakaushalya (MandM) portal 40 which will house
a database of, and act as an interface between, students, training providers and industry. The portal
includes a dashboard for job seekers and employers with real time data being generated.


Therefore, from an institutional point of view, the state of Maharashtra has made some important
strides. Two key recommendations to further strengthen the skills ecosystem would be:

40   https://www.maharojgar.gov.in

                                                                                                    25
(a) Identify, communicate and streamline the interlinkages between the Department for Skill
Development and Entrepreneurship and the MSSDS
The roles and responsibilities, together with budget and personnel allocations, need to be clearly
defined for both entities. A reporting mechanism needs to be established to ensure smooth
functioning of activities for the Department as well as for the MSSDS. Communication down the
ladder is as important as setting up structures and processes to enable efficient implementation and
reduce leakages (of information, funds and time) in the system.


(b) Promote the MandM portal, especially among industry partners
The digital portal uses multiple data analytics tools and big data and, therefore, could provide a useful
basis to understand region-specific demand and supply nexuses. Industry engagement will need to
be promoted through discussions and incentives as this platform serves to be a "win-win" for both
industry and for the student. The platform will help identify workforce availability for industry while
informing students of employment opportunities (by trade and job roles).

(ii) Economic Zones
Akin to Make in India, the Maharashtra Government launched the Make in Maharashtra campaign 41
in 2014, in order to facilitate ease of doing business and generate employment. Currently, the state
estimates an ingress of INR 5 lakh crore in industrial investment (USD 84 Billion) and the creation
of over 2 million jobs between 2014 and 2019. 42.

Most of this investment and employment will be happen in the economic zones spread across the
state. The Mumbai- Pune-Thane belt is the largest zone, accounting for almost 60 percent of the
state’s industrial output. Around 26 per cent of the state's population comes under the corridor that
covers eight districts - Thane, Raigad, Pune, Dhule, Nandurbar, Nashik, Ahmednagar and
Aurangabad.

Specific details on the four major types of economic zones in Maharashtra are provided in Figure 3.9
below together with their geographic mapping in Figure 3.10 to show the spread of economic activity
across the State 43.

The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) is a project of the government
of Maharashtra which provides infrastructure such as land (open plot or built-up spaces), roads, water
supply, drainage facilities and street lights to business. The MIDC is spread all over the state with
earmarked industrial areas, IT parks, wine and chemical parks, and accounts for the majority of
employment opportunities for the population.

With almost 1,000 ITIs in the state (equal numbers run by the government and by private training
providers), skill training is provided to over 2.5 lakh people annually. Maharashtra has a government
ITI in every block, which makes skill training highly accessible to its population. Given the existing

                                                                                                   27
networks of ITIs and other training institutes in the State, the MSSDS/Department of Skill
Development and Entrepreneurship will need to determine:

     a) Processes which can assess (on a regular basis) the type of trades being taught in specific
        economic zones, and ensure that they align with industry demand – this could be part of an
        annual assessment conducted at the district level and collated at the state level;


     b) The type of employment and entrepreneurship opportunities which need to be generated for
        zones which are not covered by major economic activities, and provide support accordingly
        to that end.

NSDC's Skill Gap Study for Maharashtra conducts an assessment of the current sectors generating
high employment and those that will in the future – see Table 3.5 below.

       •   Fishery                                    •   Tourism, Travel, Hospitality and Trade
       •   Textiles                                   •   Healthcare Services
       •   IT/ITES


On a deep dive into some industries currently operating in existing economic zones, it was
observed that companies cover a spectrum of industries. In the last financial year, almost 29
percent of the total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) which came into India was invested in
Maharashtra. 45 For example, the Maharashtra Airport Development Company Ltd. (in the Mihan
SEZ in Nagpur) was the location for India's first Boeing airbus factory. Today, it is a major IT hub,

housing over 15 companies like Infosys, and Tata Consultancy Services. Its projected direct and
indirect employment numbers stand at 1.2 million and 10 million persons, respectively.

Similarly, the Sangli- Kohlapur MSME clusters (for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) are
sites of large scale growth of textile industries, and are expected to provide high employment in the
future (currently, about 40,000 people are employed). These MSME clusters are mostly located in
rural or semi-rural areas and form a large part of the informal sector in India.


(iii) Industry/Private Sector Engagement
Given the large presence of the private sector in Maharashtra, industry and private training providers
are quite active in the skills space. Some of the large private training providers include Pratham
which has 39 centers across the state, with key a presence in Aurangabad, Pune, Nashik, Mumbai,
Raigad and Latur. They primarily cater to eight future growth sectors including hospitality,
construction, auto and healthcare.

Another large organization is the Kherwadi Social Welfare Association, which is seeking to train
about 10 lakh youth in the state through its Yuva Parivartan model. 80 percent of their program
focuses on out-of-school youth, on providing livelihoods and creating opportunities in the organised
sector through placement support, and on setting up a Rural Employment Exchange to aggregate job
opportunities in the unorganised sector. It also provides training for farm based occupations through
Self-Help Groups (SHGs), drawing on schemes catering to the rural populace like the Integrated
Rural Development Program.


Corporate engagement in skilling is primarily driven by CSR activities. Mahindra and Mahindra, 46
one of the key auto companies of Maharashtra, provides livelihood training to youth from socially
disadvantaged sections of society through the Mahindra Pride Schools. Almost 4,000 such students
have been provided training at the 3 Mahindra Pride Schools in Pune, Chennai and Patna. The
Company also implements the SMART (Skills-for-Market Training) Project, wherein it imparts
training to youth in Information Technology (IT), Accounting, Hospitality, Business Process
Outsourcing (BPO), Retail and Sales, and Nursing – all of which are key employment sectors. The
company projects 50 such centers to be set up by 2015 with a training capacity of 10,000 youth.


Similarly, Bajaj Auto 47 has undertaken the upgradation of 4 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) -
two in Pune, one in Aurangabad and one in Pantnagar - under a PPP arrangement. The company also

                                                                                                   29
has a partnership with the Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) for conducting
vocational training programmes, particularly in dairy, poultry, tailoring, fashion designing and so on
for rural youth and women. About 1,000 people are trained through these programs annually.


Larsen and Tubro supports vocational training institutes through multiple means 48 – from
upgrading the infrastructure of the institutions to developing curriculum. In FY12, 27 ITIs were
supported across the country by the company, in addition to 8 Construction Skills Training Institutes
(CSTI) that were established by them in India. In PPP mode, the building and land infrastructure is
provided by the government and LandT acts as the knowledge provider and training partner.


A list of skill-related activities by select companies across multiple industries in Maharashtra is
provided in Annexure 4.


(iv) Innovation
Two innovative models adopted by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) are discussed in
this section, both of which are practiced in Maharashtra and are being expanded to other states.

(a) Providing Medium Term Training

Context: Very few medium term (9-12 months) training courses are provided in India (most last for
3months or for 2 years). This type of trainings is critical for certain trades/sectors like architectural
assistants, surveyors for construction etc.

TISS Model: 49 The objective is to skill about 50,000 National Service Scheme (NSS) students
between 2013 and 2016-17 (together with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports) and help them
gain a diploma in specific skills/competencies in addition to a bachelor’s degree. Using a hub and
spoke model (the spokes being about 13 universities across 9 states), students undergo training in 6-
7 foundational courses (such as personality development, financial literacy and so on) and in 1 core
domain (such as agriculture, water and sanitation, entrepreneurship etc.) as part of the requirements
of an existing 3 year bachelor’s degree . On completion, they earn either a Diploma (40 Credits) or
a Certificate (20 Credits) in addition to a Bachelors of Arts or Science.

                                                                                                      30
Given the large scope for resource optimization in this model, some key lessons learned to enable
scaling up include:
   •   Using existing infrastructure of universities and other colleges which have classrooms
       and other facilities in place;
   •   Targeting a catchment of students (in this case, NSS), i.e. no separate mobilization of
       students is needed;
   •   Leveraging existing pool of trainers/experts for training delivery and of NGOs to facilitate
       field training, drawing on the core competencies of all stakeholders involved.

(b) Providing Work Integrated Training (WIT) or Earn while you Learn Training

Context: Work Integrated Training is for up-skilling people who are already employed and who can
continue to work and earn while enhancing their skills. Courses typically cover a spectrum from
Banking, Financial services and Insurance (BFSI), hospitality to industrial tool manufacturing (e.g.,
computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing – CAD-CAM). These courses have a
duration of less than 6 months (from 60-180 hours, 1 day of training per week), at the end of which
trainees are provided a certificate. The concept is similar to Work Integrated Learning (WIL) being
practiced globally as well as in engineering colleges in India.


TISS Model: The key objective of this model is to support industries in upgrading the skills of its
blue collar workforce. The TISS model uses a Hub and spoke delivery mechanism (similar to the
medium-term training model described above) with classroom-based training at the hub and on-the-
job training at spokes. This model, if scaled, will especially benefit the MSME sector and help bring
those engaged informally into formal employment structures.




Summary
Maharashtra – with the presence of both a Department for Skill Development as well as a Skill
Development Mission – is laying strong institutional foundations to build the skilling policy structure
in the state. With teams disaggregated at the regional and sub-regional levels, it is also building a
ground-level implementation structure. Going forward, it will need to align the mandates and roles

                                                                                                      31
and responsibilities of different stakeholders, especially of the Department and of MSSDS, to ensure
the smooth functioning of systems and processes. In addition, mass communication around the
MandM portal is needed to engage industry more actively on the platform.


While over 1,000 ITIs are operational in the state, with at least 1 government ITI in each block, it is
essential to map these training institutes against the predominant economic activity of the region.
This will ensure streamlined demand and supply for skills and training as per industry requirements.


Finally, Maharashtra dominates other states in India in terms of FDI ingress, and with the push
created by Make in Maharashtra, even more industries are setting up base in the state. While this
may mean an increase in CSR investment in the skills space, it also provides an opportunity for the
state leadership to bring companies together into a more holistic engagement with skill development.




                                                                                                    32
Skill Development in Bihar

State Context
Bihar is the third largest state in India by population. It has a per capita income of USD 360 a year
against India's average of USD 1265. 30.6 percent of the state's population lives below the poverty
line against India's average of 22.15 percent. 50 The economy of Bihar is largely service-oriented, but
it also has a significant agricultural base. The state also has a small industrial sector, with
manufacturing growing at an average growth rate of 0.38 percent compared to India's 7.8 percent. 51
As of 2012, agriculture accounts for 22 percent, industry for 5 percent, and service for 73 percent of
the economy of the state. Bihar is divided into nine divisions and 38 districts for administrative
purposes.


(i) Institutions
The Bihar Skill Development Mission (BSDM) 52 was set up in 2012 under the Society's Act. Its
vision is to increase capacity and capability of the system to deliver quality skill training and
professional knowledge to youth to enhance employability and bridge the skill deficit while meeting
market demand for skilled manpower. The BSDM aims to equip 1 crore people with employable
skills by 2017, with about 100K being trained annually in long duration trainings and 500K annually
in short duration ones.

BSDM's mandate, including 28 objectives listed in an MoU, is primarily to provide guidance and
support for efficient planning and implementation, monitoringand evaluation of professional,
technical, vocational education, and of skill development and upgradation in Bihar. In addition, it
also seeks to
      •   Document and promote latest innovations and technology
      •   Facilitate public-private partnerships
      •   Establish task forces for the implementation of schemes and delegation of powers
      •   Involve academic and research institutions, training institutes and other institutes working on
          skilling
      •   Oversee existing training venues and setting up new ones
      •   Advise the governing council on new schemes required in Bihar
      •   Facilitate knowledge transfer (organize conferences etc.)

Given this all encompassing mandate, the Governing Council is headed by the Chief Minister
(and in his/her absence, the Chief Secretary), with the Development Commissioner as the
Secretary. Principal Secretaries of about 12 departments are part of the BSDM's Executive
Committee (see Figure 3.11 below for more details). Similar to some other State Skill Development
Missions, implementation of skilling projects is managed by district teams which are overseen
by the BSDM


     Figure 3:11: Organization Structure of the Bihar Skill Development Mission (BSDM) 53




The BSDM has a budget of INR 65 crores and a target of training 1 Crore people by 2017-18.
It has set out the mandate and department-wise annual targets for 17 key departments in the state,
which are listed in Table 3.6 below. The Department of Labour Resources is responsible for the
highest numbers to be trained, followed by the Departments of Agriculture and Rural Development.

                                                                                                  34
Key central schemes being implemented in the state include the Apprenticeship Training Scheme
(ATS), Craftsman Training Scheme (CTS), Up-gradation of ITIs under Public-Private-Partnership
(PPP), Centre of Excellence (CoE), Skill Development based on Modular Employable Skills (MES),
and Skill Development of Youth in 34 districts affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE).

To strengthen skill development institutional structures in Bihar, two key activities are imminent:

(a) Streamline operations of the Department of Labour Employment and Training and of the
BSDM
The challenge is due to the overlapping mandates and unclear division of roles and responsibilities
between these two organisations. Therefore, mandates need to be aligned, and work plans and inter-
dependencies need to be clearly identified which will ensure the smooth functioning of processes
and systems, and reduce issues in implementation at the ground level.


(b) Develop an MIS system for job seekers and employers
A robust MIS system at the BSDM level, with access rights down the hierarchy, is needed that will
be a one-stop platform for all information on skill related activities in the state. This will facilitate
data-driven decision making for all stakeholders. The BSDM and its implementation teams can track
quality of training, placements etc.; potential trainees can decide which training institutes are best
suited to their trade needs/interests; job seekers can track job openings with listed job profiles and
companies; and employers can identify desired candidates based on their profiles. The MIS system
can further be used as a tool to design incentives into the system and create a structure for
performance based awards and recognition.


(ii) Economic Zones
Given that less than 1 percent of India's industrial output comes from Bihar, there is much scope
for the expansion of economic zones across the state. The key driver of economic activity is the
Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA), established under the BIADA Act, 1974
with an objective to promote and facilitate industrialization in the State. BIADA is a statutory body
which receives directions and instructions from the government in accordance with the provisions
under the Act. The state government acquires land under the relevant provisions of Land Acquisition
Act, transfers the same to BIADA for industrialization, which further allots it to entrepreneurs and
companies.




                                                                                                      35
Specific details on the two major types of economic zones in Bihar are provided in Figure 3.12 below
together with their geographic mapping in Figure 3.13 to show the spread of economic activity across
the State 55.


                          Figure 3:12: Details on Economic Zones in Bihar




While most districts seem to have 1 BIADA industrial estate, there is a concentration of economic
activity around Patna – the state capital. The Hajipur Export Promotion Industrial Park
(EPIP) in the Patna region, for example, is a hub for food processing and for biscuit factories. Built
over 94 acres of land, it provides a 40 percent subsidy to food-based industries. Some large
companies which have invested in this economic zone include PepsiCo, Britannia Biscuits, and
Anmol biscuits.


Two other large zones concentrated around Patna are the Fatuha and Patliputra Industrial Areas.
While Fatuha is known for small industries, especially handlooms, Patliputra is a multiproduct zone
catering to glass, steel, plastics, and gems and jewellery.

             Figure 3:13: Geographic Mapping of Economic Centers across Bihar




There are over 700 training institutes (both government and private ITIs) which provide skill
development trainings in Bihar. Most of these (almost 90 percent) are privately managed and train
on courses decided at the national level by the National Council for Vocational Training (NCVT);
very few training courses and related curriculum are developed at the state level.


NSDC's Skill Gap Study for Bihar assessed the current sectors generating high employment and
those that will in the future – see Table 3.7 below.

                Table 3.7: High employment industries: current and projected

   Current industries with large employment numbers                   Future growth sectors
    •   Agriculture and forestry (including the sugar             •    IT/        ITES         and
        industry)                                                      Communication
    •   Food processing                                           •    Energy and Power
    •   Textiles: Handloom, Silk and Jute                         •    Hospitality and Tourism
    •   Leather and tanning                                       •    Plastics and chemicals
    •   Mining and Minerals


Going forward, the state will need to:
   a) Identify trades and relevant training courses to align with high growth sectors in the state
      (especially agriculture and allied activities), develop associated curriculum and courseware,
      and implement them in the ITIs, polytechnics etc.


                                                                                                37
      b) Develop a robust MandE system to monitor and mentor training institutes (both government
         and private) so that they implement good quality training. However, the state should not
         interfere in the operational functioning of the private entities, but it should hold them
         accountable to standards and measurable outcomes (such as placements).


(iii) Industry/Private Sector Engagement
Most non-state training partners have recently started operations in Bihar over the last 2-3 years.
Some of the large private sector training providers include ILandFS, DataPro, B-ABLE, Premier
Shield and Shriram New Horizons. Given market demand and shorter course lengths, six industry
sectors dominate the training sector: construction, tourism, banking, hospitality, IT and computers. 56


Some large corporates/industries have their production plants and operations in Bihar. Typically,
most corporates engage in some kind of skill development activity for local youth and forwomen in
the neighborhood/village where the production plant is housed. In addition, they invest funds through
their CSR initiatives.


For example, ITC's Agarbatti Production Project 57 in Bihar is part of its Women's Economic
Empowerment Program, and is aimed primarily at women from poor households. The company
provides end-to-end production support to these women and handles Agarbatti marketing through its
nationwide marketing network. The requisite training is provided by ITC, and is focused on building
a comprehensive set of skills covering production, packaging ,dispatch, quality control, inventory
management, documentation and process efficiencies so that the end result is a competitive and
world-class product. ITC provides the training at its network of centers and sub-centers that it
operates in partnership with NGOs. In addition to serving as training centers, these units serve as
hubs for raw material distribution, finished product collection, quality control, and packaging and
dispatch.


Such engagements, however, are few in number. The state will need to identify specific sectors where
it needs corporate support in skill development, and to create incentives and an enabling environment
in order to engage corporates actively.

currently their engagement in Bihar is limited.


(iv) Innovation
Innovation by the Bihar Government:"Jeevika"
An innovative skilling and livelihoods program running in Bihar is Jeevika – funded by the World
Bank, Government of India and the Government of Bihar. With an outlay of over INR 9,200 Crores,
this Bihar Rural Livelihood Project has been in operation for 6 years. The project structure is laid
out in Figure 3.14 below. 58

                         Figure 3:14: Jeevika's Project Structure and Targets




With its presence in all 534 blocks of Bihar, the project has Skill and Placement as a key pillar of
its program, (linked to the initiative on Economic Capital Development) and ensures placements in
high end companies like Vardhman Rayons, LandT, Construction Industry Development Council
(CIDC), and so on. Through this project over 46,000 rural youth have been trained at the Rural Self
Employment Training Institutes (R-SETI). In order to tackle the issues related to migration and
associated skills training, the project enabled the opening of the first Migration Resource Centre
(MRC) in Gurgaon in 2014. Through this center, which provides key information on health,

education and remittance services, emphasis is placed on monitoring post placement progress of
youth and on identifying specific skills/trainings needed by migrant workers 59.


Summary
With the creation of the Bihar Skill Development Mission and annual skilling targets set for each
responsible department, the state is investing in making skill development a priority. Given the large
number of stakeholders in the skills landscape (particularly with 17 departments engaged in skills
training, and with the Department of Labour Employment and Training playing an active role in
implementing key central schemes), it is imperative to create and communicate clear mandates and
reporting mechanisms and to identify any overlaps and possibilities of collaboration. This would
increase efficiencies within the governing and the implementation system.


According to the 2015 Ease of Doing Business Report of the World Bank, Bihar ranks at number 21
of thirty-two states assessed, and falls in the Jump Start Needed category of states. 60 Going forward,
the state will need to align with Make in India, Digital India and other such national level programs
and create the necessary infrastructure and investment climate for industries to invest in high
employment generating sectors. This, coupled with high quality skill training institutes, will ensure
a higher return on investment for businesses.


Few companies and non-state partners are currently engaged in skill related trainings in Bihar. The
state will first need to prioritize creating the enabling environment for companies to increase
investments in Bihar, followed by identifying critical areas of support that the private sector can
provide to the state in its specific skill-development value chain.

                       4. RECOMMENDATIONS AND WAY FORWARD

The previous chapters covered four key aspects of skill development at the state level: institutional
set up; presence of economic zones and matching skill development training to requirements in the
respective zones; role of non-state partners (both private training providers and corporates engaged
in skill development through their CSR initiatives or otherwise); and any innovative practices/models
being implemented by the state government and/or corporates in specific states.

While state specific recommendations have been captured in Chapter 3 for each relevant state, this
section provides high-level design solutions which can be adapted to any state in the country.

(i) Strengthening State Skill Development Missions
Most SSDMs have broad, comprehensive mandates that are very similar to each other. However, in
reality, SSDMs have grown organically, and what they actually do and how they function is
very different from other SSDMs. The majority of the work of SSDMs seems to be focused on the
implementation of skilling schemes (both central and state specific), rather than on state-level
strategic thinking, analysis, planning and monitoring.

Even for implementation of large national schemes (details in Annexure 1), roll-out models at the
state level varies. For example, while the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana
(DDU-GKY) is implemented through Project Implementation Agencies (PIAs) across states, the
Ministry of Rural Development shares a different relationship with different states in terms of
disbursement of funds and monitoring/supervision control. For some states, funds are directly
disbursed to PIAs and monitoring is managed by the MoRD; for other states, funds are disbursed to
the Department of Rural Development at the state level which also manages monitoring and
supervision.In addition, SSDMs have been set up as different organization types in different states
(for example, Rajasthan has set it up as a Corporation, Maharashtra as a Society, and Gujarat and
Bihar as a Mission), with varying organization structures (heavy vs. lean staff structures) and
different budget amounts.

It is therefore important to look at the SSDM mandate and functions afresh, keeping in mind existing
organizations and institutions that are already implementing skilling activities in their respective
states. A preliminary hypothesis about the role of State Skill Development Missions covering a
range of functions is provided in Figure 4.1 below. From this, the center can decide on the minimum
functions which an SSDM should carry out or manage, and the states can adapt the remaining to their
own context.



                                                                                                  41
       Figure 4:1: Framework for Roles and Functions of a State Skill Development Mission




The broad assumption made in the framework above is that the SSDM should primarily focus on
setting policy and targets at the highest levels, and ensure monitoring/mentoring to achieve those
targets. It should get involved in implementation and funding only where necessary.


Thus, four key activities of an SSDM’s work plan could include:
   •     Assessing the skill demand and supply gap for the state;
   •     Developing an action plan (annually and five-yearly) to manage the skill gap;
   •     Coordinating stakeholders and skilling schemes to ensure alignment with the state action plan;
   •     Assuring quality, and measuring impact of implementation.


(ii) Regional Mapping of Economic Zones
Across India, there are typically six types of economic zones catering to different priorities with
different types of incentives given to industry to participate in each. A list and description of these
zones is provided in Figure 4.2 below.




                                                                                                    42
                               Figure 4:2: Economic Zones in India




Given the importance of economic zones in creating employment opportunities, one way for states
to create a demand-supply nexus is based on economic zone mapping. This activity would fall within
the ambit of the SSDM and a potential approach is provided below.


1. Identification of economic zones and industries in each state through
   •   Desk and secondary research, telephonic interviews with experts and analysis
   •   Mapping of zones geographically on state maps
   •   Identification of high and future growth industries in these zones


2. Identification of Corporates in economic zones by
   •   Means of secondary research and through conversations with Industry Associations
   •   Identifying 10-12 corporates in each state mapped by high growth industries
   •   Documenting current and projected employment numbers (where available)


3. And finally, mapping of skill centers to zones
   •   Listing skill centers (government and private ITIs etc.) in each state
   •   Matching courses taught in and seating capacity of centers to needs of corporates in those
       economic zones
   •   Identifying gaps and recommending locations and courses for new skill centers (decide on
       government vs. private centers needed for this expansion).
(iii) Facilitating Convergence of Private Sector in Skills Training
Non-state players (or the private sector) typically play one of three roles in the skilling space:
                                                                                                     43
  a) That of a training provider, which primarily focus on mobilization, trainer capacity creation,
     content creation and implementation of training programs;
  b) That of an enabler, like a public sector undertaking or a Foundation, whic provides financial
     assistance to training providers or students, and support for evaluation, market linkages,
     apprenticeships, advocacy, infrastructure and placement;
  c) That of a hybrid, which acts as both a training provider, managing implementation, and as an
     enabler supporting evaluation, infrastructure and placements.

Corporates contribute in multiple ways to the skilling agenda in India. Figure 4.3 below provides
a framework capturing the key pillars of engagement used for the private sector.


      Figure 4:3: Framework for Corporate Engagement in Skill Development in India




Different skills, trades and job roles require different kinds of engagement with industry. For
example, an ordinary gas welder for the SME sector will require minimal intervention with basic
training aids to support the learning; however, when the same welder moves up the value chain to be
trained in arc welding or in an even more complex skill of deep sea welding for the oil exploration
industry, the pedagogy as well as training aids will need refinement and be best provided by the
industry.


In order to engage with industry in the most impactful manner, the government will need to prioritize
those skills and job roles for which industry engagement is critical and design targeted intervention
models. Incentives, both financial and non-financial, will form a big part of this collaboration.
Financial incentives could be in the form of investments in infrastructure, operational expenses like
fees to trainers and expendables, tax holidays and other subsidies; non-financial incentives could
include accessibility to good quality trainers and assessors.


                                                                                                  44
There is significant scope to bring corporates into the fold to improve the relevance and viability of
private skilling players. Indian corporates have donated approximately $0.5 – 0.6 Billion 61 in
2013 62 (majority from some big names like Reliance, TATA, ITC, ONGC etc.), and of the top 100
donors, 44 percent support skill development and about 80 percent of those donate to NGOs to ensure
on-ground implementation. 63 If this money could be pooled and pushed towards developing
innovative and scalable resource-optimized models of skilling, the impact would be much more
pronounced.


(iv) Identifying and Scaling Innovative Models
About 8-10 models (suggested by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and select
Foundations) were studied in detail to understand operating models and cost structures. Each model
seeks to mitigate challenges in a particular area. For example, to improve content and create effective
classroom formats for pedagogy, training providers like I-Saksham and LabourNet are producing
digital content and interactive Learning Kits, a GTT-Cisco collaboration 64 is facilitating technology
enabled training with two way video and voice communication, and Skillveri is installing simulators
to increase accuracy and reduce costs over time.


Multiple innovative models are underway in States, particularly by corporates and private
training providers but none at scale yet. A 3 step process to identify and scale innovative models
at State level is provided below.


Step 1: Design district-level skill gap studies and identify existing innovative models which could
support district-level gaps


Step 2: Take a deep dive into the details of the model and the resources needed to scale (costs,
staffing etc.). For the models studied, tentative costs have been provided in the Table 4.1 below.
These costs have been derived based on discussions with training providers, corporates and other
key stakeholders.


Step 3: Design implementation plans and create buy-in of all stakeholders

One of the most efficient and effective ways of reaching inaccessible areas while reducing set-up
and implementation costs, is through technology enabled learning. The Indian masses are still
warming up to the idea of learning through technology, particularly in the higher education and
vocational space, but the proportion of those willing to do so is steadily increasing. In higher
education, for example, Indian enrollments account for about 8 percent of worldwide activity in
Coursera and 12 percent in edX, the two leading providers of massive open online courses
(MOOCs). Even India’s own top-tier technical universities have created free videotaped lectures of
more than 700 courses, particularly for students at regional colleges.


In the vocational space, there is much scope for expansion using technology tools. While some
models are already being tried out (for example, the recent AISECT and ALISON collaboration), 65
impact and success is yet to be measured for blue collar jobs. Given the existing appetite in the



65 AISECT, has partnered with online learning platform, ALISON, to provide skills-based learning to
rural and semi-urban populations. Under the partnership, ALISON (already with a 500,000 Indian
student user base) and AISECT will provide a free e-learning platform to students offering
internationally recognized vocational courses, which will be free of charge and open to all.

Annex 6:        Global best practices and scaling them in India

Globally, many techniques in skill development have been tried and tested. Some have stood the test
of time and have consistently shown results superior to those achieved by other means. Below are
some such models from which lessons can be learned and then adapted and replicated in the Indian
context.


We have considered three key areas of innovation when benchmarking – increasing apprenticeships
and industry participation, leveraging technology for providing training and short term trainings
provided at the last mile i.e. at the grassroots level. For each of these, we have provided a short
description on how it is currently implemented in the country, followed by identifying key aspects
of innovation and finally providing some suggestions on what it would take to replicate these models
in India.

                             successfully completing their apprenticeships. 50-60 percent of
                             apprentices stay on with the company they originally trained with – as
                             against 1.94 percent in India.
                         •   Company trainers teach trainees three to four days per week, while
                             vocational school trainers teach them for one to two days.
                         •   Blue-collar jobs (i.e. construction, manufacturing, mechanics, and
                             automotive) are traditionally the most high in demand industries
                         •   Private worker unions have good relations with the companies which
                             have ensured relatively high wages for blue collar jobs – this attracts
                             educated Germans who might otherwise have opted for more
                             professional jobs – and also increases the "skills premium" for blue-
                             collar skills.

                         •   Costs private industry roughly 15 billion Euros a year - however a high
                             youth employment rate and productivity makes up for these costs. The
                             Government spends a third of this cost at about 5 billion Euros.

                         Aspects of Innovation
                         •   Convergence of stakeholders: Companies, trade unions, and the
                             Government collectively draw up uniform qualification standards, exam
                             requirements, content guidelines, and other regulations for
                             apprenticeship – increasing ownership of all parties.
                         •   Convergence of funds: Government funds training at the vocational
                             school while the private sector bears majority of costs
                         •   Built in "trainer" model optimizing on infrastructure, time, funding: For
                             apprentices interested in becoming trainers, the same program doubles
                             up with additional teacher training modules

South Korea 69           Background
                         •   Similar to Germany, South Korea has a dual system of Government run
                             “Meister Schools” and private junior training colleges. Meister schools
                             primarily teach secondary school graduates (in ship building mechanical
                             engineering, semiconductor manufacturing etc.)
                         •   Over 80 percent of junior college graduates find employment after
                             finishing their combined school-apprenticeship work
                         Aspects of Innovation
                         •   Convergence of stakeholders: Industry works closely with many Meister
                             schools providing equipment, facilities, scholarships, mentoring and
                             work placement opportunities; KRIVET, a government supported
                             research center helped design the curriculum of the schools in
                             collaboration with multiple industry partners
                         •   Convergence of funds: Meister schools receive more funding from the
                             Government than most other schools, the Government also partially
                             covers the overall costs of workplace training and specialized equipment
                             at private junior colleges. The balance is paid by the employer.

Japan 70                 Background
                         •   Around 290,000 trainees put in private industry workplaces each year,
                             split into regular vocational training and "Kosen" colleges
                         •   Kosen, a hybrid between high school and university, established in
                             response to a strong demand for engineers, 5-6 year training with 4th
                             year spent at a private company
                         Aspects of Innovation
                         •   Convergence of stakeholders: Strong industry involvement in
                             curriculum design, assessment, knowledge sharing and research both in
                             Kosen and regular vocational training, use of industry’s full time
                             employees as trainers
                         •   Convergence of funds: Government funds Kosen (80 percent of the cost)
                             through subsidies, balance by private sector

Australia 71             Background
                         •   41 percent of secondary school graduates take on vocational routes
                         •   30 percent of all Australian employers offer apprenticeships with about
                             470,000 apprentices in-training (in 2012). Completion rates hover
                             between 50-60%. Service sector occupations are very popular.
                         •   Australian Government provides multiple forms of financial support –
                             (a) wage subsidies given to disadvantaged groups like disabled,
                             Australian Aborigines; (b) incentives to private companies in the form
                             of payments for apprentices – 2/3rd of payment made on completion of
                             program; (c) 1/3rd of all Government funding goes to private companies
                             working in areas with skill shortages
                         •   Non -financial support is provided by "Group Thinking Organisations"
                             and a network of Australian Apprenticeship centers across the country
                             which refer prospective apprentices to employers.
                         •   Finally for MSMEs, which cannot afford apprentices in a stand-alone
                             manner, groups are made and apprentices rotated within to optimize on
                             costs and other resources.

A6.1 Increasing Apprenticeships and Industry Participation

                    Aspects of Innovation
                    •    Similar to other models on convergence of stakeholders and funds

How can these be     •   Given that only 3 percent of the Indian labor force goes through
replicated in India?     apprenticeships annually, i.e. approximately 300,000 of a 12 Million
                         total labor force, apprenticeships are the need of the hour particularly
                         for the MSME sector catering to over 93 percent of the labor (informal)
                    •    Like in Australia, the Government could select 2-3 high growth sectors
                         in manufacturing (e.g. from Make in India) and incentivize industry
                         partners together with Sector Skill Councils to hire apprentices (similar
                         to interns in private companies) based on their own requirements as long
                         as certain minimum qualifications are met (these could be collectively
                         designed by MSDE and SSCs)
                    •    Like in Germany, an arrangement can be worked out where 1-2
                         days/week are spent in pre-selected ITIs/ITCs and the remaining time
                         spent in the company – giving the trainee a good mix of theory and
                         practical and keeping their skills market relevant for employment post
                         completion of the apprenticeship.
                    •    Like in Korea and Japan, some of the existing ITIs (near industry
                         clusters and catchment areas) could be converted to world class skill
                         centers (much like the Meister schools and Kosens) with foreign and
                         key industry collaboration
                    •    Apprenticeship Centers could be set up (similar to Australia) which
                         could map prospective apprentices to employers – an Aggregator
                         Platform or MIS at the MSDE level could facilitate this
                    •    MSME clusters which exist in India
                         (http://www.clusterobservatory.in/clustermap.php#) could be grouped
                         to provide combined apprentices who could be rotated internally.

Japan 72                 Background
                         •   Kosens promote technology based education and training (i.e. IT,
                             engineering/manufacturing, biotechnology/materials science as well as
                             technological skills such as metalworking, technical operating of
                             machinery etc.)
                         •   Japan has a high focus on technology industries and therefore, related
                             trainings begin through dedicated hours in the school education system
                             (secondary level)
                         Aspects of Innovation
                         •   Convergence on content: Industry and Government together develop
                             technology enabled content for multiple courses/skills especially for
                             chemical, mechanical and electric engineering.
                         •   Convergence of stakeholders: Firms and Kosens collaborate to ensure
                             that programs and trainers are up-to-date with constantly-changing
                             industry requirements.

South Korea 73           Background
                         •   Technical schools, junior and polytechnic colleges provide
                             technological training overseen by the Ministry of Education, Science
                             and Technology – with a heavy focus on manufacturing occupations,
                             thus industrial machinery (e.g. mechanical tools, welding machines) is
                             often utilized along with technology related trainings
                         Aspects of Innovation
                         •   Convergence of infrastructure: Universities with focus on Science,
                             Technology, Engineering, and Math act as hubs and spokes are technical
                             schools, thereby leveraging existing land/buildings. Support centers are
                             set up in existing private industrial zones to serve as on-site experience
                             for trainees in the technical schools
                         •   Convergence of stakeholders: Given that industry is most updated with
                             new technological innovations, sometimes companies use their own

                         employees to train the trainees and certain private firms offer specialized
                         trainings in technological training (e.g. a training program on using
                         welding machines)

How can these be     •   Leveraging technology for enabling training will serve two purposes in
replicated in India?     the Indian context: (a) it can be used to create access in hard to reach
                         destinations using a hub and spoke model and (b) it will help trainees be
                         updated on new technologies in the market which could result in higher
                         chances of employment

                    •    The Government could identify high growth technology based
                         sectors/trades (aligned to Digital India) and create content to facilitate
                         trainings together with identifying geographies (mapped to economic
                         zones) and industries which could support in this (through on-site
                         training and content development)

                    •    Hubs and spokes will need to be identified for optimizing on
                         infrastructure      since      hubs     like      engineering      colleges,
                         institutes/universities of technical education (like IITs, NITs) etc. would
                         already have computer labs to stream these trainings and trainers trained
                         on providing one and two way trainings to trainees in spokes

                    •    Based on geographies, trades taught through this medium and other such
                         parameters, funding may need to be provided for capex and opex.

A6.3 Grassroots Training To Increase Accessibility of Skill Development

Australia 74                Background
                            •   Christian colleges and churches provide grassroots trainings through
                                accredited training programs developed by Government and local
                                communities
                            •   Colleges are bound together in Australian College of Ministries training
                                network and their training courses are nationally-accredited
                            •   Typically offers training to local people who either cannot or are
                                unwilling to join the joint government-private apprenticeship system
                            •   Focus is on group training - group studies, practical skills exercises,
                                group discussions etc. – and can be finished in 1-year of full-time work
                                or in 2 years or more of part-time work. On completion, college awards
                                certificates which are nationally recognized.
                            Aspects of Innovation
                            •   Convergence of infrastructure: Colleges and Churches in local areas
                            •   Use of technology: Handbooks, notes, and other relevant course material
                                accessible online
                            •   Convergence of trainers: Separate guidelines for trainers based on
                                locality needs but some basic common norms (e.g., should be IT literate,
                                know adult teaching techniques etc.). Trainers are fungible and can
                                move between colleges.

How can this be      •          Given the large magnitude of Indian populations which are in rural
replicated in India?            settings and the large network of existing infrastructure available (both
                                public and private), reaching the grassroots level is critical and possible.

                                infrastructure (schools, community centers, colleges etc.) will need to

                                by States and proximity to economic zones and should be a decision
                                taken at the SSDM/State Government level).

A6.4 Summary Takeaways for Indian Government

While we have laid out specific ways in which each of the models above can be replicated in India,
below we present a few key takeaways from the studied global best practices for the Indian
Government (and other stakeholders) which are broad based and will facilitate impactful demand-
supply interactions – some of these have been covered in the main report as well.

A6.4.1 Recognize critical role of industry, identify skills in which they can have the most
       impact and create targeted incentives to increase their engagement

Different skills, trades and job roles require different and varying levels and types of engagement by
industry. For example, an ordinary gas welder for the SME sector will require minimal intervention
with basic training aids to support the learning; however, when the same welder moves up the value
chain to be skilled on arc welding or a more complex skill of deep sea welding for the oil exploration
industry, the pedagogy as well as training aids will need refinement which is best provided by
industry.


In order to engage with industry in the most impactful manner, the Government (MSDE) will need
to prioritize those skills and job roles for which industry engagement is critical and design targeted
intervention models. Incentives, both financial and non-financial, will form a big part of this
collaboration. Financial incentives could be in the form of investments in infrastructure, operational
expenses like fees to trainers and expendables, tax holidays and other subsidies and some forms of
non-financial incentives could include accessibility to good quality trainers and assessors.

A6.4.2 Raise aspiration for vocational education and apprenticeships among trainees and
       prospective employers

Currently, perhaps due to cultural and economic reasons, vocational education and training in India
is perceived to be a "last resort" option. Low wage premium attached to job roles post vocational
training also adds to this perception. In order to raise aspirations for vocational training, it is critical
to put policies in place and increase communication around the relevance and value (both intrinsic
and external) of such training.


In order to operationalize this, a major step can be to provide social respectability to skill training by
providing an educational equivalence to certification of skills at various levels of the NSQF – in line
with global best practices. In addition, if avenues are provided for equity in qualifications which can
facilitate international placements of skilled workers from India, the respectability and the economic
stature of such skills will enhance (also aligned with the overseas employment sub mission). Case to
point is the nursing profession in India which received a fillip due to international recognition of
nurses being trained in the Indian system.

                                                                                                         77
A6.4.3 Promote incentives for workforce certification

Global best practices indicate that while industry plays a seminal role in quality assuring skilling
initiatives, they are also expected to place a premium on certified skilled workers. This premium
could be in the form of giving preference to certified workers over others for employment or
providing higher wages to those with certification over others for the same job roles.


Similar initiatives can be planned by the Government in consultation with the industry.

A6.4.4 Prioritize technology enabled learning and create platforms to enable scale

Explained in detail in Chapter 4 (page 60).

A6.4.5 Create rosters and exchange platforms for critical assets like trainers, assessors,
       content etc.

There is currently a large gap in quantitative capacity of critical assets in the vocational training
segment – from content, training aids etc. to actual delivery agents like trainers and assessors. To
put this in perspective, in the Government run Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) alone there is a
need for 20,000 75 instructors to annually join the sector – four times more than the current 5,000 76
who are new entrants.


While building such capacity through increased trainings and content creation is important, it will
take time. In the near term, it becomes equally important is to optimize on the existing asset base and
provide opportunities for exchange of such resources (sometime idle) among stakeholders. For
example, in the Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Vocationalization of Secondary Education , the
paucity of vocational trainers in the government school system across most states was offset by
utilizing private trainers from the NSDC ecosystem (i.e. from the existing database of training
partners). A roster for trainers, assessors etc. at the MSDE level will create a marketplace and allow
for transferability of resources for optimal utilization as well as capacity utilization.
