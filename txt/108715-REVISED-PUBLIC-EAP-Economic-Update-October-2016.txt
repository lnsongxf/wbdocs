REDUCING VULNERABILITIES




Executive Summary

In the six months since the previous East Asia and Pacific Economic Update, developing East Asia and
Pacific (EAP) has faced a mixed external environment. Momentum in advanced economies continues to be
generally sluggish, and growth in most emerging market and developing economies remains subdued. Global
trade continues to stagnate, while commodity prices have stabilized at historically low levels. At the same time,
external financial conditions are more accommodative and stable than was projected in April. Advanced economy
central banks have maintained loose monetary conditions or, as in Japan and the United Kingdom, engaged in
further easing. Capital flows, exchange rates, and bond spreads across most of the region have steadied, following
several bouts of market volatility, including soon after the U.K. Brexit vote.

Growth in developing EAP was broadly stable in the first half of 2016, in line with our projections in
April. Weak external demand was largely offset by robust domestic demand, supported by the stabilizing external
financial conditions and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. Developing EAP continues to perform well
relative to other developing regions. And, adopting a longer perspective, growth in the region has been particularly
resilient since the global financial crisis. Budget deficits have increased across much of the region, largely reflecting
increased public expenditure, which is being used partly to scale up investment but also to meet growing current
expenses. Inflation remains muted across most of the region.

Growth in the region is expected to remain resilient during 2016–18, with some differences across
countries. This outlook is in line with what was projected last April, and remains more positive than in most other
developing regions. China is expected to continue its gradual transition to slower but more sustainable growth. In
most of the large Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies, growth will likely pick up slightly.
Across most countries, the impact of weak external demand is expected to be offset by continued domestic demand
growth. Favorable external financing conditions will be complemented by monetary and fiscal accommodation,
with budget deficits projected to increase across much of the region. Continued low commodity prices will support
domestic demand in the commodity importers, and contribute to a muted outlook for inflation across the region.

In China, growth is likely to continue easing steadily to 6.3 percent in 2018. The ongoing reform process
seeks to facilitate the rebalancing of the economy toward consumption, services, and higher-value-added activities
as part of a program to increase overall productivity. Output growth will moderate as excess industrial capacity
is reduced, including by slowing the growth in credit to these sectors. Nevertheless, tightening labor markets will
support continued growth in disposable income and private consumption.

Among other large economies, growth prospects are strongest in the commodity importers. In the
Philippines, growth will likely accelerate, reflecting fiscal stimulus, rising public investment, and strong growth
in services (business process outsourcing). In Vietnam, growth will fall in 2016, owing to the temporary effects
of the severe drought on agricultural output, but will then recover. In Indonesia, growth will increase steadily,
despite low commodity prices, conditional on a pick-up in public investment and the success of efforts to improve
the investment climate and increase revenues. In Thailand, growth will recover gradually, reflecting the effects
of increased public investment, improving consumer confidence, and continued expansion in services including

tourism. In Malaysia, however, growth will fall sharply in 2016, as oil and manufactured exports are affected by
weaker global demand, with a gradual recovery thereafter.

Among the smaller economies, the growth outlook has deteriorated markedly in some commodity
exporters. Mongolia is projected to stagnate in 2016, despite a large fiscal stimulus, as mineral exports weaken.
Efforts to control the ballooning debt will act as a drag on growth in subsequent years. In Papua New Guinea,
growth will fall sharply: production of copper is declining, the output of liquefied natural gas has reached a
peak, and prices of both remain depressed. In contrast, growth will remain buoyant in Cambodia, assuming that
garment exporters face off competitive threats from other low-cost producers; Lao PDR, as power exports continue
expanding; and Myanmar, supported by increased investment and strong growth in transportation, banking, and
telecommunications. The outlook for the small Pacific Island Countries will rely significantly on the development of
regional fisheries and growth in tourism, but they remain vulnerable to risks arising from natural disasters, climate
change, and terms-of-trade shocks.

Poverty in the region has declined rapidly in recent years, and is projected to fall further with continued
growth; however, there remain significant challenges to inclusiveness. In 2015, the share of the region’s
population living in poverty fell to 2.6 percent (or, excluding China, to 5.6 percent), from approximately 18 percent
a decade earlier, reflecting continued rapid growth. Poverty fell most sharply in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia,
but has also decreased appreciably in Indonesia and Lao PDR. Still, there remain large numbers of increasingly
hard-to-reach poor in middle-income China, Indonesia, and the Philippines. And, in countries such as Vietnam,
even though poverty has been almost eliminated, disadvantaged groups such as ethnic minorities are lagging
behind by an often increasing margin.

The positive outlook for growth and poverty reduction in the region in this base case is subject to
significant risks. A sharp global financial tightening, stemming from a more rapid-than-expected normalization
of monetary policy in the United States, or rising global risk aversion, would be associated with reduced capital
inflows, U.S. dollar appreciation against regional currencies, and likely with increased financial volatility. As a
result, debt-service burdens and debt-rollover risks would increase, especially for the large, financially integrated
regional economies with sizable external, foreign-currency-denominated, and/or short-term debt, most notably
Indonesia, Malaysia and, to a lesser degree, Thailand. In addition, growth fluctuations in high-income economies
would have a significant impact on output in the more open regional economies. The ongoing slowdown and
rebalancing process in China remains an important short-term risk to growth in the rest of the region, although
over the longer term China’s rebalancing will also generate opportunities for other countries. Rapidly rising levels
of credit are an additional source of vulnerability across most large economies, most notably China, Malaysia, and
Thailand. There is a growing risk of financial stress among corporates and households, which could spill over to the
banking sector and lead to protracted slowdowns. Shocks to external financial conditions or to global growth would
exacerbate these existing financial vulnerabilities.

Subdued global prospects make it critical for policy makers to address underlying financial and fiscal
vulnerabilities, and to maintain fiscal space. The deteriorating outlook in high-income economies will have
a persistent effect on regional exports, depressed world commodity prices will intensify challenges in commodity
exporters, and significant risks to global activity could spill over into the region. At the same time, unexpectedly
accommodative global financial conditions are temporarily extending the window of opportunity to address

regional vulnerabilities. Against this backdrop, preserving macrofinancial stability, by reducing financial and fiscal
imbalances that have built up in recent years, is critical to maintaining the region’s resilience.

China would need to advance reforms in the corporate sector, measures to bring credit growth under
control, and efforts to strengthen the intergovernmental fiscal system. Reforms to address excess industrial
capacity have been initiated, and could usefully be accelerated and deepened. The continued rapid expansion
of credit to state-owned enterprises has increased macroeconomic risks with steadily decreasing returns. Recent
measures to strengthen financial regulations, including those pertaining to shadow banking activities such as
wealth management products and peer-to-peer lending, should also be expanded. Household credit has been
rising rapidly, aided by a loosening of prudential policies, particularly for first-time homebuyers, and needs to
be managed carefully. As the economy rebalances, lower public investment growth at the subnational level could
facilitate efforts to strengthen the responsibility and capacity of local governments to manage debt, including
contingent liabilities from off-budget activities.

Among the other large economies, where private sector credit has grown rapidly, or where external debt is
large, the build-up of risk can be reduced through enhanced microprudential regulation and increased use
of macroprudential policies. In Malaysia and Thailand, leverage has reached significant levels, including through
sharp increases in household debt; in the Philippines and Vietnam, debt continues to grow rapidly. Risks are
heightened by the potential for significant external shocks, and by the sizable foreign-currency-denominated debt
and short-term external financing requirements, including foreign liabilities of the banking sector, in Malaysia
and Indonesia. In several countries, including the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, there is significant scope
to strengthen regulatory oversight and microprudential risk management. Enhanced macroprudential regulation
would also help mitigate the risks to financial stability from leverage, including among households. Countries with
a significant nonbank financial sector, including Thailand, should step up its regulatory oversight and supervision.

Across the region, and especially among commodity producers, maintaining fiscal buffers in the context of
a robust medium-term fiscal framework should receive priority over countercyclical stabilization efforts,
especially given the continued resilience of regional growth. Countries across the region must preserve room
for fiscal manoeuver should risks, including due to deterioration in the external environment, materialize. In this
context, broadening revenue sources remains a priority for most countries. Revenue constraints are particularly
binding for commodity producers, where low commodity prices have already had a significant impact on public
revenue, and which need to reduce their reliance on commodity-related fiscal revenues. Continued low world
energy prices also extend the window of opportunity for countries to reform energy pricing policies, including by
cutting remaining energy and fertilizer subsidies, increasing fuel taxes, and moving toward greater cost recovery in
electricity. That said, among noncommodity producers, and in particular Cambodia, the Philippines, and Thailand,
the risks associated with a limited widening of the deficit should prove manageable, as long as this expansion
finances efficient efforts to build up the economy’s long-term productive capacity.

Fiscal deficits pose a risk to sustainability in some regional economies, primarily commodity producers,
and substantial consolidation is needed. In Mongolia, large fiscal imbalances have emerged, and public debt
is set to rise rapidly in the coming years in the absence of adjustment. The announced measures to contain
expenditure need to be significantly strengthened and domestic revenue sources broadened. In Timor-Leste, the
emergence of large structural deficits demands efforts to prioritize the use of sovereign wealth fund assets to

finance essential investments that raise domestic supply potential and support diversification efforts. In these and
other resource-rich economies, the use of sovereign wealth funds can support short-term expenditure stabilization
and long-term fiscal sustainability, provided that the funds’ operational rules are simple, transparent, and allow
only limited discretion. In Vietnam, elevated debt levels, and the contingent liabilities associated with banking
sector recapitalization, also call for fiscal reforms to stabilize public finances.

 he longer-term challenge across the region is to achieve faster, more inclusive growth. While priorities will
T
necessarily be country specific, some are important across the region.

In China, the commitment to facilitate the rebalancing from investment-led to consumption-led growth,
as part of a program to increase overall productivity, needs to be complemented by continued efforts to
reduce poverty and promote inclusion. The role of market discipline in allocating resources and credit should
be enhanced to ensure that resources are allocated toward the most productive uses, including through financial
sector reforms. Despite China’s success in reducing poverty, a large share of its population remains vulnerable
to poverty, and significant rural-urban gaps in income and basic public services persist. Tackling this will require
improvements in access to services for the rural population, and for the still growing number of migrants to the
cities.

Across the rest of the region, more and better infrastructure holds the potential to promote domestic and
international connectivity, facilitate integration into regional value chains and the shift to higher-value-
added activities, and ensure gains from continued urbanization. Most of the region, and in particular Indonesia,
the Philippines, and Vietnam, suffers from significant infrastructure gaps across all sectors. A rebalancing of
public expenditure, and greater public-private cooperation, will help address infrastructure deficits. But increased
infrastructure expenditure must be accompanied by reforms to improve the efficiency of public investment
management, including developing and entrenching rigorous, transparent, and accountable processes for project
selection, appraisal, procurement, and evaluation, and for the efficient operation and sustained maintenance of
assets once these are in place.

S
 uch efforts to enhance productivity must be complemented by a renewed focus on boosting inclusion. Research
highlights the importance of three issues.

First, undernutrition leads to lifelong disadvantage; reducing it would significantly increase human
welfare, promote inclusion, and foster growth in much of developing EAP. Despite the economic success
of the region, high levels of undernutrition persist in many countries, even relatively affluent ones. Infant and
child undernutrition, in particular, generate health and cognitive deficits that are difficult to reverse. Addressing
the problem will require coordinated measures across a range of areas. Particular promise attaches to early
childhood development programs, including behavior change and communication interventions to ensure optimal
nutrition and care during pregnancy and early childhood, micronutrient interventions and deworming to enhance
the consumption of essential vitamins and minerals, and complementary feeding interventions to reduce acute
malnutrition.

Second, technological developments hold great promise for transforming financial services across low- and
middle-income economies, with significant implications for financial inclusion and productivity. Digital

REDUCING VULNERABILITIES




technologies accessed via mobile platforms, big data, and cloud computing are enabling the rapid emergence
of new financial products and business models, including crowdfunding and mobile payments. Developing EAP
is well placed to benefit from such developments. The region is technologically advanced, with a high level of
mobile phone penetration, but lags in terms of access to financial services, raising the economic and social payoff
to successful innovation. To realize these opportunities, countries will need to strengthen the relevant legal and
regulatory frameworks; improve their financial infrastructure, including the breadth and depth of borrower credit
data; and address challenges related to financial capability, consumer protection, and privacy.

Third, innovations in social protection can significantly reduce vulnerability to shocks and minimize
their long-run impact among the poor. In the face of major shocks, the poor and vulnerable often have to
cut their spending on education and health care or sell productive assets, with a permanent impact on their
human development and income-earning potential. Natural disasters are a particular concern, both because of
their relative frequency in the region, and because the poor often live in vulnerable areas. Policy makers should
therefore build on ongoing efforts to develop “adaptive safety nets”. These systems flexibly take into account the
exposure of households to different risks by, for instance, rapidly expanding conditional cash transfer programs
while waiving their conditions in the wake of natural disasters. In turn, these features help increase resilience at
both the household and macroeconomic levels.

The long-term outlook for growth and inclusion in the Pacific Island Countries hinges on their ability to
maximize the benefits from their limited opportunities, including fisheries, migrant workers, and tourism.
Three priorities stand out. First, recent policy measures have already sharply increased revenue from tuna fishing
fees and enhanced sustainability. Further reforms could yield significant additional revenue gains, but need to
be underpinned by improvements in the capacity of the agencies that regulate tuna fishing, including through
expanded staffing, training, and partnerships with regional and international organizations. Second, to expand
opportunities for residents to work abroad, policy must focus on providing potential migrants with marketable
skills, offering better employment intermediation services to both workers and employers, and introducing social
support services to mitigate the impact of the temporary separation of family members. Finally, the tourism
sector, currently reliant on its traditional Australian and New Zealand markets, could be significantly boosted by
improvements in connections and facilities to serve the potentially much larger East Asian market.

I.A.	 Recent Developments
        In the six months since the previous East Asia and Pacific Economic Update, developing East Asia
        and Pacific has faced a mixed external environment. Momentum in advanced economies continues to
        be generally sluggish. At the same time, external financial conditions are more accommodative and
        stable than was previously projected. Capital flows, exchange rates, and bond spreads across most
        of the region have steadied, following several bouts of market volatility, including soon after the U.K.
        Brexit vote. Overall, growth in developing East Asia and Pacific has proved resilient, in line with our
        projections in April, and remains high relative to other developing regions. Weak external demand was
        largely offset by robust domestic demand, supported by the stabilizing external financial conditions and
        accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. Budget deficits have increased across much of the region,
        largely reflecting increased public expenditure, which is being used partly to scale up investment but
        also to meet growing current expenses.

Global growth continued to disappoint in 2016. Momentum in advanced economies has continued to be
generally sluggish since April, reflecting softer-than-expected second quarter (Q2) growth, particularly in the
United States (Box I.A.1). Growth in most emerging market and developing economies remains subdued, and
many large natural resource exporters face continued falls in output. Global trade continues to stagnate, while
commodity prices have stabilized at historically low levels, with oil, food, and nonenergy commodity indexes all
lower than was expected in April.

External financial conditions have stabilized. Financial conditions are more accommodative and stable than
was projected in April. Advanced economy central banks have maintained loose monetary conditions or, as in Japan
and the United Kingdom, engaged in further easing, as weaker growth expectations have become entrenched.
Capital flows, exchange rates, and bond spreads across most of the region have steadied, following several bouts
of market volatility, including soon after the U.K. Brexit vote.

Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) was broadly stable in the first half of 2016, in line
with our projections in April, as weak external demand was largely offset by robust domestic demand.
China continued its gradual transition toward slower but more sustainable growth, with policy stimulus helping to
support activity (Figure I.A.1). In the rest of the region, growth was on average stable. Developing EAP continues to
perform well relative to other developing regions. Adopting a longer perspective, growth in the region has proved
particularly resilient since the global financial crisis (Box I.A.1), and developing EAP has maintained its long track
record of remarkable success in reducing poverty (Box I.A.2).

However, performance varied across the large economies other than China. In Thailand, growth has
quickened in the first two quarters, as strengthening private and public consumption, a scaling-up of public
investment, and buoyant tourism offset slowing manufactured exports (Figure I.A.2). The Philippines registered

    Box I.A.1. Recent Global Developments

    Global growth continued to disappoint in 2016. Global growth in the second quarter of 2016 remained
    below the already subdued postcrisis average of 2.5 percent for the third consecutive quarter (Figure BI.A.1.1).
    Conditions in advanced economies have on average deteriorated since April, reflecting softer-than-expected
    second quarter growth, particularly in the United States. Nevertheless, U.S. labor markets have remained
    resilient; unemployment is falling in the euro area, albeit from elevated levels, and with significant variations
    across countries; and there is little labor market slack in Japan. The uncertainty associated with the U.K.
    Brexit vote in late June has been reflected in a significant deterioration in key economic indicators in the
    United Kingdom, but global financial market repercussions and confidence spillovers to the euro area have
    so far been limited.

    amid low inflation. For instance, growth in India remains robust, as the government continues to implement
    reforms. Relatedly, activity is relatively weak in commodity-dependent regions, notably Latin America and the
    Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa, but remains dynamic in commodity-
    importing South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific (Figure BI.A.1.2). Adopting a longer perspective,

     Global trade continues to stagnate. Global trade growth was subdued in 2015 for the fifth consecutive
     year, and proved particularly weak in the first half of 2016 (Figure BI.A.1.4). Global goods trade volumes
     contracted in the first quarter and stagnated in the second quarter, driven by weak import demand in
     advanced economies and major EMDE commodity exporters. These developments were compounded by
     longer-term structural factors, including the transition to slower and more domestically oriented growth
     in China, a slower pace of trade liberalization, and a maturing of global value chains. In contrast, import
     demand from commodity-importing and manufacturing-focused EMDEs in Asia (excluding China) and
     Central and Eastern Europe remained robust.

     Commodity prices have stabilized at historically low levels. Crude oil prices recovered to US$45 per
     barrel in July (a 51 percent year-to-date increase), but remain almost one-quarter below their April 2015
     level (Figure BI.A.1.5), as well as the year-average levels forecast in April. Global oil inventories remain
     high and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), including Saudi Arabia, continues
     to produce at record levels. However, the oil market is gradually rebalancing as consumption strengthens
     and non-OPEC supply shrinks, notably in the United States, where oil output is down 11 percent from its
     peak in 2015. Metals prices, still recovering from steep falls in the second half of 2015, have increased by
     12 percent since January on stronger demand, production cuts, and continued inventory declines.
     Global financial conditions are more accommodative than was projected in April. Global long-term
     interest rates reached historically low levels during the summer of 2016, amid deteriorating growth prospects
     in advanced economies and expectations of continued monetary policy accommodation by major central
     banks. The decrease in yields was visible across most advanced economies, and was particularly pronounced
     in the United Kingdom, following the unexpected Brexit vote in June and a package of monetary easing
     measures announced in August. Falling long-term rates in advanced economies renewed the appetite for
     riskier, previously underperforming emerging-market assets.
     Capital flows to EMDEs and local asset prices have steadied, reflecting global financial accommodation
     and the observed stabilization in commodity prices. Financial conditions in EMDEs improved in July
     and August, following net capital outflows in 2015 and several bouts of market volatility at the start of
     2016 and around the time of the Brexit vote. The MSCI Emerging Market stock index is 32 percent above
     its January 2016 low, and 15 percent above its immediate post-Brexit level (Figure BI.A.1.6). Emerging

      International bond issuance by EMDEs for the year through August is 16 percent higher than in
      2015,  at US$234 billion, reflecting an increasing number of first-time issuers, and the pace has accelerated
      in recent months. In particular, bond issuance picked up in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle
      East and North Africa, more than offsetting a substantial decline in East Asia and Pacific (driven by China,
      Indonesia, and Malaysia). However, the credit ratings of major EMDEs continue to deteriorate, in line with
      their fiscal conditions. Credit downgrades, including of Turkey, are significantly outnumbering upgrades;
      and Colombia, Poland, South Africa, and to a lesser extent Mexico and Brazil, are all facing downgrade
      pressure to varying degrees.

employment was 3.8 percent lower than the previous year,1 as publicly financed construction activity has been
hit by cash shortages. However, non-commodity-dependent economies remain buoyant. Cambodia continued to

Net export demand weakened across the region

Across most large economies, weak external demand was largely offset by robust domestic demand               (Figure
I.A.4). Subdued global activity fed through to slackening regional exports. In China, the contribution of net exports
to growth has been decreasing over time, and became appreciably negative in the first half of 2016 (Figure I.A.5).
Net export demand was stagnant in Indonesia and dropped in Malaysia, reflecting weak growth or contractions in
exports. In the Philippines, net export demand was already shrinking in 2015 and fell further in 2016, as export
growth slowed and strong domestic demand drove up imports. Net export demand, in contrast, continued to
expand in Thailand, reflecting buoyant tourism and shrinking imports.

Export volume growth has been slowing, or turned negative, across much of the region. Export performance
was weaker than expected in April 2016, reflecting subdued activity in high-income economies. In China, exports
of goods began falling in 2015, although with a partial recovery in 2016 (Figure I.A.6). In Indonesia, exports
have been declining sharply since late 2015, reflecting both weaker demand for manufactured exports and lower
commodity exports. That said, in both China and Indonesia exports account for a relatively low share of total
production, mitigating the overall adverse impact. In Thailand, exports of goods continued to decline, reflecting
ongoing competitiveness challenges. Conversely, export volumes have been rising in Malaysia, where growth of
manufactured (and particularly electrical and electronics) exports offset dropping oil and gas shipments. Similarly,
in the Philippines, buoyant exports of electronics, including semiconductors, offset the impact on agricultural
exports of adverse weather and a new phytosanitary
ban on banana exports to China. Export growth,              Figure I.A.6. Export volumes have been declining
while still positive, slowed in Vietnam as oil exports      in several countries

from the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)         125

Export values remain depressed, especially among commodity exporters. Across the larger economies, export
values fell sharply in 2015 and have continued to fall into 2016 in most countries, although they have leveled
off in Thailand (Figure I.A.7). Energy exporters such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, and
Timor-Leste (Figure I.A.8) continue to be affected by depressed prices. These are leading to both sustained losses
in export earnings, and cutbacks in supply volumes. Lao PDR and Mongolia are being affected by depressed prices
for copper and coal.

A significant share of the region’s gross exports serve the regional market, moderating the impact of
weakening activity in advanced economies       (Figure I.A.9). Among high-income economies, Europe accounts for
an important share of exports, and its imports have proved relatively resilient. Domestic demand within the region
has likewise held up (see below), again helping to cushion the impact on manufacturing exports. Data for 2011
indicate that high-income economies account for a large share, and in several cases a majority, of final demand
for exports; however, the role of China and the rest of the region as a source of final demand remains significant
(Figure I.A.10), and is likely to have grown over time.

Domestic demand across much of the region was buoyant, supported by fiscal
stimulus and accommodative monetary policy

Private consumption in the large economies was buoyant in the first half of 2016. Consumption growth
accelerated in the Philippines and especially in Thailand, and remains rapid in both Indonesia and Malaysia. In
China, combined private and public consumption2 contributed more than 5 percentage points to first-half growth,
more than at any stage in 2015 (Figure I.A.4).

Investment is also holding up. In the Philippines, investment growth has steadily accelerated since 2014. In
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, investment is growing at a pace comparable to 2015, although it remains
volatile in Malaysia. In China, the contribution of investment to growth has fallen in 2016 to date compared to the

revenues have declined. Resource revenues have fallen and deficits increased in Myanmar and Papua New Guinea,
as well. In Timor-Leste, a large structural deficit has opened up, as the impact of declining petroleum production
has been compounded by low world energy prices. Deficits have increased to a lesser degree in non-commodity-
dependent Cambodia.

Private sector credit is high and continues to rise rapidly in several economies. Since the global financial
crisis, domestic credit has grown rapidly across most large regional economies, including, in particular, China,
Malaysia, and Thailand (Figure I.A.16). The majority of credit has been supplied by domestic banks, but over time
there has been some diversification toward nonbank financial institutions, cross-border bank lending, issuance
of debt securities,4 and activities in the shadow banking sector.5 Bank credit alone now stands at more than
100 percent of GDP in China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The pace of credit growth has slowed somewhat
over the past year, but without significantly altering the trend (Figure I.A.17). Real credit growth for the year to
date exceeds 15 percent per year in China and Vietnam,6 and has accelerated in the Philippines. Real credit growth
has decreased to 5 percent per year in Malaysia and Thailand where, however, the stock of outstanding credit is
already high, and in Indonesia. In recent years, credit growth has been especially rapid in some smaller economies;
in Cambodia, bank credit has been growing by close to 10 percent of GDP per year since 2011, and in Myanmar
credit is also rising rapidly, albeit from a small base.

The private nonfinancial sector accounts for most debt across the large economies; corporate debt is
particularly significant, but household indebtedness has been rising rapidly. Corporates account for the
bulk of outstanding private sector debt in both China and the ASEAN-4. However, household credit accounts for
the majority of credit expansion over the past five years in the ASEAN-4,7 continues to grow rapidly in China, and
currently represents the majority of private sector debt in both Malaysia and Thailand.


4	        The stock of outstanding corporate bonds in emerging East Asia almost quadrupled between end-2008 and end-2015, to reach US$3.5 trillion (Asian Development Bank 2016).
5	        In China, for instance, overall credit to the economy continued to expand as lending activity migrated to the nonbank system, including a diverse set of institutions and instruments
          comprising wealth management products, trusts, entrusted loans, and informal lending.
6	        In China, credit to both the government and nonfinancial sector has grown twice as fast as the overall economy for the year to date, issuance of bonds by local governments and local
          government financing vehicles has increased rapidly since the second half of 2015, and the outstanding debt stock now exceeds 250 percent of GDP.

          points for nonfinancial corporates, and 1.6 percentage points for government credit.

REDUCING VULNERABILITIES




Inflation has been muted, reflecting sustained low commodity prices

Inflation was muted across most of the region in 2016. In Indonesia, from May onward, consumer price
inflation has been at its lowest levels since 2009, reflecting low world energy prices and a stabilizing exchange
rate. Inflation has also been decreasing in Malaysia (Figure I.A.18), following a peak in February driven by a
rise in electricity tariffs. Inflation remains stable in China. Deflation is subsiding in Thailand, and several other
countries, including the Philippines and Vietnam, which recovered from near-deflation at end-2015. Among the
smaller economies, over the year to date, inflation has remained low and stable in Cambodia and Lao PDR, but
has dropped sharply in Mongolia, as consumer spending has collapsed and policy rates have been hiked. Inflation
picked up sharply in Myanmar in late 2015, and remains elevated, driven by increases in food prices. Producer
price deflation is close to subsiding in the large economies (Figure I.A.19). That said, China has been experiencing
falling producer prices since early 2012, reflecting also an adjustment to overcapacity. While the sharp drops in
regional consumer and producer price inflation through end-2015 partly reflected falling world energy prices, the
latter’s partial recovery in 2016 has not yet led to price increases (Figure I.A.20).

8	        The region has accounted for the bulk of flows into emerging market bond and equity funds in 2016. It has also seen a sharp rise in cross-border bank lending, especially to Chinese
          companies raising funds to finance overseas acquisitions. Partly offsetting this, international bond issuance by developing EAP borrowers for the year through August is approximately
          20 percent lower than in 2015.

their late-2015 lows (Figure I.A.25). However, there has
been little change in trade-weighted nominal or real
exchanges rates (Figure I.A.26), largely reflecting the sharp appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and
regional currencies in 2016. Exceptions include China, which has experienced significant depreciation, and above
all Mongolia, where rapid monetary and fiscal expansion led to a sharp depreciation.

Flows of workers’ remittances to the region have been growing, after flattening or declining in the wake
of the global financial crisis   (Figure I.A.27). This partly reflects the strengthening of labor markets in some
advanced economies. Remittances are of considerable significance to several countries in the region, including, in
particular, small Pacific Island Countries (PICs) such as Samoa and Tonga, as well as the Philippines and Vietnam.9


9	       Remittances amount to more than 20 percent of GDP in Samoa and Tonga, 10 percent of GDP in the Philippines, and 7 percent of GDP in Vietnam.

Recent developments in the Pacific Island Countries

Recent growth in the PICs has been volatile, reflecting their dependence on undiversified income sources
and significant exposure to shocks. Growth in the PICs is both low on average and extremely volatile. In Tonga
and Samoa, GDP growth for the year to date reached around 3 percent, supported by a scaling-up of private sector
investments, including the reconstruction of Tonga’s largest hotel and a new fish processing plant in Samoa.
Economic activity was adversely affected in Vanuatu by an uncertain political environment, and in Fiji by a major
cyclone. In many of the Northern PICs, bumper revenues from regional tuna fisheries (see below) supported
increased public spending. In Nauru, a new member of the World Bank Group, the limited data available suggest an

economic boom during 2011–14, as Australia opened an offshore asylum-seeker processing center and phosphate
mining resumed. Since then, problems with phosphate shipping have negatively affected growth.

Regional fisheries boosted public finances in many PICs in the past year. Record tuna catches delivered
large budget windfalls in Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, and Tuvalu.
Several of these countries placed part of the surpluses into sovereign wealth funds, to finance the budget in future
years. Vanuatu also recorded a large budget surplus in 2015, as political uncertainty delayed implementation
of cyclone recovery and infrastructure projects. And, in Samoa, the budget deficit fell, despite a drop in grants,
as domestic revenues increased and expenditure was contained. In contrast, the budget deficit increased in Fiji,
as the authorities began implementing a cyclone recovery program, and in Tonga, where lower-than-expected
development grants and higher wage spending more than offset higher revenue collection.

Continued low commodity prices have significantly dampened inflation and boosted domestic demand in
the PICs. All the PICs are heavily dependent on imports, in particular, for food and fuel. They also incur significant
transportation costs, whose level is strongly affected by fuel prices. As a result, low world commodity prices have
helped suppress inflation, support household spending, and reduce balance-of-payments pressures.




Poverty and inclusiveness: successes and challenges

New household surveys indicate an even lower incidence of poverty in the region than previously
estimated. In China, data from the integrated 2013 household survey show a much lower incidence of poverty
than the separate rural and urban household surveys of 2012. This reflects both improvements over time in living
conditions, and a more accurate measurement of household consumption patterns. New data from household
surveys in Indonesia (2015), Vietnam (2014), Mongolia (2014), Timor-Leste (2014), Cambodia (2013), and the
Solomon Islands (2013) show that the incidence of poverty declined also in these countries.

Natural disasters and extreme weather events occurred in several EAP countries and likely adversely
impacted the poor, including through lower growth and higher food prices. Over the past year, the extreme
weather patterns associated with El Niño and La Niña have led to delayed planting and harvesting, and significant
crop losses, in several countries.10 Again, large parts of Fiji’s population have been affected by the severe Tropical
Cyclone Winston of early 2016.

Across much of the region, growth has proved relatively inclusive over the past few years, but challenges
remain. The bottom 40 percent of the population has experienced relatively rapid income growth (Figure I.A.29).
Since 2000, inequality has decreased in most countries, except Indonesia11 and the Philippines (Figure I.A.30).
Nevertheless, there remain significant challenges to inclusiveness; even in countries such as Vietnam, where
poverty has been almost eliminated, disadvantaged groups such as ethnic minorities are lagging behind by an
often increasing margin (Box I.A.3).

      Box I.A.3. Inclusive Growth in Vietnam1

      Vietnam has enjoyed tremendous success in reducing poverty and achieving shared prosperity.
      Extreme poverty has been almost eliminated. Between 1993 and 2014, the share of the population living
      below the national poverty line fell from approximately 80 percent to 13.5 percent (Figure BI.A.3.1), and the
      consumption of the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution grew by 6.8 percent per year. Inequality has
      remained substantially lower than in other fast-growing East Asian developing countries (the Gini coefficient
      was 0.348 in 2014). This progress has been mirrored in nonmonetary dimensions of well-being. Between
      1993 and 2012, under-five mortality declined from 45 per 1,000 live births to 24, and the incidence of
      stunting from 61 percent to 23 percent. On most indicators, Vietnam performed better than its peers.2
      Vietnam’s success reflects rapid economic growth that has created more and better jobs                 (Figure
      BI.A.3.2). First, the launch of the Doi Moi reforms in 1989 ushered in a period of increasing agricultural
      productivity. Then, rapid structural transformation became the engine of growth, as the country transitioned
      from an agrarian economy to labor-intensive manufacturing and services.3 Labor rapidly moved away from
      agriculture, with the manufacturing and service sectors contributing 15 million of the 20 million new jobs
      created in the past 20 years. This shift accounted for 40 percent of the overall increase in labor productivity.
      The growing export sector helped accelerate the transformation, especially as FDI flowed into Vietnam after

    its accession to the World Trade Organization. Growth of cities generated agglomeration economies, fostered
    innovation, and contributed to industrialization and modernization. Migration to these cities presented
    rural households with nonfarm opportunities. Reflecting these factors, households diversified their income
    sources from agriculture; those earning a higher share of income from nonagricultural enterprises and
    nonagricultural wages are less likely to be poor.
    Impressive progress in service delivery significantly improved human development outcomes. This
    both facilitated growth and enabled broad participation by households in the growth process. The country’s
    basic education system stands outs globally, and enrollment is near universal. Between 1993 and 2012,
    net enrollment in upper secondary education increased from 6 percent to 64 percent for girls, and from
    8 percent to 56 percent for boys. Net enrollment in tertiary education also significantly increased. The
    attainment of tertiary education has proved an important pathway to better jobs, because having a college
    degree increases the likelihood of having a wage job (by 52 percent compared to only lower secondary
    education), especially one with a written contract (by 72 percent). Access to infrastructure and amenities also
    improved. The share of households using electricity as their main energy source jumped from 48 percent to
    98 percent between 1993 and 2012, access to sanitation improved from 43 percent to 75 percent, and rural
    access to clean water increased from 17 percent to 61 percent.
    But even as overall poverty declines, significant challenges to inclusiveness and shared prosperity
    are emerging. Growth and improvements in basic service delivery have benefited all population subgroups,
    but initially disadvantaged groups are lagging behind by an often increasing margin. More than half of
    ethnic minority households still live in poverty, and the gap in poverty rates relative to the ethnic majority
    has widened sharply since 1993 (Figure BI.A.3.3), reflecting minorities’ lower income and consumption
    growth. Ethnic minorities account for 14 percent of the population but 60 percent of the poor, a share that
    at current trends will rise to 80 percent by 2020. Similar gaps are observed in the prevalence of stunting
    (which is twice as high among ethnic minorities), and in education.4 Lower educational attainment and
    low migration to cities (reflecting language barriers, the household registration system, and poor social
    networks) have contributed to ethnic minorities lagging behind.
                                                                                                                                                                                  (continued)


    4	       Vietnam enjoys near universal lower secondary enrollment. However, upper secondary enrollment stands at only 39 percent among ethnic minorities, compared to 67 percent
             among the ethnic majority. Likewise, tertiary enrollment stands at only 7 percent among ethnic minorities, compared to 31 percent among the ethnic majority (VHLSS 2014).

  More broadly, the current growth model is reaching its limits, raising other challenges for poverty
  reduction and shared prosperity. First, growth has imposed significant environmental costs. Pollution
  affects more than 83 percent of the population, a share that will rise further if current energy generation and
  use patterns are maintained. Second, structural transformation is slowing. Growth in both labor productivity
  and employment has decreased significantly.5 The small- and medium-sized private-sector enterprises that
  dominate the labor market are failing to expand.
  Thus, new jobs reflect mainly the formation of new       Figure BI.A.3.3. Ethnic minorities are being left

  infrastructure and supporting efficient urbanization;
  strengthening governance to even the playing field for the private sector; strengthening economic
  management, especially managing the rising public debt and financial sector vulnerabilities; and creating
  more efficient factor markets for capital and land. Agriculture needs to be transformed to enhance rural

I.B.	 Outlook and Risks
          Growth in the region is expected to remain broadly resilient during 2016–18. This outlook is in line
          with what was projected last April, and remains more positive than in most other developing regions.
          China is expected to continue its gradual transition to slower but more sustainable growth. In the large
          ASEAN economies, excluding Malaysia, growth will likely pick up slightly. Among the smaller economies,
          the growth outlook has deteriorated markedly in some commodity exporters. Across most countries,
          the impact of weak external demand is expected to be offset by continued domestic demand growth.
          Favorable external financing conditions will be complemented by monetary and fiscal accommodation,
          with budget deficits projected to increase across much of the region. Continued low commodity prices
          will support domestic demand in the commodity importers, and contribute to a muted outlook for
          inflation across the region.

          The positive outlook for growth and poverty reduction in the region in this base case is subject to
          significant risks. A sharp global financial tightening would be associated with reduced capital inflows
          and likely with increased financial volatility. In addition, growth fluctuations in high-income economies
          would have a significant impact on output in the more open regional economies. The ongoing slowdown
          and rebalancing process in China remains an important short-term risk for the rest of the region,
          although over the longer term China’s rebalancing will also generate opportunities for other countries.
          Further, rapidly rising levels of credit are a key source of vulnerability across most large economies,
          notably China, Malaysia, and Thailand. There is a growing risk of financial stress among corporates and
          households, which could spill over to the banking sector and lead to protracted slowdowns. Shocks to
          external financial conditions or to global growth would exacerbate these existing financial vulnerabilities.




Growth will decrease gradually in China, but pick up in the rest of the region

Prospects for global growth and commodity prices are more subdued, but global financial conditions are
expected to remain more accommodative than previously projected         (Box I.B.1). Global growth is projected to
fall in 2016, and recover slowly through 2018. This downward revision from the April 2016 projections is driven
by the advanced economies, and reflects stalling global trade, weak investment, and ongoing policy uncertainties.
Commodity prices are projected to recover gradually, but remain at historically low levels for a protracted period;
the outlook for both energy and nonenergy prices has been revised down since April.

Growth in the region is expected to remain resilient during 2016–18, with some differences across
countries. This outlook is in line with what was projected last April, and remains more positive than in other
developing regions (Box I.B.1). China is expected to continue its gradual transition to slower but more sustainable
growth (Table I.B.1). In most of the large ASEAN economies, growth will likely pick up slightly. Across most countries,
the impact of weak external demand is expected to be offset by continued domestic demand growth. Favorable
external financing conditions will be complemented by monetary and fiscal accommodation, with budget deficits
projected to increase across much of the region. Continued low commodity prices will support domestic demand in
the commodity importers, and contribute to a muted outlook for inflation across the region.

  Box I.B.1. Global Outlook and Risks

  Global growth prospects remain subdued. Global growth in 2016 is set to be even lower than the
  2.5 percent projected in April, reflecting weak investment and international trade, as well as ongoing policy
  uncertainties, including those associated with the U.K. Brexit process, doubts about the effectiveness of
  unconventional monetary policies, and elections in several countries (Figure BI.B.1.1). In the United States,
  short-term prospects have deteriorated, and lackluster productivity is leading to further downward revisions
  to medium-term potential growth. In the euro area, recent developments are broadly in line with previous
  expectations for 2016, but the lagged repercussions of Brexit are likely to depress activity in 2017. In
  contrast, in Japan, the delay in the tax hike (from April 2017 to October 2019) and the new fiscal stimulus
  package are likely to support growth in 2017. In the East Asian Newly Industrialized Economies (NIEs),
  growth is expected to increase slightly in 2017–18 but remain below its long-term average, reflecting weak
  global growth and trade prospects, partly offset by more robust domestic demand.

  The outlook for emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is also subdued, given weaker
  advanced-economy growth prospects and stagnant global trade. Differences in outlook across EMDE
  regions continue to reflect in part the divergence between commodity exporters and importers, with
  prospects particularly favorable in South Asia and in East Asia and the Pacific (Figure BI.B.1.2). Prospects
  for some of the larger EMDEs, including Brazil and Russia, have shown signs of improvement, and for India
  are becoming even more positive. However, this is being offset by weakness in other countries (including
  Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, and Turkey), partly reflecting idiosyncratic factors in a context of continued
  fragility. The divergence in prospects between commodity exporters and importers is projected to narrow,
  given the expected stabilization in commodity prices.
  Global trade growth is likely to remain depressed. Trade in goods is likely to grow by less than 3 percent
  in 2016. Subdued activity in advanced economies, weakening demand from key commodity exporters, and
  China’s slowing industrial sector all exert a drag. This is compounded by longer-term structural factors,
  including a slower pace of trade liberalization and a maturing of global value chains.

     commodities and the pass-through of lower energy
     costs (agricultural production is relatively energy-
     intensive).
     The rebound in capital flows to EMDEs seen since March 2016 might prove fragile and, as observed
     in recent years, rapidly reverse in an episode of market volatility. Changing expectations regarding
     the pace of U.S. monetary policy normalization could have particularly significant repercussions for capital
     flows. The U.S. Federal Reserve remains committed to a gradual normalization of policy interest rates, but has
     continued to revise downward its expected interest rate path. However, a faster-than-expected resurgence
     of inflation as the labor market tightens could trigger a significant readjustment in market expectations.




In China, growth is likely to continue easing steadily to 6.3 percent in 2018. The ongoing reform process
seeks to facilitate the rebalancing of the economy toward consumption, services, and higher-value-added activities
as part of a program to increase overall productivity. Output growth will moderate as excess industrial capacity is
reduced, including by slowing the growth in credit to these sectors.1 Nevertheless, tightening labor markets will
support continued growth in disposable income and private consumption.

Among other large economies, growth prospects are strongest in the commodity importers. In the
Philippines, growth will likely accelerate to 6.4 percent in 2016, reflecting fiscal stimulus, rising public investment,
and strong growth in services (business process outsourcing). In Vietnam, growth will fall in 2016, owing to the
temporary effects of the severe drought on agricultural output; it will then recover to 6.3 percent, in line with
rising consumer demand and credit, and as exporters continue gaining from the recent free trade agreement with
the European Union. In Indonesia, growth will increase steadily to 5.5 percent in 2018, despite low commodity
prices, conditional on a pick-up in public investment and the success of efforts to improve the investment climate
and increase revenues. In Thailand, growth will recover gradually to 3.3 percent in 2018, reflecting the effects
of increased public investment, improving consumer confidence, and continued expansion in services including
tourism. In Malaysia, however growth will fall sharply in 2016, as oil and manufactured exports are affected by
weaker global demand, with a gradual recovery thereafter.


1	   The growth projection for 2018 has been lowered from the 6.5 percent projected last April, reflecting the continuation of this process.

In commodity-dependent Mongolia and Papua New Guinea, the outlook has deteriorated markedly.
Mongolia is projected to stagnate in 2016, despite a large fiscal stimulus, as mineral exports weaken. Efforts to
control the ballooning debt will act as a drag on growth in subsequent years. In Papua New Guinea, growth will
fall sharply in 2016: production of copper is declining, the output of liquefied natural gas has reached a peak, and
prices of both remain depressed. In Timor-Leste, growth is projected to remain robust, as the impact of falling oil
production on public revenue and expenditure is cushioned by large withdrawals from the sovereign wealth fund.

The other smaller developing East Asian economies will continue to enjoy rapid growth as competitive
sectors develop. In Cambodia, growth will remain around 7 percent, assuming that garment exporters face off
competitive threats from other low-cost producers, including by continuing to increase value added (Box I.B.2).
Lao PDR enjoys a similarly strong outlook, as its power generation and exports continue expanding. In Myanmar,
growth will accelerate to above 8 percent in 2017–18, supported by increased investment and by rapid expansion
in the services sector, including transportation, banking, and telecommunications..

Poverty will continue to fall across much of the region, including in China

Poverty is projected to continue falling across much of the region      (Table I.B.2). In China, poverty reduction
will be supported by rapid income growth, falling inequality, and rebalancing toward more labor-intensive services.
While overall growth may moderate, continued reforms will translate into disposable income rising more quickly
than GDP. In particular, with growth shifting to more labor-intensive services, and the labor force shrinking, job
creation and wages will remain buoyant. In Indonesia, the second-most-populous country in the region, poverty
reduction is expected to be modest, but may be boosted by the 2016 expansion of the conditional cash transfer
program. And prospects remain positive in Vietnam, as rapid economic growth continues to create more and better
jobs.


    Box I.B.2. Cambodia’s Garment Sector1

    Cambodia’s outward-oriented garment sector has prospered, despite increasing competition in
    world markets. Largely established in the mid-1990s, it now accounts for most of the country’s merchandise
    exports,2 and more than 10 percent of total employment3 and GDP (Figure BI.B.2.1).

    The garment sector is almost entirely financed by rising foreign direct investment (FDI), mostly from
    China. China, together with Hong Kong SAR, China; Macau SAR, China; and Taiwan, China, accounts for
    91 percent of total investments in the garment sector (Figure BI.B.2.2). Chinese FDI in the clothing industry
    started as early as mid-1990, attracted by the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA) quota system, and has expanded
    significantly since 2000. Total FDI stock in the garment sector currently exceeds 20 percent of GDP.
    The sector’s success has been underpinned by low wages and a liberal trade and investment regime.
    Garments are labor-intensive. The increase in FDI since 2000 partly reflects rising domestic wages in China,

  which encouraged relocation of factories to lower-cost Cambodia.4 Foreign direct investors have contributed
  improved technology and management, helping to overcome Cambodia’s relatively weak infrastructure and
  human capital. Raw material inputs, including fabric, are also largely imported from China, reducing reliance
  on the small domestic manufacturing sector. In addition, in 2011 the European Union (EU) relaxed its rules
  of origin requirements for duty-free access under the “Everything but Arms” (EBA) preferences, enabling
  Cambodia to increase its share of the EU garment market.5 Also, frequent public-private consultations have
  helped solve specific sectoral obstacles.6
  Export growth has largely reflected increasing volumes, but more recently rising wages are
  encouraging a move toward higher-value-added products. Wages have been rising quickly in recent
  years, (from US$61 per month in 2012, to US$140 per month in 2016), partly in the wake of labor unrest.
  This has forced factories to gradually move away from mass production of basic garments toward more
  specialized, higher-value-added products. Also, the more relaxed EU rules of origin encouraged garment
  producers to focus on relatively more value-added tasks. As a result, and after some fluctuations, in 2015
  the industry witnessed a significant increase in the average export price of garments, accounting for more
  than one-quarter of total growth in export values (Table BI.B.2.1).

  Looking ahead, the sector’s “footloose” characteristics and its sizable foreign ownership share
  translate into significant exposure to rising input costs, competition from regional low-wage
  economies, political uncertainty, higher taxes, and/or erosion of trade preferences. For instance,
  Myanmar is an emerging low-cost producer whose minimum wage is only two-thirds of Cambodia’s.7
  Cambodia enjoys duty-free access to the EU market, but its competitive position will be eroded once Vietnam
  receives similar access under the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement. Similarly, Cambodia’s exports to the
  U.S. market may be undermined once Vietnam enjoys duty-free access under the planned Trans-Pacific
  Partnership.8 Reinforcing this, there are few barriers to rapid relocation of factories to other countries, and
  less than 7 percent of the 600 garment factories are majority-owned by Cambodians.9

However, the outlook for poverty reduction is mixed in several countries. In Lao PDR, rapid economic growth
has so far been associated with rising inequality and relatively little poverty reduction, although the link may
strengthen given the recent expansion of manufacturing and the attendant boost to job creation. In Cambodia,
the stagnant agricultural sector is likely to hamper the pace of poverty reduction, although growing industrial and
service sectors should support progress in urban areas. In Mongolia, poverty conditions will likely deteriorate in the
near term, given weak growth and labor market conditions.




Domestic demand will support growth, with at most a modest contribution
from net exports, across much of the region

Net exports will provide at most a modest contribution to growth across the large economies, reflecting
more subdued global activity than previously projected       (Figure I.B.1). In China, net exports are now expected
to exert a small drag on growth, in line also with the continued sectoral shift from industry toward services (Figure
I.B.2). In Indonesia and Malaysia, net export demand will remain broadly neutral, given the subdued outlook
for both manufacturing and commodity exports. In the Philippines, exports of both goods and services will rise,
and imports are set to expand sharply to meet the needs of a fast-growing construction sector and rising private
consumption. In Thailand, exports will continue recovering from depressed levels, and in Vietnam they are projected
to continue expanding, but sustained growth in both countries will require structural reform and innovation.

Consumption across much of the region is projected to continue growing rapidly, supported by low
commodity prices and monetary and fiscal accommodation. Private consumption will remain buoyant in the
Philippines, Vietnam and, to a lesser degree, Indonesia and Malaysia. It will gradually recover in Thailand, as
confidence returns, and remain stable in China. Reinforcing this, the direct contribution of government consumption
to growth is projected to nearly double between 2014 and 2016 in the region, excluding China. In particular, the
projections for the Philippines and Thailand reflect significant expected fiscal stimulus in 2016 and 2017.

Investment growth will quicken or remain elevated in many large economies in 2016, and drop back only
gradually. Investment is anticipated to make a significant contribution to growth in Indonesia and the Philippines,
and to recover in Thailand, in all cases supported by a scaling up of public investment and the projected ongoing
stabilization in capital flows. It will also continue growing rapidly in Vietnam. However, investment growth will
continue falling in China, in line with rebalancing efforts, and in Malaysia, as new developments in the oil and gas
sector are postponed given unfavorable prevailing prices.

Among the smaller economies, trends will diverge between commodity exporters and other countries. In
Mongolia, consumption will decline sharply in 2016, as stabilization measures and weak confidence take hold, and
mining exports are projected to continue declining in 2017, as copper production becomes increasingly dependent
on lower-quality ores (Figure I.B.3). In Papua New Guinea, external demand is expected to weaken, although much
uncertainty surrounds the potential development of new mining and petroleum projects. In contrast, export growth
will remain robust in Cambodia, driven by the garments sector, and in Lao PDR, where rising electricity exports will
offset a slump in the copper sector. In both countries, investment is expected to remain robust, while consumption
slackens.

Fiscal stimulus is projected to continue, raising risks to sustainability
in some countries

In 2016, fiscal deficits are expected to widen and public debt to increase across much of the region. In
China, the deficit is projected to expand as recent tax measures, including tax breaks, lower pension rates, and
a switch from an enterprise tax to the value-added tax, adversely affect collections (Figure I.B.4). Among the
other large economies, the increase in the deficit will be particularly marked in the Philippines, largely reflecting
increased expenditure. However, rapid growth will maintain the public debt burden on a declining trajectory (Figure
I.B.5). The deficit is also projected to rise in Thailand in 2016, reflecting new spending measures and increased
tax exemptions. In Indonesia, the deficit will increase in 2016, reflecting the negative impact of continued low
commodity prices on revenue, but the proposed 2017 budget reins in further expansion. In Malaysia, where the
revenue envelope has also tightened, expenditure consolidation is expected in the second half of 2016 to meet the
deficit target of 3.1 percent of GDP, which will contribute to the muted growth outlook. Nevertheless, debt levels
will remain elevated. In Vietnam, the deficit is projected to remain elevated, but fall from 6 to 5 percent over the
forecast window, with further increases in the debt stock, to around 65 percent of GDP.

Among the smaller economies, Mongolia and, to a lesser degree, other commodity exporters, face the
greatest deterioration in public finances. In Mongolia, the deficit is expected to balloon from 8 percent of GDP
in 2015 to 20 percent of GDP in 2016, reflecting large increases in pre-election expenditures in the first half of
the year, revenue shortfalls stemming from the sharp slowdown in mineral exports and domestic demand, and the
limited corrective measures announced so far. As a result, government debt is set to rise sharply over the next two
years. Large external debt repayments due in 2017 and 2018 will present significant challenges. In Lao PDR, the
deficit is projected to increase in 2016 to 6.2 percent of GDP in 2016, reflecting declining mineral revenues. In
Timor-Leste, a large structural deficit has emerged, projected to reach 24 percent of GDP in 2016 and 30 percent
of GDP in 2017, reflecting the exhaustion of its oil reserves. Its large sovereign wealth fund can finance this deficit

increase to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2016 and 5 percent of GDP in 2017, but concessional financing and rapid growth
will help reduce the debt burden.

reversing this trend. In Thailand, this year’s fiscal
stimulus package involves increases in policy lending to SMEs and targeted tax exemptions, as well as increased
capital expenditure. In the Philippines, 70 percent of the planned expansion in spending in 2016 will be on current
expenditure, much of it wages and salaries, although public investment is also expected to increase. In Malaysia,
most of the fiscal stimulus so far has involved targeted transfers to low-income groups and temporary tax breaks.
In Cambodia, the public wage bill is expected to increase rapidly through 2018. In Myanmar, public investment is
expected to fall in 2016 despite higher spending.




A sharp global financial tightening or a further slowdown in world growth
would test the region’s resilience

The eventual normalization of monetary policy in high-income economies will test the resilience of
regional growth. Global financial conditions are expected to remain more accommodative than projected last
April, with only gradual, modest adjustments over time in policy rates in high-income economies. And, so far,
the region has proved relatively resilient to repeated bouts of global financial volatility, associated in particular
with changing expectations regarding the pace and extent of monetary policy normalization in the United States,
and the prospects for emerging markets as a whole. Nevertheless, a more rapid-than-expected normalization, or
rising global risk aversion, could have significant repercussions, especially for the large, financially integrated
regional economies. Such shocks would be associated with reduced capital inflows, U.S. dollar appreciation against
regional currencies, and likely with increased financial volatility driven by uncertainty at key turning points. As
a result, debt-service burdens and debt-rollover risks would increase, especially for unhedged borrowers with
short-term, foreign-currency-denominated debt. Amplifying exposure, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and

Risks to global activity persist, with potentially significant implications for regional exports       (Box I.B.1).
Growth fluctuations in high-income economies would have a significant impact on output in the more open regional
economies, even though the majority of developing EAP exports serve the regional market. On the positive side,
the U.K.’s Brexit vote, and the upcoming Brexit process, are likely to have only a small impact on developing EAP,
given the region’s limited direct trade and financial links with the United Kingdom, with the possible exception of
Cambodia and Fiji (Box I.B.3).

In China, the ongoing slowdown and rebalancing process remains an important short-term risk to growth
in the rest of the region. China accounts for a large and rising share of demand for goods and services from the
region, both to meet its own final demand and as inputs into further exports. As a result, China’s orderly slowdown
to date has been an important factor behind the region’s resilience in the face of weakening global growth.
However, rising private leverage and debt service burdens, especially in excess capacity sectors, raise the risk of
financial stress among corporates. This could lead to a faster-than-anticipated slowdown in activity, especially if
the strains spilled over to the banking sector and led to generalized reductions in credit. That said, the country
continues to have significant fiscal, institutional, and reserve buffers (World Bank 2016c).

However, over the long term, China’s rebalancing will also generate opportunities for the rest of developing
EAP. The ongoing transformation in China’s economic structure will open up new export opportunities for its
trade partners, through two important channels. First, it will increase China’s consumption of and demand for
many products, including agricultural commodities and services. Second, it will create space for other countries to

    Box I.B.3. The Impact of Brexit on Developing EAP1

    Brexit is likely to have a limited impact on developing EAP, but could add considerable uncertainty
    to an already fragile global environment. In the short term, Brexit is not expected to have a large impact
    on developing EAP, given its limited direct trade, investment, and financial links with the United Kingdom.
    In the medium term, Brexit will imply a renegotiation of developing EAP’s trade and investment agreements
    with the United Kingdom, and may also affect their trade relations with the European Union. Further, there
    is a risk of sustained financial market stress around key decision dates in the upcoming Brexit process, which
    could affect EAP countries with large foreign participation in financial markets, such as Indonesia, Malaysia,
    and Thailand.
    The financial markets’ reaction in EAP following the Brexit vote was relatively calm. In the immediate
    aftermath, equity prices and exchange rates against the dollar fell across the board. Malaysia, by far the
    most exposed to lending from U.K. banks, experienced the sharpest depreciation among regional currencies,
    consistent with the notion that much of the selling was by foreigners seeking a safe haven. However, financial
    markets stabilized after two days of turbulence; equity markets rapidly recovered their losses, and Malaysia’s
    dollar exchange rate quickly bounced back to the level before the Brexit vote.
    The direct impact on developing EAP from any recession in the United Kingdom is likely to be small,
    given the limited direct trade and FDI links. The United Kingdom accounts for less than 2 percent of
    total exports across most of developing EAP; Cambodia, Fiji, and to a lesser degree Vietnam and China are
    relatively more exposed (Figure BI.B.3.1). On a value-added basis, in most cases final demand from the
    United Kingdom accounts for less than 1 percent of GDP. As a result, the trade channel is likely to reduce
    growth in most of the region by at most 0.1 percent, even after factoring in slightly weaker EU growth. The
    United Kingdom also accounts for only a limited share of total FDI flows to developing EAP.2

    The impact through financial channels is also expected to be small, since direct financial links with
    the United Kingdom are in general limited. Most portfolio flows to developing EAP originate from the
    United States, Japan, and other EAP countries. Similarly, bank loans from the United States and Japan exceed

  those from the United Kingdom. Loans from U.K. banks, including both cross-border loans and domestic
  loans from local subsidiaries, are concentrated in the regional financial centers of Hong Kong SAR, China;
  Singapore; and Malaysia.3 The risk of a lending squeeze is limited, because U.K. banks mainly finance their
  operations through local deposits.4 In all other developing EAP economies, loans from U.K. banks account
  for less than 3 percent of GDP (Figure BI.B.3.2).
  The region could be affected by general risk aversion in the wake of Brexit. One source of risk is the
  post-Brexit appreciation of the Japanese yen as a safe haven. Thailand and Malaysia have high exposure
  to Japanese banks; these might respond to continued yen appreciation by pulling funds back to Japan,
  tightening local financial conditions in the process. Yen appreciation could also raise debt-servicing costs
  for countries with significant unhedged yen-denominated external debt.5
  Brexit will imply a renegotiation of developing EAP’s trade and investment agreements with the
  United Kingdom, and may also affect their trade relations with the European Union, with unclear
  effects. On the positive side, it may be easier to negotiate free trade and investment agreements with an
  independent United Kingdom than with the European Union. On the negative side, future agreements with
  the European Union could become more difficult, reflecting the absence of the United Kingdom’s voice.
  China’s growing financial services relationship with the United Kingdom, partly based on London’s role as
  a gateway to the European Union, may be affected.6 Malaysian firms also rely on the United Kingdom as a
  gateway to the European Union; their cost of doing business could increase if new agreements have to be
  negotiated with the European Union post-Brexit. For Indonesia, Brexit is likely to postpone negotiation of the
  Indonesia-EU Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. More broadly, Brexit could be associated
  with a revival of protectionist sentiments that could obstruct trade with the United Kingdom and possibly
  the remaining EU countries.
  The trade and investment relationship of some smaller EAP countries with the United Kingdom
  could be significantly affected. In Fiji, the sugar industry, which accounts for 9 and 12 percent of
  merchandise exports and total employment, respectively, benefits from duty-free, quota-free access to the
  highly protected EU sugar market, and Britain’s Tate and Lyle is among the biggest purchasers. Fiji will
  likely continue enjoying preferential access to the EU sugar market for some time, but this access would not
  automatically apply to a post-Brexit United Kingdom. In Timor-Leste, all residents born before 1998 enjoy
  the right to Portuguese passports. As a result, since independence there have been large flows of migrants
  toward the European Union, including, in particular, the United Kingdom. After Brexit, their right to work in
  the United Kingdom may be affected.




  3	   Such loans account for, respectively, 117 percent, 32 percent, and 12 percent of their GDP.
  4	   Correspondingly, a large share of their assets consists of local positions denominated in local currencies.
  5	For instance, 30 percent of Vietnam’s external debt, equivalent to 12 percent of GDP, was denominated in yen at end-2015.
  6	   Plans included a London-Shanghai equity trading link, a mutual recognition scheme for distributing funds products, cooperation on cross-listing exchange products,
       measures to strengthen London as a yuan clearing hub, and a commitment on the part of several Chinese financial firms to set up bases in London.

expand their production of labor-intensive manufactures, including by encouraging relocation of existing factories
from China to lower-cost regional economies. Those economies that can flexibly adapt their production and export
structure in response to China’s rebalancing could reap a growth dividend (Abiad et al. 2016).




High and rising private sector leverage is an important source of vulnerability
in some large economies

Rapid growth in private-sector credit and leverage across the large economies has already led to a
gradual deterioration in debt-servicing capacity, raising the risk of financial stress among corporates and
households. Debt service ratios for the private nonfinancial sector have been rising steadily over the past five
years, and are now particularly high in China, Malaysia, and Thailand (Figure I.B.9). Likewise, interest coverage
ratios (the ratios of available company earnings to current interest payments) have weakened significantly over the
past five years in several countries, suggesting a deterioration in the financial health of corporates (Figure I.B.10).
This partly reflects a trend decline in corporate profitability (Figure I.B.11) and broader economy-wide returns to
investment (Figure I.B.12). Furthermore, economy-wide aggregates may present a misleadingly optimistic picture
of financial risks. Across the region, corporate debt is often concentrated in relatively weak or risky sectors, including
construction, real estate, utilities, and the oil, mining, and gas sectors (Figure I.B.13), which raises vulnerability to
macroeconomic or commodity price shocks (IMF 2014, 2015).

Rising private sector leverage is also increasing the vulnerability of the region’s financial systems
including, in particular, its banks. Financial difficulties among corporates and households could spill over to
domestic banks, which still supply the majority of credit. Overall, the region’s banking sector is relatively well
capitalized and profitable, and far less vulnerable than in the run-up to the 1997 Asian crisis. Banks hold significant

Past experience, both in the region and more widely, confirms that rapid private sector credit growth
significantly increases the risk of future financial distress and protracted economic slowdowns. Rapid
credit expansions are often followed by a prolonged period of deleveraging and lackluster economic growth, or
indeed outright crises.7 Underlying this, borrowing booms facilitate the accumulation of latent nonperforming
loans that are revealed after the boom subsides.8 More broadly, rapid credit growth may lead to a deterioration in
the efficiency and profitability of investment.

Shocks to external financial conditions or to global growth could trigger or hasten the realization of
existing financial risks. The share of firms with “debt at risk”9 across the region would increase significantly under
a range of plausible financial shocks.10 Relatedly, renewed financial volatility would significantly aggravate short-
term financial stresses among the more leveraged corporates. The risks would be further magnified if weaker global
activity were simultaneously to affect profitability in export-oriented sectors, including commodity producers.




Outlook and risks for the Pacific Island Countries

Growth in PICs will rely significantly on fisheries and tourism. Coordinated reforms across PICs have already
proved successful in increasing sustainably the rents from the regional tuna fisheries (most notably in Kiribati, the
Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu), and this resource
will continue to support growth in the medium term. Tourism is also expected to expand, especially in Fiji, Samoa,
Tonga, and Vanuatu. Inflation is expected to remain moderate, reflecting muted commodity prices.




7	     About 60 percent of credit booms are followed by economic underperformance, and one-third of credit booms are followed by banking crises (Dell’Ariccia et al. 2014).
8	     A typical borrowing boom raises nonperforming loans from 2.5 percent to 10 percent of gross loans (Mendoza and Terrones 2008). See also World Bank (2016c).
9	     Debt at risk is defined as debt held by firms with an interest coverage ratio of less than 1.5 (that is, firms whose earnings, before interest and tax, are less than 1.5 times current interest
       payments).
10	 In Malaysia, the share of firms with debt at risk would increase from 26 percent to 35 to 42 percent, assuming three concurrent shocks of varying magnitudes: (a) simultaneous
    depreciation against the U.S. dollar and the euro (by, respectively, 20 to 40 percent and 10 to 20 percent); (b) a 20 percent decline in earnings before interest and tax; and (c) a
    200-to-300-basis-point increase in interest rates. In Vietnam, the share of firms with debt at risk would increase from 15 percent to 25 percent in response to a 200-basis-point increase
    in interest rates.

The main risks for PICs arise from natural disasters, climate change, and terms-of-trade shocks. Nearly
every year, at least one country is hit by a major natural disaster; vulnerability will remain high even with an
increased policy focus on disaster risk management. In the long run, many PICs are also highly vulnerable to sea-
level rise. Shocks to world commodity prices significantly affect livelihoods across the PICs, because they are highly
dependent on imports, and face transportation costs that are both large and heavily influenced by oil prices.

I.C.	 Policy Considerations
          Subdued global prospects make it critical for policymakers to address underlying financial and fiscal
          vulnerabilities, and to maintain fiscal space. China needs to advance reforms in the corporate sector,
          implement measures to bring credit growth under control, and strengthen its intergovernmental fiscal
          system. Among the other large economies, where private sector credit has grown rapidly, or where
          external debt is sizable, the build-up of risk can be reduced through enhanced microprudential regulation
          and increased use of macroprudential policies. Among the other large economies, where private sector
          credit has grown rapidly, or where external debt is sizable, the build-up of risk can be reduced through
          enhanced microprudential regulation and increased use of macroprudential policies. Across the region,
          and especially among commodity producers, maintaining fiscal buffers should receive priority over
          countercyclical stabilization efforts. In this context, broadening revenue sources remains a priority.
          Fiscal deficits pose a risk to sustainability in some regional economies, primarily commodity producers,
          and substantial consolidation is needed. In resource-rich economies, the use of sovereign wealth funds
          can support short-term expenditure stabilization and long-term fiscal sustainability, provided that the
          funds’ operational rules are simple, transparent, and allow only limited discretion.

          The longer-term challenge across the region is to achieve faster, more inclusive growth. In China, the
          commitment to facilitate the rebalancing from investment-led to consumption-led growth, as part of
          a program to increase overall productivity, should be complemented by continued efforts to reduce
          poverty and promote inclusion. Across the rest of the region, more and better infrastructure holds the
          potential to promote connectivity and facilitate the shift to higher-value-added activities. A rebalancing
          of public expenditure, and greater public-private cooperation, will help address infrastructure deficits,
          but increased expenditure must be accompanied by reforms to improve the efficiency of public
          investment management. Such efforts to enhance productivity must be complemented by a renewed
          focus on boosting inclusion, with a focus on reducing still-high levels of undernutrition across much
          of the region, harnessing the full potential of new technology for financial development and inclusion,
          and developing “adaptive safety nets” that respond rapidly and flexibly in the wake of shocks such as
          natural disasters. The long-term outlook for growth and inclusion in the Pacific Island Countries hinges
          on their ability to maximize the benefits from their limited opportunities, including fisheries, migrant
          workers, and tourism.




Subdued global prospects make it critical to address underlying financial
and fiscal vulnerabilities, and to maintain fiscal space

Subdued prospects for the global economy are generating headwinds across the region. The deteriorating
outlook in high-income economies will have a persistent effect on regional exports. Depressed world commodity
prices will intensify challenges in commodity exporters. And significant risks to global activity persist.

At the same time, unexpectedly accommodative global financial conditions are temporarily reducing
pressures. The delayed normalization of monetary policy in high-income economies has stabilized capital flows and

reduced exchange-rate pressures. The window of opportunity to address regional vulnerabilities has extended—
but the reprieve is likely to prove temporary.

China needs to advance reforms in the corporate sector and implement measures to bring the current
rapid credit growth under control. Reforms to address excess industrial capacity have been initiated, and could
usefully be accelerated and deepened. The continued rapid expansion of credit to state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
including those involved in public investment, has increased macroeconomic risks with steadily decreasing returns.
Recent measures to strengthen financial regulations, including those pertaining to shadow banking activities such
as wealth management products and peer-to-peer lending, should also be expanded. Household credit has been
rising rapidly, aided by a loosening of prudential policies, particularly for first-time homebuyers,1 and needs to be
managed carefully.

As China’s economy rebalances from investment-led to consumption-led growth, the intergovernmental
budgetary and public finance system also needs to be strengthened. The adoption by the State Council of a
new framework to address the current imbalance in revenues and expenditure responsibilities at different levels of
government appears to be a positive step in that direction. Lower public investment growth at the subnational level
could also facilitate efforts, building on the recent budget reform, to strengthen the responsibility and capacity of
local governments to manage debt, including contingent liabilities from off-budget activities.

Among the other large economies, where private sector credit has grown rapidly, or external debt is
sizable, the build-up of risk can be reduced through enhanced microprudential regulation and increased
use of macroprudential policies. In Malaysia and Thailand, leverage has reached significant levels, including
through sharp increases in household debt; in the Philippines and Vietnam, debt continues to grow rapidly. Risks
are heightened by the potential for significant external shocks, including faster-than-anticipated global financial
tightening, renewed global financial volatility, and further downturns in high-income economies. The impact of such
shocks could be magnified by the sizable foreign-currency-denominated debt and short-term external financing
requirements, including foreign liabilities of the banking sector, in Malaysia and Indonesia. In response, in several
countries, including the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, there is significant scope to strengthen regulatory
oversight and microprudential risk management. Enhanced macroprudential regulation would also help mitigate
the risks to financial stability from leverage, including among households (IMF 2015). Focus areas for micro-
and macroprudential reform should include risk-informed pricing, rigorous borrower affordability assessments,
supervisory vigilance over underwriting practices and capital adequacy, elevated reserve requirements, higher
liquidity ratios or loan-loss provisions, and appropriate loan-to-value (LTV) and debt-to-income (DTI) limits (World
Bank 2016c). Countries with a significant nonbank financial sector, including Thailand, should enlarge financial
regulatory perimeters, with robust oversight and close supervision of nonbank financial institutions, to avoid
regulatory arbitrage. Across the region, strengthened collection of data, including granular data on household
assets and liabilities, will help monitor the build-up of financial stability risks. A number of countries, including
Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar, are already introducing measures along these

various dimensions.2 These efforts should be strengthened, especially in economies with large credit markets,
while continuing to promote desirable financial deepening. In Vietnam, consolidating the banking sector and
restructuring the large banks to improve efficiency and overall asset quality are also important measures for
consideration.

The experience of the Republic of Korea illustrates how a timely policy response, tailored to country-
specific circumstances, can cool overheated credit markets and reduce the risk of loan defaults; Malaysia
is starting to follow this example. In Korea, mortgage loans and housing prices began rising sharply in 2000–
01. In response, authorities introduced a series of countercyclical macroprudential policies, including LTV and DTI
limits for housing loans3; and tightened caps on leverage (as a multiple of bank capital). They also introduced a
“stability levy” on banks’ nondeposit foreign exchange liabilities (which raised foreign exchange funding costs).
As a result, the growth in housing prices, the number of loan defaults, and the growth of new loans decreased
by 2008. In Malaysia, in response to rising household indebtedness, macroprudential measures, including limits
on LTV ratios and maturities of housing loans,4 have been strengthened since 2010, and the authorities have
enhanced the framework for risk-based pricing, stress testing, and supervision. As a result, house price growth
has been moderating since 2014,5 the share of borrowings by highly leveraged lower-income households has
declined,6 loan applications and approvals have decreased, and personal credit growth has slowed. That said, both
household and corporate debt remains elevated.

Across the region, and especially among commodity producers, maintaining fiscal buffers in the context
of a robust medium-term fiscal framework should receive priority over any countercyclical stabilization
efforts, especially given the continued resilience of regional growth. Countries across the region need to
preserve room for fiscal manoeuver should risks, including due to deterioration in the external environment,
materialize. In addition, debt-servicing costs can crowd out high-priority investment and social expenditures.
That said, among noncommodity producers, and particularly Cambodia, the Philippines, and Thailand, the risks
associated with a limited widening of the deficit should prove manageable, as long as this expansion finances
efficient efforts to build up the economy’s long-term productive capacity (see below).

To maintain fiscal buffers, broadening revenue sources continues to be a priority for most countries.
Revenue mobilization remains low across much of the region.7 Revenue constraints are particularly binding for
commodity producers; in Indonesia and Malaysia, low commodity prices have already had a significant impact on

     financial institutions, which hold over 20 percent of financial sector assets, will now be supervised by the central bank, promoting more comprehensive oversight and transparency.
     In the Philippines, the authorities have enhanced monitoring of real estate and credit conditions, including through the introduction of the residential real estate price index, and are
     addressing data and regulatory gaps related to the real estate sector and rising corporate leverage. In Vietnam, macroprudential regulation of credit markets was strengthened in April,
     with a particular focus on real estate. In Cambodia, minimum capital requirements for financial institutions were recently increased, and the required liquidity coverage ratio was raised
     to 60 percent in September 2016. In Myanmar, the recent adoption of the financial sector law is expected to help manage risks from credit growth.

public revenue and public finances. In general, commodity producers need to reduce, or continue reducing, their
reliance on commodity-related fiscal revenues. In Indonesia, a series of tax-compliance measures combined with
modest base-broadening measures could raise revenues by almost 2.5 percent of GDP.8 In Malaysia, which already
introduced a goods and services tax in 2015, current priorities include reducing exemptions and expanding the
base for the personal income tax. In Thailand, tax reforms will introduce wealth and asset-transaction taxation,
supporting both revenue and equity. In the Philippines, the proposed tax policy reforms, with their focus on
broadening the tax base, lowering tax rates, and raising overall revenue, represent a step in the right direction.9
They will need to be accompanied by continued efforts to improve tax administration.10 In Vietnam, the revenue
base should be broadened through new taxes on capital gains, property and interest income, and by raising
rates or reducing exemptions with appropriate measures to mitigate the impact on the poor. Timor-Leste would
benefit from introducing a VAT as a pillar of domestic revenue, and Vanuatu from introducing an income tax.
In addition, continued low world energy prices extend the window of opportunity for countries to reform energy
pricing, including by cutting remaining energy and fertilizer subsidies, increasing fuel taxes, and in some cases
moving toward greater cost recovery in electricity (World Bank 2015a). Public transfers should target low-income
or vulnerable groups, to maximize their impact on inclusion; and permanent commitments, including public service
wage settlements, should be approached cautiously.

In Mongolia and Timor-Leste, commodity producers that have failed to adjust to lower commodity
revenues, and to a lesser degree in Vietnam, high or rising fiscal deficits pose a risk to fiscal sustainability;
substantial consolidation is needed. In Mongolia, large fiscal imbalances have emerged, and public debt is set
to rise rapidly in the coming years in the absence of adjustment. The announced measures to contain expenditure
must be significantly strengthened and domestic revenue sources broadened. In Timor-Leste, the emergence of
large structural deficits demands efforts to prioritize the use of sovereign wealth fund assets to finance essential
investments that raise domestic supply potential and support diversification efforts. These need to be coupled
with the development of a stronger domestic revenue framework, and a targeted program of institutional and
policy reform to improve the regulatory environment and broader investment climate. In Vietnam, elevated debt
levels, and the contingent liabilities associated with banking sector recapitalization,11 also call for fiscal reforms to
stabilize public finances. Reversing the significant erosion of fiscal revenue over the past few years is a priority. SOE
reform, including measures to enhance transparency and governance, will help reduce public financial liabilities.

In resource-rich countries, there is significant scope to enhance institutions for managing commodity-
price volatility. The effective use of sovereign wealth funds can support short-term expenditure stabilization
and, relatedly, long-term savings, while ensuring that key development needs are met. However, the operation
of sovereign wealth funds, especially in thin-capacity environments, is likely to prove most effective when the
operational rules are simple, transparent, allow only limited discretion, and enjoy broad political support (Box
I.C.1).

     property taxes, and a harmonization of capital income tax rates.

    The smaller commodity-dependent EAP countries face a number of challenges in increasing their
    resilience to changes in commodity prices, and ensuring that resource revenues benefit both current
    and future generations.2 This box examines the institutional mechanisms that have been employed to
    manage resource revenues in a selection of small EAP commodity exporters—Kiribati, Mongolia, Papua
    New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu (Table BI.C.1.1). Resource revenues, which tend to be highly volatile,
    comprise a substantial proportion of total revenues in each of these countries (Figure BI.C.1.1). In some cases,
    these resources are not projected to last indefinitely: for instance, in Timor-Leste, petroleum production is
    forecast to end by 2022.

    In a number of cases, SWFs have had some success in meeting their stabilization objectives, with
    a broadly negative correlation between net withdrawals and resource revenues                (Figure BI.C.1.2).
    In Kiribati and Tuvalu, governments have readily drawn down SWF balances to finance fiscal deficits over
    the past decade, and more recently have begun to make contributions on the back of marked increases in
    fishing license fee revenues. However, Kiribati has generally been more willing to make withdrawals than
    contributions: while the funding of persistent fiscal deficits and low returns on investment halved the value
    of Kiribati’s SWF between 2000 and 2008, only around half of the large recent fiscal surpluses have been
    allocated to the SWF (the remainder has been saved as cash reserves). In Timor-Leste, government spending
    has continued to grow steadily over the last decade, despite a pronounced rise and fall in petroleum revenues
    over the same period, owing to disbursements from the SWF.3
    In Mongolia, SWF withdrawal decisions have been somewhat ad hoc, with declining copper, coal,
    and gold prices complicating macro-fiscal management. The government has made only one drawdown
    from the SWF (of 0.5 percent of GDP, in 2014), despite structural budget deficits averaging 6.4 percent
    of GDP over the last five years. Instead, budget deficits have been financed by domestic and sovereign
    borrowings as well as prepayments of large mineral royalties. Moreover, while the SWF was intended to
    support the operation of the Fiscal Stability Law, which was passed in 2010 and established rules on the
    structural deficit, expenditure growth, and public debt, each of these rules has been breached regularly in
    recent years.4
    In Papua New Guinea, while experience with the SWF is limited, questions have arisen about the
    contribution and withdrawal rules, as well as the relationship with fiscal policy. The 2015 SWF
    legislation includes some best practice features: it ensures that all SWF inflows and outflows are recorded
    on-budget, mandates that the SWF invest only in foreign assets, and sets out a governance structure to
                                                                                                                                                                                                 (continued)


    3	   These withdrawals (Figure BI.C.1.3) are reflected in the fact that over the past decade, the net contributions to the SWF (Figure BI.C.1.2) have regularly been less than total
         petroleum sector revenues, which by law must be deposited in the SWF.
    4	   The Fiscal Stability Law had three key provisions: (1) a ceiling on the structural deficit of 2 percent of GDP; (2) a cap on expenditure growth based on the nonmineral GDP
         growth rate; and (3) a ceiling on the net present value of public debt of 40 percent of GDP. It came into force in 2013, but a subsequent amendment temporarily loosened
         these rules for 2015–18.

  prevent conflicts of interest. However, the contribution rules do not account for all resource revenues: for
  instance, the legislation currently requires only 50 percent of mineral and petroleum taxes to be transferred
  to the SWF. The withdrawal rule is complex and not clearly countercyclical in all circumstances. There is also
  no explicit link between the SWF rules and the broader fiscal policy framework, potentially weakening the
  traction of and support for these rules.

  The operation of most SWFs has not been fully compliant with savings rules and objectives, despite
  some limited success in stabilizing expenditure, calling their longer-term sustainability into
  question. Savings rules are often calibrated to maintain the real value of the SWF over time, to ensure that
  future generations can also benefit from current resource revenues or aid flows. However, in Timor-Leste,
  the exception clause allowing withdrawals above the Estimated Sustainable Income has been heavily used
  in recent years. As a result, withdrawals have generally been at a level inconsistent with long-term SWF
  sustainability, and have instead allowed expenditures to rise steadily over the past decade (Figure BI.C.1.3).
  n Kiribati, annual SWF withdrawals continued until 2014, even though the SWF fell below its target per
  I
  capita value since the mid-2000s. In Tuvalu, the Tuvalu Trust Fund rules—which do not allow transfers
  directly to the budget, and only allow transfers to the Consolidated Investment Fund when the Tuvalu
  Trust Fund exceeds its target real value—have been and continue to be effective in ensuring that the fund
  maintains its value in real terms. Nevertheless, the Consolidated Investment Fund, which has regularly been

    In Mongolia, cumulative budgetary contributions to the Fiscal Stabilization Fund (FSF) have been around
    
    40 percent below planned contributions, due mainly to the continued decline in copper prices since 2011.
    As a result, the FSF balance was only around 1.3 percent of GDP at end-2015. The new Future Heritage Fund
    will not allow withdrawals until 2030, which should allow for the buildup of a substantial pool of funds.
    However, saving through this SWF while simultaneously borrowing, in some cases at high interest rates,
    to fund large fiscal deficits would not be an optimal strategy. The Papua New Guinea Savings Fund also
    does not allow withdrawals until 2024, although it is not clear whether and how the rules determining the
    respective contributions of resource revenues to the Savings Fund and the Stabilization Fund SWFs have
    been calibrated to serve the objective of intergenerational equity.
    To the extent that resource revenues are used to finance public expenditures rather than saved, the
    type and quality of these expenditures is also critically important for longer-term outcomes. Using
    resource revenue for development expenditure (even if that means running down the value of the SWF)

   may be justified if this expenditure is likely to produce a positive long-term social return. There may also
   be a case for using resource revenues for current spending, rather than development spending or saving,
   especially in relatively low-income countries, if future generations are expected to be wealthier than the
   current generation or if resources are projected to provide a steady long-term source of revenue. But in both
   cases, ensuring the quality of expenditure is key. In Timor-Leste, excess SWF withdrawals in recent years
   have been used to finance projects with no clear assessment of economic benefits and with seemingly ad-
   hoc project selection and fiduciary processes.5 This undermines transparency, accountability, and efficiency.
   Overall, the experiences of these five countries suggest that SWFs in thin-capacity environments are
   most effective when the operational rules are simple, transparent, allow only limited discretion, and
   enjoy broad political support. While the overall design of Timor-Leste’s SWF framework is seen as best
   practice, the exception clause allowing withdrawals in excess of the Estimated Sustainable Income has provided
   the government with a high degree of discretion, which it has used at the cost of longer-term sustainability
   and which it now has little incentive to forego. In Tuvalu, in contrast, the robust governance structure of
   the TTF—with two of the three board seats occupied by representatives independent of government—has
   helped ensure that its real value has been maintained over time. In Kiribati, the government has avoided
   introducing formal rules governing SWF contributions and withdrawals, in part because SWF withdrawals are
   viewed as politically costly, creating an incentive to avoid saving in the SWF in the first place. Nevertheless,
   despite varying degrees of success in meeting savings objectives, SWFs in Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, and Kiribati
   have at least assisted in insulating public expenditures from swings in resource revenues. To date, SWFs
   appear to be less successful in meeting both stabilization and savings goals in Mongolia and Papua New
   Guinea. In these cases, the established SWF rules are overly complex and not closely integrated with the
   overall fiscal framework, and in Mongolia the political commitment to effectively implement these rules
   (which may mean, for instance, forgoing shorter-term spending priorities) has been weak.


   5	Funds are nominally appropriated by the budget, but executed by autonomous entities such as the Infrastructure Fund and the Oecusse Special Economic Zone, which are
      not subject to standard government fiduciary rules and are able to transfer funds between existing or new projects within a budget year.




Sustaining growth and inclusion

Over the longer term, sustaining growth and ensuring that its fruits are widely distributed will require
redoubled efforts across a range of areas. While priorities will necessarily be country specific, some are important
across the region.

In China, the commitment to facilitate the rebalancing from investment-led to consumption-led growth,
as part of a program to increase overall productivity, needs to be complemented by continued efforts to
reduce poverty and promote inclusion. Measures to address financial and fiscal vulnerabilities, as discussed
above, will also support long-term growth. More broadly, the role of market discipline in allocating resources and
credit, including through financial sector reforms, should be enhanced to ensure that resources are allocated toward
the most productive uses. Despite China’s success in reducing poverty, a large share of its population remains

require improvements in access to services for the rural population, and for the still growing number of migrants
to the cities. In addition, there is scope to better target and monitor social assistance programs, and to promote

the region. In addition, water, sanitation, and housing services are facing significant strains across the region,12
including in higher-income Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, reflecting both urban-rural divides in service
delivery, and the challenges of rapid urbanization.

Infrastructural investment, including transportation improvements in the context of the Belt and Road
initiative, or appropriate infrastructure for special economic zones, may yield significant gains. Across
much of the region, public capital expenditure is relatively low and has been on a downward trend in recent
years. Several countries, and in particular Indonesia and the Philippines, have underinvested in infrastructure
for decades. Increased expenditure could yield large returns, especially given continued low borrowing costs. The
Belt and Road initiative may serve as a useful framework to coordinate investments across countries both inside
and outside the region, and potentially as a source of additional finance. The planned new and improved railways
alone would significantly reduce average freight transportation times, yielding large trade gains for most countries
in developing EAP (Box I.C.2). The benefits would be particularly large for countries that are more integrated in
regional and global value chains, where producers would enjoy more timely delivery of inputs; exports would
increase by 6 percent or more in China, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia. Quality infrastructure also plays a
critical role in enabling special economic zones to grow, generate jobs, and contribute to poverty reduction,
export diversification, and regional development (Box I.C.3). Indeed, well designed infrastructure has a much

  Box I.C.2. The Trade Effects of the Belt and Road Initiative1

  In 2013, President Xi of China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative to boost economic integration
  in the Eurasia region. This ambitious project aims at improving transport infrastructure, lowering trade
  barriers, deepening financial cooperation, and building stronger people-to-people bonds. The pillars of this
  initiative are the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (Map BI.C.2.1). The “Belt”
  focuses on building four new land corridors: the Eurasian Land Bridge, and the China-Mongolia-Russia,
  China-Central Asia-West Asia, and China-Indochina Peninsula economic corridors. The “Road” focuses on
  improving the maritime connectivity of China’s coast with Europe, through the South China Sea and the
  Indian Ocean, and with the South Pacific. Related to the Belt and Road Initiative are the land corridors
  China-Pakistan and Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar. Available estimates indicate that the plan, if fully
  implemented, would cost between US$4 trillion and US$8 trillion.

  This box analyzes the potential trade effects of the new and improved rail infrastructure proposed
  as part of the Belt and Road Initiative, using a combination of geographic and economic analysis.
  First, georeferenced data and geographical information systems (GIS) analysis are used to compute the
  reduction in bilateral trade time induced by the proposed (new or improved) railway infrastructure (Map
  BI.C.2.2).2 This analysis incorporates information on the relative share of different transportation modes
                                                                                                                                                                              (continued)

          Competitiveness Global Practice, World Bank). Based on Baniya et al. (Forthcoming).
  2	      The impact of the Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative is estimated by measuring connectivity (defined as the bilateral travel time in hours by rail) between capitals and major cities
          in the Eurasian countries under two scenarios: before the proposed interventions (pre-B&R) and after the interventions (post-B&R). Routing is determined by minimum travel
          time, computed as a function of distance and speed. Speed along the new and improved railroads is assumed to equal 75 kilometers per hour, while speed in the pre-B&R
          scenario is assumed to equal 50 kilometers per hour. Improvements in sea, air, or road networks are not explicitly included in the analysis, owing to lack of information.
          Instead, the estimates control for the fact that goods can be shipped using different transportation modes, and that for certain products there is scope to switch transportation
          modes (see Baniya et al., Forthcoming, for details).

    in the export of different products. Second, econometric analysis is used to estimate the total effect of any
    given improvement in bilateral trade time on bilateral export values. This analysis captures the impact of
    both consumers’ preference for faster delivery of final goods, and producers’ need for timely delivery of
    inputs. It also takes into account that different products are affected differently by changes in trade times.3


                                                                                                                                                                                 (continued)

    	       Xijg is the bilateral export value of product g from country i to country j in 2013 (that is, pre-B&R).
    	       GisTimeij is the shortest travel time from country i to country j using rail transportation in 2013 from the GIS analysis. For those country pairs ij for which there is no rail
            connection in 2013, a matching technique is adopted: pre-B&R bilateral travel times are computed as the average of the travel times of a set of “nearest neighbor” trade
            pairs, which are matched to the pair ij based on the physical distance between the trade partners.
    	       tg is the consumption time sensitivity of product g, which captures how much consumers are willing to pay for fast delivery of this product (direct effect). t̃g is the production
            time sensitivity of product g and reflects how intensely producers demand the timely delivery of their inputs (indirect effect). The direct and indirect time sensitivities are
            computed in Hummels and Schaur (2013) and in Baniya (Forthcoming), respectively.
    	       The specification also includes a large set of fixed effects, and a number of other variables suggested by the relevant literature. The estimation technique addresses potential
            endogeneity problems.

  Finally, the actual impact of the Belt and Road on bilateral trade flows is calculated by combining the above
  GIS and econometric estimates.4
  The Belt and Road rail initiative would both create new connections in the Eurasian region and
  reduce trade time along existing rail links by 26 percent, on average. Average trade time reductions
  for individual developing regions range between 25 percent and 32 percent (Figure BI.C.2.1). Within
  developing EAP, trade time is reduced most, by around 30 percent, for China, and by 25 percent or more for
  Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam (Figure BI.C.2.2).

     Belt and Road rail improvements would significantly increase total Eurasian trade. A plausible upper-
     bound estimate is that trade would increase by 13 percent. This assumes that faster trade times benefit
     both consumers (direct effect) and producers (indirect effect), and that trade in all products can switch
     transportation modes relatively easily to take advantage of the improved rail links. A lower-bound estimate
     is that trade would increase by 1.3 percent. This assumes that faster trade times benefit consumers alone,
     and that there is no switching between different modes of transportation.
     Belt and Road rail improvements would lead to significant trade gains for most countries in EAP.
     All developing regions would experience substantial trade gains (Figure BI.C.2.3). Within developing EAP,
     the gains would be largest for China, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia, where exports would increase by
     more than 6 percent (upper-bound estimates) (Figure BI.C.2.4). Differences across countries reflect both
     the extent of improved connectivity, and the export structure of the country—time-sensitive products and
     products that require time-sensitive inputs into production are more strongly impacted. In general, the
     biggest trade gains stem from improvements in trade times for inputs whose timely delivery is highly valued
     by producers. Put differently, countries that are more integrated in regional and global value chains tend to
     benefit more from reductions in trade times.
     Significant uncertainty attaches to these estimates. First, Belt and Road is a fluid project: details of
     infrastructure investment are not known, and specifics will obviously affect the time to trade. Second, a full
     assessment would need to incorporate other factors (for instance, the potential for improved infrastructure
     to stimulate exports of new products). Third, infrastructure improvements are just one element of Belt
     and Road; reduction in trade barriers and other forms of international cooperation are likely to contribute
     further to the deepening of trade relations. This suggests that the above findings may provide a conservative
     estimate of the trade impact of Belt and Road.


greater impact on the success of special economic zones than tax incentives or regulatory exemptions. That said,
the numerous examples of special economic zones that failed to thrive despite large investments point to the
importance of a focus on the efficiency of investment (see below).

A rebalancing of public expenditure, and greater public-private cooperation, will help address
infrastructure deficits. Even in countries where overall public expenditure has been increasing, such as Mongolia
and the Philippines, there is significant scope to redirect spending toward productivity-enhancing areas. Likewise,
in Cambodia, where the public service wage bill is rising rapidly, the policy focus should shift to raising public
investment. The private sector can play a significant complementary role in addressing infrastructure deficits, but
this will require improvements to the regulatory framework for public-private partnerships, aimed at curtailing
regulatory risk and supporting fair, open competition.13

Increased infrastructure expenditure must be accompanied by a focus on ensuring value for money, and
tackling underlying legal and regulatory barriers to project implementation. To meet the objectives of public
infrastructure programs, increased expenditure allocations need to be complemented by reforms to improve the
efficiency of public investment. Managing public investment programs already constitutes a significant challenge
across much of the region (Figure I.C.1), and performance could deteriorate further in the face of rapid scale-

ups of expenditure. In general, rigorous, transparent, and accountable processes for project selection, appraisal,
procurement, and evaluation, and for the efficient operation and sustained maintenance of assets, need to be
developed and strengthened across the region. In Indonesia, public infrastructure investment faces significant
challenges with respect to project selection, project management, and procurement and budget processes. In
Thailand, the currently fragmented planning and budgeting process would benefit from integration. In Vietnam,
project implementation by local governments and SOEs is often significantly delayed. In Myanmar and Timor-Leste,
among other countries, public investment management frameworks are still undeveloped and ambiguous. Several
countries have manifested a commitment to reform, but the focus must now shift to implementation.

Such efforts to enhance productivity must be complemented by a renewed focus on boosting inclusion.
Much of the region has seen broad-based growth in living standards over the past few years. But both poverty and
challenges to inclusiveness remain elevated in several countries, especially in rural and lagging areas, for instance
in Indonesia and the Philippines, and among disadvantaged groups, including ethnic minorities in Vietnam (Box
I.A.2). Three issues are highlighted below.

First, undernutrition leads to lifelong disadvantage; reducing it would significantly increase human
welfare, promote inclusion, and foster growth in much of developing EAP. High levels of undernutrition
persist in many countries in the region, even relatively affluent ones.14 Infant and child undernutrition, in particular,
generate health and cognitive deficits that are difficult to reverse. As a result, undernutrition elevates the risk of
infant and child morbidity and mortality, leads to increased expenditure on health care and social safety nets,
lowers the efficiency of investments in education, and decreases lifelong income-earning potential and labor
force productivity. Further, undernutrition and poverty are mutually reinforcing, with significant implications for
equality of opportunity and the intergenerational transmission of inequality.

Reducing undernutrition will require coordinated measures across a range of areas; early childhood
development programs hold particular promise. Undernutrition is the outcome of multiple factors including
poor maternal, infant, and child caring and feeding practices; limited availability and affordability of nutritious
foods; limited access to preventive and primary health care, clean water, and appropriate sanitation; and the low
social status of women. But many high-return, operationally proven strategies are available to tackle the problem
(Chapter II.A, “Tackling Malnutrition in East Asia and the Pacific–An Agenda for Growth and Inclusion”). For
instance, early childhood nutritional interventions, targeting the critical window of opportunity from conception
through the first two years of life, cost relatively little but have long-lasting effects on nutritional status. As a
result, they also enhance long-term learning outcomes and labor market productivity, especially when combined
with broader early childhood stimulation (Gertler et al. 2014; World Bank 2015b). Specific measures include
behavior change and communication interventions to ensure optimal nutrition and care during pregnancy and
early childhood; micronutrient interventions and deworming to enhance the consumption of essential vitamins and
minerals; and complementary feeding interventions to reduce acute malnutrition.

Second, technological developments hold great promise for transforming financial services across low- and
middle-income economies, with significant implications for financial inclusion and productivity. Digital
technologies accessed via mobile platforms, big data, and cloud computing are enabling the rapid emergence of



14	 Even in upper-middle-income countries, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, undernutrition rates exceed those found in some much poorer countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South
    Asia.

    Box I.C.3. Special Economic Zones and Economic Performance: Lessons from East Asia1

    Cities, regions, and countries across the emerging world are increasingly developing Special
    Economic Zones (SEZs). There are approximately 3,500 SEZs in more than 130 countries, directly employing
    approximately 68 million people. Their goal is to drive growth, generate employment, attract foreign direct
    investment, and narrow the technology gap with more developed countries. East Asia spearheaded the
    development of SEZs: the Republic of Korea introduced its first special economic zone in 1970 (Masan), the
    Philippines in 1975 (Bataan), China in 1980 (Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen), and Vietnam in
    1991 (Tan Thuan).
    SEZs share common characteristics, but differ in significant ways across countries, and even within
    (mostly large) countries. Key common factors include a geographically defined area; a specific regulatory
    and legal framework for firms within the zone (for instance, fast-track business registration, easier import
    and export licensing, and flexible application of labor laws); dedicated, subsidized infrastructure; and a
    special fiscal and incentive regime (for instance, duty-free status, tax holidays, and skills-training and land-
    rental subsidies).2 However, the detailed application of these factors may differ across zones.
    The policy objectives behind SEZs are largely similar. They include increased economic activity, job
    creation, increased household incomes, poverty reduction, export diversification, and regional/spatial
    development. Firm-level objectives are related to attracting foreign direct investment; boosting firms’
    investment, innovation, productivity, profitability, and growth; and enhancing cross-firm coordination and
    networks.

    Despite the proliferation of SEZs, there is surprisingly little evidence on their economic impact, or on
    the factors that determine their success. In particular, there is a dearth of large comparative quantitative
    analyses of the drivers of SEZ success. Previous studies have tentatively identified some determinants of
    success, such as the establishment of a clear policy objective and an institutional framework to implement
    an SEZ policy, experience in dealing with investors and understanding market demand, the location of
    economic zones and infrastructure planning within SEZs, and linkage programs to encourage spillovers to

  the broader local economy (Farole 2011). However, the statistical evidence is typically weak. And case studies
  have tended to focus only on the most successful zones (for instance, Shenzhen). The scarcity of analyses is
  related partly to the relative novelty of SEZs, but more fundamentally to lack of adequate comparable data
  about their performance. Data on firm growth, export performance, and job creation in most SEZs across
  the emerging world are scarce and, when available, there are often questions about their reliability. Hence,
  alternative data sources on SEZ performance are needed.

    there is a strong correlation between changes in nightlights and in economic activity. However, nightlights
    tend to underrate economic activities that emit less light, including, in particular, agriculture and services.
    The suitability of nightlights for this analysis was confirmed by collecting alternative performance measures,
    specifically data on the number of companies and on employment, for a number of SEZs. These alternative
    measures are clearly and positively associated with nightlights (Figure BI.C.3.1).

    in four East Asian countries—China, Korea, the Philippines, and Vietnam             (Table BI.C.3.1). The initial
    sample included over 1,000 SEZs; strict criteria relating to the size, start-up date, type of activity in the zone,
    and data availability were used to determine the final sample.4

   SEZ performance is critically influenced by the local and national contexts in which they operate.
   Zones operating in relatively low-cost locations, preferably in the vicinity of and well connected to large
   markets, and in areas with previous specialization in manufacturing have performed better. Given the low-
   tech nature of many successful zones, the role of factors such as local skills and levels of agglomeration
   has been more limited. Moreover, the economic growth of zones spilled over to neighboring areas, but this
   impact was in general limited to the immediate vicinity of the zone.
   SEZ characteristics also play a significant role in the growth of zones and the surrounding area. In
   general, successful zones tend to build on local strengths. Relatedly, the technological component of the zone
   has an impact: low-tech, low-cost manufacturing zones on average performed better than those pursuing
   higher-tech, more research-intensive paths. Recent efforts to upgrade the technological component of zones
   have not yet paid off. Also, more recently established zones are on average characterized by significantly
   higher growth than older, more mature zones. However, there are exceptions; some of the most dynamic
   zones in Korea and the Philippines were already set up in the 1990s.
   In contrast, incentive programs to attract investment have had an uneven impact on SEZ performance.
   Overall, these programs, in which East Asian countries have invested heavily, made little substantial difference
   to the economic trajectory of SEZs, implying that caution is required when setting up the programs. The
   most common type of incentive, corporate tax breaks, had a limited effect on performance; the impact was
   relatively larger in more developed countries. Similarly, neither exemptions from local labor regulations
   nor the presence of one-stop shops made a significant difference to zone dynamism. Utility subsidies, in
   contrast, played a considerable role in the initial growth of SEZs; however, they provide no guarantee that
   economic performance will be sustained beyond the initial years of operation.



new financial products and business models. Examples include marketplace finance (equity and debt crowdfunding),
and cashless payment technologies, including mobile payments. Developing EAP is well placed to benefit from such
developments. The region is technologically advanced, with a high level of mobile phone penetration (including
in lower-income Cambodia, Lao PDR, and, increasingly, Myanmar) and internet access, widespread use of social
media and electronic commerce, and a significant global role in ICT manufacturing and software development. At
the same time, developing EAP still lags in terms of access to financial services (for instance, only 30 percent of
individuals hold bank accounts), raising the economic and social payoff to successful innovation.

Significant reforms are needed to harness the full potential of new technology for financial development
and inclusion. In particular, countries across the region will need to strengthen the relevant legal and regulatory
frameworks; improve their financial infrastructure, including the breadth and depth of borrower credit data;
and address challenges related to financial capability, consumer protection, and privacy (Chapter II.B, “How will
technology disrupt financial services in EAP?”).

Third, innovations in social protection can significantly reduce vulnerability to shocks and minimize
their long-term impact among the poor. In the face of major shocks, the poor and vulnerable often have
to cut their spending on education and health care or sell productive assets, with a permanent impact on their
human development and income-earning potential. Natural disasters are a particular concern, both because of

their relative frequency in the region, and because the poor often live in vulnerable areas. Policy makers should
therefore build on ongoing efforts to develop “adaptive safety nets”. These systems flexibly take into account the
exposure of households to different risks by, for instance, rapidly expanding conditional cash transfer programs
while waiving their conditions in the wake of natural disasters (Box I.C.4). In turn, these features help increase
resilience at both the household and macroeconomic levels.

The long-term outlook for growth and inclusion in the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) hinges on their
ability to maximize the benefits from their limited opportunities, including fisheries, migrant workers,
and tourism. Three priorities stand out. First is fully harnessing the potential riches of tuna fisheries. Recent
policy measures have already sharply increased revenue from fishing fees and enhanced sustainability. Further
reforms could yield significant additional revenue gains, but need to be underpinned by expanded investments in
policy delivery capacity, including partnerships with regional and international organizations (Box I.C.5). Second
is expanding opportunities for PIC residents to work abroad. Remittance flows to the PICs as a share of GDP are
already among the largest in the world, with very large diasporas relative to the size of their resident population.
Nevertheless, existing regional seasonal worker programs, such as Australia’s and New Zealand’s, are heavily
oversubscribed, and new or enlarged migration pathways could significantly increase income-earning opportunities.
To that end, policy must focus on providing potential migrants with marketable skills, offering better employment
intermediation services to both workers and employers, and introducing social support services to mitigate the
impact of the temporary separation of family members (Box I.C.6). Finally, the tourism sector, currently reliant on
its traditional Australian and New Zealand markets, could be significantly boosted by improvements in connections
and facilities to serve the potentially much larger East Asian market.

  Restoring aggregate economic growth is a significant macroeconomic policy concern in the wake
  of natural disasters, but natural disasters also have the potential to adversely affect poverty and
  shared prosperity. The poor are generally more exposed to negative impacts from natural disasters,
  because they live in more vulnerable areas and more vulnerable housing, hold a higher proportion of their
  assets in material—and thus physically vulnerable—forms, and depend on subsistence production for a
  higher proportion of their food consumption. Because the poor tend to have low savings and poor access to
  credit and insurance, they are more likely to have to rely on negative coping strategies in the face of major
  shocks, such as reducing essential food consumption, health care spending, or educational investment;
  and selling productive assets. These negative coping strategies adversely affect their human development
  and reduce their future income-earning potential. If not addressed, natural disasters can leave the poor
  with permanently lower productive capacities, undermining efforts to alleviate poverty and boost shared
  prosperity.
  In recognition of the severe impact natural disasters can have on the poor, governments in the
  EAP region are increasingly investing in adaptive safety nets. Building on existing social protection
  programs, these take into account the exposure and vulnerability of households to different risks and how
  social protection can help them respond and cope. They are flexible in their ability to incorporate new design
  characteristics and scale, both vertically (higher benefit levels) and horizontally (reaching a wider segment
  of the population) following natural disasters. In the Philippines, following Typhoon Yolanda in 2013, the
  government waived the conditions (relating to school attendance and child health) of its conditional cash
  transfer program, the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), for a defined period in affected areas.
  This demonstrated the potential of social protection programs to deliver assistance quickly to affected
  populations in the wake of natural disasters, with existing beneficiaries receiving US$12.5 million. Moreover,
  other development partners, including the World Food Programme and UNICEF, were able to channel their
  assistance to the poor in affected areas more effectively through the 4Ps system. The government is actively
  looking to build on this experience through the adoption of an Emergency Cash Transfer program that is
  able to deliver cash transfers to an even larger share of affected households following natural disasters. It is
  also looking at measures that can help households prepare ex ante (the 4Ps, for instance, already included
  family development sessions aimed at addressing disaster preparedness).
  This year, following Tropical Cyclone Winston, Fiji became the first Pacific Island Country to channel
  postdisaster assistance through its existing safety net. With wind speeds of up to 306 kilometers
  per hour, Tropical Cyclone Winston was one of the most powerful cyclones ever recorded in the Southern
  Hemisphere and the first Category 5 cyclone to directly strike Fiji. Total damage and losses to the productive,
  social, and infrastructure sectors were estimated at 22 percent of GDP, rising to 31 percent of GDP with
  damage to the environment and losses in ecosystem services. The highest per capita damage and losses were
  incurred in areas where average household incomes are lower, primarily because the cyclone struck a path
  across rural Fiji where average household incomes are lower—itself correlated with an increased propensity
  to use nonrobust housing materials—and where agriculture is of overwhelming importance to livelihoods.
  The government swiftly mobilized funds through its existing social protection programs to channel assistance
  to poor households and vulnerable groups. The 22,802 households covered by the Poverty Benefit Scheme
  were paid a lump sum of US$300 each, while a further 21,095 households and individuals covered by
  the Care & Protection Allowance for vulnerable households and the Social Pension Scheme for the elderly
                                                                                                              (continued)

    received US$150 each. This was equivalent to three months of their regular benefits and was designed to
    help poor households and vulnerable groups meet their immediate expenses for basic needs.
    In an initiative that will have global relevance, the Government of Fiji has supported a comprehensive
    impact evaluation of this postdisaster assistance. The initial results from the evaluation suggest that
    poor households did suffer severe losses in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Winston, and that adaptive safety
    nets were effective in assisting them to cope. Of all households that received additional cash assistance,
    37 percent lost their entire dwelling, 74 percent

    Investments in adaptive safety nets can help countries in the EAP region achieve their poverty
    alleviation goals, boost shared prosperity, and strengthen macroeconomic resilience. The experience
    to date in EAP demonstrates that in the wake of natural disasters, adaptive safety nets have the potential to
    mitigate the impact of natural disasters on poor households and vulnerable groups. By reducing their need
    to resort to negative coping strategies, adaptive safety nets can help to protect their investments in human
    development and preserve their income-earning potential. By helping to maintain the productive capacities
    of the least well-off in the wake of natural disasters, adaptive safety nets contribute to the postdisaster
    recovery of aggregate economic growth, but they do so in a way that also helps to keep poverty alleviation
    efforts on course and that preserves the share of the bottom four deciles in aggregate prosperity.

  Box I.C.5. Harnessing the Riches of Pacific Tuna Fisheries1

  Pacific Island Countries (PICs) enjoy abundant tuna resources. Their waters supply some 34 percent of
  the world’s tuna, with an estimated delivered value to processors of around US$3.4 billion in recent years
  (FFA 2014). Their three key fisheries (purse seine, tropical longline, and southern albacore longline) form
  the basis of several global supply chains, with tuna caught in PIC waters ending with consumers in Europe,
  Japan, or North America (Gillett 2014). PICs can charge harvesters fees for access to the fish stocks found
  in their waters. The greater the profitability of fishing, the higher the fees that harvesters can afford to pay.
  Recent policy reforms in PICs have dramatically increased the revenue they receive from the purse
  seine fishery. Before 2009, PICs received relatively constant access fees of approximately US$60 million
  per year from (largely foreign) harvesters, typically
  amounting to less than 10 percent, and in some
                                                         Figure BI.C.5.1. Estimated tuna purse seine access

  introduced by PICs for longline fisheries.5


  These reforms have also enhanced sustainability. The expansion of global tuna fishery supply chains had
  led to growing concerns about overexploitation. The vessel day scheme sets a cap on total fishing activity
  in line with scientists’ recommendations for maintaining a stock that can support the maximum sustainable
  yield, thereby protecting the region’s natural capital asset base. This cap has remained relatively constant
  since the introduction of the vessel day scheme. However, a key challenge emerging in recent years has been
  the change in the status of the bigeye tuna stock to overfished.6

REDUCING VULNERABILITIES




    (Box I.C.5 continued)


    There are five key priorities for further policy reforms  to sustainably enhance the contribution of the
    region’s tuna resources to its economic growth in the coming decades:
         1.	Broadened regional cooperation. Existing coalitions of PICs could be expanded to include other key
            resource owners, such as Indonesia and the Philippines in the purse seine arrangements, and Indonesia
            in the tropical longline arrangements. This would place most of the world’s skipjack tuna stock under one
            cooperative, robust management scheme. This should be coupled with continued restrictions on fishing
            in the high seas for vessels that want to fish in the waters of PNA members.
         2.	Hard limits on fishing effort and catch. This will ensure sustainability of tuna stocks, as well as
            constrain supply, and hence increase price. Rebuilding the bigeye tuna stock before further declines
            will require proactive efforts and upfront investments, including research and development to reduce
            by-catch coupled with regulations on fishing gear.
         3.	Increased flexibility of fishing access rights, for instance, by increasing the duration of access
            rights, pooling access rights (that is, offering rights to access multiple countries’ waters), eventually
            denominating access rights in terms of catch quota rather than inputs (that is, days that a vessel may
            fish), and potentially allowing auctions of rights. This will provide fishing companies with enhanced
            flexibility and security, in turn enhancing the value of the fisheries without increasing production. It will
            also afford interested PICs a tool to leverage greater foreign investment in processing, trading off access
            fees for foreign investment in local processing.
         4.	Significant investment in skills and capacity for fisheries management. The goal is to develop
            highly skilled tuna managers, improve compliance with catch limits and access rights, and prevent
            illegal fishing.
         5.	Inclusion of coastal communities in the fisheries. This will require targeted investments to maintain
            food security, given stagnating coastal fish supplies and growing populations.
    Continued, expanded investment in policy delivery capacity must underpin such reforms. The focus
    should be on increasing the capacity of the regional agencies that support the information base underlying
    fishing limits and compliance monitoring, of the secretariats of regional coalitions that set fishing limits,
    and of the national agencies developing and implementing policy within countries’ waters. Tools include
    expanded staffing, training, partnerships with regional and international organizations, and dedicated
    regional programs and activities.
    Such a coordinated reform package would yield significant economic benefits to PICs, largely in the
    form of increased public revenues received from foreign operators. By 2040, public revenues would
    increase on a sustainable basis by US$177 million to US$345 million per year (55 to 107 percent of 2014
    public revenues), even after deducting required investments, including in administration, monitoring, and
    surveillance (Table BI.C.5.1).7 And, in the PICs with local processing clusters, aggregate local value added
    would increase by US$88 million per year (specifically, by 8 percent, 0.3 percent, and 1.3 percent of 2014
    GDP in the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands, respectively), and 7,500 to 15,000
    additional jobs (less than 0.5 percent of the regional labor force) would be created.
                                                                                                                                                                           (continued)


    7	     The analysis employs all data available through 2015 on trends in the growth of Pacific tuna fisheries since the 1950s, the structure and extent of current value chains, and
           current contributions to GDP, employment, and sustainability. It controls for the impact of trends in key exogenous factors, including climate change, global macroeconomic
           outcomes, science and technology, demography, and external governance. It largely draws on databases and published reports from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries
           Commission and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, supplemented by consultations with experts.

    Box I.C.6. Boosting Labor Mobility in the Pacific1

    Given the geography, size, and changing demographics of the Pacific, labor mobility offers an
    important pathway to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The Pacific Island Countries face a triple
    burden of economic geography as a result of their small size, remoteness, and internal dispersion. Kiribati,
    for example, is set out across 3.5 million square kilometers of ocean (approximately the land mass of India),
    but with a population equivalent to less than 1 percent of Mumbai’s. These structural characteristics coupled
    with a high exposure to natural disasters have limited
    the region’s ability to generate economic growth         Figure BI.C.6.1. Growth in populations and

    almost double the EAP average. As a result, many           2

    parts of the region have seen employment rates
    decline at a time when working-age populations are         0

    where jobs are located.
    While access to overseas job opportunities varies across the Pacific, it remains severely constrained
    for the vast majority, especially those who live in poorer countries. There are three groups of countries,
    with differing access to overseas labor markets. First are the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau, which
    enjoy free and unhindered access to labor markets in the United States, under the Compact of Free Association.
    The number of emigrants equals about one-third of these countries’ resident populations. Second are Fiji,
    Samoa, and Tonga, where the number of emigrants equals 26 percent of the resident populations, mostly
    as the result of historical ties with Australia and New Zealand and bilateral migration agreements with the
    latter. However, even in these two groups of countries, the poor face constraints on taking advantage of
    available migration opportunities, given the high costs of migration and their lack of tradable skills. Most
    important, the vast majority (95 percent) of the population of the Pacific live in the low mobility countries
    of Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, and in the atoll countries of Kiribati and Tuvalu.
    Migration opportunities remain mostly out of reach in these economies, which on average are also relatively
    poor; the number of emigrants is less than 1 percent of their population.
    The World Bank’s forthcoming Pacific Possible report examines potential benefits over the next
    25 years if both labor-sending and labor-receiving countries around the Pacific Rim were to
    significantly remove barriers to labor migration and undertake complementary measures. Key
    proposed reforms in the receiving countries include expanding access through existing migration pathways,
    such as the seasonal worker schemes and the working holiday programs in Australia and New Zealand;
    opening up access to new labor markets, such as in the Republic of Korea via its Employment Permit System;
    providing access to new sectors, like aged care, through programs tailored for the Pacific; and expanding
    opportunities for permanent migration, especially for the low mobility and atoll countries most impacted by

                                                                                                                            (continued)

  climate change. The Pacific Island labor-sending countries can develop appropriate education and training
  systems that provide potential migrants with marketable skills; provide better employment intermediation
  services to both workers and employers; and introduce support services to mitigate the negative social
  impacts of labor mobility, especially those that arise from the temporary separation of family members
  working in seasonal employment schemes. Managing potential brain drain through sensible domestic wage
  policy will also be necessary.
  These migration reforms could lead to significant growth in the number of migrants and the
  employment opportunities they enjoy. The report considers three scenarios: business as usual, partial
  reform,2 and full reform.3 With full reform, the total number of Pacific migrants in 2040 would be
  approximately 50 percent larger than under business as usual (Figure BI.C.6.2). Relative to 2013, the
  migrant stock would increase ninefold in low mobility countries, and almost sixfold in atoll countries.

  The reforms would also yield significant welfare gains. With full reform, migrants’ incomes would increase
  by around US$10 billion (approximately one-third of current gross national income), and remittances to the
  Pacific Islands by around US$800 million. The impacts would vary substantially across countries, and be
  relatively large in the low mobility and atoll countries (Figure BI.C.6.3). Moreover, the impacts of higher
  migration from the Pacific on receiving countries would be minimal, because employed Pacific migrants
  would account for an insignificant share of receiving country populations (for instance, about 1 percent in
  Australia). The gains with partial reform are half as large as with full reform. These findings suggest that
  labor mobility will prove critical in addressing the Pacific’s unemployment challenge and raising living
  standards in the face of limited domestic growth.

II.A.	 Tackling Malnutrition in East Asia and Pacific–
       An Agenda for Growth and Inclusion1
             Malnutrition, which encompasses both undernutrition and overnutrition, presents a significant challenge
             to continued economic growth in developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP). The persistence of high levels
             of undernutrition despite decades of economic growth and poverty reduction represents a staggering,
             yet avoidable, loss of human and economic potential. Undernutrition elevates the risk of infant and
             child morbidity and mortality, increases expenditure on health care and social safety nets, lowers the
             efficiency of investments in education, and decreases lifelong income-earning potential and labor force
             productivity, with the potential to be transmitted across generations. Overnutrition compounds the
             challenges. Overweight rates in Southeast Asia and the Pacific have risen rapidly in the last three
             decades. A continuation of this trend will lead to escalating costs of managing and treating overweight/
             obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases, and present immense challenges for financing
             health systems.

             Appropriate policy responses to malnutrition will vary across the region, depending on the degree
             and type of malnutrition. Overall, many high-return, operationally proven strategies are available. But
             successfully addressing the challenge requires tackling the critical determinants across multiple sectors.
             In particular, undernutrition is not solely a function of poverty. Its drivers include maternal and child-
             caring practices, partly shaped by inadequate information; food security; access to health, clean water,
             and appropriate sanitation; and the social status of women. Comprehensive behavioral and nutritional
             interventions from conception through early childhood hold particular promise for ensuring that every
             child reaches his or her full physical and cognitive potential.




I.	          nvestment in Nutrition in EAP: An Essential Foundation
             I
             for Sustained Economic Growth

Malnutrition, encompassing both undernutrition and overnutrition, presents a significant development
challenge across much of East Asia and Pacific (EAP). With the exception of the small Pacific Island Countries
(PICs), all of the region’s lower-income countries face an unfinished agenda with regard to undernutrition. In
these countries, at least one in five children (under age five) will likely face lifelong learning and productivity
impairments due to stunted physical and cognitive development. Simultaneously, the growing prevalence
of overweight and obesity, among both children and adults, generates large societal and economic costs. The
associated noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), the cost of managing and treating them, the inevitable premature
deaths, and the impact on productivity (Bloom et al. 2011) are enormous challenges facing the region.

Widespread malnutrition in EAP is symptomatic of market failures that have a significant impact on
welfare and urgently require corrective public action. Continued economic growth by itself will not solve
all the underlying problems, certainly not for decades—a period during which much of the population would

suffer irreparable damage. There is a small window of opportunity—before age three—to provide the adequate
nutrition and stimulation to maximize brain development. Further, growth itself will be undermined by persistent
malnutrition. Also, some market failures reflect equity considerations. Malnutrition and poverty are mutually
reinforcing, with the wealth disparities in reading, language, and cognitive performance emerging even before
children enter primary school. Investing in early life can contribute to inclusive growth by addressing inequality
in access to services, and giving poor children the greatest opportunity to break the cycle of poverty and improve
adult outcomes. In addition, reductions in malnutrition rely on the provision of various public goods, including
essential information (for instance, on healthy child-caring practices and diets) and public services. And much
of the cost of malnutrition is borne by the wider community, through public financing of health systems, giving
society a stake in reducing relevant risk factors, including by facilitating behavioral changes.

High-return, operationally proven investments in malnutrition are available; in many cases they require
coordinated multisectoral strategies. Interventions targeted at the early years of life (between conception and
transition into primary school) to reduce malnutrition and increase access to early childhood care, stimulation, and
learning are necessary in order to ensure that from birth, every child in EAP has the greatest possible opportunity to
reach his or her full potential to learn, earn, innovate, and compete. Global evaluations of development assistance
have consistently shown that nutrition interventions are highly cost-effective, and are among the highest-return
investments available to governments and donors.2 Interventions in the child’s first five years of life have much
higher rates of return than interventions aimed at addressing skills and capacities in later life. The impact of
interventions is magnified when they are undertaken early and are implemented across multiple sectors.




II.	        Malnutrition in East Asia and Pacific

Undernutrition remains prevalent in many EAP countries, despite decades of strong economic growth and
poverty reduction. Chronic undernutrition, as proxied by childhood stunting, is associated with severe and largely
irreversible cognitive (brain) underdevelopment (Box II.A.1). The prevalence of stunting in several EAP countries
remains high compared to levels observed in other developing countries, and what would be expected given
average GDP per capita. For instance, Indonesia and the Philippines are on the verge of achieving upper-middle-
income status, yet have stunting levels comparable to (or even exceeding) some South Asian and Sub-Saharan
Africa countries with considerably lower levels of economic development (Figure II.A.1). Relatedly, progress over
time has been uneven. Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and several PICs have seen only limited reduction in
stunting; conversely, China has experienced a sharp decline in stunting (Figure II.A.2).

In some countries, undernutrition is a generalized phenomenon; in others, it mirrors broader inequalities
in income and status. In Cambodia, Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste, undernutrition is a generalized
phenomenon that affects all segments of the populations. In Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, wealthier
households have experienced significant improvements in stunting, but stunting remains high among the poor,
rural, and marginalized subpopulations, such as ethnic minorities.

       Box II.A.1. What exactly is malnutrition?

        he term “malnutrition” refers to a deviation from optimal nutritional status, and includes both undernutrition
       T
       and overnutrition.
       U
        ndernutrition refers to a state of nutritional deficiency and presents the most serious risks to health and
       development when experienced by women during pre-pregnancy/pregnancy/lactation and infant and young
       children. There are a variety of measures of undernutrition,1 but child stunting (low height-for-age in
       children under five years of age) is the type of undernutrition of most concern for policy makers and the
       focus of this note. Stunting results from chronic undernutrition and indicates a failure of a child to attain
       the height expected among healthy children. Height growth and brain development not achieved during the
       first 1,000 days of life (from conception to two years of age) is largely irrecoverable and is associated with
       measureable negative consequences for health, cognition, productivity, and income across the life course
       (Horton and Hoddinot 2014; Victora et al. 2010).
        vernutrition represents an oversupply of nutrients (usually macronutrients) relative to the body’s
       O
       physiological needs. Overnutrition is often measured as high Body Mass Index (BMI), and a person is
       considered overweight if his or her BMI is equal to or greater than 25 kilograms per square meter (kg/m2),
       and obese if BMI is equal to or greater than 30 kilograms per square meter.2 Elevated BMI is a major risk
       factor for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and some cancers.

       1. 
          Additional measures of undernutrition at the population level include inadequate weight-for-height in children under five (wasting), low weight-for-age in children
          under five (underweight), short stature and thinness among pregnant women, and micronutrient deficiencies among adult and child subgroups, such as iron-
          deficiency anemia, iodine deficiency, and vitamin A deficiency.
       2. 
          BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (kg/m2). BMI is a screening tool that provides the most useful population measure of
          increased health risks due to excess body fatness. However, it is not a perfect measure at the individual level because it does not measure body composition, that is,
          how much fat compared to muscle one has. Hence, the index can be misleading for individuals with high muscle tissue, which pushes up their weight. Nonetheless,
          BMI is highly correlated with gold standards of body composition measurement and, at the population level, BMI is still a reliable indicator of overnutrition.

REDUCING VULNERABILITIES




Overnutrition presents a rapidly rising challenge. Globally, the prevalence of obesity and overweight has
risen substantially in the past two to three decades. Within developing EAP, obesity has already reached pandemic
levels in most PICs, where more than one-half of adult women are obese. In Southeast Asia, standard cross-country
measures of overnutrition such as Body Mass Index (BMI) are low relative to other low- and middle-income regions
(Figure II.A.3). However, such measures understate the magnitude of overnutrition-related health problems among
East Asians.3

   any given BMI, Asians face a greater risk than other races of developing overnutrition-related NCDs (such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and adverse cardiovascular outcomes) (Low et al.
   2009; Wen et al. 2009). Consequently, alternative public health action cutoff points have been proposed for Asian populations, with a BMI of 23 to 27.5 denoting increased risk, and

demonstrate a high degree of heterogeneity in malnutrition, and can be classified into four categories based on
their malnutrition burden (Figure II.A.4). “Red” countries, including Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands,
and Vanuatu, face the dual burden of child stunting and adult overweight, that is, the seemingly paradoxical
combination of undernutrition and overnutrition. “Orange” countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines, and
Vietnam, have high stunting rates and lower but rising burdens of adult overweight. “Yellow” countries, including
China, Malaysia, and many PICs, have high levels of adult overweight, but limited child stunting. And the “green”
country of Thailand is experiencing neither challenge. The causes, consequences, and solutions to malnutrition
vary by typology, and are discussed next.




III.	        The Impact of Malnutrition on Health and Growth

Malnutrition in developing EAP leads to a staggering loss of human and economic potential. Malnutrition
affects health and economic growth through three key channels. It:

      •• Elevates the risk of morbidity and mortality, with the potential for transmission across generations.
      •• Decreases lifelong income earning potential and labor force productivity.
      •• Increases the costs of health care and social safety nets—largely borne by the public sector—and lowers
         the efficacy of investments in education.

As a result, the costs of child undernutrition in Asia may range from 4 percent to 11 percent of GDP
(Horton and Steckel 2013).4 Similarly, the global economic impact of obesity has been estimated at 2.8 percent
of global GDP (Dobbs et al. 2014).


ÌÌMorbidity, mortality, and disability

Undernutrition is the underlying cause of about 20 percent of maternal deaths and over 45 percent of child
deaths globally each year     (Black et al. 2008; Black et al. 2013). In many countries with high levels of stunting
(orange and red countries including Cambodia, Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste), child and maternal
undernutrition remains among the top three risk factors for disability, morbidity, and premature mortality. At the
regional level, child and maternal undernutrition were the greatest risk factors for death and disease in 1990, only
to be displaced by dietary risks in 2013 (but still ranking ninth) (Table II.A.1). Undernourished children are more
likely to suffer from serious infections and are at increased risk of death from common childhood illnesses such as
diarrhea, measles, pneumonia, malaria, or HIV/AIDS.

Overnutrition, and in particular the loss of healthy life from high BMI, dietary risks, and the associated
NCDs, are now the biggest health challenge facing the region, and in particular the high overweight
burden countries. Excess fat accumulation is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease



4	   Undernutrition is estimated to yield annual losses of 2.5 percent of GDP in Cambodia (Bagriansky et al. 2014) and 2.4 percent of GDP in Lao PDR (Bagriansky and Voladet 2013). In
     Cambodia, nearly half of the damage accrues before the child is even born, and roughly one-third is due to stunting (Bagriansky et al. 2014). These estimates reflect the impact of child
     mortality, decreased productivity, and excess health care expenditures

and stroke), type 2 diabetes, and some cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon). In the region, healthy life years5
lost due to high BMI increased by 81 percent between 1990 and 2013. Dietary factors (including diets high in
sodium and low in fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, and whole grains) are the region’s leading risk factor for
death and disease; cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death. In PICs such as Kiribati, the Federated
States of Micronesia, Samoa, and Tonga, diabetes is the leading cause of death; at least one-quarter of deaths from
NCDs in Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu are premature (IHME and World Bank 2013).

 Note: Risk factors are ranked 1 to 17 based on the total number of disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 in the country. High BMI refers to death and disease for which elevated BMI is a known risk factor. Dietary
 risks refers to diseases (mainly noncommunicable) for which a diet low in whole grains, fruits, and/or vegetables is a known risk factor.




The consequences of malnutrition can be passed from mother to offspring, resulting in the intergenerational
transmission of impaired human capital. Stunted mothers are three times as likely to have undernourished
infants, and between one-third and one-half of growth failure accrued by a child’s second birthday can be attributed
to poor growth as a fetus (Dewey and Huffman 2009). The scarcity of essential nutrients at key developmental
points can trigger alterations to cell metabolism and a variety of tissues (including brain tissue). These metabolic
alterations can cause permanent changes to the way in which sugars and fats are metabolized and accumulate in
the body. Thus, early life undernutrition increases risk of later-life obesity and other NCDs (Godfrey et al. 2007).
Similarly, obesity and hypertension among mothers is associated with higher infant mortality as well as obesity,
hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetes in later life (O’Reilly and Reynolds 2013).


ÌÌLabor productivity

Malnutrition is associated with lower labor force productivity in both the short and long term. Many of
the high stunting burden countries also experience a high burden of anemia among adults. Anemia6 directly
reduces work capacity, with a significant impact on agricultural labor capacity and output (Horton and Ross 2003).

     conditions, and blood losses), but the most common cause globally is iron deficiency

Similarly, obesity directly influences labor force productivity, owing to increased illness and lower productive
output while working (Chenoweth 2005).

Poor early-life nutrition and childhood stunting lead to poorer learning outcomes in school, and decreased
future productivity and earning potential. Stunting is associated with cognitive delays (Grantham-McGregor et
al. 2007) and lower educational attainment.7 Relatedly, stunting in childhood is associated with reduced height
and productivity as an adult.8 Conversely, children who are well nourished during their early years have 5 to
50 percent higher incomes as adults, and are 33 percent more likely to escape poverty (Hoddinott et al. 2011).

Malnutrition and poverty can generate a vicious cycle. Although many nonpoor people are undernourished, the
prevalence of undernutrition is often two or three times—and sometimes many times—higher among the poorest
income quintile than among the richest quintile. Poor people may therefore not be sufficiently well nourished and
healthy to take advantage of broad improvements in
income-earning opportunities. Conversely, creating an     Figure II.A.5. Expected relative change in working-age

ÌÌExpenditure on health and social services

Malnutrition leads to increased, as well as less efficient, expenditure on health and social services, often
borne by the public fiscal system. This reflects the impact of malnutrition on morbidity, mortality, and poverty
(see above). Well-nourished populations are healthier and spend less on health care. In high stunting burden
countries, maternal and child undernutrition translate into higher frequency and severity of illness, and therefore
increased health care costs.9

In particular, overweight/obesity and the associated diet-related NCDs are a growing challenge from a
health financing perspective. Direct health care costs related to treatment of obesity and associated chronic



7	   On average, stunting and associated nutrient deficiencies can result in delays in starting school, loss of attained schooling (Hoddinott et al. 2013), and a higher likelihood of children
     dropping out of school. In addition, children suffering from iodine deficiency lose on average 13 IQ points, and iron deficiency anemia reduces performance on tests by 8 IQ points
     (World Bank 2006).
8	   Several studies document associations between height and labor market outcomes (Hoddinott et al. 2013). For example, a 1 percent increase in adult height is associated with a
     2.4 percent increase in productivity (Thomas and Strauss 1997). The effect may arise because adult height is a proxy for general health, social skills, and social class.
9	   In Cambodia, for instance, undernutrition results in an additional US$10.3 million in public and private health care costs (Bagriansky et al. 2014).

diseases are expected to increase in many EAP countries (Ng et al. 2014).10 Relatedly, many countries with high
stunting burden currently lack the capacity to identify overweight/obesity and treat associated diet-related NCDs.
This may result in lower health care expenditures, but also in significantly increased disability and premature
mortality.

Malnutrition also decreases the efficacy of spending on other social services, particularly education. As
discussed, stunting is associated with cognitive delays, schooling deficits, and poorer learning outcomes. Therefore,
in high stunting burden countries, between one-quarter and one-half of children are unable to realize the full
benefit of public investments in education.




IV.	           Drivers of Undernutrition

Poor countries and poor households suffer from higher rates of undernutrition. At the country level,
economic growth, particularly starting from low initial GDP, is associated with reductions in stunting.11 Rising
incomes enable improvements in access to sanitation, women’s education, and the quantity and quality of food
(Smith and Haddad 2015). Across most of the region, stunting rates are higher among poorer households (Figure
II.A.6). Good nutrition is a long-term investment, and poor families lack the resources and knowledge to finance
this investment.

However, undernutrition is not solely a function of poverty. Stunting rates vary widely even controlling for
(country or household) income levels. In countries including Cambodia, Lao PDR, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste,
stunting is prevalent even among the wealthiest quintile. This pattern is not unique to EAP: middle-income countries
in Latin America, South Asia, and Africa display similar trends.


10	 In the Republic of Korea, for instance, the socioeconomic costs of overweight and obesity among adults aged 20 and older were approximately 0.22 percent of GDP and 3.7 percent
    of national health care expenditures in 2005 (Kang et al. 2011). In Thailand, the total cost of obesity is estimated at 0.13 percent of GDP; health care costs attributable to obesity are
    estimated at 1.5 percent of national health expenditure (Pitayatienanan et al. 2014). The annual cost of glucose testing strips per individual exceeds Vanuatu’s total health expenditure
    per capita (Anderson 2013).
11	 On average, globally, a 10 percent increase in GDP per capita is associated with a 6.3 percent decrease in stunting in the long term, and a 1.7 percent decrease in the short term (Smith
    and Haddad 2015).

The underlying drivers of undernutrition are multisectoral. They relate to maternal and child caring practices;
food security, that is, the availability and affordability of nutritious foods; access to health, clean water, and
appropriate sanitation; and the social status of women. A key role is played by information: households do not
always know which foods or feeding practices are best for their children or themselves, nor can they visually identify
when children are stunted or micronutrient deficient (World Bank 2006). All these factors may be correlated with
income, but are conceptually distinct from it.

                delivery, with a lack of focus on the delivery of quality preventive and primary care services, which are
                essential for the prevention of undernutrition.

        •• Unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation facilities. Much of the region enjoys access to improved
           drinking water.13 However, sanitation and hygiene are often inadequate, especially in rural areas and in
           high stunting burden countries. Open defecation, common across the region,14 also contributes to stunting.

Women’s social status. Gender disparities remain significant across much of the region.15 The low status of women
contributes to maternal and child undernutrition. Women with low status (defined as women’s power relative to
men) tend to have weaker control over household resources, tighter time constraints, less access to information and
health and nutrition services, poorer mental health, and lower self-esteem. These factors are thought to be closely
tied to women’s own nutritional status and the quality of care they receive, and, in turn, the quality of health and
nutritional care they provide to their children (Smith et al. 2003).

Adult overweight rates are strongly correlated with average income per capita; they are also much higher
in Pacific Island Countries than East Asia (Figure II.A.9). The link between overweight and income, in turn,
arises because the rapid income growth and economic transformation experienced by many Asian economies

13	 The Eastern and Southeastern Asia Millennium Development Goal (MDG) regions have met the MDG target of 88 percent coverage of improved drinking water. However, Papua New
    Guinea is one of three countries in the world with less than 50 percent coverage of improved drinking water.
14	 Roughly 100 million people in the region practice open defecation, with country prevalence rates ranging from zero to 72 percent, based on a 2013 review of 14 EAP countries.
    Cambodia, China, and Indonesia are among the 12 countries in the world with the largest population practicing open defecation (UNICEF 2013).
15	 Women often enjoy less access to productive resources. For instance, in Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam, female-headed households have less land than male-headed households
    (World Bank 2012). More broadly, Indonesia in particular performs poorly on gender equity in economic activity (Haddad et al. 2014).

has been accompanied by rapid urbanization, changing lifestyles, and hence changes in dietary patterns.16 In
the Pacific Island Countries, elevated overweight rates reflect the unfavorable food, sociocultural, and physical
environments (Box II.A.2).

Urbanization is highly correlated with obesity and chronic diseases        (Figure II.A.10),17 though the relationship
is strongest amongst countries at lower levels of GDP. This correlation reflects the impact of urbanization on several
underlying risk factors, including diet, physical exercise, and exposure to mass media.

      •• Changes in diet. Urbanization alters the food environment (which includes the availability, affordability,
         convenience, and desirability of foods) and is associated with increased intake of refined carbohydrates,
         added sugars, fats, and animal-source foods. Rural dwellers are relatively self-reliant in obtaining food, and
         tend to eat traditional diets that are high in grains, fruit, and vegetables, and low in fat. Urban dwellers,
         in contrast, rely on supermarkets and fast-food stores, which offer a ready supply of processed foods, high-
         calorie and high-fat snacks, sweets, and sugary beverages, all of which have been linked to obesity.18

      •• Physical exercise. Urbanization is associated with reduced expenditure of energy on physical activity, with
         workers transitioning from farming to sedentary, professional, and mechanized jobs.19 Furthermore, leisure
         time is spent on relatively sedentary activities owing to less outdoor recreational space, and transportation
         relies relatively more on cars and buses and less on walking or biking (Popkin, Adair, and Ng 2012).

      •• Exposure to mass media. Urbanites are more exposed to mass media marketing, which can shift
         preferences away from traditional diets to unhealthy processed foods. Widespread marketing of foods to
         children (overwhelmingly for foods high in fat, sugar, and/or salt) is a particular concern. A survey of six
         Asian countries (India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines) reported that television
         advertising to children was widespread, and that the diets actively promoted on television ran counter to
         national nutrition guidelines (Escalante Cruz et al. 2004).




16	 Urbanization increased from 18 percent in 1950 to 48 percent in 2014, with Asia experiencing the fastest pace of urbanization across major areas during 1985–2014 (United Nations
    2014).
17	 In a study of 42 countries, annual overweight/obesity prevalence increased during 1989–2007 by 0.8 percentage points among urban women in East Asian and Southern Asian
    countries, compared to 0.3 percentage points among rural women (Popkin, Adair, and Ng 2012).
18	 In Indonesia, in 2013, urban households spent nearly 31 percent of their food expenditures on packaged and processed foods compared to only 18 percent for rural households (Labaste
    and Jaffee, forthcoming).
19	 In China, between 1991 and 2000, energy expenditure from occupational and domestic sources declined by, respectively, 22 percent and 57 percent among men, and 24 percent
    and 51 percent among women. Lower occupational physical activity increased body weight among both men and women. Over this same period, China’s adult overweight prevalence
    roughly doubled (Monda et al. 2007).

REDUCING VULNERABILITIES




    Box II.A.2. Drivers of overweight and obesity in the Pacific Island Countries

     he 22 Pacific Island Countries (PICs) share a number of characteristics that make them particularly
    T
    susceptible to growing burdens of overweight and obesity.

    Food environment and unhealthy diets
    The physical environment in PICs naturally constrains food production and food security. Smaller
    island nations, in particular, consist almost exclusively of atolls that are largely infertile and susceptible
    to sea level rise. Volcanic islands tend to be larger and mountainous, with more fertile soils and mineral
    deposits that make them better suited for agricultural production (Snowdon and Thow 2013). Agricultural
    food production is commonly conducted for subsistence but also for domestic and international markets,
    whereas fisheries play a critical role in economic development, food supply, and diets (Barnett 2011). Most
    Pacific countries are food dependent (Hughes 2005), and leaving aside fisheries, the value of agricultural
    imports tends to dwarf agricultural exports from PICs. Additional forces, such as urbanization and market
    penetration of processed imported foods have weakened domestic production of diverse, local production
    (Barnett 2011). Imported foods such as noodles, white bread and crackers, and fatty meats are now added
    to traditional diets, which consisted of large quantities of starchy roots, local fruits, and seafood (Hughes
    2005). Fat and calories from imported foods have added to rather than replaced traditional sources.

    Sociocultural environment and perceptions of body image
    Social structures, values, and beliefs affect food consumption, activity, and self-image patterns
    and contribute to obesity-inducing behaviors among both youth and adults. Even more than media,
    families (and fathers, in particular) drive pressures to achieve a particular body type for adolescents. The
    large body is perceived to be ideal for both male and female adolescents, with larger youth believed to be
    well respected and cared for. In Fijian and Tongan households, the intrahousehold distribution of food is
    also found to reflect love and care, such that the best quality and highest volume of food is provided to those
    of relatively high status. Highly valued foods include those that are imported and less available, compared
    with local fish or fresh produce.

    Physical environment and lack of physical activity
    The physical environment of the PICs creates barriers to physical activity. Common environmental
    conditions such as lack of footpaths and lighting, wet weather, and high temperatures create barriers to
    physical activity even in better-connected and urban communities (Siefken et al. 2012). Among adolescents
    in Fiji and Tonga, lack of interest or motivation, lack of safety, study, and household responsibility inhibit
    female adolescents from participating in recreational activity.

VI.	      Routes to Better Nutrition: From Drivers to Actions

Appropriate policy responses to malnutrition will vary across countries, depending on the type and degree
of malnutrition they face  (Figure II.A.4). Nonetheless, with strong political commitment and concerted action
across multiple sectors, high stunting burden countries could achieve significant improvements in nutritional
outcomes in the near future (Box II.A.3.).



   Box II.A.3. Peru’s success in reducing chronic undernutrition

   In the early 2000s, over one in three Peruvian           Figure II.A.3.1. Trends in child (<5) stunting in Peru,
   children under five years of age suffered                1990–2014
   from chronic malnutrition. These high levels of          Stunting prevalence, percent

   stunting remained virtually unchanged until 2008         40

   (Figure II.A.3.1), despite rapid economic growth
                                                            30
   and significant expenditure on nutrition programs.
   Then, between 2008 and 2014, child stunting              20
   rates decreased dramatically. Peru’s experience
   ranks among the most successful recent global            10

   in tackling undernutrition.
   First, Peru rallied strong political commitment and set out a clear direction through measurable,
   time-bound goals. Alan Garcia, elected president in 2006, committed in his inaugural address to the
   “5-by-5-by-5 goal” of reducing stunting by 5 points in 5 years for children under five. This ambitious, yet
   feasible, goal was then translated into specific regional targets, and the focus then turned to achieving them.
   Second, Peru adopted a multisectoral strategy supporting both the demand and supply of nutrition
   services. Peru empowered parents by providing them with information to identify a stunted child and
   make its consequences visible through a widely disseminated video (“My Future in my First Centimeters”).
   In addition, the government leveraged the existing conditional cash transfer program for poor families
   (“Juntos”) to reduce child malnutrition, by conditioning transfers on children’s receipt of health and
   nutrition services, including growth promotion checkups and early childhood stimulation. To respond to the
   increased demand, the government expanded maternal and child nutrition services. Relatedly, it improved
   the coverage of clean water and proper sanitation.
   Third, the government used financing for results and targeted communities with the greatest need.
   Results-based budgeting through the evidence-based “Articulated Nutrition Program” was used to ensure
   that demand and supply efforts worked together to achieve established nutrition goals. Each agency was
   held accountable for improving specific indicators, such as the number of poor children enrolled in the
   conditional cash transfer program, and the number of child-growth checkups and nutrition counseling
   sessions to poor families in targeted communities.

ÌÌCountries with elevated stunting levels

Countries with high stunting levels should focus on scaling up a package of evidence-based, direct health
interventions that can be delivered through primary health care services targeting the critical 1,000-day
window of opportunity (from conception through the first two years of life). These direct, nutrition-specific
interventions include (a) behavior change and communication interventions to promote optimal nutrition and
care during pregnancy and the early years of infants’
and young children’s lives (including nutritional

Improving supply-side delivery of nutrition-specific interventions may not necessarily require increased
health investments, but rather a reprioritization of interventions and delivery platforms. Many EAP countries
have made strong commitments toward achieving universal health coverage over the next 10 to 20 years. In
lower-income EAP countries with high stunting burdens (including Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Papua New Guinea),
health insurance coverage is generally low. However, even these countries have made strides in removing financial
barriers to health services for targeted subgroups (the poor) and for specific services (maternal and child health).
In addition to extending benefits to vulnerable groups, nutrition interventions must be included in the health
benefits package, while community-based and outreach platforms may be necessary to ensure last mile delivery
and availability of nutrition services for the poor, rural, and remote populations who shoulder much of the burden
of malnutrition. Additional investments are also needed to strengthen human resource capacity and develop
quality assurance mechanisms, particularly for counselling and behavior change interventions, such as promotion
of breastfeeding and optimum maternal infant and young child feeding, and in lower-level facilities accessed by
rural and poor populations.

Social transfers can stimulate demand for essential health and nutrition services, address the immediate
and underlying determinants of undernutrition, and improve the nonincome dimensions of poverty. These
social transfers should be targeted toward the disadvantaged groups who are at greatest risk of undernutrition
(poor, rural, ethnic minorities, and/or other groups experiencing forms of social exclusion; pregnant women and
children under 2 years old). Publicly funded social safety net programs play an important role in improving access
to special complementary foods (Bloem et al. 2013) and fortified foods for the poor. For example, conditional cash
transfers not only can have positive effects on poverty reduction, but have also been shown to improve household

food consumption, dietary diversity, and use of preventive and curative nutrition services (Ruel et al. 2013). They
also provide a platform for reaching caregivers with programs that include not only nutrition interventions, but
also information on health, growth, early learning, and stimulation, which can enhance overall development of
young children. In addition, in EAP countries where rice is the primary staple food, social safety net programs that
distribute fortified rice can provide a means of reaching the poor and those at greatest nutritional risk (Codling,
Fabrizio, and Rosenzweig 2015).

Agricultural programs have a role to play in reducing malnutrition by improving the access to and
affordability of adequate, nutrient-rich diets. In EAP, agricultural policies and programs have tended to
encourage the production of cereals/staple foods and income generation through high-value export crops. While
enhanced staple food productivity is, to a degree, necessary to meet the caloric needs of growing populations,
programs are needed to explicitly target optimal nutrition (Ruel et al. 2013). For example, fiscal incentives (healthy
food subsidies) can be used to improve the affordability of nutrient-rich foods—particularly for rural households—
as can agricultural investments to incentivize the production of nutrient-rich foods (especially fruits, vegetables,
pulses/legumes, and animal-source foods).

Improved water, sanitation, and hygiene practices are critical for reducing undernutrition. Interventions
must be designed to address the full spectrum of related issues, among which are reducing human and animal
fecal matter in the environment, including the soil and children’s play areas; ensuring availability of water and
soap for handwashing; and changing behavior, including instilling the habit of handwashing with soap at critical
times (for instance, after using the toilet, before preparation of food, after cleaning babies, and before eating).

Countries with high stunting should also implement key measures to prevent obesity      (see below). Proactively
developing some relatively low-cost policies and regulations to improve the food environment and food system
will help ensure that development is associated with movements to low stunting and low overweight, rather than
low stunting but high overweight. Prevention of overweight/obesity is much more cost-effective than treatment.


ÌÌCountries with high burden of overweight and obesity

Action at multiple levels is needed to halt the rise of overweight, including by changing social norms
Dobbs 2015; WHO 2016). A coordinated package of interventions is required to promote healthy diets, ranging
(
from systems-level policy measures to sector-specific solutions that promote behavior change at the community
and individual levels (Table II.A.3.).

At the systems level, a number of domains have been identified where regulatory and policy actions are
warranted to reduce overweight/obesity, many of which fall outside of the purview of the health sector.
Overconsumption of unhealthy foods reflects market failures. For instance, consumers are often provided with
incomplete information. And products exploit biological, psychological, and socioeconomic propensities toward
overconsumption of foods high in fat, sugar, and salt, with neither the producer nor the consumer bearing the
full social, economic, or health care cost of overweight. This creates the need for interventions, including nutrition
standards and labelling, restrictions on advertising, and use of economic and other incentives to influence food
purchases and consumption. Other complementary policies may be needed, including supporting better consumer

(Sassi 2016). Strong political will is needed for governments to take leadership and ownership over anti-obesity
interventions.

      •• Regulating food marketing, improving food labelling, and scaling up nutrition education will help
         improve nutrition information. The unregulated marketing of unhealthy foods and sugar-sweetened
         beverages is associated with childhood obesity (WHO 2016). Government regulation is warranted to
         prevent the marketing of unhealthy foods to children. Moreover, nutrition labelling will allow consumers
         to be better informed of the health implications of food choices. In all countries of Southeast Asia except
         Malaysia, nutrition labelling is voluntary unless nutritional claims are made (Kasapilla and Shaarani 2011).
         As individuals in EAP begin eating outside the home in greater numbers, municipalities may consider
         extending nutrition labelling to restaurants and ready-to-eat food retailers.

      •• Mass media and behavior change communications can help improve nutrition education and
         literacy. A variety of delivery mechanisms are possible, including mass media, health and education
         facilities, and community-based interpersonal communication. In China, policy makers produced Guidelines
         for Prevention and Control of Overweight and Obesity of Chinese Adults, as well as Guidelines on Snacks for
         Chinese Children and Adolescents. These guidelines were complemented by behavior change campaigns,
         including, in 2007, the 121 Health Action strategy, which called for individuals to take, “ten thousand
         steps a day, the balance of eating and activity and healthy life.”

      •• Targeted taxes and subsidies have great potential to prevent or mitigate overweight and obesity
         through dietary changes. Fiscal measures have been proposed as a mechanism to influence consumer
         behavior by changing the relative prices of healthy compared to less healthy foods, or by manipulating
         incomes. Demand for food is generally inelastic, but observational and robust modelled studies have
         demonstrated the impact of taxes on target food consumption, with larger taxes and taxes on noncore food
         items (including confectionary and sweetened beverages) demonstrating the largest effects (Thow et al.
         2011). Moreover, at both the country and household level, the response is strongest among the poor.20

            While this might be interpreted as an example of regressive taxation, the impact of overweight through
            diabetes and premature deaths is also regressive.

            M
             ore specifically, fiscal measures may be characterized according to their targeting of objects (for example,
            foods, nutrients, or meals), subjects (for example, entire population, children, or low-income mothers),
            and settings (home, food stores, or schools). For instance, tax schemes may target individual foods, or
            else nutrients (for example, depending upon a product’s fat content) in an effort to encourage product
            reformulation.21 Experimental and simulation tests suggest that taxes or subsidies on foods or beverages
            tend to be effective in changing diet consumption.22 The evidence regarding taxation of nutrients is too
            scarce to draw firm conclusions. Also, there is not yet evidence regarding the ultimate impact of taxation
            on nutritional status.

      •• Food composition regulations can also promote dietary change. Industry self-regulation can achieve
         some changes, but in other cases government regulation will be required. Food composition targets for
         salt, trans fats, saturated fats, and sugar can be developed for both packaged/processed foods and food
         service retailers. The WHO has identified regulations to reduce trans fats as a “best buy” to prevent NCDs
         at the population level. However, experience with tobacco regulation, as well as early experiences with food
         industry regulation, make it clear that efforts at regulation will be challenged.


ÌÌCountries facing both high stunting and high overweight/obesity

I
n addition to the measures recommended for countries facing either overweight/obesity or undernutrition, there
are special considerations for countries experiencing the dual burden of malnutrition.

The key challenge is to address food insecurity without adding to the burden of overweight/obesity.
Many EAP countries have adopted a food policy centered on self-sufficiency in rice. The exclusive policy focus on
staple foods, also known as “cereals fundamentalism,” has a distorting effect on the price of staples compared to
nonstaples (Pingali 2015). Subsidies for rice and cereals result in the relatively low cost of starchy staple foods
and edible oils—contributing to the pervasive availability of processed, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor
foods—compared to the relatively high cost of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat animal source foods.
In these countries, there are sufficient calories available to lead to the accumulation of excess body weight, but
micronutrients and healthy protein sources may be beyond the economic reach of poor families. Food policy
in these countries needs to be rebalanced to remove the distortionary effects of staple grain fundamentalist
policies. Input subsidies, public agricultural advisory services, and irrigation investments must not create obstacles
to farmers aiming to diversify production and specialize in higher-value, nutrient-dense foods.

Food-based safety nets must be rethought. Where countries provide complementary foods for young children,
transfer programs have been found to contribute to increased overweight and obesity in mothers in Mexico (Leroy
et al. 2013) and Columbia (Forde et al. 2012) as well as young children in Mexico (Leroy et al. 2010) and the
United States (Akee et al. 2013). A variety of program design choices can help mitigate these risks. In Mexico, the



21	 Mexico has tried both, taxing foods with energy content exceeding 275 Kcal per 100 grams (1 kilocalorie = 1,000 calories) as well as sugar-sweetened beverages.
22	 Taxes on individual unhealthy food products were generally found to increase consumer prices and reduce consumption of the taxed products (OECD 2014).

benefits package of supplements and counselling was modified to respond to the different nutrient gaps of urban
and rural populations (Neufeld et al. 2011). Fortified milk distribution continued in remote communities with low
access to services; where risk of overnutrition was high, food supplements were modified to reduce calories but
retain micronutrients. In addition, individual counselling sessions are being scaled up to promote breastfeeding,
healthy complementary feeding, and the avoidance of excess weight gain in preschool-age children (Kroker-Lobos
et al. 2014).




VII.	Conclusions

Developing EAP faces significant challenges with respect to both undernutrition and overnutrition.
Economic growth has been insufficient to eliminate undernutrition among the region’s poorest. At the same time,
an increasing propensity toward sedentary lifestyles, and changes in food availability that have facilitated a shift
in diets toward greater intake of animal-source and processed foods, sugar and sweeteners, oils, and salt, have
contributed to increased overweight and obesity rates.

The health sector alone cannot address these challenges and their social and economic costs. Countries
in the region must make targeted investments in nutrition programs (particularly in early life), in health, social
protection, agriculture, and education, and develop the frameworks to promote healthy diets and physical activity.
In turn, this will help create a healthy workforce capable of adapting to the rapidly changing global economic
landscape.

II.B.	 How Will Technology Disrupt Financial Services in East Asia and Pacific?1
            There is a growing sense that financial services may be the next major industry to experience a tectonic
            shift in how products and services are delivered and value created. Disruptive technologies, enabled by the
            internet and the spread of mobile phones (nearly all new internet users are joining via mobile platforms,
            not desktop computers), big data, and cloud computing are creating new business models every day.
            Examples include new payment technologies that use mobile phone networks, and crowdfunding.

            Developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) will almost certainly be at the forefront of this revolution. The
            region is advanced technologically, with a high level of mobile phone penetration and internet access,
            as well as widespread use of social media and electronic commerce. The region is also a global leader in
            information and communications technology (ICT) manufacturing and software development. The region
            is not as advanced, however, in terms of access to financial products and services—in developing EAP only
            about 30 percent of individuals have a bank account. This gap between advanced technology adoption
            and still limited financial inclusion creates a unique opportunity for financial technology solutions that
            apply ICT to financial intermediation, and for completely new business models, often referred to as
            “alternative finance”. However, to take full advantage of these opportunities, countries in developing
            EAP will need to strengthen governance and the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, improve their
            enabling infrastructure, and address challenges such as those related to privacy, consumer protection,
            and financial capability, so that consumers can make sound and informed financial decisions.

Technology is creating new opportunities in the financial sector, allowing existing players to become
more efficient and tap new markets, and creating space for new business models and entrants. This chapter
analyzes a few of the ways in which technology will alter the financial services landscape in developing EAP over
the coming years, for countries at all income levels.

The potential for technology to “disrupt” the financial sector is gaining increasing attention globally.
But there is confusion about the potential for truly transformative change, as opposed to marginal increases
in efficiency or changes in the consumer experience. Two of the most popular terms used in this discussion are
“fintech”, or financial technology, and “alternative finance”. These terms overlap but have important differences.

Fintech relates to the innovative application of technology to financial services through, for instance,
data and analytics, online platforms, mobile apps, and the use of other ICT tools such as the Global
Positioning System. Fintech can be deployed by incumbents (including large commercial banks, microfinance
institutions, insurance companies, and brokers), or it can be the focus of stand-alone firms. The development of
mobile banking, increased use of credit scoring tools by financial institutions, and application of new electronic
data monitoring tools by insurers are examples of fintech.

Alternative finance relates to new business models and instruments that are developing outside
the traditional regulated financial markets, and which overwhelmingly use fintech. Examples include
“crowdfunding” platforms, and payment systems, including some mobile payment solutions, that operate outside

alternative financial services providers, but all scalable alternative financial services providers use fintech to power
new business models.

This chapter is organized as follows. The next section looks at the conditions that have made both fintech and
alternative finance possible, and analyzes why developing EAP may be especially well suited to technology-enabled
solutions in finance. Two case studies then provide examples of fintech and alternative finance that hold promise
for growth in the region, and highlight key policy considerations. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the
key challenges and suggested next steps.




The context for fintech and alternative finance in EAP

A strong environment for fintech is readily apparent in the higher-income countries in East Asia and Pacific
(EAP). These countries already have advanced ICT infrastructures and a strong investment climate, including
well-developed legal and regulatory frameworks for financial services. However, the opportunities for fintech and
alternative finance also extend to many of the region’s lower-income economies, where technology may help fill
the current gap in financial services delivery.

     such as Malaysia and Thailand, and lower-income economies such as Cambodia and Vietnam. China has the highest rates of mobile phone penetration among city centers (Hong Kong
     SAR, China and Macao SAR, China exceed 230 and 320 per 100, respectively), but still has room for growth in rural areas and among low-income populations, with a national rate of
     about 92 mobile phones per 100 people.

Technology penetration has outpaced access to financial services in developing EAP. Most countries make
far greater use of mobile phones than banks, with less than half the population holding accounts in formal
financial institutions. China and Mongolia are outliers, with especially high rates of financial accounts in the adult
population. And only a relatively small percentage of people—fewer than one-quarter across developing EAP—use
their mobile phones to execute financial transactions.

Some advances in digital payments have come from traditional sources, especially from increased access
to both debit and credit cards, and this may help create a platform and payment solutions for some fintech
applications. Many developing EAP countries compare favorably on access to debit cards (Figure II.B.2); however,
this technology is still limited in lower-income economies such as Cambodia and Myanmar, and growth in the
region lags global trends.3 Developing EAP has witnessed a more dramatic increase in credit card ownership in
recent years (Figure II.B.3). Ownership of credit cards increased globally by 18.1 percent between 2011 and 2014,
but in developing EAP surged by 88 percent, with China responsible for much of this expansion. However, levels
of credit card penetration remain limited to 20 percent or less; it is a payment solution typically available only to
more wealthy consumers. One area where the region leads is savings rates; 37 percent of adults save at a formal
financial institution compared with 15 percent or less in other developing regions.4

E-commerce in the region is also relatively strong. A global survey of e-commerce habits indicates that
consumers are more likely to purchase through e-commerce in EAP than in other regions where rates of browsing
without buying are higher (Nielsen Corporation 2014). The willingness of consumers in EAP to use the internet
to conduct business is another positive factor for fintech in the region, especially in China, where online retail
sales are already approximately 14 percent of total retail receipts. The economic muscle of new forms of retail
commerce, and the data they have access to on shopping habits and business sales, can also create opportunities
in the alternative finance space.

Fifty-two percent of users in Southeast Asia first hear
about a new product, brand, or service through Facebook (Facebook IQ 2015). Payments between individuals
and between individuals and firms, as well as crowdfunding, are poised to thrive in this highly interconnected
environment.

There are also important challenges to the expansion of fintech in the region, including the pervasive use
of cash to pay bills. Even in e-commerce, many transactions are still conducted in cash using “cash-on-delivery”
arrangements that add to costs and create barriers to entry for new market participants and reduce convenience for
consumers. Around 90 percent of school fees and utility bills and nearly 100 percent of payments to farmers are
paid in cash (Table II.B.1). The shift from cash to noncash payments will require both attractive alternative payment
mechanisms and a change in consumer behavior and preferences.

diversity in levels of economic and institutional development. In particular, for the region’s poorest countries,
where adherence to the rule of law is weakest, this impedes adoption of some fintech and alternative finance
services. However, there may also be added incentives in some of these same countries to move toward fintech
services such as cashless payments, which can reduce opportunities for corruption and theft.

This chapter focuses on two specific fintech/alternative finance opportunities: digital payments, in
particular mobile payments; and crowdfunding. Mobile payments provide a critical gateway to broader
financial inclusion for a wide spectrum of society, reaching even poor and rural consumers who already have
mobile phones. Crowdfunding provides opportunities for financing small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), a
widespread development priority across the region, and is relatively advanced in developing EAP, garnering the
attention of both the business and regulatory communities.

digital payments among several constituencies. These include policy makers interested in expanding financial
access and reducing informality; businesses that see opportunities to reduce costs and compete in new markets;
and consumers who seek convenience, and in some cases the increased security, of less reliance on cash. In many
countries, the primary motivation is to expand financial inclusion, especially for lower-income consumers and
those in rural or remote locations. The welfare impact of gaining access to payment services has been shown
repeatedly to be significant and positive (World Bank 2014). Providing people with transaction accounts creates
both a gateway to other financial products and services and a mechanism for storing value, even if not for long-
term savings. Transaction accounts also create data about the financial lives of their owners—both flows in and
out—which can be used to help gauge creditworthiness and demand for other types of financial products and
services such as lines of credit or insurance.

Digital financial services also have a direct impact on the efficiency and operation of the national payment
system, which is in turn linked to issues of financial sector stability and soundness. There are significant
fixed costs with a national payment system, and therefore if the system is serving only a small portion of the
economy and relatively few consumers—and few transactions—the costs per transaction will be relatively high
and incentives to invest in new technology will be low. The more transactions that pass through a national payment
system, the more efficient it becomes and the better the quality of information that may be gleaned on financial
consumer behaviors and economic trends.

There are also broader development objectives served by the move to digital financial services. These
include a shift toward greater formality and tax compliance when payments can easily be traced, and positive
impacts for government expenditures when transfers go directly to beneficiary accounts, removing leakage in the
system such as bribes paid to collect benefits (Rogoff 2016).

Digital payments may also help to reduce the impact of de-risking whereby jurisdictions seen as having
transparency and security concerns are cut off from correspondent banking relationships. De-risking is a
particular issue for small countries, including the Pacific Island Countries, where the volume of business is relatively
low, making it harder to absorb high compliance costs. A pilot project for the New Zealand–Tonga remittance
corridor, which is supported by the World Bank, uses digital payments and electronic client verification to reduce
the impact of de-risking. Individual bank accounts are not required in this pilot, and the digital payments bypass
traditional banking channels, with lighter Know Your Customer requirements and limits on the amount that can be
sent to minimize risk. If successful, this approach could be replicated in other countries.


ÌÌThe status of digital payment services in developing EAP

Much of developing EAP is technologically well suited to taking advantage of digital payments, given the
high mobile phone penetration rates, but this potential is far from being fully realized. Noncash payments
are steadily increasing, but not at a rate commensurate with the expansion of mobile phones. And payments via
mobile phones are still estimated to be small compared to those made online or through prepaid cards—less than
5 percent of the total value of noncash payments (McKinsey & Company 2012).

The legal and regulatory framework for digital payment services in developing EAP requires further
adaptation and reform to reflect the rapidly changing technology and market landscape and permit
mobile payment services to reach their potential. Pending issues include the respective roles of commercial
banks, other formal financial institutions, and new entrants such as telecommunication companies or social media
platforms; how to leverage payments to access other financial services such as savings or credit; how to ensure
proportionality regarding, for instance, the customer due diligence required for using digital financial services;
and how to provide effective consumer protection.

Across the world, it has not been financial institutions that have typically led progress on mobile payments.
In China, two giant internet-based firms—Alibaba and Tencent—are in stiff competition to attract the mobile
payment business. They are using payments to compete for customers, for page views, and for data. Instead of
providing payments as a stand-alone source of revenue, payments are a way to support and strengthen other
core business activities. This is similar to the Safaricom M-pesa model in Kenya, which was premised on locking in
loyalty among mobile phone users in a services market where consumers tend to be highly price elastic.


ÌÌPolicy guidance

Over the past two years a number of leading organizations in the financial inclusion space have developed
guidelines for the development of mobile payments that would create the policy environment for rapidly
extending access. These include the Payment Aspects of Financial Inclusion (PAFI) document developed jointly by
the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure and the World Bank, the High-Level Principles for Digital
Financial Services developed by the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion for the G20, and the Level One
Project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Table II.B.2).

PAFI and the G20 High-Level Principles take a more comprehensive and strategic approach to supporting
digital financial services than the Level One Project, which is more technical. All three address the issue of a
legal and regulatory framework that can balance risk and innovation and that provides consumer protection. This
includes:

     •• Know Your Customer requirements adapted to risk (tiered).
     •• Maximum amounts established for payments through alternative digital financial services.
     •• Different regulatory treatments for deposit transaction accounts (which provide access to full banking
        protections) and for transaction accounts linked only to payments.
     •• Regulations based on functionality, not on institutional type.
     •• Providers to provide consumers with clear information on payment products and fees and with an effective
        means of redress when problems occur.

All three approaches recognize the importance of the financial and ICT infrastructure and ecosystem. This
includes the critical concept of interoperability, whereby consumers are not restricted to only sending payments
within a network serviced by their provider. Good practices established by the G20 recommend open solutions
including:

     •• A modern retail payment system infrastructure, with open payment platforms linked to both the clearing
        and settlement system and to different types of providers, including both banks and nonbanks.
     •• Interoperability of access points and channels, so that consumers benefit from greater convenience
        and competition and operators do not overinvest in payment infrastructure (as happened with ATMs in
        developed country markets).

Both PAFI and the Level One Project explicitly recognize the importance of specific product design features
that will result in either uptake and use when done well, or many dormant accounts when done poorly.
The Level One Project guidelines focus on creating digital financial services that mimic cash to the extent possible,
to include:

     ••   Immediate funds transfer
     ••   Same-day settlement
     ••   Push payments (such as automatic debits)
     ••   Irrevocability.

Financial literacy is critical for the successful expansion of digital financial services, especially in
environments where consumers may be moving from cash directly to mobile payments as a first form of
financial inclusion. Other key policy issues include the importance of customer identification (and secure and
reliable national identification), and the ability to quickly scale up through large volume recurrent payments such
as government-to-person transfers or payment of wages by the public sector or taxes to the public sector.

              and jobs in EAP?


ÌÌWhy is crowdfunding important?

Crowdfunding is a new technology-enabled approach to meeting the financial needs of both firms and
individuals. It is a relatively nascent industry, working to fill a niche where traditional financial institutions have
struggled—providing credit to SMEs and to consumers, including those who may have a limited financial history
and weak credit data, known as “thin files” in markets with credit reporting infrastructures in place. Crowdfunding
includes a range of financing arrangements, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, with the unifying characteristic
being the online platform used to conduct the transaction. The concept originated with online platforms to directly
link individual lenders to borrowers—either individuals or firms. Interest on the part of financial institutions in
this new way of reaching borrowers has led to institutional investment approaches where platforms raise or receive
funds that they distribute to prospective borrowers based on credit scoring and credit analysis.

Policy makers are especially concerned about lack of access to credit for SMEs, owing to the relatively large
contribution they make to employment and economic output. SMEs are one of the most opaque segments of
credit markets, which impedes the ability of lenders to accurately assess and price risk and thereby extend credit.
Further, the lack of reliable data on this market segment often leads to more onerous regulatory treatment in
commercial banks, further depressing the ability of traditional lenders to serve these firms, even when they are
profitable.

Among firms, especially SMEs, there is ample evidence of unmet financial needs in the region. Across the
region, a high share of investments are financed internally by firms. In fact, the share of investments financed by

banks and supplier credit is even lower than in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure II.B.5). Unmet credit demand from small
firms amounted to US$241.5 billion in EAP (Stein, Goland, and Schiff 2010). Thus, there is a particular need in the
region to focus on innovation in supporting the provision of finance to SMEs.

Crowdfunding also widens individuals’ saving options, by providing a mechanism for them to invest
directly in businesses and to lend money (debt) to both firms and individuals. The investments are not
guaranteed, however, and carry significantly more risk than bank deposits, albeit with a potential upside that
might also be significantly greater. Typically, individual investors face limits on the amount of their exposure
through crowdfunding channels.


ÌÌThe status of crowdfunding in developing EAP

Crowdfunding mobilizes funding through online platforms and is increasingly popular in developing EAP,
and especially in China. China is by far the largest alternative finance market in the world. P2P lending, a subset
of crowdfunding, is the biggest market segment, with consumer lending accounting for US$52 billion and business
lending US$40 billion.5 Even excluding China, the total market volume of alternative finance in developing EAP in
2015 was more than triple that of 2014 (Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance 2016).

Some of EAP’s largest crowdfunding services are linked with networks such as social media platforms
(Tencent) or e-commerce sites (Alipay). These relationships provide several advantages, starting with the ability
of such networks to help reduce the information asymmetries in these credit markets. Data on e-commerce traffic
or on an individual borrower’s employment status or social capital can help to assess risk. The networks do more
than provide information used in the loan decision. They also can facilitate mentoring, feedback, and support
for small firms and form part of a broader ecosystem by, for example, building on social media relationships

with clients and suppliers, creating a way for incubators and accelerators to quickly test interest in new business
ventures, and developing links to traditional lenders who might invest through crowdfunding platforms.

Within EAP, laws or regulations specific to crowdfunding are not yet in place except in Malaysia, Thailand,
and high-income economies such as Australia; New Zealand; Hong Kong SAR, China; and Singapore. Many
other developing EAP countries, including China, Indonesia, and Vietnam, are in the process of developing laws
and regulations to address crowdfunding. In the meantime, existing securities or banking laws and regulations
provide the de facto legal and regulatory framework. In many cases, however, these more general statutes may not
provide the assurances investors seek to enter the market.

Malaysia and Thailand have introduced regulations that focus on equity crowdfunding, but nothing
specifically on debt crowdfunding for individuals. Crowdfunding is currently supervised and regulated
under either central banks’ banking laws or financial regulators’ securities laws. In Thailand, for instance, equity
crowdfunding is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission as of May 2015; the Bank of Thailand
oversees P2P lending; and the Securities and Exchange Commission oversees other debt crowdfunding.


ÌÌPolicy guidance

The prospects for crowdfunding hinge critically on establishing laws and regulations that favor enterprise
growth and investments in firms, and on the availability of a wide range of borrower credit data. Scaling
up crowdfunding will almost certainly lead to increasing reliance for funding on institutional investors or balance
sheet lending. Measures are needed to ensure that large investors gain confidence in crowdfunding as a viable and
sustainable source of credit, especially for firms.


     Business and investment laws and regulations

The quality of national legal and regulatory frameworks, and in particular their ability to support
enterprise growth and third-party investments in firms, varies significantly across EAP. Key issues include
the willingness of people to establish their businesses formally, the protections afforded to minority investors,
the ability to enforce contracts (including financial contracts), and the efficiency of the process for closing or
reorganizing firms, resolving their debts, and liquidating assets. A heat map of the existing legal and regulatory
framework (Table II.B.3) shows where the policy environment is well developed (shades of green) and where reforms
are needed (orange and red), and with countries listed in order of their overall score in the Doing Business 2016
report. Countries in EAP range from mostly high-income countries with strong legal and institutional frameworks
(green), to middle-income countries with relatively developed investment climates (such as Thailand and China),
to lower-income countries with greater institutional challenges (including Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, and the
Philippines), to the least developed countries (including Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste).

This typology provides important insights:

      •• Crowdfunding is well suited to the sophisticated business climate in higher-income EAP           and helps
         explain the foothold it has gained in diverse countries including Hong Kong SAR, China; New Zealand;
         Korea; and Malaysia.
      •• Many countries in developing EAP have at least some of the laws and institutions needed for
         crowdfunding. However, in some countries it will require relatively extensive reforms, including of minority
         shareholder protection, contract enforcement, and insolvency.
      •• Countries in developing EAP with the least developed legal and regulatory framework are not
         well placed to take advantage of crowdfunding. They should focus on the reforms needed to establish
         effective basic banking.

       Data

Borrower credit data are a critical input for any kind of lending relationship, but are especially crucial
for arms-length transactions such as those conducted via crowdfunding websites. One of the best predictors
of a borrower’s future payment behavior is their past credit behavior. Credit information typically includes basic
identification data (name, address, birthdate) and payment history. Some systems only collect negative payment
data (late payments, defaults), but most now follow international good practice and also collect positive data
related to on-time payments. These data provide the basis for development of analytical products and decision
tools used by financial institutions.

EAP countries perform well on the “getting credit” indicator, often with higher rankings than on overall
“ease of doing business”; however, the quality and coverage of credit data potentially available for
crowdfunding varies greatly across countries(Figure II.B.6). The “getting credit” indicator includes a “depth of
credit information index”, which covers eight items, equally weighted, for both private credit bureaus and public
credit registries. EAP’s high-income countries such as Australia; Hong Kong SAR, China; Korea; New Zealand; and
Singapore, all have high ratings (7 or 8 out of 8) for credit bureaus. Thailand and Malaysia also have relatively
well developed private systems, each with a score of 6, followed by Cambodia, the Philippines, and Vietnam (all
at 5). Some countries that rely on public credit registries—typically administered by the central bank or bank
supervisor—have little or no data available through privately run credit bureaus. This is the case for China,
Mongolia, and Indonesia. And in some countries, such as Papua New Guinea and Myanmar, credit reporting has
yet to be developed.

Fintech ventures need access to credit and payment data on firms and individuals to make sound credit
decisions, but in many cases in EAP these data are either not collected or not available outside the
regulated banking sector. In countries that rely on a public sector registry for credit data, access is typically
restricted to regulated financial institutions that have mandatory reporting requirements. Crowdfunding platforms
and other fintech ventures that are not considered regulated financial institutions lack access to these data, which
are usually housed in the bank superintendent or central bank. In response, fintech companies have developed

alternative data sources, in some cases based on social media. However, the accuracy of credit risk analysis is
almost certainly diminished when critical data, such as payment history with banks, are not available.

The inclusion in credit reports of alternative data, such as payment history with retailers and utility
companies, and the availability of credit scoring tools through credit bureaus are other important but
largely lacking aspects of the credit information infrastructure in EAP. Only Australia, Korea, and New
Zealand have private credit bureaus that include both credit scoring and alternative data, and no developing
economies have either element. This is important for crowdfunding and other new fintech activities, because credit
scoring tools are more robust and accurate when based on more comprehensive data, such as credit bureau data
from multiple sources rather than institutional data from only one lender. This is especially true for new market
entrants or smaller volume lenders. The ability of crowdfunding platforms to buy a credit score from a bureau as
part of their credit risk analysis offers greater reliability and reduces startup costs. In essence, access to a credit
bureau score helps level the playing field among market participants, reducing the value of information rents to
large, incumbent financial institutions, and fostering greater competition for good-quality customers.

The inclusion of alternative data in private credit bureaus is important for several reasons, both for the
information value it carries and as an indicator of the potential for nonregulated financial institutions to
access the credit bureau data. Alternative data refers to credit and payment data obtained from nonbank and
often nonfinancial institutions such as utility companies, retailers and, in some cases, government agencies. These
data are especially valuable for customers who might not have taken any bank loans but who do have a payment
history that can be used as a starting point to gauge creditworthiness and to serve as reputation collateral. For
startup firms, young borrowers, and low-income borrowers, the access to alternative data through a credit bureau
is particularly important.

The other reason the alternative data indicator is important for this discussion of fintech is that it serves
as a kind of proxy for the institutional structure of the credit bureau. Where regulated financial institutions
are the owners of the private credit bureau, they may restrict access to the data, preferring to keep the bureau
limited to the banking sector. In such instances, it is likely that the bureau would not be able to collect alternative
data; nonbanks would be reluctant to share data if they do not have equivalent access to the data from banks.
However, when a bureau is not limited to the banking sector, it is more likely to seek access to relevant data
sources throughout the economy, as captured by the alternative data indicator in “Getting credit”. This would likely
include establishing relationships with fintech firms such as crowdfunding platforms—to both provide data and, if
available, scores, as inputs to the lending decisions, and then collect data on borrower performance.




Conclusions

An advanced technology environment in most EAP countries creates an opportunity for the relatively
rapid development of fintech and alternative finance. Much of the region enjoys extremely high mobile
phone penetration rates, and internet penetration rates continue to grow, with the overwhelming majority of new
connections via mobile platforms. In most countries the basic technological conditions for expansion exist. This fact
alone, however, is not sufficient for market success.

Fintech solutions must offer value to both customers and the businesses that provide them. Solutions will
have more success if they fulfill several objectives, such as promoting customer loyalty to mobile phone companies,
as has been shown to be the case for mobile payment services. In Asia, e-commerce giants such as Alibaba, and
social media platforms such as WeChat, have launched financial products that already reach hundreds of millions
of customers, providing convenience to individuals and strengthening ties to businesses on these platforms. Any
growth slowdown in the region will dampen incentives for new projects across the board, including for fintech,
especially in cases where significant upfront investments are required.

The demand side creates another challenge for fintech in the region, particularly the persistent reliance
on cash as a means of payment. Even when consumers in Asia buy online, they frequently continue to pay for
their purchases in cash through cash-on-delivery arrangements. Supply-side limits to financial inclusion such as
relatively low levels of account penetration are part of this dynamic, but these likely combine with other demand-
side factors such as concerns over privacy and transparency. Shifting the demand side will take time and both
private sector efforts through development and marketing of attractive and convenient products, and public
policies that support them, and in some cases, such as government-to-person payments, consumers to adopt new
financial behaviors.

Public policies, and especially the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern financial services, are a
critical building block for fintech and alternative finance. Some of the private sector innovations discussed
above, such as mobile payments led by mobile phone companies or short-term loans provided by e-commerce
sites, were possible because of “trial and error” approaches by regulators that allowed innovation. In other cases,
such as crowdfunding, the private sector is largely stalled, waiting for government to implement the legal and
regulatory framework. Regulators face a delicate balancing act—how to encourage innovation and competition
while also taking into consideration sometimes competing objectives of system stability and soundness and
consumer protection. A holistic view of consumer welfare should be developed by regulators—one that takes
into account benefits to be gained from improved access, convenience, and competition in financial markets, and
the possible associated costs such as more aggressive marketing of financial products, opportunities for fraud,
or greater dissemination of personal data. New business models will also likely force regulators to look beyond
more narrow current definitions of licensed financial institutions and expand their scope of action (at times in
coordination with other regulators such as those responsible for ICT) to keep pace with innovation in the sector.

Finally, the technological breakthroughs that make fintech and alternative finance possible can sometimes
distract attention from traditional areas of financial and private sector development that continue to create
obstacles to access. The arms-length nature of most technology-powered innovations increases the importance
of confidence in institutions, firms, contracts, and courts. Broadly covered under rule of law, these issues include
topics such as corporate governance for both firms and financial institutions, protection of minority shareholder
rights, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and, when those fail, confidence in an impartial and time- and
cost-effective judiciary.

agricultural prices fall back to more normal levels,
growth could become less inclusive, with the rural
poor negatively affected. Constrained by education
attainment and skills levels, a large share of the poor
workers might not be able to reap the full benefit of the
job opportunities in the high-end services sector. As a
consequence, poverty is expected to decline at a slower
rate in rural areas.
