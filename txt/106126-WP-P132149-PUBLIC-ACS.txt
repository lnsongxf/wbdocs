This report was commissioned by Sutayut Osornprasop, task team leader of this project
for the World Bank, to review the performance of the People Who Inject Drugs Operations
Research (PWID-OR) under the Big Cities Project (BCP) from April 2013 until December
2015. Pascal Tanguay, a consultant, prepared this report with supervision and guidance
from Sutayut Osornprasop, human development specialist at the Bank and Joselito Vital,
BCP consultant for the Bank. The author of the report and the Bank would like to
recognize the financial contributions and technical support of the Bank and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) that facilitated implementation of the BCP as well as the role of
Population Services International (PSI) that led implementation and acted as principal
recipient of the Bank and ADB funds, as well as the team of peers who reviewed the report
before publication—Roberto Rosadia, Teresita Bagasao, Ernest Massiah, Robert Oelrichs,
and Lilanie Olarte Magdamo.

Special thanks to the PSI team and all the BCP partners—the Department of Health (DOH)
including Cebu City Health, and the Argao Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (TRC), as
well as the Kamagayan Barangay Council, the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB), Cebu Plus,
the Society for the Divine Word, and the World Health Organization (WHO) —for their
sustained efforts, significant contributions, and invaluable support throughout the
project implementation period as well as their time and sincerity in reviewing the
achievements of the BCP in Cebu.

This report highlights the critical role of peers —people who use drugs in the
Philippines—in the implementation of the BCP in Barangay Kamagayan and beyond.
Without their involvement, the project would likely not have been as successful and the
preparation of this publication would not have been possible. Finally, our sincere thanks
to every project client for investing their trust and sharing personal details about their
lives with the project representatives and ultimately for making this report possible.
                                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Philippines has been identified as one of nine countries in the world where HIV
continues to increase at an alarming rate of more than 25 percent.1 HIV transmission
among people who inject drugs (PWID) expanded rapidly in recent years, from less than
1 percent in 2005 to more than 5 percent in the past five years.2 There are between 12,304
and 16,607 PWID living in the Philippines, with the majority —an estimated 6,000
PWID—in Metro Cebu and between 2,000 and 2,500 in Cebu City.3 HIV and Hepatitis C
Virus (HCV) rates among this group have been estimated at 41.6 percent and 70 percent,
respectively.4 In Cebu City, up to 74 percent of people living with HIV contracted the virus
through needle sharing,5 and 99 percent of infections among PWID were reported in
Metro Cebu.6

Global evidence unequivocally shows that distribution of sterile injecting equipment
reduces the transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections like Hepatitis C among
PWID; does not lead to an increase in drug use in general or in intravenous injection, in
particular; increases demand for health and social care services, often resulting in better
monitoring, care, and treatment; and that results are enhanced when such efforts are
included in a comprehensive package of health and social care services. 7 However, the
Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 prioritizes public security over public
health objectives and specifically criminalizes possession and distribution of drug
paraphernalia such as needles and syringes.

In March 2013, Population Services International (PSI) was contracted to lead the
implementation of the Big Cities Project (BCP) between April 15, 2013 and December 31,
2015 with a total budget of US$1,840,000 committed by the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB). The ultimate goal of the project was to reduce HIV
transmission by reducing risk behaviors among PWID. Specifically, implementation of the
BCP aimed to develop friendly drop-in center (DIC) and outreach services; increase
demand and uptake of health services through improved peer education and support; and
strengthen governance for development and implementation of sustainable, evidence-
based policies and interventions.

While the operations research (OR) arm of the PWID component of the BCP in Cebu was
not in a position to generate the expected outcomes —with regard to quantitative
evidence of the impact of needle and syringe distribution on HIV transmission among
PWID—the BCP produced significant positive results that should not be overlooked.
Based on a thorough review of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) data collected by
implementing agencies as well as inputs from focus group discussions and key
stakeholder interviews, this evaluation finds that the BCP objectives were largely met.
Specifically, the project data shows a significant uptake in HIV-related services through

peer-led outreach and DIC-based services. Coverage among project clients is impressively
high—between 67.1 percent and 99.7 percent—for the short implementation period and
the multiple challenges encountered. Implementation of project activities has also shown
that there is great demand among PWID for needles, syringes, and comprehensive sterile
injecting equipment sets; for health and HIV-related services; for drug dependence
treatment and rehabilitation; and for employment, especially as peer educators.

The impact of the BCP results are corroborated by the recent Integrated HIV/AIDS
Behavioral Sentinel Surveillance showing a reduction in sharing of injecting equipment
among PWID from 35 percent to 25 percent (BCP target 30 percent); an increase in the
proportion of PWID who never shared needles, from 37 percent to 82 percent (BCP target
45 percent); and an increase in the percentage of PWID who were tested for HIV in the
past 12 months and who know their result, from 6 percent to 23 percent (BCP target 15
percent).8

One of the most important achievements of the PWID component of the BCP in Cebu was
the roll out of a comprehensive package of HIV prevention, demand reduction, and
community development services. Though the distribution of sterile injecting equipment
was suspended after only five months of implementation, the majority of services
continued to operate with great success, as indicated by the coverage levels recorded by
the project team. In essence, Kamagayan Comprehensive Care Center (KC3) became the
first and only one-stop-shop where PWID felt comfortable and respected and could
voluntarily access a wide range of health and social care services without fear of stigma
or legal consequences.

The KC3 clients report being very satisfied with the comprehensive package of health
services offered under the BCP and they feel welcome and accepted at the KC3.
Community members in Kamagayan, including family members of the KC3 clients, also
praise the service as an excellent intervention. Virtually all key stakeholders interviewed
noted that the KC3 team had performed especially well in building trust between clients
and their health service providers, families, and community. In that sense, community-
based advocacy efforts were successful at generating an enabling environment for service
delivery. The KC3 clients, family members, and community representatives also
appreciated efforts from the KC3 team to promote demand reduction through counseling,
Narcotics Anonymous (NA) sessions, and privileged access to the Argao Treatment and
Rehabilitation Center (TRC).

Efforts were invested by the project team to develop an enabling environment for the
PWID component of the BCP to be implemented in Cebu. Those efforts led to an official
legal exemption to Section 12 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002
through Resolution 298: ‘Approving the Proposed Operations Research on Community-
Based Comprehensive Services for People who Inject Drugs (PWID) in Barangay
Kamagayan, Cebu City, and the Creation of a Technical Working Group (TWG) that will
Formulate its Implementing Guidelines,’ that approved legal implementation of needle
and syringe distribution in the context of scientific research. The project team was also
able to mobilize local government support from a wide range of agencies to initiate the
project, and strategic partnerships contributed to mobilizing approvals. In the end, the
KC3 operations were integrated into local government units at the Barangay level. The
assessment of the OR also showed that efforts were deployed to strengthen the capacity
of project workers and clients as well as other key stakeholders involved in the project.

There is great demand and genuine interest among the KC3 clients and patients’ clients
to become peer educators and provide support to PWID. The professionalization of PWID
through peer educator roles has also reportedly reduced stigma and discrimination and
increased acceptance of PWID in the community. Should services for PWID be scaled up
in Cebu and beyond, recruiting a workforce of peer educators should not be a critical
challenge—an important lesson learned for future harm reduction projects in the
Philippines.

Another critical lesson learned is the impact of suspending distribution of sterile injecting
equipment. Uptake of services radically decreased, contacts with the KC3 project workers
fell, and referrals almost stopped. Multiple clients were lost to follow up and the bond of
trust cultivated by the KC3 workers was suddenly compromised. Several key
stakeholders noted the critical enabling role of distributing sterile injecting equipment:

    If we don’t provide them with needles, they won’t come to the clinic even if our
    services are free. Distribution of sterile injecting equipment is critical to stimulate
    enrollment in health services and hopefully in treatment for HIV and other
    infections. – Dr. Ilya Tac-An, Manager, Social Hygiene Clinic, Cebu City Health
    Office.

Though the BCP objectives were largely met, some important areas have been identified
as critical gaps. The evaluation identified significant weaknesses in M&E; implementation
timelines were delayed by factors often beyond the control of implementing partners;
limited provisions were included in the project design for strategic advocacy
interventions across the entire project life cycle; and governance structures were largely
ineffective.

As of January 1, 2016, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund)
resources will be channeled through ‘Save the Children to Cebu Plus’ to take over
operations at the KC3 and ensure continuity of services to PWID. Such a handover is
especially timely and the Cebu Plus team is enthusiastic and strategically positioned to
maintain the KC3 services and potentially expand on the strengths, lessons learned, and
good practices identified in this report. To facilitate such a handover, this report includes
a set of recommendations specifically related to continuation of health and social care
services for PWID.

HIV and Drugs in the Philippines

     The greatest growth [in Asia] can be seen in the Philippines, where a 28 percent
     increase in HIV among people who inject drugs was seen between 2012 and 2014.9

While global trends indicate a significant reduction in HIV transmission, the Philippines
has been identified as one of nine countries in the world where HIV continues to increase
at an alarming rate of more than 25 percent.10 Everyday, 22 new HIV cases are reported
in the Philippines, compared to fewer than 10 per day in 2012 (see Table 1). As of
September 2015, a total of 28,428 unique cases of HIV have been reported, representing
a 22 percent increase compared to 2014.11 HIV disproportionately affects men, with 92
percent of cumulative cases reported among males and 51 percent of cases found among
those ages 25–34, irrespective of gender.12

HIV transmission is predominantly concentrated in urban centers such as Metro Manila
and Metro Cebu, but important differences in transmission vectors have been identified.
For example, half of the infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) were
reported in the national capital region (Metro Manila), 99 percent of infections among
PWID were reported in Metro Cebu (region 7), and 48 percent of infections among women
and girls were reported from Central Luzon (region 3).13 Up to 80 percent of cumulative
HIV cases have been identified among MSM while 14 percent of cases were transmitted
through unprotected heterosexual contact and 5 percent through needle sharing among
PWID.14

HIV transmission among PWID expanded rapidly in recent years, from less than 1 percent
in 2005 to more than 5 percent in the past five years.15 There are between 12,304 and
16,607 PWID living in the Philippines, with the majority—an estimated 6,000 PWID —in
Metro Cebu and between 2,000 and 2,500 in Cebu City.16 HIV and HCV rates among this
group have been estimated at 41.6 percent and 70 percent, respectively.17 In contrast, HIV
prevalence among women who inject drugs in the Philippines has been estimated at 27

percent.18 Recent surveillance data among PWID in Cebu City show that HIV prevalence
has dropped: from 52.3 percent among male PWID in 2013 to 42.8 percent in 2015 and
from 30.4 percent among female PWID in 2013 to 25.2 percent in 2015.19 In Cebu City, up
to 74 percent of people living with HIV contracted the virus through needle sharing.20
PWID in the Cebu region are reported to inject every month, on average 18 days in a
month, and up to 12 times per day.21

Meanwhile, coverage of HIV testing and counseling (HTC) among PWID has increased—
from 1 percent in 2009 to 5 percent in 2011,22 to 7 percent at the latest estimates—though
uptake of HTC remains the lowest when compared to other key populations (see Figure
2),23 and well below the recommended coverage threshold of 40 percent.24 National data
from 2013 shows that only 6 percent of PWID were ever tested for HIV,25 while recent
surveillance results indicate a significant increase to 23 percent.26 There is no data
currently available on the past or present coverage of the antiretroviral treatment (ART)
among PWID living with HIV.

Data from 2013 showed that more than two-thirds of PWID usually inject drugs in a
shooting gallery.27 Needle sharing increased between 2007 and 2013, from 52 percent of
PWID sharing needles and syringes the last time they injected to 61 percent.28 In contrast,
data from 2009 shows that 85 percent of PWID had used sterile injecting equipment at
their last injection, down to 25 percent in 2011,29 and up to 30.7 percent in 2014.30 Local
data shows that sharing of needles among those who received free sterile injecting
equipment was 15 percent lower compared those who did not.31 Needle sharing remains
one of the most rapid and effective mechanisms for HIV transmission.32

The Philippines has one of the lowest documented rates of condom use in Asia,33 where
consistent condom use rate is estimated at 11 percent among the general population.34 In
contrast, condom use among PWID was reported at 24 percent in 2007,35 22 percent in
2009, and 15 percent in 2011,36 indicating a worrying, rapidly decreasing trend with
profound implications for HIV prevention. Among PWID, condom use at the last sexual
encounter has been estimated at 13.4 percent.37

Drug control in the Philippines has long espoused a prohibitionist approach enshrined in
several laws and policies that favor criminalization and punishment over public health
objectives.38 Specifically, the Revised Penal Code of 1930 is largely modeled on the United
States’ Harrison Act (1914) which seeks to identify individuals and organizations who
produce, import, manufacture, compound, deal in, dispense, sell, distribute, or give away
specific substances to impose penalties while framing drug control measures around a
strict law enforcement and criminal justice approach with secondary objectives of
prevention and education as well as treatment.39 Additional controls were put in place
through Republic Act No. 6425 or the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 as well as through
Republic Act No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, both of which
prioritize public security over public health objectives.

The 2002 Act specifically criminalizes possession and distribution of drug paraphernalia
such as needles and syringes. Specifically, Section 12 of the Comprehensive Dangerous
Drugs Act of 2002 states:

     The penalty of imprisonment...shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless
     authorized by law, shall possess or have under his/her control any equipment,
     instrument, apparatus, and other paraphernalia fit or intended for smoking,
     consuming, administering, injecting, ingesting, or introducing any dangerous drug
     into the body. The possession of such equipment, instrument, apparatus, and other
     paraphernalia fit or intended for any of the purposes enumerated in the preceding
     paragraph shall be prima facie evidence that the possessor has smoked, consumed,
     administered to himself/herself, injected, ingested, or used a dangerous drug and
     shall be presumed to have violated this Act.

However, global evidence unequivocally shows that distribution of sterile injecting
equipment reduces the transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections like
Hepatitis C among PWID; does not lead to an increase in drug use in general or in
intravenous injection, in particular; increases demand for health and social care services,
often resulting in better monitoring, care, and treatment; and that results are enhanced
when such efforts are included in a comprehensive package of health and social care
services.40

In that respect, several agencies have invested and worked to remove criminal penalties
associated with distribution of sterile injecting equipment. For example, the Global Fund’s
Office of the Inspector General recommended in 2010 that recipients should invest
significant efforts to address the conflicting laws and policies that prevent the distribution
of sterile injecting equipment.41

Given the legal and policy context, the vast majority of drug-related arrests involved
amphetamines (locally known as shabu), accounting for 84 percent in 2013 and 89

enforcement agencies in the country report that 8,000 Barangays are affected by illicit
drugs with 92 percent of Barangays in Metro Manila reporting illicit drug activities.43
Males are overrepresented in drug-related arrests (87 percent in both 2013 and 2014).44
Surprisingly, the Philippines Drug Enforcement Agency makes no mention in its Annual
Reports of Nubain or nalbuphine hydrochloride, the most commonly injected drug in the
country. Alarmingly, reports dating back to 2009 indicate increasing trends of injecting
combined shabu and nalbuphine hydrochloride (also known as ‘speedballs’ or
‘milkshakes’).45 Nalbuphine hydrochloride was formally included in the list of dangerous
drugs in January 2011, making its possession and use a criminal act.46

According to United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime’s 2012 World Drug Report, the
Philippines has the highest rate of methamphetamine use in East Asia. 47 National agencies
report that 2.1 percent of Filipinos ages 16 to 64 have used shabu.48 An estimated 1.6
million individuals are dependent on illicit drugs and an additional 1.8 million use illicit
drugs recreationally across the Philippines.49

Responding to HIV among PWID50

The DOH is the lead government agency responsible for the national response to
HIV/AIDS and chairs the Philippines National AIDS Council (PNAC), a multisectoral
policy-making body. Since the detection of the first recorded case of HIV in the Philippines
in 1984,51 the PNAC has developed strategies to prevent transmission and provide
treatment, care, and support to those affected by and living with HIV. Interventions
targeting PWID have been included in national strategic plans at least since 2005.52
Despite the absence of formal commitments from government agencies to scale up core
interventions like distribution of sterile injecting equipment and opioid substitution
therapy (OST) to prevent HIV transmission among PWID, a number of initiatives were
nonetheless implemented. The following is a chronological account of the evolution of
service delivery targeting PWID in the Philippines.

In 1995, the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health and the University of
Southern Philippines Foundation, with support from the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) initiated the country’s first harm reduction project

covering six Barangays of Cebu City where drug use and injecting is widespread.
Operating through outreach, clients were provided with education on the risks of needle
sharing and strategies to reduce risks such as sterilization of injecting equipment as well
as consistent condom use. Additional services included behavior change counseling,
distribution of bleach, water, condoms, and sterile needles and syringes,53 primary health
care services, and job referrals.54

Throughout the early 2000s, a number of civil society groups such as Remedios AIDS
Foundation, KABALIKAT, Caritas, the AIDS Society of the Philippines, Social Health,
Environment and Development, USAID’s Local Enhancement and Development for Health
Project, and Cebu City Health delivered outreach education targeting PWID.55 Global Fund
recipients have implemented behavior change interventions targeting PWID since 2004
(under Rounds 3 and 5).56 In 2008, Global Fund recipients continued to target PWID with
behavior change interventions to reduce the transmission of HIV and initiated
distribution of sterile injecting equipment.57

USAID also provided financial support to FHI360 to implement the Reaching Out to Most-
at-Risk Populations (ROMP) project between 2012 and 2015. The project targeted PWID
in Cebu, Mandauae, and Lapu-Lapu with the objectives of identifying and enhancing HIV
service delivery models; increasing the demand and utilization of such services; and
capacitating local service providers and partner organizations to implement, manage, and
sustain a comprehensive package of HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention
and management services. The project operated through strategic outreach, peer-led
intervention, improved HTC, and effective linkages to HIV care and treatment but did not
include distribution of sterile injecting equipment.58

The Cebu City Health Office’s Social Hygiene Clinic has also been delivering a
comprehensive package of HIV treatment, care, and support services, targeting PWID
since 2013. This effort was a unique local initiative established through multisectoral
collaboration between local government agencies and civil society groups as well as
multilateral partners that resulted in facility-based distribution of sterile injecting
equipment. However, the distribution of sterile injecting equipment from the Social
Hygiene Clinic operated informally, without formal legal support and in 2014, the Cebu
City Anti-Drug Abuse Council (CADAC) sent an official letter to demanding that such
efforts be halted immediately:

Reports from 2010 and 2012 indicate that PWID in the Philippines received 2.5 and fewer
than 10 needles and syringes per person per year respectively.60 The clinic has plans to
scale up coverage to 12.5 needles and syringes per person per year. 61 Other reports show
that only 14 percent of PWID were reached by HIV prevention programming in a 12-
month period in 2010.62 However, the current and planned coverage of sterile injecting
equipment among PWID remain well below the effective threshold to meet the needs of
PWID in preventing the spread of HIV, which is set at 200 needles and syringes per person
per year as recommended by UNAIDS.63

Other calculations estimated the cost of needle and syringe distribution at US$122 per
client, with an investment of US$0.15 per needle and syringe distributed.64 Based on these

OST is not available in the Philippines65 and medicines for substitution—methadone and
buprenorphine—are classified as dangerous drugs66 despite the fact that the most
commonly injected drug—nalbuphine hydrochloride—is an opioid that could potentially
be substituted with buprenorphine.67 In parallel, the opioid overdose antidote naloxone
is in the core list of essential medicines and is classified as “medicines requiring specific
expertise, diagnostic precision, or special equipment for use.”68 Given the classification,
naloxone is not available in community settings in the Philippines.

committed to providing financial assistance to the government of the Philippines to
support the development and strengthening of HIV prevention service delivery models
targeting MSM in Metro Manila and PWID in Metro Cebu. In March 2013, PSI was
contracted to lead the implementation of the BCP, between April 15, 2013 and December
31, 2015. In total, the ADB committed US$1,840,000 for the period of April 2013 to
December 31, 2014, and the Bank committed an additional US$500,000 from April 15,
2013 to December 31, 2015, to support the implementation of the BCP. While the total
project timeline represents 32.5 months, the original expectation was to implement the
operations study, embedded in the BCP, for a period of 24 months.

The ultimate goal of the project was to reduce HIV transmission by reducing risk
behaviors among MSM and PWID. Specifically, implementation of the BCP aimed to
develop friendly DICs and outreach services; increase demand and uptake of health
services through improved peer education and support; and strengthen governance for
development and implementation of sustainable, evidence-based policies and
interventions.

The BCP component in Cebu was designed as an OR to determine the effectiveness of a
comprehensive package of services—including distribution of sterile injecting
equipment—on HIV transmission and on drug demand among PWID in Barangay
Kamagayan, Cebu City. In addition to the BCP objectives and as a result of the OR design,

the project integrated new, more targeted objectives to measurably reduce the HIV risk
behaviors and increase demand for drug dependence treatment and rehabilitation.

PSI established local partnerships with several nongovernmental organizations, namely,
the Philippine Nongovernmental Organization Council on Population, Health and Welfare,
Cebu Plus (in Cebu), and LoveYourself (in Manila), to facilitate project implementation. In
addition, at least six consultants were hired to provide technical support to the BCP in
Cebu, including from two of the world’s leading centers of excellence on HIV/AIDS—the
University of Manitoba and the University of New South Wales (UNSW). The Bank also
supplied technical assistance through internal experts to support the BCP.

The KC3 was opened as a DIC for PWID on September 1, 2014, on the third and fourth
floors of the Kamagayan Barangay Hall, a local government office, to deliver
comprehensive HIV prevention services. The KC3 was designed to deliver basic health
care services, including the comprehensive package of HIV services through both DIC- and
outreach-based services; facilitate access to voluntary drug dependence treatment and
rehabilitation services; and contribute to the development of an enabling policy and
implementation environment. The BCP supports seven full-time staff, two part-time
medical doctors, one outreach worker, and eight peer educators.

Barangay Kamagayan is in the city’s central business district, a block away from Colon
Street, the country’s oldest street. Kamagayan is within the periphery of the Central
Visayas offices of the Philippine National Police, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency,
and the City Hall. The short distance between the Barangay and the law enforcement and
government offices, however, does not deter prostitution and illegal drug trade, which are
rampant. Kamagayan is on the list of the top 10 drug-prone villages in the city’s 80
villages.69

The BCP interventions implemented in Cebu were expected to generate the following
outcomes:

                Reduced percentage of sharing injecting equipment among PWID, from 35
                 percent to 30 percent.

                Increased percentage of PWID who never shared needles, from 37 percent to
                 45 percent.

                Increased percentage of PWID who were tested for HIV in the past 12 months
                 and who know their result, from 10 percent to 15 percent.

                                    METHODOLOGY
This report is the result of an evaluation of the PWID component of the BCP implemented
in Cebu commissioned by the Bank. This evaluation was designed to assess the impact of
the BCP in Cebu and review project performance against a range of quantitative and
qualitative expectations. The present evaluation was prepared with the objective of
providing a range of key stakeholders, especially in the Philippines, with a comprehensive
assessment of the results achieved under the PWID component of the BCP in Cebu and its
implications on national response to HIV among PWID. To assess the performance of the
BCP in Cebu, the OR component will be measured against its quantitative objectives while
achievement of the BCP objectives will also be analyzed to derive quantitative as well as
qualitative lessons learned.

The evaluation process was initiated with a thorough literature review that included
published academic and media materials, project narrative reports, and quantitative
project data. The independent evaluator visited the Philippines from December 1 to 13,
2015, and spent ten days spent in Cebu and three days in Manila. A range of site visits, key
stakeholder interviews, and focus group discussions were conducted during the visits as
summarized in annex 1.

After a comprehensive analysis of all the collected information, the evaluator provided a
comprehensive review of results, including highlighting lessons learned and good
practices based on experiences in implementing the BCP. The results of the analysis are
presented in a conclusion, with recommendations addressed to key stakeholders that will
be responsible for the continued implementation of harm reduction services targeting
PWID in the Philippines beyond the BCP. Before finalization, the Bank and UNAIDS peer
reviewers provided feedback and suggestions that were integrated into this evaluation
report.

This report has several limitations. First, the data provided to evaluate the
implementation of the BCP and the OR component was often incomplete and it was
challenging to triangulate and verify the accuracy of results. Second, the evaluator was
dependent on PSI to obtain the necessary data and access key individuals. Though
logistical support was covered by the Bank, PSI managed the local schedule and facilitated
access to clients and their relatives, community members, and key stakeholders. Third,
the evaluator had limited contact with key political figures that supported and challenged
the BCP in Cebu, not for lack of trying. In that sense, the conclusions related to the political
situation and harm reduction in the Philippines have limited value and should be read
carefully. Fourth, the evaluator had the opportunity to engage with key local
organizations that challenged the implementation of the BCP in Cebu, though there were
limited opportunities to engage with national level political leaders who also challenged
implementation of the project. Aside from a meeting with CADAC and the City Office on
Substance Abuse Prevention on December 1, 2015, there was limited official input from
drug control representatives and other sectors that have voiced their opposition. Finally,
it is important to note that this evaluation relies on observational data, without a control
population. Many of the limitations listed above are related to tight project
implementation timelines as well as the timelines for the conclusion of the BCP. There
was a limited window for the evaluator to collect, analyze, and report the findings and not
all respondents were available during the evaluation period.

                           EVALUATION OF BCP IN CEBU
As noted in the previous section, the evaluation of the BCP in Cebu will require a review
of the OR component as well as project performance under the broader BCP
programmatic objectives. However, before looking into the results of either component
to evaluate their performance, it is relevant to present a summary of the key milestones
that have marked the implementation of the BCP in Cebu.

While the BCP formally started on April 15, 2013, the illegal nature of drug paraphernalia
in the Philippines was a critical barrier to the initiation of project implementation. To
address this critical barrier, the BCP team designed the project to consider the political
sensitivities based on PSI’s recognized experience in managing the national response to
HIV among PWID in Thailand since 2009. The original project design was slightly revised
into an OR to allow implementing agencies to obtain a legal exemption from Section 12 of
the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and initiate distribution of needles and
syringes, on a scientific research basis. Essentially, the project was adapted to address
important legal barriers. Consensus-building efforts led to a tentative agreement between
the DOH and the development partners that an OR framework would facilitate rapid
implementation and provide tangible evidence to policy makers to reform existing laws
and policies.

The implementation contract between the ADB, the Bank, and PSI was amended to
integrate the OR component in November and December 2013. Meanwhile, study
protocols were finalized in May 2014 and the DOH appointed a principal investigator in
early July 2014. At the end of the same month, the Chong Hua Hospital Institutional
Review Board formally approved the protocols for the OR. The Cebu City Mayor endorsed
the OR component on August 19, 2014. In September 2014, the first standard operating
procedure (SOP) to guide service delivery was approved by the DOH and later that month,
the DDB provided the final approvals to initiate the study by issuing Resolution 298 in
early October 2014.70

The exemption provided through the DDB Resolution 298 enacted on October 8, 2014
defined a circumscribed geographical area within which the project was expected to
operate as well as a strict and limited timeframe. The Bank team shared evidence related
to the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of needle and syringe distribution with the
DDB in an effort to mobilize high-level support for the BCP. The approval of the DDB
Resolution 298 was a long, time-consuming process that significantly affected project
implementation timelines.

Recruitment of study participants started on October 14, 2014. The full complement of
787 study participants was achieved on January 31, 2015. Unfortunately, on April 29,
2015, the distribution of sterile injecting equipment under the OR was suspended because
of local political pressures that received significant media coverage in the following
months.71 Since May 2015, distribution has not been resumed at the KC3 (though
agreements are in place to resume in late December 2015).

Despite the suspension of needle and syringe distribution, the KC3 team has continued to
reach out to PWID and deliver the most comprehensive package of services available
given the restrictions in place. Though the BCP is set to officially end on December 31,

Operations Research

Operations Research Design

The OR was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive package of
interventions, which include basic health services (including harm reduction), drug
dependency treatment, and rehabilitation services as well as community development
services delivered to PWID in community settings. In that sense, the OR was intended to
yield high-quality evidence to measurably demonstrate the impact of community-based
harm reduction services on health. The results of the OR were intended to convince
decision makers and policy makers in the Philippines and unequivocally show that harm
reduction services are effective and community-based interventions targeting PWID are
critical to reducing HIV transmission at the national level.

Effectiveness was intended to be measured through a single cohort dose-response
analysis where the analyses would ideally measure the impact of the services offered by
the KC3 on (a) changing unsafe injecting behavior and thus reducing known risks for HIV
infections and/or (b) directly reducing HIV transmission, that is, a decreased rate of new
infections. Additionally, the single cohort study design was also intended to yield a
reliable evaluation of the project’s impact on reducing HIV transmission among the
overall PWID population.

The package of services offered under the OR arm of the BCP included three intervention
components (see Figure 4):

       1. Basic health services: These include outreach, distribution of sterile
          injecting equipment and condoms, counseling and screening for STI, HIV,
          Hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, and drug and harm reduction education.

       2. Demand reduction services: These include intensive outpatient treatment,
          focusing on symptomatic treatment, residential treatment, and rehabilitation
          program through supervised detoxification, aftercare, and follow-up.

       3. Community development services: These are community-based
          interventions, including, but not limited to, awareness and advocacy
          campaigns, community education, and capacity building.

Note: TB = Tuberculosis.

To achieve the objectives of the OR, its implementation was broken down into a step-by-
step algorithm as presented in Figure 5. Even before the recruitment of clients, the
implementation team had acknowledged in their concept note the need to adequately set
the scene and invest in community preparation to obtain the necessary approvals.

             assessment
                                                                   exit interviews




              Evaluation



With regard to recruitment of study participants, a minimum of 386 HIV negative clients
needed to be enrolled in the OR to generate statistically relevant results. Participant

                                               17
eligibility was based on a history of injecting nonprescribed drugs at least once in the past
six months; assessment for substance use disorder according to the DSM5; and age (at
least 18 years). A comprehensive consent form was developed and translated in Cebuano
to formally enroll clients in the OR, detailing that the study is anonymous and includes
consent for at least four serological tests, to participate in face-to-face interviews, allow
the research team to access his or her records from the intervention program, remain in
the study for the next 12 months, and return for follow-up sessions when required.

All PWID, regardless of their enrollment in the OR, were encouraged to access the KC3
services, including sterile injecting equipment, and assigned a unique identifier code to
protect their identity while facilitating data collection and analysis. After confirming
informed consent, baseline information was meant to be collected from study participants
and coded into the appropriate forms. Baseline data required administration of the
following components (which included about 150 questions):

           PWID-OR Questionnaire (Appendix D)

           Individual client record (Appendix F)

           Drug dependency examination report (Appendix G)

           World Health Organization (WHO) Alcohol, Smoking and Substance
            Involvement Screening Test v3.0 interview on substance use (Appendix H)

           Standard mini mental status examination

           Serological tests for HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis

The OR evaluation protocol was intended for serological testing of HIV negative clients at
regular three-month intervals, as well as an end line evaluation using the same tools as
for the baseline assessment and an exit interview. The data collected throughout the
intended 24-month study period were to be analyzed using rigorous statistical analysis
of baseline versus end line data to determine the impact of the KC3 services on client
behaviors and serological status.

Evaluation of the Operations Research Component

Following the implementation algorithm presented in Figure 5, the results and
achievements of the BCP OR component can now be evaluated.

Community Preparation

Given the sensitive nature of harm reduction projects in the Philippines, the BCP team
was careful to establish strategic partnerships with a range of organizations to support
the implementation of the project. Project documents highlight the need for a tailored,
culturally appropriate, and sensitive approach to minimize potential negative backlashes.
In that context, a local PWID specialist was hired early on to assist the BCP team to
mobilize the necessary support locally and to roll out the project. Key stakeholder
interviews confirm that the PWID specialist played an invaluable role in community
preparedness ahead of the launch of the OR. Local and well-respected partners like Cebu
Plus were contracted to support service delivery.

The BCP team invested considerable time and resources in mobilizing support for the
project. A significant proportion of time over the course of 2013 –2014 was invested to

                                             18
mobilize high-level endorsements from the Cebu City Mayor, from the DOH, and the DDB.
In September 2014, a study visit to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was organized for 10 high-
level government officials to facilitate approval of the OR in Cebu. In November 2014, a
workshop specifically targeting police from the Cebu City area was organized that led to
the mobilization of their support for the OR. Policy advocacy interventions were
successful and ultimately, the project was formally approved by the DDB Resolution 298:
Approving the Proposed Operations Research on Community-based Comprehensive
Services for People who Inject Drugs (PWID) in Barangay Kamagayan, Cebu City and the
Creation of a Technical Working Group (TWG) that will Formulate its Implementing
Guidelines.

The DDB Resolution 298 is an unprecedented document that allowed the distribution of
needles and syringes for medical research purposes and considerably reduced
operational risks by making Barangay Kamagayan a ‘safe zone’:

     “ . . . where there will be no arrests or apprehensions in relation to Section 12
     (Possession of Equipment, Instrument, Apparatus and other Paraphernalia for
     Dangerous Drugs) only, insofar as the needle/syringe exchange program is
     concerned, with respect to identified and registered PWID participants and
     Kamagayan Health Personnel, for the period of the aforesaid study.”72

It is also worth highlighting that the KC3 services are operating out of the local
government office—the Kamagayan Barangay Hall—that is a significant achievement in
the context of legitimizing harm reduction services and the OR. The BCP team was able to
secure permissions from the Barangay Captain after the project was endorsed officially
by the Cebu City Mayor. The KC3 thus benefits from a large office space that is provided
rent-free, demonstrating a significant level of integration with the local government and
within the Kamagayan community.

Unfortunately, the partnerships between PSI and a number of local groups were strained
quickly due to the challenges in management and communication styles and the tension
led to conflicts that the partnerships could no longer sustain. Key stakeholder interviews
confirm that as the partnership with Cebu Plus weakened and eventually ended, so did
the BCP’s position weaken in the eyes of many external key stakeholders. In parallel, the
project PWID specialist, who had facilitated many of the project’s approvals , opted not to
renew his contract with the project. Meanwhile, the project’s Technical Working Group,
designed as a multisectoral governance and oversight committee, and empowered under
Resolution 298, only met once in November 2014. The lack of engagement between the
implementers and the Technical Working Group further compromised opportunities for
growing discontent in the community and beyond.

Meanwhile, the tensions between project partners were exacerbated by external political
sensitivities and media coverage of the BCP OR in Kamagayan. In the end, the
achievements generated by the DDB Resolution 298 were temporarily suspended in April
2015. Already in late February 2015, the Cebu CADAC had issued a formal resolution to
oppose the temporary exemption to Section 12 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs
Act as well as the implementation of the OR in Kamagayan. Starting in May 2015, Senator
Vicente Sotto III brought even more media attention to the efforts in Kamagayan that
were still plaguing implementation in December 2015 during the evaluator’s visit.

                                                19
In that respect, though significant advocacy efforts were invested to secure approvals in
the early phases of the project, the impact of those advocacy efforts was clearly not
sustainable. Indeed, sterile injecting equipment was only distributed for a total of five
months over the 24-month life cycle of the OR. It is important to note that the BCP team
did not develop a communications or advocacy plan.73 Though there was no formal plan,
some communication and advocacy activities obviously occurred, especially in the start-
up phase of the project, though there is limited evidence of such efforts beyond securing
the approval through DDB Resolution 298. Beyond reporting to donors, the vast majority
of external key stakeholders were never informed about project plans, developments,
achievements, and challenges. The fact that the Technical Working Groups only met once
in November 2014 is also testament to the lack of effective and strategic planning around
communications and advocacy.

Capacity Building and Orientation

The KC3 project reports indicate that few training workshops were held to build capacity
of the KC3 staff, peer educators, and outreach workers across the OR life cycle. In June
2014, a multistakeholder training workshop was organized with the BCP support to
strengthen delivery of psychosocial support services for PWID and during the same time,
project peer educators were trained by an expert consultant while a comprehensive
training curriculum was also developed to facilitate local implementation of capacity
building on a regular basis. In February 2015, a refresher workshop was organized for
nine participants. However, the BCP team has integrated refreshers in their weekly team
meetings, showing adaptability and effective financial management.

However, despite the development of technical and operational SOPs, there is little
evidence that any trainings have been rolled out to ensure that project workers had
sufficient capacity and understanding to manage and implement project activities. For
example, the research protocol was developed in May 2014, but there is no evidence that
training was rolled out to inform project workers of the expectations. Similarly, a
technical SOP on DIC management was developed in August, revised in September, and
again in December 2014, but there is no evidence that training was delivered to project
workers following finalization of these documents.

Another key example relates to the development and implementation of the OR
evaluation protocol. Though the evaluation protocol was meant to be developed through
technical support from the UNSW and lead to capacity development of the BCP team, the
protocol required the prior development and deployment of the SOP on DIC management
and health service delivery. In the end, the evaluation protocol was finalized but the
majority of the project workers were either unaware of this document or confused it with
technical SOPs.

Despite these important limitations, discussions with project workers showed that they
were generally confident to very confident about managing the tasks assigned to them.
They also expressed that their formal education had generally prepared them well to
conduct their tasks and they reported being generally comfortable with managing their
workload. However, virtually all workers interviewed showed a very high interest for
opportunities to further develop their professional capacity, especially in areas related to
drugs, drug counseling, and harm reduction service delivery.



73PSI developed a Marketing Communication Plan (2015) to enhance outreach through a social marketing
approach. However, the plan does not include external communications or advocacy activities geared at
maintaining high-level approval and understanding of the project modalities.

                                                 20
Finally, it is worth highlighting that, during interviews and focus group discussions,
virtually all project workers highlighted the negative impact of a very high internal
turnover of workers. The inherent instability of the project had an impact on job security
and workers’ commitments, especially in the start -up phase, given the lack of clarity on
official legal approvals that remained pending at the time. However, it is worth pointing
out that even after the distribution of sterile injecting equipment was suspended in April
2015, there has been very little staff turnover. Similarly, the BCP workers showed
tremendous loyalty when they remained with the project for several months without pay
due to administrative constraints. At the time of the evaluation visit, orientation for new
project workers were taking place on an ad hoc basis as needed.

Recruitment of Study Participants

By January 31, 2015, a total of 787 clients provided informed consent to participate in the
OR, as shown in Table 3. All clients—irrespective of their participation in the OR—were
provided with a unique identifier code and ID cards to protect their confidentiality. All
project workers were very sensitive to protecting client confidentiality and reminders
were posted as signs in the DIC common areas and in the offices.

             Table 3. Schedule of Participants Recruitment for Operations Research

   January 2015                                             293

Baseline Assessment

Although the comprehensive baseline assessment tools were scheduled to be applied to
all study participants upon enrollment, Appendix D (PWID-OR Questionnaire) was
completed only 113 times, Appendix F (Individual Client Record) for only 260 clients, and
Appendix H (WHO Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test) only 208
times. Complete baseline information through administration of the comprehensive
assessment tools is only available for 24 clients.

Ideally, baseline data would have been available for the minimum 386 study participants
to generate statistically relevant conclusions about the impact of services. Unfortunately,
comprehensive baseline data is extremely limited and compromises the possibility of
deriving meaningful conclusions about effectiveness of needle and syringe distribution
on HIV transmission in Cebu. Given this important constraint, this evaluation will limit its
review and conclusions regarding the PWID-OR component of the BCP and further,
quantitative review of project data will be analyzed in the next section evaluating the
BCP’s overall performance.

As an example, although serological testing for HIV at baseline covered 100 percent of
participants enrolled in the OR, the process and results of serological testing will be
discussed in the next sections of the evaluation report.

Further discussion regarding service delivery and follow-up will also be discussed in the
next section covering the BCP’s overall performance.

End line Assessment

At the time of the evaluator’s visit to Cebu, no end line data had been collected and the
majority of project workers were unaware of plans to initiate end line data collection. End
line assessment was expected only if PWID-OR, including distribution of sterile injecting
equipment, had been resumed. PWID-OR could not effectively be implemented given the
compromised timelines and political challenges.

Performance Evaluation

At the time of the evaluation in December 2015, there was sufficient evidence to conclude
that the OR component of the BCP did not conclusively demonstrate within the project
timelines the impact of the distribution of sterile injecting equipment on HIV transmission
among PWID. Without complete baseline data for the minimum 386 clients, with no end
line data to compare results to, and compromised timelines—much of it beyond the
control of the implementing agencies—it is clear that no conclusions can be formulated
regarding the effectiveness of needle and syringe distribution on reducing HIV
transmission. However, despite this critical quantitative limitation, it is important to look
back and draw key lessons learned from the process based on qualitative findings from
the overall analysis.

Despite the lack of hard evidence regarding the effectiveness of needle and syringe
distribution in Cebu, the BCP implementation team and partners should be commended
for generating significant positive results. For example, Resolution 298 is largely the
result of concerted advocacy efforts, which represents a significant milestone in drug
policy advocacy in the Philippines. Similarly, the integration of the KC3 in the local
government office is an important achievement that legitimized the efforts in Barangay
Kamagayan.

Mobilizing local government support for the PWID component of the BCP was an
important achievement despite the lack of sustainability of such arrangements. Local
government officials from the DOH, the Mayor’s office, and the local Barangay played
important roles in negotiating the requirements for the project to be allowed to be
initiated. Technical support was also mobilized locally from the Social Hygiene Clinic
where some PWID had been getting sterile injecting equipment before the start of the
BCP. A tentative truce was negotiated with the police through Resolution 298 that seemed
to be effective in limiting arrests of clients around the KC3. In essence, the project team
was able to mobilize significant multisectoral support locally to initiate and carry out the
majority of project activities.

It is also worth pointing out that the efforts deployed by the project workers to obtain
genuinely informed consent and protect client confidentiality was sustained as a core
value throughout the performance of their duties.

Needle and syringe distribution operated only from December 1, 2014 to April 30, 2015,
because of both a lengthy process to secure the necessary approvals and a targeted
political media campaign that polarized issues around the implementation of the OR. This
situation was compounded with earlier delays in the start-up phase because of revised
contracts between donors and implementers, and in the end, only five months’ worth of
needle and syringe distribution data is available.

Though implementation of the OR was negatively affected by many external factors, the
development of a project risk assessment plan could have identified these external
bottlenecks and developed contingencies, accordingly. In addition, knowing the

                                             22
criminalized nature of needle and syringe distribution in the Philippines, the OR should
have included a very targeted external communications and policy advocacy plan with
activities to ensure continued support of key stakeholders. Finally, the BCP team should
have developed strategies to mobilize support from members of the Technical Working
Group.

BCP Implementation

BCP Implementation Results

Originally, the BCP was designed to reduce HIV transmission and increase demand and
uptake of comprehensive health services among PWID through improved peer-led DIC
and outreach services. Though limited conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness
of the intervention package, an analysis of project data collected through regular M&E
mechanisms will provide insight into the BCP’s overall performance. As with the OR
component, the M&E records were often incomplete. That said, sufficient project data was
made available to the evaluator to assess overall project performance.

The performance of the BCP cannot be evaluated against specific indicators intrinsic to
the project as those were specifically designed to meet the requirements of the OR.
However, implementation of the BCP can be assessed with regard to coverage against
recommendations formulated by the UN agencies,74 and good practices and lessons
learned can be identified to determine overall performance.

The results presented in the following paragraphs are organized according to the overall
programmatic structure, as described in Figure 4. Essentially, the results of the PWID
component of the BCP in Cebu are organized around three programmatic pillars: basic
health services, demand reduction services, and community development services.

BCP Reach

A total of 1,042 PWID were reached by the KC3 services between October 2014 and
December 2015 (see Table 4). Clients were from 14 municipalities, with the majority from
Cebu City (n = 788; 76 percent) and Mandauae, the second most important municipality
(n = 34; 3 percent). This implies that in a 15-month period, the KC3 services covered 32–
39 percent of the estimated PWID in Cebu City based on the latest population size
estimates of 2,000 to 2,500 PWID.75

Clients were from 60 Barangays, with the highest number from Kamagayan. Table 5
summarizes the distribution of the KC3 clients across the most important Barangays for
the project. This shows that the BCP was effective at reaching PWID even beyond the
immediate target ‘safe zone’ and managed to attract a significant number of PWID clients
to receive services in Kamagayan. This also shows that there is considerable demand for
client-centered HIV prevention services for PWID.

Though there was limited M&E data available to track number of client visits at the KC3
during the 15 months of operations, discussions with project workers indicate that
between 50 and 60 clients visited the DIC per day while sterile injecting equipment was
being distributed. However, after suspension of the distribution at the end of April 2015,
attendance at the KC3 dropped to 10–15 client visits per day. A DOH representative
expressed admiration for the achievements of the KC3 team noting that:

    “KC3 is the strongest, most effective mechanism to reach people who inject drugs
    and facilitate access to a comprehensive package of health services in Cebu, if not
    all of the Philippines.” Key informant.




                                             24
Overall, the PWID component of the BCP in Cebu reached a considerable number of PWID
from a range of locations in and around Barangay Kamagayan. The reach of the project
indicates that the services were sufficiently attractive for clients to undertake journeys to
the KC3. Participants in focus group discussions repeatedly described the KC3 as a unique
initiative and underlined that they felt greater trust toward the KC3 services compared to
other health and HIV prevention services.

Distribution of Commodities

With regard to the distribution of sterile injecting equipment, the KC3 team was able to
operate this service only for five months, between December 2014 when Resolution 298
was issued and April 2015 when the services were suspended due to political pressures.
During the five months the services were operated, the KC3 team distributed a total of
37,322 sterile needles and syringes (Terumo, #27) across 2,199 client-contacts, or an
average of 16 needles and syringes per client-contact per month. If the service had been
sustained and performance maintained, this would have provided an effective coverage
of 196 needles per client per year. Such coverage is considered high by the UN guidelines
and it is worth highlighting that such results, achieved in such a short time and in such a
challenging implementing environment, are even more commendable.

The KC3 needles are generally distributed in packs of five and labeled with a sticker from
the ROMP. A weekly limit of 10 needles and syringes was put in place. Unfortunately,
despite the very high coverage among the KC3 clients, incidents of theft of injecting
equipment were reported by project workers, indicating a significant unaddressed gap in
the needle and syringe market. Key stakeholder interviews and focus group discussions
revealed that clients stole injecting equipment to resell, again indicating that many PWID
have not been covered by the project and that demand for such services remains very
high. Nonetheless, all clients interviewed expressed a significant preference for collecting
free sterile injecting equipment from the KC3 over the Cebu City Health Center or
compared to purchasing from private sector pharmacies. Clients described the services
at the KC3 as friendly, client-centered, tailored to their needs, and comfortable and free
of stigma and discrimination.

The KC3 team also collected a total of 32,116 used needles and syringes through 1,501
client-contacts or an average of 15 used needles per client-contact. The KC3 performance
results are summarized in Table 6. Used injecting equipment is collected by the project
workers in disposal boxes using universal precautions on a daily basis while special clean-
up activities have been organized with clients and community members. During one
clean-up day, up to 40 kg of used injecting equipment was collected in large barrels for
disposal. However, the local hospital does not have an incinerator and disposal is often
delayed, leaving potentially unsecured quantities of unsterile injecting equipment in the
open and reports confirm that a number of clients have broken into the disposal barrels
to get injecting equipment. Additional reports from early in the project implementation
life cycle indicate that issues were raised about unsecured unsterile blood products at the
KC3. However, these issues were thoroughly addressed by PSI and no additional incidents
have occurred in relation to used injecting equipment and blood products at the KC3 after
the first year.

Since the distribution of sterile injecting equipment was suspended, demand for bleach
has increased significantly, as reported by key stakeholder interviews and focus group
discussions. It is worth pointing out that there was a high degree of agreement among
project workers and key stakeholders related to the KC3 that distribution of additional
equipment should be seriously considered. For example, bleach, alcohol swabs,
tourniquets, and cotton balls were requested by the majority of clients interviewed.

A partnership with the ROMP project has led to a public awareness campaign in
Kamagayan where large posters remind PWID to clean their injecting equipment if it is
not sterile (see Figure 6 and media reports76).

During the implementation of the BCP in Cebu, a total of 7,785 male latex condoms were
distributed to project clients (see details in Table 7). The KC3 condoms are prepackaged
and each pack contains three individually wrapped condoms. Clients were also provided
with free sachets of lubricant though there is no official record of their distribution.77 In
total, the project team recorded 660 condom distribution contacts, implying that about
12 condoms (or four packs) were distributed on average for every client-contact. In the
end, the KC3 condom coverage among all its clients is 7.5 condoms per person over the

77Focus group discussions and key stakeholder interviews revealed that lubricants were initially included
in the packs with condoms; however, clients reported discarding the lube so the project team decided to
make the lube ‘optional’ and the sachets can be collected on a voluntary basis.

                                                    27
While the UN guidelines recommend a minimum coverage of 50 condoms per person per
year and a high coverage of 100 condoms per person per year,78 the KC3 results fall well
short of these targets. However, knowing that consistent condom use among PWID in the
Philippines is extremely low, the results achieved by the BCP implementation of condom
distribution are important in scale and scope. Despite these important achievements,
there was virtually no mention of condoms in focus group discussions with clients or key
informant interviews.

In addition, the KC3 team confirmed that condoms were being distributed as early as
October 2014 all the way through to December 2015. Unfortunately, regular M&E data
records were incomplete, so it is likely that the results presented here are an
underestimation of the project achievements.

Condoms and injecting equipment are stocked at the KC3. The project commodities are
stored on the outdoor balcony of the third floor office, under plastic tarps. While the
limited amount of physical space in the KC3 explains why commodities are stocked in
such a way, exposure to the elements will inevitably reduce those commodities’ shelf-life
while leaving project commodities unsecured could lead to negative political, legal, and
health consequences. In parallel, there was no evidence of a proper stock management
system—from bin cards to performing physical counts of commodities.

HIV Testing

Out of the 1,042 PWID who were reached by the KC3 services, 1,039 were tested for HIV
(99.7 percent) by trained medical professionals at the KC3 center. Table 8 summarizes
the results of HIV testing from the KC3 services. Such coverage of project clients is
impressive and warrants recognition, especially given that data show that only fewer than
10 percent of PWID have been tested for HIV in the Philippines.79 Similarly, the results
achieved in relation to HIV testing under the BCP are significant given that the UN
agencies recommend a minimum coverage of 40 percent and consider coverage above 75
percent as high coverage.80

Clients who tested positive on an HIV test were referred to the Cebu City Social Hygiene
Clinic. Unfortunately, referral data was not integrated in the regular M&E mechanisms
and it was impossible for the evaluation team to determine follow-up actions. However,
focus group discussions with clients indicated that all those who were living with HIV
were now on ART.

Table 9 shows that out of the 1,039 clients who were tested at baseline, only 224 came
back for a second test, 46 came back for a third test, and 12 for the fourth end line test.
The OR protocol required that at least four HIV tests be conducted during the 24-month
study period. At repeat, a total of 13 clients were identified with serodiscordant results
compared to the baseline test —all 13 clients were identified after about three months
after baseline testing. No additional serodiscordant results compared to baseline were
identified at the third and fourth tests.

Out of the 523 KC3 clients who tested negative for HIV, only 112 came back for a second
test, only 26 for a third test, and only 9 for the fourth end line test. While efforts should
have been deployed by the KC3 team to focus their interventions on the 112 PWID who
tested negative for HIV to retain and retest them, there seems to have been no specific
efforts to do so. However, it is important to note that the KC3 services had been presented
to the community and potential clients as a source of sterile injecting equipment; when
distribution was suspended, clients’ motivation to return to the KC3—and get retested—

                                                   29
dropped dramatically. Despite efforts to reincentivize clients by providing free
multivitamin packs, clients’ return visits to the DIC were significantly reduced and
compromised opportunities for retesting.

Evidence in the BCP M&E records shows that 235 clients received a confirmation test
from the Cebu City Social Hygiene Clinic. Among the 516 PWID who tested positive for
HIV at the KC3, only 228 received a confirmation test. Despite the low coverage with
regard to confirmatory testing, the testing conducted at the KC3 is robust and conforms
to national protocols and expectations set forth by the DOH with regard to HTC. Finally, it
is worth pointing out that several PWID clients have highlighted the importance of HIV
testing services and its impact on their lives, particularly with regard to managing their
health better. The KC3 clients reported that they felt comfortable accessing HTC services
at the DIC and felt confident about the capacity of the KC3 workers.

Testing for Viral Hepatitis and STI

Out of 1,042 clients reached by the KC3 services, 801 (76.9 percent) received on-site
serological screening for HCV. Again, the coverage of project clients is impressive and
though there are no clear HCV testing coverage recommendations, it can be assumed from
the recommendations from the UN agencies on HIV testing that coverage above 75
percent should be considered high.

Table 10 shows that 688 of the 801 KC3 clients who received serological screening for
HCV were reactive at baseline (85.9 percent). Furthermore, it is important to note that of
the 516 clients who tested positive for HIV at baseline, only 5 were nonreactive to HCV
compared to 372 who were reactive. This shows that a very high proportion of PWID are
coinfected with both HIV and HCV. However, key stakeholders ’ interviews and focus
group discussions confirmed that there were no options available for treatment of HCV
for PWID in Cebu.

Project data also shows that only 162 clients returned for a retest after three months,
only 30 returned after six months, and only 5 returned after nine months. Data also show
that among those who were retested, only one test yielded serodiscordant results from
nonreactive at baseline, at the first retest. It is also worth pointing out that though
coverage was high, clients who returned for retests were all HCV reactive at baseline. As
noted above with regard to HIV testing, the KC3 team would have done well to develop
targeted strategies with nonreactive clients to prevent HCV transmission. In parallel,
given the high prevalence of HCV among the KC3 clients, additional information,
education, and communication materials could have been developed to raise awareness
regarding prevention of transmission, management of the liver, and options for
treatment.

In contrast to HCV testing, 416 KC3 clients received HBV testing (40 percent). Coverage
is comparable to the minimum coverage levels recommended by the UN agencies for HIV
testing. Table 11 shows that out of the 416 KC3 clients who received serological screening
for HBV, only 85 came back for retest after three months, 13 after six months, and 4 after
nine months.

Across all the KC3 serological testing activities, a total of 411 clients were tested for HIV,
HCV, HBV, and syphilis. In addition, comparing results across the four tests shows
significant coverage at baseline, with a 20 percent to 22 percent return rate for the first
retest after three months. At the third and final retest, clients return rates drop
dramatically low, at around 1 percent for all four tests. Table 13 summarizes the coverage
results achieved with the KC3 serological testing.

Other Basic Health Services

All 1,042 KC3 clients were provided with a free health checkup at baseline. Additional
services were provided free of charge to the KC3 clients on a voluntary basis. Significant
efforts were invested to improve hygiene and general cleanliness among the KC3 clients.
Special social events were organized to mobilize both clients and community members —
on bath day and on haircut day—where facilities and equipment like soap, toothbrushes,
and toothpaste were provided free to the KC3 clients.

All clients were encouraged to enroll in regular demand reduction and harm reduction
counseling sessions with the KC3 staff. Counseling sessions are conducted in private with
trained counselors. Harm reduction counseling sessions were in high demand, with an
average of 1.9 harm reduction counseling session for all the 1,042 KC3 clients. In contrast,
drug demand counseling was less popular, with only 224 recorded sessions. However,
since August 2015, the KC3 team has established a partnership with the Society for the
Divine Word, which facilitates weekly NA sessions accessed on a voluntary basis by the
KC3 clients. There was no M&E data available but focus group discussions with clients
indicated great appreciation for these sessions. Clients also noted that counseling
sessions had been useful in developing strategies to control their drug use, reduce the
frequency of their consumption, and seek assistance from professionals to better manage
their drug use, their health, and their lives.

The cessation of needle and syringe distribution at the KC3 had a significant impact on
the uptake of health services among clients starting May 2015. However, the KC3 team
developed an innovative approach to incentivize clients to return to the DIC and continue
to access basic health services. The KC3 team initiated distribution of multivitamin packs


                                                  32
in May 2015, which successfully motivated a number of clients to return to the DIC. A total
of 1,201 multivitamin packs were distributed, providing 1.15 packs for every KC3 client.

Meanwhile, spotty M&E records show that very few referrals were completed but
discussions with the KC3 staff indicates that many more clients were referred to expert
health services. Specifically, key stakeholder interviews with representatives from the
Cebu City Health Office indicated that 40 to 50 KC3 clients were being referred to their
clinic on a monthly basis while needle and syringe distribution was in operation.
However, the same stakeholders noted a drastic decrease in referrals to fewer than five
per month after distribution of sterile injecting equipment was suspended.

Drug Dependence Treatment and Rehabilitation

The KC3 team has established a partnership with the Argao TRC, located about 160 km
away from Cebu City. The Argao TRC is a closed government-certified facility that offers
a strict Daytop therapeutic community treatment model with cold turkey approaches,
with minimum seven months inpatient commitment followed by nine months of aftercare
and follow-ups.

At the time of the evaluation in December 2015, there were 130 clients at the Argao TRC
over a capacity of 100 beds, though the center was in process of expanding its capacity to
150 beds. Based on a sample of 161 records reviewed, the majority of clients at the center
were referred through the criminal justice system (87 percent) while others were
committed to the center by family members (13 percent). The majority of clients used
shabu (46 percent), cannabis (36 percent), and nalbuphine hydrochloride (injected) (16
percent). Admission to the center costs PHP 3,000 per month and clients are not allowed
to leave until the program is completed. Escapees are returned to the center and the
duration of their detention increased.

 Box 1. Drug Dependence Treatment
 In 2012, the UN agencies released a joint statement calling on member states to close compulsory drug
 detention and rehabilitation centers without delay and to release the individuals detained therein.81 Such
 centers have been generally characterized as ineffective, unsafe for clients, costly and insufficiently
 capacitated, and that a great proportion of detainees there may not be clinically dependent and,
 therefore, in no need of intensive inpatient services.82 Instead, the UN agencies recommend that drug
 dependence treatment be based on the following principles:83
      ● Multiplying treatment options on offer will better meet client’s individual needs
      ●   Evidence-based treatment options
      ●   Selection of treatment options by the client on a voluntary basis, without coercion or pressure
      ●   Culturally tailored and relevant treatment options
      ●   Respect for human rights, guarantee of ethical compliance, and safeguarding clients’ well-being
          and security
      ●   Meaningful participation and engagement of the community (civil society, peer groups, people
          who use drugs)
      ●   Integration of key interventions in low-threshold84 health service outlets
      ●   Multisectoral coordination and collaboration, especially between public health and public
          security


Nine KC3 clients were referred to the Argao TRC and voluntarily enrolled in the inpatient
treatment program. All the KC3 clients were exempted of monthly fees. Though coverage
here is very low, focus group discussions with the Argao TRC staff and the nine remaining
KC3 clients at the center as well as key stakeholder interviews revealed that the BCP
implementation has stimulated demand for drug treatment and rehabilitation services.
More specifically, the KC3 clients who volunteered to register at the Argao TRC would not
have done so without the KC3 services.

     Without the KC3 counseling services, I know that my son would never have
     voluntarily enrolled in a drug treatment program. – Mother of KC3 client at Argao

     My husband told me about this place [KC3] and that he wanted to volunteer for
     drug treatment in Argao, but I didn’t believe him. It was just another one of his
     empty promises. But once I came to KC3 and met with the drug dependence
     counselor, the people here convinced me that my husband’s situation can improve.

Focus group discussions with the TRC staff also indicated that the KC3 clients are
considered more motivated to change and easier to manage most likely due to the fact
that they volunteered instead of being forced into treatment. The TRC staff also noted that

the KC3 team had been instrumental in building confidence among clients and community
members.

Focus group discussions with the KC3 clients at the Argao TRC revealed that clients were
grateful for the opportunity to access free drug dependence treatment at the Argao TRC.
There was consensus among the KC3 clients currently enrolled in rehabilitation at the
Argao TRC that there were few other options for drug dependence treatment available to
them—even accessing the Argao TRC on their own would have been very challenging for
mainly financial and legal reasons. Clients indicated that they felt safe, significantly more
so compared to being in prison. Many of the clients expressed a desire to apply for peer
educator jobs upon release from the center. One of the clients interviewed at the Argao
TRC worked as a peer educator at the KC3 before enrolling and initiating this
rehabilitation program.

Focus group discussions with families of the KC3 clients at the Argao revealed immense
gratitude for the opportunity to access free drug treatment. One family member noted the
significant financial savings that were generated:

    He used to spend about PHP 6,000 per month to buy drugs. Now, I have more
    money take care of the family. My kids eat better food! – Wife of KC3 client at the
    Argao TRC.

Overall, the nine clients and their family members who were interviewed during the
evaluator’s visit to the Philippines in December 2015 showed a high level of satisfaction
and appreciation for the opportunity to enroll and benefit from the KC3 partnership with
the Argao TRC.

Community Development Services

As noted earlier in the section covering the operation research component, significant
efforts were invested by the project team to develop an enabling environment for the
PWID component of the BCP to be implemented in Cebu. The previous section has
highlighted how efforts made to obtain a legal exemption to Section 12 of the
Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 were rewarded with the passing of
Resolution 298: Approving the Proposed Operations Research on Community-Based
Comprehensive Services for People who Inject Drugs (PWID) in Barangay Kamagayan,
Cebu City and the Creation of a Technical Working Group (TWG) that will Formulate its
Implementing Guidelines, that approved legal implementation of needle and syringe
distribution in the context of scientific research. The same section of this report
underlined how the project team was able to mobilize local government support from a
wide range of agencies to initiate the project, how strategic partnerships contributed to
mobilizing approvals, and how the KC3 operations were integrated in local government
units at the Barangay level. The assessment of the OR also showed that efforts were
deployed to strengthen the capacity of the project workers, clients as well as other key
stakeholders involved in the project.

BCP Performance Evaluation

The BCP was designed to reduce HIV transmission and increase demand and uptake of
comprehensive health services among PWID through improved peer-led DIC and
outreach services. Specifically, the project aimed to reduce needle sharing and increase
uptake of HIV testing. National sentinel surveillance data collected in Cebu between April
and June 2015 shows that the BCP contributed to achieving these objectives. Integrated
HIV/AIDS Behavioral Sentinel Surveillance results from 2015 indicate that sharing of

                                             35
injecting equipment decreased from 35 percent in 2013 to 25 percent; the proportion of
PWID who had not shared needles and syringes at their last injection increased from 31
percent in 2103 to 82 percent; and the proportion of PWID testing for HIV increased from
6 percent in 2013 to 23 percent.85

In addition, based on a thorough review of M&E data collected by implementing agencies
as well as inputs from focus group discussions and key stakeholder interviews, this
evaluation finds that the BCP objectives were largely met. Specifically, data shows a
significant uptake in HIV-related services through peer-led outreach and DIC-based
services. Coverage among project clients is impressively high for the short
implementation period and the multiple challenges encountered. Table 15 summarizes
coverage of the KC3 services.

The KC3 clients report being very satisfied with the comprehensive package of health
services offered under the BCP and feel welcome and accepted at the KC3. Community
members in Kamagayan, including family members of the KC3 clients, also praise the
service as an excellent intervention. Virtually all key stakeholders interviewed noted that
the KC3 team had performed especially well in building trust between clients and their
health service providers, families, and community. In that sense, the community around
Kamagayan has a very good understanding of the need for free distribution of sterile
injecting equipment in their neighborhood.

The KC3 clients, family members, and community representatives also appreciated
efforts from the KC3 team to promote demand reduction, through counseling, NA
sessions, and privileged access to the Argao TRC. Many key stakeholders interviewed
noted that the demand reduction component of the KC3 was often overlooked and
misunderstood though the majority felt that integration of demand reduction services
would support the legitimacy of harm reduction services and approaches. However, it is
not possible to assess to what extent the BCP contributed to supporting abstinence among
PWID reached.

One of the most important qualitative achievements of the PWID component of the BCP
in Cebu was the rollout of a comprehensive package of HIV prevention, demand reduction,
and community development services. Though the distribution of sterile injecting
equipment was suspended, the majority of services continued to operate with great
success, as indicated by the coverage levels recorded by the project team. In essence, the
KC3 became the first and only one-stop-shop where PWID felt comfortable and respected

and could voluntarily access a wide range of health and social care services without fear
of stigma or legal consequences.

The KC3 clients reported great appreciation for the opportunity to become peer
educators and those clients who became peer educators explained multiple benefits they
now enjoyed, including getting a small salary, reducing their drug use, and feeling valued
and valuable. One peer specifically said:

    Becoming a peer educator improved my life. I feel more confident, I’m useful and
    productive, and I help others.

There is great demand and genuine interest among the KC3 and Argao clients to become
peer educators and provide support to PWID. The professionalization of PWID through
peer educator roles has also reportedly reduced stigma and discrimination and increased
acceptance of PWID in the community. Should services for PWID be scaled up in Cebu and
beyond, recruiting a workforce of peer educators should not be a critical challenge—an
important lesson learned for future harm reduction projects in the Philippines.

Another critical lesson learned is the impact of suspending distribution of sterile injecting
equipment. Uptake of the services radically decreased, contacts with the KC3 project
workers fell, and referrals almost stopped. Multiple clients were lost to follow up and the
bond of trust cultivated by the KC3 workers was suddenly compromised. Several key
stakeholders noted the critical enabling role of distributing sterile injecting equipment:

    If we don’t provide them with needles, they won’t come to the clinic even if our
    services are free. Distribution of sterile injecting equipment is critical to stimulate
    enrollment in health services and hopefully in treatment for HIV and other
    infections.

Despite the lack of continuity, it is clear from the evidence analyzed in this report that
needles and syringes are in high demand. Stocks remain available from the BCP at the end
of the project and those should be used for HIV prevention among PWID, as originally
intended.

Though the BCP objectives were largely met, some important areas have been identified
as critical gaps. First, the evaluation identified significant weaknesses in M&E. The project
did not have a clear M&E framework and while outcome indicators and some output
indicators were developed, the data collection and M&E systems did not effectively
capture the data to measure performance and data collection was irregular. Project
reports do not indicate the rollout of any training or skills building sessions around M&E,
data collection, and data analysis. While the absence of data and documentation does not
necessarily imply that these activities did not take place, these weaknesses have certainly
compromised the opportunity to draw strong conclusions about the role of harm
reduction services in Cebu.

Second, significant delays in project setup, mobilizing allies, and securing approvals
combined with the cessation of needle and syringe distribution compromised the entire
BCP timeline. Originally intended as a 24-month project, services were only delivered for
15 months, only five of which included distribution of sterile injecting equipment. The
shortened timeline also compromised the capacity to generate reliable conclusions for
the future.

Third, knowing that distribution of sterile injecting equipment is a criminal act in the
Philippines, the BCP should, by default, have included provisions for strategic advocacy

                                              37
interventions across the entire project life cycle. The absence of advocacy staff at the KC3
and the lack of advocacy plans have been identified as critical gaps, especially given the
immense political and media pressures exerted on the project. In parallel, the absence of
an external communications plan—to regularly keep both allies and opponents supplied
with strategic evidence—and dedicated workers to implement communications activities
are critical gaps that should have been addressed.

In the same context, when the project attracted the attention of key political figures—
Senator Vincente Sotto and Senator Grace Poe—the project implementation team was
taken aback and progress slowed significantly, given that their focus was diverted from
service delivery and data collection to negotiating what had in their minds been already
approved. Though these external challenges could have been foreseen and risk
management strategies developed in advance of such events, this by no means implies
that foresight and planning could have resolved this very sensitive political issue.
However, the legally contentious nature of the project should have compelled the
implementer to develop such strategies as well as the DOH and donor agencies to demand
such plans be in place as part of their oversight roles. Extensive experience from the
region could also have been mobilized to reduce the risk of such vocal opposition, as
highlighted in Box 2.

 Box 2. Scaling-up Harm Reduction in Southeast Asia
 Of the 23 countries in Southeast and South Asia, 17 countries are implementing needle and syringe
 programs and 15 countries are offering OST to PWID in need.86 Across the region, governments have
 demonstrated their leadership in responding to HIV among PWID by scaling up harm reduction and
 working toward an enabling legal and policy environment to facilitate service delivery.
 In Malaysia, the government had invested RM 69.7 million of the national budget to support the
 implementation of harm reduction programs through partnerships with civil society organizations by the
 end of 2011.87 Financial contributions for NSEP between 2006 and 2015 show that 69 percent of funds
 came from national donors, compared to 31 percent from external sources.88 Overall, the government of
 Malaysia has demonstrated that early interventions with significant investments in harm reduction
 service delivery targeting PWID are effective at reducing HIV transmission. WHO has also recognized
 Malaysia’s investment of national resources as a model of good practice,89 while the Bank’s assessment of
 return on investment and cost-effectiveness of harm reduction programming in Malaysia shows
 conclusively that even with the present moderately low coverage, priority harm reduction services such
 as distribution of sterile injecting equipment and OST are effective and cost-effective interventions for
 averting HIV infections.90
 Driven by the rapid spread of HIV, Vietnam’s response to drug use has undergone significant
 transformation in the past decade. The last decade has witnessed a progressive change in the mindset of
 political leaders in Vietnam around illicit drug use and HIV issues. This has led to adoption of evidence-
 based interventions and the evolution of drug policy that support the scale-up of these interventions.
 Significant policy changes have allowed the implementation of HIV prevention and drug dependence
 treatment services. In 2005, the Communist Party and the National Assembly became significantly and
 proactively involved in the drug and HIV policy-making process. The 2005 Directive No. 54 shows a
 remarkable shift in the mindset of the Communist Party, shifting away from ‘social evils’ toward a more
 holistic and balanced approach. Decree 108, approved in 2007 to guide the implementation of the HIV
 Law, created a crucial legal corridor for the implementation of a harm reduction program for people who
 use drugs.91

 In an attempt to focus criminal sanctions on drug production and trafficking, Vietnam made a series of
 revisions to the Law on Drug Control in 2008 and to the Penal Code in 2009 that downgraded drug
 possession from a criminal to an administrative offence. The Revised Law on Drug Control (2008)
 acknowledges that drug use is a social problem and that drug users should be provided with treatment
 instead of punishment. To harmonize the criminal and administrative frameworks, the Law on Handling
 Administrative Offences was approved in 2012. While the law allowed for diversion of sex workers away
 from compulsory detention centers, the same considerations were not applied to people who use and
 inject drugs.92 More recently, the government of Vietnam abolished the death penalty for illicit drug
 possession and procurement.93
 Vietnam significantly scaled up access and coverage of core harm reduction services, focusing on
 distribution of sterile injecting equipment and OST. Reports show substantial and consistent scale-up of
 harm reduction services in Vietnam from 2005 onward.94 More than 1,000 sterile injecting equipment
 distribution sites were reportedly opened between 2008 and 2011.95 Reported estimates from 2011
 regarding needle-syringe coverage were very high—with 95 percent of clients accessing a sterile
 injecting equipment in a 12-month period and 189 needles-syringes per client per year).96 Data from
 2011 also show a nearly five-fold increase in the number of clients receiving OST in Vietnam,97 reflecting
 rapid expansion of this program.98 At the end of 2013, more than 15,000 people were receiving
 methadone maintenance therapy at 80 clinics and about 26.7 million needles and syringes were
 distributed to PWID that year.99 Vietnam’s efforts in scaling up harm reduction have also been
 acknowledged as a model of good practice by WHO.100


PSI has implemented health programs targeting PWID since 1996 and covered 11
countries with such projects in 2013. However, since then, PSI’s operations targeting
PWID have been scaled back significantly, particularly in Asia where harm reduction
services implemented by PSI have been suspended in China, the Philippines, and
Thailand. Despite a wealth of experience with such projects in very challenging
environments,101 PSI in the Philippines was unable to deliver on many of the project
objectives. Key stakeholder interviews revealed time and again that significant issues
compromised PSI’s capacity to deliver on project expectations: start -up delays and
political opposition, internal personality conflicts, internal miscommunications,
conceptual misunderstandings in the implementation team and among key stakeholders
in the Philippines, and limited technical expertise within the team on the ground in Cebu,
as well as very limited internal and external oversight.

Finally, the evaluation has identified that project governance structures were largely
ineffective. Roles of governance body members were not defined by reference; meetings
were rarely held; some people did not even know they were members of the Technical

their limited communications with the BCP team. The DDB, the DOH, and PSI should have
mobilized the support of members of the Technical Working Group to support both
regular advocacy as well as stave off the challenges levied against the project in Cebu.
Strong governance mechanisms could have been useful to weather some of the political
and media challenges levied against the services offered at the KC3.

                                    CONCLUSION
The ADB and the Bank made significant investments in Cebu to support the development
and the strengthening of effective service delivery models targeting PWID, with the
ultimate goal of reducing HIV transmission over a 24-month period. A DIC was opened at
the Kamagayan Barangay Hall that offers comprehensive drugs and HIV prevention,
treatment, care, and support services. Over 1,000 clients accessed a range of services over
a 15-month period, with significant coverage achieved. The BCP delivered on the
objectives to deliver a comprehensive package of HIV-related services to PWID and its
high coverage results demonstrate that rapid and effective scale-up is possible. Indeed,
coverage among project clients is impressively high for the short implementation period
and the multiple challenges encountered.

The KC3 clients reported being very satisfied with the comprehensive package of health
services offered at the KC3 and feel welcome and accepted. Community members in
Kamagayan, including family members of the KC3 clients, also praised the service as an
excellent intervention. Virtually all key stakeholders interviewed noted that the KC3 team
had performed especially well in building trust between clients and their health service
providers, families, and community. The KC3 clients, family members, and community
representatives also appreciated efforts from the KC3 team to promote demand
reduction, through counseling, NA sessions, and privileged access to the Argao TRC.

While the BCP objectives have been largely achieved, the specific objectives under the OR
arm were not. The OR component was meant to yield reliable local evidence about the
health impact of needle and syringe distribution, but insufficient baseline data, the
suspension of needle and syringe distribution (which eliminated the possibility of
collecting end line data), and the dramatically shortened implementation period
compromised this valuable opportunity, often due to external factors beyond
implementing agencies’ capacity to redress. Politicians have already mobilized the media
and polarized the discussion; local evidence would have been invaluable in addressing
many of the concerns that have been raised to date.

Implementation of project activities has also shown that there is great demand among
PWID—for needles, syringes, and comprehensive sterile injecting equipment sets; for
health and HIV related services; for drug dependence treatment and rehabilitation; and
for employment, especially as peer educators.

As of January 1, 2016, Global Fund resources will be channeled through Save the Children
to Cebu Plus to take over operations at the KC3 and ensure continuity of services to PWID.
Such a handover is especially timely and the Cebu Plus team is enthusiastic and
strategically positioned to maintain the KC3 services and potentially expand on the
strengths, lessons learned, and good practices identified in this report. To facilitate such
a handover, this report includes a set of recommendations specifically related to
continuation of health and social care services for PWID.




                                            41
                              RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations have been formulated for consideration by local,
national, and international agencies working on HIV, drugs, and harm reduction in the
Philippines. The recommendations have been formulated against best practice models
from across Asia and beyond, to support the strengthening of the national response to
HIV among PWID in the Philippines. The recommendations below have been grouped and
prioritized to avoid start-up delays, ensure smooth implementation and scale-up of
services, and long-term sustainability of the harm reduction response.

       1. Mobilize leadership of the DDB and the DOH: Efforts should be urgently
          made to facilitate open and ongoing dialogue between public health officials
          and public security agencies in the Philippines. A national multisectoral task
          force could be mandated with overall coordination between various sectors
          to ensure that national objectives are achieved by all sectors. The DOH should
          be invited to play a leading role in responding to drug-related issues through
          effective, evidence-based interventions that are supported and aligned with
          public security objectives. Similarly, the DDB should be invited to play a lead
          role in reviewing and amending laws and policies that prevent the
          government from achieving national goals.

       2. Review and reform drug laws and policies: Urgently conduct a thorough
          assessment of the legal and policy barriers generated by drug control
          mechanisms that hamper implementation of comprehensive HIV prevention
          services among PWID, including distribution of needles and syringes, and
          reform those policies to maximize both public health as well as public security
          outcomes. For example, Section 12 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs
          Act of 2002 should be reviewed in the context of the original intention of drug
          control, as enshrined in the international conventions, and facilitate access to
          essential health services instead of prohibiting effective interventions. In
          addition, external technical support should be mobilized to strengthen
          national-level efforts and obtain expert guidance on effective legal and policy
          measures in the context of effective public health responses to drugs and HIV.
          The International Drugs Policy Consortium offers such support and advice
          that can be mobilized through existing technical support mechanisms.

       3. Complete the operations research: Significant positive quantitative and
          qualitative results indicate that the PWID component of the BCP in Cebu
          generated positive results. In this context, it will be critical to complete the OR
          as soon as possible to generate local evidence that supports the effectiveness
          of needle and syringe distribution on HIV transmission. It will be imperative
          to pursue integration of such efforts within other HIV activity frameworks in
          the Philippines.

       4. Make evidence-based decisions: The current report is a comprehensive
          summary of the evidence related to HIV prevention among PWID in the
          Philippines. The content of this report should be used as an additional tool to
          inform decisions related to drugs and HIV and support action that aligns with
          international evidence about effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of
          public health interventions. This recommendation should be operationalized
          up front as soon as a consensus is reached regarding the continuation of the
          OR and/or harm reduction service delivery.



                                            42
         5. Ensure good governance: Develop clear terms of reference for members of
            governing bodies; organize and facilitate regular meetings to troubleshoot
            and mobilize additional support; ensure wide distribution of project reports
            to ensure transparency and build trust; conduct regular financial,
            programmatic, and data audits and address major and minor findings in a
            timely manner; and consider setting up a community advisory board in
            hotspots. The DOH, the DDB, and other national agencies should consider
            increasing their oversight mandate to address obstacles, facilitate integration
            at national level, and avoid duplication, especially in the context of a
            challenging legal and policy environment. Similarly, donor agencies as well as
            other development partners should be ready to provide technical support and
            assistance to reinforce technical capacity at the national level both for
            programmatic issues as well as management, including oversight. This
            recommendation should be operationalized up front as soon as a consensus is
            reached regarding the continuation of the OR and/or harm reduction service
            delivery.

         6. Strengthen capacity of all project workers: All the KC3 workers have
            performed to the best of their abilities, and, where possible, the handover to
            Cebu Plus should aim to retain as many of the current KC3 workforce.
            However, there is ample need and interest for additional skills building and
            training, covering staff, outreach workers, and peer educators. Training and
            skills building should focus on drugs and drug dependence, HIV and common
            infections, technical service delivery, and administrative functions like data
            collection and analysis for M&E. It is therefore recommended that a training
            needs assessment be performed with the retained KC3 workers and
            appropriate training sessions organized to ensure adequate capacity within
            the workforce. This recommendation should be operationalized up front as
            soon as a consensus is reached regarding the continuation of the OR and/or
            harm reduction service delivery.

         7. Improve monitoring and evaluation: The challenges encountered in data
            collection and analysis have compromised many of the project objectives. In
            this context, it is strongly recommended that a comprehensive M&E
            framework be developed to capture the appropriate data for project
            performance analysis and production of local, reliable evidence. A
            comprehensive M&E framework should clearly spell out linkages between
            project objectives, service delivery, and performance indicators at outcome,
            output, and impact levels. Performance frameworks for interventions to
            address HIV among PWID should be based on the most recent WHO
            guidelines: the Consolidated Guidelines on HIV Prevention, Diagnosis,
            Treatment, and Care for Key Populations102 and the Technical Guide for
            Countries to Set Targets for Universal Access to HIV Prevention, Treatment,
            and Care for Injecting Drug Users.103 This recommendation should be
            operationalized up front as soon as a consensus is reached regarding the
            continuation of the OR and/or harm reduction service delivery.

         8. Deploy Syrex as a national data management system: Syrex is a data
            management system designed and developed by Alliance Ukraine, a key

102 WHO (World Health Organization). 2014. Consolidated Guidelines on HIV Prevention, Diagnosis,
Treatment, and Care for Key Populations.
103 UNAIDS (Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and

WHO (World Health Organization). 2012. Technical Guide for Countries to Set Targets for Universal Access to
HIV Prevention, Treatment, and Care for Injecting Drug Users – 2012 Revision.

                                                    43
    partner of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance and currently deployed in 18
    countries worldwide. Syrex offers easy-to-use apps on smartphones, linked to
    a computerized database to track client profiles, service uptake, and a range
    of other options. Syrex can generate reliable reports adapted and customized
    to each local harm reduction project that reduces the need for paper-based
    management. It is strongly recommended that Syrex be integrated as the
    management information system related to harm reduction service delivery
    in the Philippines. This recommendation should be operationalized up front
    as soon as a consensus is reached regarding the continuation of the OR and/or
    harm reduction service delivery.

9. Meaningfully involve PWID: PWID are essential participants in the
   development, implementation, and M&E of any and all interventions that
   affect their lives. Enshrined in the principles of meaningful involvement of the
   affected communities, PWID can provide invaluable information to tailor
   project as well as ongoing insights to ensure effective rollout of services, while
   enhancing project and programs outputs, outcomes, and impacts. This implies
   developing mechanisms to ensure meaningful participation and
   representation of people who use drugs in decisions that affect their lives. The
   Asian Network of People who Use Drugs can provide assistance to
   stakeholders in the Philippines with regard to project design, implementation,
   and evaluation as well as in policy advocacy by informing the decisions of
   authorities. This recommendation should be operationalized up front as soon
   as a consensus is reached regarding the continuation of the OR and/or harm
   reduction service delivery.

10. Develop risk management plans: Given the experience in implementing the
    BCP in Cebu, it is strongly recommended that future implementers of health
    services targeting PWID develop comprehensive risks prevention, mitigation,
    and recovery plans. These plans should include programmatic, financial, and
    political dimensions as well as other relevant issues that are likely to hamper
    implementation. This recommendation should be operationalized up front as
    soon as a consensus is reached regarding the continuation of the OR and/or
    harm reduction service delivery.

11. Develop advocacy and communications plans: In line with
    recommendation 3, it is strongly recommended that future implementers
    allocate resources for extensive advocacy and external communications
    activities, including the development of strategic advocacy and
    communications plans. Dedicated staff should be hired, trained, and
    empowered to manage these responsibilities. Targeted efforts should be
    made to reach out to vocal opponents of the BCP to better understand their
    position with regard to harm reduction and develop strategies to address
    those concerns with both evidence and multisectoral support. Additional
    advocacy efforts should continue to be deployed, targeting community
    members around the location of harm reduction service access points to
    prepare and sensitize the community and avoid backlash. Advocacy activities
    in a challenging legal environment need to be sustained across the entire
    implementation period to act as a shield against the kind of challenges that
    the BCP implementation team in Cebu faced. This recommendation should be
    operationalized up front as soon as a consensus is reached regarding the
    continuation of the OR and/or harm reduction service delivery.



                                     44
12. Coordinate regionally and mobilize technical support: Consider
    leveraging support from technical experts based in the region such as the
    International Drug Policy Consortium through technical support providers
    such as the French government’s 5 Percent Initiative and UNAIDS Technical
    Support Facility. Coordination of national efforts with partners across the
    region—through regional grants and other relevant platforms such as
    Association of Southeast Asian Nations—could significantly enhance and
    accelerate the national response by integrating approaches and initiatives
    from neighboring countries in national systems. Finally, mobilizing high-level
    political and public support for harm reduction from within the Philippines
    and beyond would require a coordinated strategy to strengthen capacity of
    the national media and mobilize their communication channels to normalize
    harm reduction services and reduce the risk of political opposition.

13. Expand distribution of sterile injecting equipment: It is strongly
    recommended that quantity limits per client be removed and project
    equipment be specifically labeled ‘FREE – not for sale’ to minimize resale and
    ultimately maximize coverage, making secondary distribution work positively
    for the project. It is also strongly recommended that the needles and syringes
    be nestled in a kit containing other commodities —like bleach, alcohol swabs,
    cotton filters, and tourniquets—both to improve client health and better meet
    their needs while shifting the discourse away from the distribution of needles
    and syringes to the distribution of sterile injecting equipment. The project
    should also consider the distribution of needles and syringes through a
    partnership with pharmacy outlets. All these recommendations and
    suggestions are contingent on obtaining the necessary approvals from
    government authorities.

14. Strengthen referral systems and strategies: It is strongly recommended to
    rapidly explore opportunities to strengthen referral systems between civil
    society agencies and government health service providers. Implementation of
    the BCP demonstrated that important windows of opportunities have been
    missed in providing targeted information and support to clients. For example,
    messaging in the context of HIV testing should have focused on those who
    tested negative to encourage regular retesting. In the same vein,
    documentation of referrals should be significantly strengthened to allow
    triangulation of results and confirm that the referral has been completed and
    that clients are indeed receiving services.

15. Improve support mechanisms for peer educators: It is strongly
    recommended that additional support be provided to peer workers. Access to
    relapse prevention and general counseling should be included and tools to
    improve professionalization of peer educators should be adapted from
    existing resources. In addition, peer worker stipends were insufficient and
    peer educators regularly used their meager earnings to support clients. Peer
    workers should be provided with vehicles—bicycles and/or motorbikes—to
    reach clients more efficiently.

16. Consider geographical expansion: Given the very high demand for services
    among PWID, it is reasonable to assume that the remaining PWID population
    also has high interest in comprehensive harm reduction and HIV-related
    services. In that respect, it is recommended that a geographical mapping be
    conducted to assess opportunities for geographical expansion, with the
    possibility of opening additional DICs in new locations to reach new clients.

                                   45
17. Develop and enforce a drug-free workplace policy: It is strongly
    recommended that implementers develop a comprehensive drug-free
    workplace policy to address significant concerns among government officials.
    Specifically, concerns were raised often about the presence of illicit drugs in
    the DIC, particularly given the KC3’s location at the Barangay Hall and the
    children’s day-care center operating on the second floor. A comprehensive
    drug-free workplace policy should focus on providing support rather than
    retire workers in breach. In addition, posters with clear rules about drugs and
    drug use in the DIC should be developed and posted to visibly reinforce the
    objective of a drug-free workplace. It is thus recommended that a set of small
    lockers be procured for the KC3 and other potential sites where clients can
    leave their personal belongings securely behind before entering the DIC.

18. Consider working in prisons: Key stakeholder interviews and focus group
    discussions revealed that a significant proportion of people who use and inject
    drugs are currently incarcerated, that injecting drug use frequently takes
    place in prisons, and that injecting equipment is often improvised and shared
    among many prisoners. In this context, there is urgent need to reach prisoners
    with drug and HIV education and counseling and, where possible, with
    commodities like condoms and sterile injecting equipment. It is therefore
    strongly recommended that linkages with prisons be established to access
    incarcerated clients and to conduct outreach in prison settings.

19. Consider piloting substitution pilot study: OST is one of the most effective,
    cost-effective, and safe interventions that can be implemented to reduce HIV
    transmission among PWID. Given that nalbuphine hydrochloride is an opioid
    and expert reports indicate that buprenorphine could be an effective
    substitute, it is recommended that partners be identified to conduct a clinical
    trial of buprenorphine substitution among people clinically dependent on
    nalbuphine hydrochloride.

20. Consider piloting HCV treatment: Given the very high rates of HCV among
    PWID in Cebu, it is strongly recommended that harm reduction implementing
    partners consider integrating HCV treatment in the package of services.
    Additional resource mobilization would be required to cover the high costs of
    medicines though strategic partnerships with academic and/or private sector
    agencies could contribute to piloting such services on a small scale. Additional
    investments should urgently be made in developing HCV prevention
    information, education, and communication materials as well as treatment
    literacy materials, including local language guides with key messages on
    managing the liver in the context of drugs and HIV.
