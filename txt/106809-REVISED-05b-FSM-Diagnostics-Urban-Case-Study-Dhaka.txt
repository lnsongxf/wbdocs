Executive summary

Introduction
This report summarises the main findings of a case study on faecal sludge management in Dhaka,
Bangladesh. It is part of the project entitled ‘Fecal Sludge Management: Diagnostics for Service
Delivery in Poor Urban Areas’, funded by the World Bank Water and Sanitation Programme (WSP).
There are five city case studies as part of this project (Balikpapan, Dhaka, Freetown, Lima and Santa
Cruz). The specific objectives of the Dhaka study were:

        To provide quantitative and qualitative data on the sanitation situation in Dhaka from a socio-
         economic perspective, specifically as it relates to FSM.

        To do the above in such a way that the data is representative of the city as a whole but also
         providing a separate picture of the situation in slums (especially the slum areas of Mirpur and
         Uttara where a World Bank-supported project is underway)

        To provide initial recommendations to guide discussions around future interventions in the
         sanitation sector in Dhaka, by contributing credible data and analysis.

        To inform the development of analytical tools and guidelines for using them, by “road-testing”
         draft tools using primary data collection.


Methodology
The study followed an overall research framework developed as part of the inception period, which
set out research questions and sub-questions. Data collection instruments were then developed so
as to answer these questions. Six data collection instruments were used in Dhaka, four quantitative
and two qualitative. The quantitative instruments were a household survey, transect walks,
observation of service provider practices, and tests of fecal sludge characteristics. The qualitative
instruments were key informant interviews and focus group discussions.

The OPM / WEDC team led on methodology design and data analysis, while data collection was
undertaken by separately-contracted consultants under the leadership of WSP. All data collection
was undertaken by Adhuna Ltd, with the exception of key informant interviews which were
undertaken by WSP short-term consultants.

The household survey primarily aimed to collect data from households using on-site sanitation
(particularly those living in slums) regarding their use of FSM services and preferences for future
FSM services. The sampling was carefully planned so as to allow conclusions to be drawn about the
city as a whole on a representative basis, and about slum areas in particular, on a purposive basis.
The transect walks aimed to enable participants to make a subjective and qualitative assessment of
physical and environmental conditions within a community. The observation protocol for service
providers involved making visual inspections about fecal sludge (FS) from pits or tanks to final
disposal, in particular watching service providers go about their business. The tests of FS
characteristics were carried out at three stages: (i) during removal, (ii) after removal, and (iii) after
treatment (which was not relevant for Dhaka). The key informant interviews aimed to address key
questions about how both the ‘enabling environment’ and the operating environment affects FSM
services (past, current and future). Finally, the focus group discussions with residents of informal
settlements aimed to gather qualitative data that would complement, validate, or challenge
conclusions drawn from the household survey data.

Sampling for most quantitative instruments was derived from the sampling for the household survey,
for which there were two sub-samples. For sub-sample A, the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were
mohallas, an administrative unit akin to “urban neighbourhoods”, which were selected so as to allow
estimates which were representative of Dhaka city as a whole. For sub-sample B, the PSUs were
slum neighbourhoods, purposively selected from larger slum areas which were defined
geographically using secondary data. The focus of the purposive sample was Mirpur and Uttara, two
large slum areas in the north-west of the city. There were 720 households overall, equally divided
between the two sub-samples, with sub-sample A giving city-wide data, and sub-sample B giving
slum-specific data.

Faecal Waste Flow Diagram for Dhaka – city-wide sample




The data in the table above paints a picture of almost all FS ending up in the drains or environment
one way or another. It is therefore not surprising that a functioning market for FSM services barely
exists.

Analysis of demand and supply for FSM services finds that demand is very low and supply is
weak. That is not surprising in the context of the SFD above, and particularly the household survey
finding that only 13% of households city-wide who had a toilet with a pit or septic tank had ever
experienced it filling up. The drains are effectively running as sewers. Various other facts affecting
demand for FSM services (type of building, accessibility of facility, fill rate and the extent of sharing)
are also considered. On the supply side, there are very few mechanical emptiers in operation. The
bulk of service provision, when demanded, is carried out by manual emptiers. Of those households
who had emptied a pit tank city-wide, 97% had used a manual emptier last time. This is also reflected
in reported intentions next time the pit or tank filled up.

Findings from the transect walks emphasise that all of Dhaka is affected by poor FSM – it is not
only a problem for slum-dwellers. Latrines empty into drains throughout the city, and drains run
through all areas – slums and non-slums. Having large amounts of FS in the drains and environment
is an externality which affects everyone in Dhaka. Therefore, poor FSM is not only a private
household matter – it is a public health and environmental hazard.

The Service Delivery Assessment shows that there is a severe shortage of public policy, capital
investment and operational oversight of FSM services throughout Dhaka. This allows the current
practice of latrines emptying into drains, in place of safe emptying practices, to continue. This in turn
removes many of the efforts and financial costs required to achieve effective construction,
management and maintenance of appropriate infrastructure. The result is significant challenges for
finding solutions, which will only come about when an FSM Framework translates into clearly
defined, capacitated and financed action. The overall aim of the Framework and actions must
therefore be to provide a fully-functioning service chain for all of Dhaka’s fecal waste flows. This

requires recognition of the scale of the problem, dialogue and engagement of public, private and civil
society bodies to ensure appropriate infrastructure and services can be systematically developed
and adapted to respond to the various contextual challenges of the city (space, tenancy, flooding,
poverty, etc.).

All of this suggests that bringing change to fecal sludge management practices in Dhaka will demand
significant reform of the regulatory systems that currently govern all stages of the service chain. In
the context of the general failure of existing regulatory systems, clearly segregating the roles for
regulation of failure by central government, from that of licensing of compliance by local
governments, from that of service management by providers, may improve the incentives for overall
compliance and investment.

Economic analysis of four hypothetical intervention options is undertaken, three of which are non-
conventional sewer models and one of which was full fecal sludge management. This aims to
illustrate the types of costs which might be incurred for different interventions. In each case, the
sanitation chain was modelled for the whole population of Uttara and Mirpur, where an intervention
financed by the World Bank is to take place. Since the analysis is hypothetical, its value is in drawing
together the costs data relevant to Dhaka in a comparable form using standardized units. There is a
risk that the comparison of costs using data from different sources is inaccurate at best, or invalid at
worst. Due to these limitations it is difficult to develop any implications for FSM in Dhaka; primary
data collection on costs is required before the technology costing can be taken to be reflective of the
costs of implementing different sanitation interventions.

A ‘Prognosis for Change’ assessment surmises that the externalities of poor FSM are both public
and dispersed, whereas addressing the lack of proper containment would involve private costs (from
households and property developers). A credible threat of enforcement, which would raise the cost
of inaction on the part of these stakeholders, is therefore critical. Proper containment will require the
enforcement of ensuring existing emptiable systems (pit/tank) are disconnected from drains, that
existing non-emptiable systems are upgraded, and that newly-constructed buildings have an
appropriate containment system. Change is achievable on this front, but interventions will not be
successful unless they address the incentives which deliver the current outcome, which is the drains
running as sewers.

Recommended intervention options from the study are identified, grouped according to the key
stages of the sanitation service chain. These relate to the following areas, and are discussed in detail
in section 10.

     Formalised and operational transport, treatment and end-use stages of the fecal sludge service
      chain need to be identified and put in place, enabling fecal sludge to be safely received, treated
      and managed as upstream arrangements are improved. Effective business and financial
      models will be needed for each stage.

     Systematic and progressive steps to improve existing containment infrastructure must include
      disconnecting latrine outlets from drains as alternative ‘outlets’ are introduced. Newly -
      constructed buildings should not be permitted to discharge fecal materials to drains. For on-site
      systems, the aim must be to introduce correctly built containment that enables systematic and
      safe emptying services to function.

     A range of affordable mechanical, or improved manual, emptying services are needed that can
      respond quickly to demand, especially for shared sanitation facilities and for the urban poor.
      Licencing, service agreements and contracts can help service providers to invest in improved
      business operations, as well as improve regulation to achieve service standards.

1         Introduction and Research Framework

1.1       About this report
This report summarises the main findings of a case study on faecal sludge management in
Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is part of the project entitled ‘Fecal Sludge Management: Diagnostics
for Service Delivery in Poor Urban Areas’, hereafter “the FSM research project”. This work i s
funded by the World Bank Water and Sanitation Programme (WSP). There are five city case
studies as part of this project (Balikpapan, Dhaka, Freetown, Lima and Santa Cruz).

This project is led by Oxford Policy Management (OPM) in partnership with the Water,
Engineering and Development Centre (WEDC) at Loughborough University. The overall
objective of this assignment is : “to work with the WSP urban sanitation team to develop the
methodology, design, develop survey instruments and undertake analysis of data collected
from five field case studies (linked to World Bank operations projects), refine the diagnostic
tools and develop decision-making tools and guidelines for the development of improved FSM
services.” Specific objectives of the Dhaka case study are listed in the next section. The scope
includes the need for city-wide septage services with a focus on poor urban communities.

This document is part of a project deliverable designed to be internal at this stage. Therefore,
it does not contain much background information and the assumed audience is the WSP
project team and others familiar with the Dhaka FSM context.

The report’s structure is detailed below. It begins with background to the research and the city,
moving into several sections analysing the urban sanitation context which are not specific to
FSM. Thereafter, the report’s focus is FSM services in particular.


1.2       Study rationale and objectives
It is very common for poor people living in urban areas of most low-income countries either
use on-site sanitation facilities, or defecate in the open. Even when improved on-site options
are used to contain feces, in many cities there exist few services for collection, transport and
disposal or treatment of the resulting fecal sludge. Few opportunities for resource recovery
through end-use of fecal sludge exist. The service delivery gaps within and between stages of
the sanitation service chain become more apparent as sanitation coverage increases in poor
urban areas. Failure to ensure strong links throughout the fecal sludge management (FSM)
service chain results in untreated fecal sludge (FS) contaminating the environment, with
serious implications for human health.

Despite this, there are few tools and guidelines to help city planners navigate complex FSM
situations, despite increasing demand for this. This study aims to build on existing frameworks
and tools, in particular the Service Delivery Assessment scorecard, Fecal Waste Flow
Diagram, and the Economics of Sanitation Initiative toolkit. The aim is to produce diagnostic
and decision-making tools that are based in tried-and-tested strategic planning approaches
and frameworks, with a focus on practicality. Critically, updates to the tools and guidelines
have been updated based on primary data collection in five cities. In most of the cities, this is
supported by interaction with city stakeholders involved in ongoing World Bank lending.
Acknowledging the difficulty of reforming FSM services in cities, political economy questions
around FSM are explicitly included as part of the overall analysis.



                                                                                               11
Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



In addition, the specific objectives of the study are:

        To provide quantitative and qualitative data on the sanitation situation in Dhaka from a
         socio-economic perspective, specifically as it relates to FSM.

        To do the above in such a way that the data is representative of the city as a whole but
         also providing a separate picture of the situation in slums (especially the slum areas of
         Mirpur and Uttara where a World Bank-supported project is underway)

        To provide initial recommendations to guide discussions around future interventions in
         the sanitation sector in Dhaka, by contributing credible data and analysis.

        To inform the development of analytical tools and guidelines, by “road -testing” draft
         tools using primary data collection.

The study was therefore primarily socio-economic rather than technical. It did not aim to carry
out technical inspections of infrastructure or produce detailed maps with neighbourhood-level
analysis and recommendations. For those who have worked on sanitation in Dhaka for some
time, there may be few surprises, but the report does offer representative data to back up what
has previously been reported in smaller or more general studies.


1.3       Research framework
During the inception stage, the OPM/WEDC team developed a Research Framework (RF),
based on the overarching research questions implicit in the TOR and draft research protocol.
From these questions a logical set of project components was developed. These became the
basis for the data collection instruments that would enable the data to be collected for the
indicators making up each component.

The approach is to place all components – as well as ensuing results – of the study within the
context of the FSM service chain, to optimise its relevance and effectiveness. This is clear
from the full version of the RF in the inception report, with all components and questions
arranged along the service chain. There is not space here to go through the research
questions. The research framework can be downloaded from a link available in Annex D

The structure of components from the inception report is reflected in Table 1 below, some of
which were adapted during the course of the study. The study methodology is then described
in the next section.

2                  Methodology

2.1                Overall design
A key component of this study was primary data collection, since it aimed to build on an earlier
12-city FSM study based only on secondary data collection (Peal et al. 2013). The study had
six different data collection instruments, four quantitative and two qualitative, each of which
contribute to various project components shown in Table 1 above. These instruments are
summarised in Table 2 below.

The overall design decided by WSP was that team OPM/WEDC should lead on methodology
and analysis, while actual data collection would be managed by two types of consultants
contracted separately. A local firm, Adhuna Ltd, was contracted by WSP to conduct primary
data collection under all of the above instruments, except for the Key Informant Interviews. In
addition, short-term consultants (Mark Ellery and Elisabeth Kvarnstrom) were contracted to
conduct the Key Informant Interviews and produce the draft SDA and PEA.

Detailed research protocols for the instruments in the table above are available in a separate
instruments report here. This section briefly summarises each instrument, and the ensuing
section describes the sampling approach.

Household survey

The household survey aimed to collect data from and about households using on-site
sanitation (particularly those living in slums, informal or low-income settlements) regarding
their use of FSM services and preferences for future FSM services. The household survey
informs multiple components of this research. The sampling was carefully planned so as to
allow conclusions to be drawn about the city as a whole on a representative basis, and about
slum areas in particular, on a purposive basis. Questionnaire sections included household
members and characteristics, use of water and sanitation infrastructure, usability and
observation of latrines, satisfaction and planning on sanitation, filling up and emptying, and
last time emptying.

Observation of service provider practices

The observation protocol involved making visual inspections about fecal sludge (FS) from pits
or tanks to final disposal, in particular watching service providers (SPs) go about their
business. It required the identification of hazards, hazardous events, and an assessment of
possible risks at each stage (containment, emptying, transport, treatment and end-use or
disposal) of the fecal sludge management chain.

Testing fecal sludge characteristics

The characteristics of faecal sludge will vary, depending on many factors including but not
limited to the length of time for which it has been stored, the season, and the storage conditions
(e.g. whether the sludge was in a lined or unlined pit). Assessment of the characteristics was
required at three stages: (i) during removal, as this will influence the removal methods that
could be used, (ii) after removal, as this will influence how the faecal sludge can be transported
and treated, and possible resource recovery options, and (iii) after treatment, as this will
determine the resource value of the end product derived from the faecal sludge.

Transect walk

The Transect Walk enabled participants to make a subjective and qualitative assessment of
physical and environmental conditions within a community. During the walk, participants make
systematic observations, discuss their observations and record their findings using a standard
reporting format. The information collected complements information collected from household
questionnaires, observations, and sample collection and analysis. For this study, a transect
walk provides information about the broad environmental risks to public health, in particular
with respect to the presence of fecal material and solid waste, and the likelihood that these
enter drainage channels and water sources. When all observations are complete, participants
ask community members a few short questions to gain information about typical behaviours in
the community that could be a source of risk (latrines discharging to drains, overflowing
latrines, illegal dumping of fecal sludge, etc.) and the frequency of those behaviours throughout
the year (daily, weekly, seasonal, etc.). These walks were designed to give an overall picture
of conditions in a neighbourhood, with the aim of this being built into a city-wide picture. They
did not aim to allow detailed maps to be drawn with FS flows to be physically tracked, nor did
they aim to make operational recommendations at the neighbourhood level. Further discussion
of this issue is in Section 5.

Testing water supply and drain water quality



                                                                                                16
Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



During transect walks, samples of drinking water supplies and water flowing in drains (drain
water) were taken from a selection of PSUs in the city and tested for levels of E. coli. The
results can help to identify the extent to which there is an association between poor FSM
services and resulting levels of fecal contamination in the local environment (i.e. in water
supplies and surface water drains). This information, together with results from transect walk
observations, reported behaviours and practices associated with sanitation in the community
and other data sources, helps build-up a picture of the public health risks associated with poor
FSM services, associated with contamination levels (hazard), exposure and vulnerability.


Key informant interviews

Key informant interviews (KIIs) are the way in which primary information was sought to address
key questions about how both the ‘enabling environment’ and the operating environment
affects FSM services (past, current and future). KIIs were held with stakeholders having
responsibility or interest in FSM services at city-level and beyond, allowing the enabling and
operating environments to be better understood in relation to their influence within the city.

Focus group discussions

The objective of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with residents of informal settlements was
to gather qualitative data that would complement, validate, or perhaps challenge responses
made during the household survey. Questions focused on obtaining information relating to
household sanitation and FSM practices (particularly identifying the practices of “others” as
individuals are reluctant to talk honestly about their own, or their family’s, practices), service
levels, past interventions, risks and other issues associated with FSM services that affect their
community.


2.2       Sampling

2.2.1     Sampling for the household survey

The key sampling method was for the household survey, with the sampling approaches used
for other instruments using the selected clusters as a basis for their own sampling. Therefore,
the household survey is discussed first, and the remaining instruments are covered afterwards.
Overall it is crucial to understand that in the sampling, two pictures were being sought: the first
to give a representative understanding of the city-wide situation, and the second to give a
specific understanding of the situation in slums on a purposive level.

The study population were people living in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Hence, the sampling frame for
the household survey contains all urban areas within the boundaries of the Dhaka City
Corporations (different definitions of Dhaka’s boundaries are discussed in section 3.1). Some
non-residential areas were excluded from the sampling frame, which is discussed below.

There were two sub-sample areas (denoted A and B). Sub-sample A was representative of
the city as a whole, while sub-sample B focused on poor urban areas (identified as ‘slums’ in
Dhaka) without any attempt to be statistically representative. The aim of sub-sample A was to
get city-representative estimates at minimum cost and minimum administrative burden.
Therefore, it has a relatively small sample size, for example compared to what would be




                                                                                                 17
Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



necessary for studies with different objectives (e.g. an evaluation aiming to attribute impact to
an intervention).

Sub-samples and sampling units

For sub-sample A, the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were mohallas, which are an
administrative unit akin to “urban neighbourhoods”. Mohallas are the lowest administrative unit
in formal city arrangement, and sit below the ward level.1 Lists of wards and mohallas were
collected from both Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation
(DSCC).

For sub-sample B, the PSUs were slum neighbourhoods, purposively selected from larger
slum areas which were defined geographically using secondary data. The focus of the
purposive sample was Mirpur and Uttara, two large slum areas in the north-west of the city
which each received one third of the sub-sample B PSUs. This is because a World Bank-
supported project is currently underway in those localities, as well as them being some of the
largest slum areas in Dhaka (see Figure 3 in section 3.2 below).

The Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs) were households, in both cases. A list of slums in
Mirpur was collected from the UPPR (Urban Partnerships for Poverty Reduction) project data
for 2014. A list of slums in Uttara was collected from the Centre for Urban Studies (2005) study
team, and was updated by Adhuna based on visits to these areas. Finally, a map of all Dhaka’s
slums, based on remote sensing of Google Earth images in 2014, was collected from the World
Bank. All three sources were used to build the list of potential sub-sample B PSUs to be
purposively selected.

A map showing the location of sampled PSUs within wards is shown in Annex A.

Sample sizes

To estimate the sample size for sub-sample A, the statistical software EpiInfo was used. The
sample size needed to generate city-representative estimates with a confidence level of 90%
was predicted to be 360 households, given other variables in the power calculation. 2 Surveys
placing a premium on representativeness would aim for 95% confidence, but it was decided
that 90% was enough to give us a good idea of FSM services used in the city. It was decided
to use the same sample size for sub-sample B, for ease of comparison and understanding.
The power calculation would be identical for sub-sample B, but since the sampling is purposive
rather than random, there is no specific level of confidence. The total number of households
surveyed across both sub-samples was therefore 720.


1 In a household survey, households are the sampling unit we are interested in, but it is difficult and expensive to
sample 1000 households from across a city completely randomly, as you would potentially have to go to 1000
different localities. Therefore, most surveys take an intermediary approach using clusters of households. This
approach has two sampling units. The community/neighbourhood is the primary sampling unit (PSU) and the
household is the secondary sampling unit (SSU). The reason we say PSU instead of community/neighbourhood
is the former can be clearly defined geographically, whereas the latter means different things to different people.
The size of a PSU will differ across cluster surveys. The gold standard is to use census enumeration areas
(usually between 200-400 households), but this is not always possible.
2 This is based on an expected frequency of 80%, a design effect of 2, a PSU/cluster size of 12, a total number of

30 PSUs, and a margin of error of 5%. For the city-wide sample, our indicator of interest is the proportion of
households using on-site sanitation (OSS), which for Dhaka was estimated to be around 80%.




                                                                                                                  18

Sampling methodology

Sub-sample A – city-wide

A cluster random sampling method was used to sample the mohallas/PSUs to be surveyed.
First, any mohallas which were outside the sampling frame were excluded, due to the study’s
focus on residential areas. These were any which were predominantly characterised by
university areas, business districts, government administrative areas, military cantonments
and diplomatic areas. The rationale for this was that, which the sanitation arrangements of
such institutions are an important part of the whole picture, a socio-economic household survey
can only interview residential households. Of the remaining mohallas, 15 mohallas from DNCC
and 15 from DSCC were randomly sampled using a programme in Stata (a statistical software
package), so as to account for the relative population size of wards and mohallas across the
two This gave 30 mohallas out of 690 in the list. This can legitimately be called a city-wide
sample of mohallas, with the caveats that non-residential areas are excluded and Dhaka is
defined as the city corporation jurisdiction.

Households (SSUs) were sampled using systematic random sampling. Adhuna produced
Google Earth images with the border of each sampled mohalla indicated. Next, they drew the
largest possible rectangle that fits within the border of the mohalla, and divided it into twelve
equally-sized blocks. Upon arrival in the block, the supervisor sent the enumerator to the centre
of each block, and took them to a randomly selected household closest to the centre of that
block, by spinning a pen and visiting the nearest household to which it was pointing, taking
care to not be influenced by households which were easier to access. Where the nearest
household was a building of more than one floor containing more than one household, a floor
of the building was randomly selected.

Sub-sample B – slums

A purposive sampling method was used. First, collected lists of slums in Mirpur, Uttara and
elsewhere from different sources (see above). Next, for Mirpur and Uttara, any slums were
excluded which contained fewer than 200 households from the slum lists, then randomly
sampled 10 slums from each of Uttara and Mirpur. For the rest of the city’s slums, 10 slums
were purposively sampled from other parts of the city, based on the World Bank map and
aiming to balance a variety of geographical areas with a variety of slum sizes. Adhuna visited
those 10 slums in advance to verify that they were slums as per the national definition.

For sampling households/SSUs, the same process was followed as in sub-sample A.

2.2.2     Sampling in the other instruments

Observation of service provider practices and testing FS characteristics

Fully recorded observations were made at 5 different locations, through all stages (where
possible) of the sanitation service chain. The chosen observations reflected existing fecal
sludge management practices as much as possible, considering both manual and mechanical,
formal and informal emptying methods. Arrangements for observation were driven by the
schedules of the service providers with whom Adhuna collaborated.




                                                                                               19
Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



Tests for FS characteristics were carried out on FS collected during the observations, so the
sampling method is identical.

Transect Walks

Transect walks were conducted in 40 PSUs in total: all 30 PSUs of sub-sample A and 10
randomly selected PSUs from the full list of sub-sample B PSUs. Annex D includes an
explanation of the format and scoring used during the Transect Walks.

Testing water supply and drain water quality

Samples of drinking water supplies and drain water (water freely flowing in drains) were taken
in 20 PSUs; 10 PSUs from sub-sample A and sub-sample B were randomly selected for
transect walks. Water samples were taken from the three most common drinking water
supplies identified in the PSU (through asking community members) namely piped water into
the community, from groundwater sources within the community, or from surface water
sources. Samples were taken at the source of the supply and tested for levels of E. coli, to
identify contamination in the supply itself and avoid measuring contamination resulting from
poor water storage or handling practices. Drain water samples were taken from locations to
represent the three most common types and characteristics of drains in the community
(identified during the transect walks) and also tested for levels of E. coli, to identify
contamination from poor sanitation and fecal sludge handling within the PSU. A standard
procedure for collecting samples was followed, with samples sent to registered laboratories for
testing.

Key informant interviews (KIIs)

The total number of interviews required, as well as the range and extent of questioning, was
influenced by the availability of current and reliable data from other sources, as well as
constraints on time and resources. Selection of interviewees was purposive, based on advice
received from stakeholders and existing knowledge of the World Bank consultant.

Focus group discussions (FGDs)

10 FGDs were held with households from 10 sub-sample B PSUs, which were randomly
selected from the total of 30 sub-sample B PSUs in slum areas.


2.3       Fieldwork implementation
Pretesting, training and piloting

Initial pre-testing was carried out by Adhuna to refine the instruments before a week of
enumerator training. During the training, all data collection instruments were piloted in urban
communities in both higher-income and lower-income areas, as part of field practice for the
enumerators. The team then joined a debriefing session before starting data collection.

Field team composition

For the quantitative survey, four field teams were deployed for data collection. Each team was
composed by one Supervisor and two Household Enumerators. In addition to that there was



                                                                                             20
Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



one qualitative team composed of one supervisor and two qualitative researchers. An
experienced Field Manager was responsible for ensuring overall management, field
implementation and quality assurance.

Data collection

The field teams collected the majority of the data from the 60 sampled PSUs in 4 weeks during
September-October 2014. On average, each team spent one day in a PSU. Each household
interviewer conducted the survey in 6 households per day, and thus each team with 2
interviewers completed 12 households in a cluster in one day. For the transect walks (TWs),
five teams of two participants conducted all 40 TWs over 7 days (5 consecutive days in late
September / early October for 37 TWs and a further 2 days in late October to complete the
remaining 3 TWs). Teams conducted between 2 and 10 TWs each. Observations of service
providers were conducted over a 1 week period in mid-November, with 2 observations carried
out on the first day and the remaining 3 on the subsequent days. The delay to data collection
was waiting for the pit emptiers that Adhuna was in contact with to be called to carry out
emptying services.

Data entry, cleaning and analysis

The quantitative survey data were entered into SPSS at Adhuna’s offices in Dhaka, using
various data quality checks, including range checks, skips and internal consistency checks.
After data cleaning checks, data were then transferred into the statistical software Stata. Data
were analysed using Stata in OPM’s offices in Oxford.


2.4       Limitations
This study has various limitations which are important to explain, so that readers understand
the strengths and weaknesses of the data and what conclusions can and cannot be drawn
from the analysis. These should be considered in the context of the objectives of the study
(see section 1.2 above). These are:

        Socio-economic survey – household surveys with enumerators skilled in social
         research can only really ask question of householders. Such individuals cannot make
         technical inspections of infrastructure which would require a different skillset.
         Therefore, it is necessary to take the household’s responses at face value (e.g. about
         the destination of their blackwater). Furthermore, it was not possible to physically
         establish the pathways of FS once it has left then household (e.g. which kind of drain,
         or its ultimate destination).

        Sampling method – sample surveys are designed to estimate indicators for a broader
         population. Therefore, they cannot produce detailed data for specific neighbourhoods
         without dramatically increasing the sample size and appropriate stratification. The
         sample size is relatively small, compared to what would be necessary for an impact
         evaluation, for example. In a similar vein, transect walks aimed to build up a broad
         picture rather than specific maps or explanations for individual neighbourhoods. In
         addition, the study only focuses on residential areas and households, not institutions.

Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



        Definition of Dhaka – as explained in section 3.1, the definition of Dhaka used is the
         area under the jurisdiction of the two Dhaka City Corporations (covering about 7
         million people), rather than any other definition in use.

        Seasonality – The data collection took place at the end of, or just after, the monsoon
         season in Bangladesh, which runs from May to September. The timing of a survey
         will always influence its results, which is true for several of the instruments used in
         this study. In this case the most likely influence is that drains were running fuller than
         normal, which could have diluted the fecal load and made the E. coli counts lower
         than would be expected, particularly at the height of the dry season. Other influences
         may also have been taking place, such as changes in water usage patterns and
         latrine emptying rates.

3         Background to Dhaka city

3.1       Dhaka overview
Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with approximately
160 million people living in a land area of around 150,000 km 2. The country is moving
convincingly towards achieving most of the Millennium Development Goal targets and in
particular has made remarkable progress in the reduction of open defecation to just 3%
nationwide (WHO/UNICEF, 2014). While the majority of the population still lives in rural areas,
the urban population has been growing rapidly from just 5% of the total population in 1971 to
27% in 2008.

Dhaka is reportedly the fastest growing city in the world, with a growth rate of around 3% per
annum. This adds an estimated half a million people per year to the 14 million people already
residing in Dhaka mega-city. An associated trend is the vertical expansion of the city, which
has seen houses making way for multi-storey apartment blocks, which then in turn have made
way for high-rise buildings. Expansion of the sewerage network has not kept up with population
growth.3 . Anecdotally, from key informant interviews with sweepers, there has also been a
decrease in demand for the emptying of septic tanks. Given the near absence of a mechanical
emptying market in Dhaka, this suggests an overall increase (both in relative and absolute
terms) in households connecting pits and septic tanks to drains of various kinds. Regardless
of the trend in recent years, it is clear that a large fecal load is ending up in the storm water
drainage system. Further details are provided in section 6.

Defining the boundaries of Dhaka is not straightforward – different definitions and jurisdictions
are shown in Table 3. For this study, “Dhaka” was defined as being the areas under the
jurisdiction of the Dhaka City Corporations, commonly referred to as “Dhaka City”. This is due
to this being the most commonly-understood term and it being administrated by a clear
authority. Ultimately, one definition had to be selected and the one most appropriate for both
city planning was selected, so it is justified to call this a city-wide sample. It should also be
noted that the boundaries of Dhaka City do not fully align with DWASA’s service area.

While average incomes in Dhaka are relatively high as compared to the rest of Bangladesh,
the absolute number of poor people in Dhaka is also very high. Over one-third of all Dhaka
residents live in slum areas with densities 7-8 times greater than the city average.

The topography is extremely flat and close to sea level. Much of the city sits on a layer of
Madhupur clay that extends to a depth of about 10m. Other areas sit on a variety of soil types,
including loose and soft silty clay, clayey silt or organic clay. It is widely recognised that, as
these soil types have low infiltration capacity they are not suited to the infiltration requirements
of on-site sanitation systems needing to ‘drain away’ effluent, such as correctly installed septic
tanks.. Dhaka experiences a hot, wet and humid tropical climate. The monsoon between the
months of May and October is responsible for over 85% of the annual average rainfall of over
2,000mm. This combined with the urban density and destruction of water bodies leaves Dhaka
highly susceptible to seasonal flooding.

Until November 2011, the task of running the affairs of the city of Dhaka was undertaken by
the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC), comprising 92 wards. At that time, it was split into two parts
– Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) with 36 wards, and Dhaka South City Corporation
(DSCC), with 56 wards. Each is headed by a government-appointed administrator. The DCCs
are designated as autonomous bodies responsible for municipal services (i.e. public health,
water supply and drainage, roads, etc.) and given fund-raising power including levying of rates,
fees and rents. However, the Government reserves the right to intervene in their affairs, e.g.
by appointing the Chief Executive Officer, or transferring functions.

According to the population census 2011, 78% of the population of Dhaka city live in rented
housing. In 2005 it was estimated that there were over 3 million slum dwellers residing in 5,000
slums, comprising 35% of the population of Dhaka city at that time (Centre for Urban Studies,
2005).4 Slums and squatter settlements are increasingly concentrated on the fringes of the
city, due to an acute demand for land and high land prices, especially in the central zones and
upper class residential areas.


3.2         Dhaka’s sanitation context
According to the 2011 census, access to “sanitary” latrines within the Dhaka City Corporation
area is 94%. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) definition of a sanitary latrine
comprises of two arrangements: either a sanitary latrine with a water seal, where feces are
covered by the water that remains in the water seal (or pan) after use; or a sanitary latrine
without water seal, or where the water seal is broken, such that water does not remain in the
pan after use. Data are shown in Figure 1 below. The census identified extremely low rates of
open defecation within the city (0.3%, not shown in the chart), and relatively low use of non-
sanitary latrines (5%).5




4 Updated  data from a slum census conducted by BBS in 2014 should be available by mid-2015.
5 Ideally
        we would also show the census data re-categorised by JMP definitions, but this is not possible without
access to the raw census data. Shared sanitation is particularly important in Dhaka, as is shown in our data in
section 4 below. The definitions of sanitary and non-sanitary latrines are from the National Sanitation Strategy
2005, with the key difference being whether the passage between then squat hole and pit is sealed (either by a lid
or a water seal).



                                                                                                                24

Definitions used by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (as well as the Millennium
Development Goal for sanitation) relate to the type of user-interface (i.e. the latrine itself),
without reference to how or where the latrine discharges fecal waste beyond this containment
stage, through to further stages of the sanitation service chain. However, for the purposes of
this study, the focus is primarily the management of fecal sludge from latrines (i.e. the
containment stage) and to an extent all forms of fecal waste flows, including sewerage, through
to end-use/disposal (see Figure 2 below).

                                                                                                        End-use/

The study is not focusing on the structural conditions or the latrine itself, so much as the extent
to which it contains / does not contain fecal sludge and what happens to the fecal sludge from
this stage onwards. For this reason, the household survey and later sections of this report refer
to different categories for household sanitation facilities and assesses fecal sludge
management in relation to the service chain above.

In addition, the spatial dimension of access to sanitary latrines and sewerage networks is also
important. This is shown in Figure 3 below, which overlays spatial data on use of sanitary
latrines (red/pink shading) with sewer network (blue lines) and slums (yellow shaded). As can
be seen, the sewerage network only covers a small proportion of Dhaka geographically, and
is by no means used by all residents in the areas nominally “covered”. Slums are dotted around
the city, but there is a significant concentration in Uttara and Mirpur in the north-west of Dhaka.

It is beyond the scope of this report to undertake a detailed literature review of the sanitation
context in Dhaka or summarise the history of urban sanitation sector development. It is
however necessary to highlight a few key documents and studies which are directly relevant
to the objectives of this study. In terms of sector context, two key documents should be
mentioned, which are DWASA’s 2013 Sewerage Master Plan for Dhaka City (prepared by
Grontmij), and the 2014 Draft Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Fecal Sludge
Management in Dhaka City (prepared by ITN-BUET). The former sets out DWASA’s stall in
terms of planning for the wastewater management and sanitation systems in Dhaka city with
a planning horizon of 2035. The latter has sets out a proposed framework for FSM which
was welcomed by DWASA.

In terms of studies, the key reference is the 2011 study of FSM in three cities of Bangladesh,
including Dhaka, by WaterAid Bangladesh (funded by BMGF). It provides some of the only
detailed household survey data on pit/tank emptying available prior to the present study. In
terms of sampling, it is not representative of the city, since households were drawn from
pockets in the fringe of the city which require emptying. It is therefore most comparable to
sub-sample B in the present study.

4            Fecal Waste Flow Diagrams

4.1          Introduction
Fecal Waste Flow Diagrams (also known as ‘shit flow’ diagrams, or SFDs) are an innovation
arising from WSP’s 12-city study of FSM (Peal et al., 2013). In short, an SFD is a visualisation
of how fecal waste (fecal sludge or wastewater) flows along the sanitation service chain. At
each stage of the chain, the proportion of fecal waste that is or is not effectively managed to
the next stage of the chain is indicated.6

This means that:

    -    where fecal waste is deemed to be effectively managed from one stage of the chain to
         the next (for example where wastewater from cistern flush toilets is effectively
         transported through sewers to a designated treatment site, or fecal sludge is
         transported by tanker to a designated disposal site), the SFD shows the flow of fecal
         waste continuing along the chain – and the arrow representing that flow of fecal waste
         to the next stage remains green;

    -    where fecal waste is deemed to be not effectively managed from one stage of the chain
         to the next (for example where wastewater leaks from sewers before reaching a
         designated treatment site, or fecal sludge is dumped into the environment or drainage
         channels), then the SFD shows the fecal waste “dropping out” of the service cha in –
         and the arrow representing that flow of fecal waste turns brown.

The proportion of fecal waste that is effectively managed all the way to the end of the service
chain is indicated as “safe”, with the remaining proportion that has dropped -out of the chain
deemed “unsafe”. The primary destination of that “unsafe” fecal waste is indicated e.g.
receiving waters, general environment, drains etc.7 Thus far, SFDs in different cities have been
undertaken using different methodologies, as is often necessary in the context of poor data
availability. Furthermore, most SFDs so far (including those in the 12-city study) were
undertaken using secondary data and expert estimates. This study is amongst the first to use
primary household survey data and field-based observations to construct SFDs. A group of
urban sanitation experts is currently discussing the ‘roll-out’ of the use of SFDs, for which other
methodologies will be developed.8

One of the benefits of the sampling approach for this study is that it is possible to develop
separate SFDs which are (i) representative of the city-wide situation, and (ii) indicative of the
situation in low-income settlements (see section 2.2 above)




6 Previous  iterations of SFDs distinguished between safe and unsafe practices, but here we refer to
effective/ineffective management. This progression has been made because it is difficult be sure of the safety of
the process, but if the fecal waste is managed to the next stage of the sanitation service chain we can say it is
considered as an effective process.
7 It is acknowledged that FS may pass from drains into other water bodies, e.g. rivers, but the diagram focuses on

the primary destination. It was beyond the scope of this study to be able to track the pathways of sludge beyond
the household, e.g. which types of drains did it pass through and where was its eventual destination.

4.2          Methodology
For this analysis, several key indicators from the household survey were used. In particular,
data from the following household survey questions was used:9

     A. “What kind of toilet facility do members of your household usually use?”

     B. “Where do the contents of this toilet empty to?”

     C. “What did you do when the pit or septic tank filled-up last time?”

     D. “What was [the faecal sludge] emptied into?”

Of these, question ‘B’ is one of the most crucial for the construction of the SFD. It should be
noted that the household’s response is taken as given. It was not possible to confirm responses
by observation since enumerators were selected for a background in social research and not
sanitation. It was however felt that they could be trained to observe ‘above-ground’
components, so observation of slab, water seal, superstructure, etc. was carried out in all
households where permission was given.

Given that ‘B’ is based on household response, possible sources of bias include the household
not knowing the true answer, or knowing it but answering differently for fear of being identified
as practicing illegal behaviour (e.g. pits/tanks connected to drains). The former is certainly
likely, the latter does not seem to be an issue given the vast majority of households who
willingly disclosed illegal behaviour.

To analyse this data, an SFD matrix is created, as shown in Figure 4 below. It shows which
data sources are used and how they are analysed into levels of effective / ineffective
management of fecal waste through the stages of the service chain – with results in the next
section.

First, the household survey data on use of infrastructure (questions (A) and (B) above) is used
to allocate households to five categories shown in the column marked (1) in the figure below:

     (i)      “Sewered (off site centralised or decentralised)” – toilets connected to sewers
              (not OSS)
     (ii)     “On-site storage – emptiable” – OSS toilets (involving pits or tanks) which can
              be emptied. However, they can also be connected to drains through an overflow,
              to avoid the need for emptying. These toilets are emptiable but may or may not be
              emptied.
     (iii)    “On-site storage - single-use / pit sealed” – OSS toilets where pits or tanks are
              sealed and/or abandoned once full. These toilets are emptiable but never emptied.
     (iv)     “On-site non-storage - straight to drain/similar” – OSS toilets which connect to
              drains or open water bodies (e.g. hanging latrine, or latrine with a pipe connecting
              the pan directly into a drain). These toilets are therefore non-emptiable.


9 Full  response categories for these questions are included in the survey questionnaire, to which there is a web
link in Annex D. In particular, it should be noted that the response categories to question B above were: (i)
Directly to piped sewer system, (ii) Septic tank connected to "piped sewer system", (iii) Septic tank with no outlet,
(iv) lined pit with no outlet, (v) septic tank connected to drain, (vi) lined pit with overflow to drain/elsewhere, (vii)
unlined pit, (viii) directly to sea, lake or river, (ix) directly to drain/ditch



                                                                                                                        29

    (v)      “Open defecation” – self-explanatory

The question of emptiability is key. Category (ii) above is denoted as emptiable, meaning that
this containment option involves a pit or tank which fills with FS. In Dhaka, many such
pits/tanks are also connected to drains through a variety of means (e.g. overflow pipe). This
means that while they are emptiable they are not in fact emptied as often as would be
expected, or even at all. Between the two extremes of a closed system and a system which
never fills up, there is a spectrum of scenarios. For example, some pits/tanks may have an
overflow to the drain but may still require emptying if they become blocked. This is partly
reflected in the data below.10

The data from questions (A) and (B) at the beginning of this section are allocated in column
(2) below (a key shows the meaning of the colour-coding of cells by data source). Next, the
proportions for each of the stages of the chain are allocated. As can be seen from the emptying
column, marked (3), a certain proportion of the population’s FS which makes it to that stage is
emptied by a service provider, and the rest is not emptied (e.g. overflows to drains). This is
estimated by dividing the number of households which reported emptying their pit (question
(C) above), by the number of households using emptiable technologies (questions (B) above).

The rest of the matrix follows similar logic. Full SFD matrices for the two sub-samples in Dhaka
are provided in Annex A, along with further methodological notes. This section has given a
brief overview of where the data underlying the SFDs comes from. The SFDs themselves are
more intuitively appealing and are presented in the next section.

It should be noted that since the data comes from a household survey, the proportions in the
matrix are proportions of households, not proportions of people or of FS volumes. In Dhaka,
the mean household size for sub-samples A and B was 4.8 in both cases.11




10 Aswill be seen, only 2% of households city-wide reported using a sanitation facility with no outlet, whereas
13% of households city-wide reported experiencing a pit or tank filling up. This suggests that some of those with
who cross-connected to the drains did in fact have to empty their pit at some point.
11 The impression given by the SFD therefore involves assumptions that (i) each person produces the same

amount of FS, and (ii) pit accumulation rates are constant across the city. This is an approximation but the most
pragmatic approach in the context of uncertainty around FS volumes. FS volume only really becomes an issue
when considering the extent of change in service levels needed to deal with the amounts. This study is primarily
about identifying the broader picture of where the management of FS is or isn’t effective, not what volumes are
being managed or mismanaged.

Firstly, the key household survey results which are inputs to the SFD are shown in the tables
below. They are reported separately for the city-wide representative sample (sub-sample A)
and the slum/poor areas sample (sub-sample B). After that, a separate SFD matrix and
diagram for each sub-sample are presented.

4.3.1          Household survey results as an input to SFD

As can be seen from Table 4 below, the vast majority of households in the city-wide sample
used a pour-flush latrine (82%). The same category was also the most common in the slum
sample, albeit lower (46%). Unimproved latrine technologies (e.g. pit latrine without slab,
hanging toilet) were found in the slum sample but not the city-wide sample. No households
reported practising open defecation.12

12 The city-wide sample is designed to be representative of the whole city, so should include some slum areas.
Given the sampling approach, it is impossible to know which of the city-wide PSUs are actually in slums. The data
above suggests that not very many were, given the low prevalence of latrine types typical of slum areas in the
city-wide sample. We can further pursue this question using the housing characteristics data.

The table above shows the basic categories, but it is also important to consider the proportion
of these which are shared. This is relevant, not just in terms of developing the standardised
indicators of the WHO/UNICEF JMP, but also because the FSM arrangements for shared
latrines are likely to be different from those of ‘private’ latrines from a management perspective.
This is because accountability for dealing with full or blocked pits, as well as payment for FSM
services, may be less clear-cut in a ‘shared’ situation, recognising that this label could refer to
a large number of scenarios. The technology and service used would be as for private facilities,
while noting that shared pits/tanks would be likely to fill more quickly, depending on the number
of users.

As can be seen from Table 5 below, 78% of households city-wide used a facility considered
improved under JMP definitions, whereas this was only 17% for the slum sample. It should be
emphasised, however, that 65% of the slum sample used a latrine which was an improved
technology but shared with other households or a public facility. Overall, 78% of slum
households used a latrine (improved or unimproved) which was shared between 2 or more
households. Further sections below go into this in more detail.

As noted above, the most important question in the survey is where the contents of toilets go
after flushing or similar. The standard question in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
incorporate this into the overall sanitation question (see WHO/UNICEF core questions), it was
necessary to ask it separately in order to get better quality data. 15 Household-reported data is
relied upon for this indicator, while noting that households may not always know the full detail,
especially if they are renting, or may answer untruthfully16. Furthermore, with a socio-economic
survey rather than a technical survey, it was not possible to physically verify household’s
answers to this question, which would have required a different kind of expertise amongst
enumerators. Nonetheless, a large proportion of the enumerator training was spent ensuring
that the enumerators fully understood distinctions between the response categories.17




13 The JMP definition of a shared facility is one which is used by 2 or more households (including a public facility).
14 “Unimproved   shared” is not a category usually reported by the JMP, but it is useful to report for our purposes,
so we can see the full proportion of households sharing latrines.
15 As stated above, the question asked was “Where do the contents of this toilet empty to?”. The question is

answered by all households, regardless of whether they owned a private toilet, managed a shared toilet or used a
shared toilet.
16 We are relatively confident in this data because the figure for sewerage is around 25%, which is more or less

what was expected. Of course this does not mean that the waste going into the sewer makes it through the
system or is treated.
17 In Table 6, the data are reported as per the response categories used in the questionnaire, with footnotes in the

table below qualifying aspects of the data. The response categories used were developed on the basis of
discussion with experts on sanitation in Dhaka regarding prevalent containment options.



                                                                                                                    32

The results were grouped into risk categories based on the relative risk to public health from a
combination of the type of containment arrangement and where the FS and effluent empty to:

          Low-risk categories are those where the FS can be considered to be contained (in
           JMP terms), at least in relation to the first stage of the service chain.

          High-risk categories are those where the FS goes directly into the environment and
           so potentially poses a risk of exposure to the public, whether via drainage systems or
           water bodies that people interact with (especially children).

          Medium-risk categories are those where there is at least some containment in a pit or
           septic tank, but those pits/tanks either: a) have outlets connected to drains which allow
           only partially digested effluent to flow through, or b) are unlined, allowing FS to leach
           into the surrounding soil and groundwater which may be used for domestic purposes
           (e.g. washing clothes). These scenarios still represent a risk, but it is somewhat lower
           than contact with fresh FS as in the high-risk category above

The results are shown in Table 6 below. Unsurprisingly, high-risk blackwater management
practices are more common in the slum sample (71%) than the city-wide sample (21%). It is
worth emphasising that toilets were connected to drains (either immediately or after
intermediate storage in a pit/tank) for 71% of households city-wide, and 87% of slum
households.

Cutting the data another way, it is important to note that 75% of households city-wide use what
is considered as an on-site sanitation system, whereas 100% of households in slum areas do
so. However, in practice the majority of these on-site systems connect into the drainage
network, either directly or via an on-plot pit/tank.

With so many pits and tanks connected to the drainage system, it is not hard to see why there
is such a limited market for FSM services, as outlined in section 3.2 above. In order to assess
the potential demand, households were asked whether their pit/tank had ever filled up (if they
had one). The results are shown in Table 7 below. As can be seen, in the city-wide sample,
only 13% of those answering the question (i.e. 10% of the 360 households overall) reported
having experiencing the pit or tank of their toilet filling up.19 These proportions are very similar
in the slum sample (13% of those responding, 10% of overall slum households).

Finally, it is worth considering reported household behaviour in the context of pits filling up.
This was assessed by asking about what action the household took last time this happened.
As can be seen across both sub-samples, almost all households emptied the pit/tank and then
reused it. The nature of the service they used, and associated data, is discussed in section 6
below. Combining these data, the conclusion is that 8% of households in Dhaka overall have
emptied a pit or tank, as compared to 10% in Dhaka’s slums.20

4.3.2     Presentation of SFDs

Using all these results, two sets of SFD matrices and diagrams were constructed: one for the
city-wide sample and one for the slum sample. These are presented as Figure 5 and Figure 6
below. SFDs work on the same principle as the matrix shown above. Household’s toilet
technology and associated containment method is shown on the left, with intermediate steps
and primary destination of the FS shown along the sanitation service chain. What is clear from
both SFDs is that the majority of FS in Dhaka is not effectively managed. Some 99-100%
eventually ends up in the city drains or receiving waters untreated, regardless of its route. It is



19 Households  were only supposed to answer the question if their latrine was connected to a pit or tank, with a
“not applicable” response category for others.
20 This comes from 30/360=8% and 37/360=10%




                                                                                                                   34
Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



notable that only about half of households in Dhaka overall use a toilet which is “emptiable”
(see definitions in section 4.2)

For clarity, it is worth briefly describing the city-wide results. Dhaka has a sewer network which
covers part of the city, with 25% of households in city-wide sample reporting being connected
to a sewer.21 However, as shown in Figure 5, only about 1.2% of households’ FS which enters
the sewer ends up being treated (this comprises the faecal waste of 0.3% of households
overall). This is due to leakages in the system and deficiencies at the treatment plant
(explained in discussion on treatment in section 7.2.1).

The other 75% of households reported using an improved latrine, though many are shared
(and noting the caveats above regarding slums in the city-wide sample).22 However, as shown
below, all of the FS from those toilets ends up in the environment or drains, by three different
routes. Some households have latrines with no storage component, i.e. the contents travel
straight to the drains. Overall, this is the case for 21% of households’ FS city-wide. If there is
containment of some kind (e.g. a pit or tank), for 46% of households’ FS overall, this goes
through to a drain via a connection from the pit or tank. In the small proportion of cases where
the containment chamber is emptied (8% of households overall), the methods used result in
the FS ending up in the drains (see section 5.2.3) Overall then, as shown in the SFD, only 1%
of households’ FS in Dhaka is effectively managed.

Considering next the SFD for the slum sample (Figure 6), the main differences are that some
people are using unimproved sanitation options (18% of households overall). In slums, only
29% of households use a facility which is emptiable (against 54% city-wide).23 However, it was
found that households in slums are more likely to have decided to empty a pit or tank (see
Table 8). This is most likely because in some densely-populated slum areas, drainage is less
formal and there may not be nearby drains to connect to.

Of those households with an emptiable pit or tank, about a third have actually emptied it, which
equates to 10% of slums households overall using an emptying service. Similar to the city-
wide sample, qualitative research in slum areas found that all of the FS that is emptied ends
up in the drains and eventually the wider environment. Overall then, 0% of households’ FS in
slums is effectively managed.




21 Households  were asked to show their DWASA sewerage bill if they responded with this option. 25% is slightly
higher than the general estimate of 20%, but is within the bounds of sampling error in a sample of only 360
households
22 Note that not all cistern flush toilets go into sewers, and not all pour-flush toilets go into pits/tanks. The small

black arrows in the diagram illustrate this. What matters is the blackwater management.
23 This data comes from Table 6, but is more clearly shown in the SFD tables in Annex B.

4.4       Implications of the SFDs for FSM in Dhaka
The city-wide SFD shows that almost all FS is ending up in the drains or environment one way
or another. It is therefore not surprising that a market for FSM services barely exists. Only 10%
of households city-wide have experiencing a pit filling up. It must be emphasised that having
large amounts of FS in the drains and environment is an externality which affects everyone in
Dhaka. Poor FSM is not only a private household matter – it is a public health and
environmental hazard. Most of the time, it mainly affects poor households whose children play
in and around the drains or contaminated ground. However, during heavy rains, when the
drains block up and the city floods, the problem affects everyone. The risk to public health is
discussed in section 5.3 below

Both SFDs above are necessarily vague about the destination of the untreated FS (i.e. “local
area and beyond, via drains). There are many different kinds of drains in Dhaka – for example,
the large storm drains (managed by DWASA), the small-bore local drains (managed by the
DCCs) and informal street side drains in lower-income areas (properly managed by nobody).
For some of these, FS entering them means contaminating the local environment. For others
(e.g. the large underground drains) it means contaminating the Buriganga river further
downstream.

There are various implications of the SFDs above for FSM in Dhaka. These are discussed in
full in section 10 of this report focusing on implementation options. In short, however, it is clear
that key challenges in Dhaka are: (i) preventing newly-constructed buildings from connecting
septic tanks and blackwater outlets to the drains, and (ii) progressively disconnecting existing
households’ systems from the drains and ensuring proper containment. This will not be an
easy process – analysis of the problem is discussed in section 9. Clearly sewerage should
play a role, but given that only 3% of sewage entering the system is currently treated, and only
20-25% of households have a sewer connection, its role will continue to be minor even in the
medium-to-long-term. Addressing Dhaka’s sanitation crisis by introducing proper containment
and systematically getting these facilities connected to the most appropriate technical option(s)
to provide a functioning sanitation service chain is clearly a priority.

In terms of FSM services, the SFDs show that at the moment, when households experience a
pit or tank filling up, they do use an emptying service rather than abandoning that pit or tank.
Some service providers exist (as discussed in section 6.4 below), but markets are thin. As
proper containment is introduced, one would expect broadening and deepening of those
markets.

5             Public Health Risk Assessment

5.1           Introduction and methodology
A component of the diagnostic study is to assess the extent of public health risk resulting from
poor FSM services within Dhaka, representing risks at a city-wide level and for slum/poor
areas. The study also seeks to identify the approximate level and location along the sanitation
service chain of adverse public health risks.

Methods adopted within the data collection instruments to do this include:

     -    Identifying types of household facility and emptying services used (supported by direct
          observation of the cleanliness and functionality of the facility), during the household
          survey;

     -    Observing emptying service providers to identify how their practices may introduce risk
          to the household specifically (containment and emptying stages) and to the wider public
          at large (emptying, transport and disposal stages) - see Annex D for information on the
          scoring system used;

     -    Scoring hazards and vulnerability factors observed during transect walks (see
          explanation below), along with information about local practices that could result in
          fecal contamination in the environment (see Annex D for information on the scoring
          system used);

     -    Measuring fecal contamination levels in local drains and water supplies, to identify
          potential levels of exposure to risks; and

     -    Asking for perceptions of risk related to emptying services, during focus group
          discussions.

Collating and analysing results from the data collection instruments provides information
about sources of risk through the service chain. This includes: how clean and operational
toilets are kept within the household; how effectively and safely service providers empty,
transport and dispose of fecal sludge; the extent to which infrastructure provides effective
handling of fecal sludge and wastewater through the city.

Given the limited extent of data collected for this part of the study, it can only provide a
general indication of risk level at positions along the service chain. The study is not intended
to report on specific locations or flow paths of FS movement within the sampled PSUs. 24

5.2         Results: risks through stages of the FSM service chain

5.2.1       Containment: household facilities, levels of sharing and practices

The standard of household containment facilities has been identified from the household
survey, as indicated in Section 4.3.1.

From the survey, reported levels of sharing of facilities shows that, in slum areas, 65% of
households use an improved shared latrine and a further 12% an unimproved shared latrine.
This compares with 22% of households city-wide using an improved shared latrine and no
households using an unimproved shared latrine (see Table 5). For shared latrines in slum
areas, an average of 11 households share a latrine (median value 7 households), as compared
to an average of 5 households sharing a latrine city-wide (median value 4 households). 35%
of slum dwellers who use a shared latrine reported sharing their latrine with more than 30
individuals.

Standards of cleanliness for household facilities, observed during the household survey, were
found to vary between city-wide and slum area facilities.

    -      City-wide, 100% of observed latrines were found to have a cleanable slab and 96% no
           fecal or urine contamination on the floor or slab.

    -      In slum areas, these levels fell to 78% of latrines having a cleanable slab. 71% showed
           no signs of fecal or urine contamination on the floor or slab, which given the extent of
           sharing is perhaps a better result than might be expected.

Practices around the disposal of child faeces also introduces risks to both households and
potentially the wider public. City-wide, 6% of households reported unsafe methods practiced
when disposing of faeces of children under 5 years old (disposing into drains, ditches, solid
waste or leaving in the open), while in the slum areas this figure rises to 67%. In the majority
of cases this is by faeces being disposed into drains or ditches (56%), with remaining practices
being through disposing of faeces with solid waste (7%) or faeces left in the open (11%).

Despite such potential risks, levels of diarrhoea are relatively low, as shown in Table 9
below. The household survey gives the following results for self-reported diarrhoea
prevalence by the respondent (person answering the questions). As can be seen, prevalence
was higher in the slum sample (4%) than the city-wide sample (2%). However, it may be too
small a difference to be statistically significant. A similar pattern is seen amongst children
under-5. In the city-wide sample, respondents reported that no children under-5 had suffered
from diarrhoea in the past two weeks, but this figure was 3% in the slum sample.25

25 These figures are more or less consistent with the Bangladesh DHS 2011 data on diarrhoea prevalence, which
found that 4% of children under-5 in urban areas nation-wide had suffered from diarrhoea in the 2 weeks
preceding the survey.



                                                                                                            39

It should be noted that diarrhoea prevalence is only one indicator of a contaminated
environment. It is increasingly understood that nutrition outcomes, especially stunting (height-
for-age) are strongly linked to sanitation through multiple transmission pathways. The
Bangladesh DHS 2011 found that, in urban Bangladesh, 36% of children under-5 were stunted.
While stunting has numerous determinants, living in such a contaminated environment
certainly contributes to those observed outcomes.

Wider risks to public health, beyond risks to families and individuals from poorly-managed
containment facilities and practices, arise from poor access to fecal waste management during
discharge, emptying, transport and disposal practices.

5.2.2      Emptying: household practices around emptying services

As seen in the results from the household survey and reported during focus group discussions
in slum areas, the majority of households rely on using some form of self-built latrine that
connects into a drain, either directly or via a pit or septic tank. The data regarding filling-up
and emptying rates was discussed in section 4.3.1.

Of those households who have called on emptying services, the reasons have been identified
as mainly the pit/tank being nearly full (for both city-wide and slum areas), and only in a few
cases the facility overflowing, smelling, or becoming blocked (Table 10).

Satisfaction expressed about the safety of emptying services was reported to be high across
both city-wide and slum area households.26 83% of households city-wide (30 responses) and
87% of households in slum areas (37 responses) stated they were either very satisfied or
satisfied with the safety of emptying services. Risk as perceived by householders will not be
the same as actual risk resulting from the process, so this information should be considered
alongside results from the structured observation (next section).



26 Households   who had used an emptying service provider (mechanised or manual) were asked to rate their
satisfaction with the safety of the service – from very satisfied to very dissatisfied. With no definition for “safety”
given to households, the response will be based on the perceived level of safety to the household themselves as
a result of the emptying activity.

5.2.3     Emptying, transport and disposal: observed practices and risks, in
          slum areas

Planned observations were carried out during five emptying operations in slum areas (three
carried out by manual emptiers and two using mechanised vacuum tankers – the VacuTug).
In all five cases, there were no logistical challenges affecting the service providers themselves,
as access to the latrine on the compound was satisfactory and access into the pit/tank in each
case was by lifting a removable cover slab to gain full access to the pit/tank below.

Using a structured observation format, likely sources of immediate risk from exposure to FS at
each step of the process were identified for the Containment, Emptying, Transport and
Disposal stages. Treatment and End-use of fecal sludge is not practiced in Dhaka, so these
stages of the service chain could not be observed.

Risk levels were taken to be based on exposure as follows:

    -    at containment stage to the family members/households who use the facility,

    -    at emptying stage to those in the compound (site) where the facility is located, plus the
         neighbourhood along the emptying route from the compound to transport/disposal
         point,

    -    at transport and disposal stages, affecting a wider geographical area and population,
         especially where FS is discharged into drains and open water bodies. Disposal of FS
         into a drain may not present a direct risk to public health (unless people enter into the
         drain and/or use the drain water directly), but there will be high environmental pollution
         occurring beyond the final outfall of the drain. There could therefore be risks resulting
         from human contact with wastewater discharges beyond the outfall – but the location
         of such discharge was not identified within the scope of this study.

Based on the scoring system developed for the structured observation, exposure to risk were
recorded using High/Med/Low categories. The specific results are shown in Annex D, while
the following sections discuss the broader findings and their implications Error! Reference
ource not found.. It should be kept in mind that, as the immediate risk was being noted down
at each stage in the process, the risk level can vary between stages, depending on the actions
taken.

Containment and Emptying: Manual
The containment facilities where manual emptying was observed (three cases) introduced a
low risk to the household, as they were in relatively clean condition and the pits/ tanks were
not full to the point of overflowing.

The action of manual emptying itself introduced medium risk to the compound and possibly
neighbours on two occasions, as spillage occurred during the removal and transfer of fecal
sludge from the emptying bucket to ground level buckets/containers or discharge into
channels.

    -    In the majority of focus group discussions, participants identified manual emptying as
         an unsafe practice, as fecal sludge is discharged into the nearest pond, drain, water
         body or canal. In no case was FS reported as being transported to a safe discharge



                                                                                                 41

         point. On two occasions, fecal sludge was reported to have been spilt onto paths and
         roads during the procedure identified as affecting the health of children, who are often
         barefoot.

    -    81% of households surveyed in slums who had used an emptying service reported
         using manual emptiers (compared with 97% of households’ city -wide) on the basis of
         their affordability, accessibility and a more flexible and responsiveness service. This
         was backed up by the majority of FGDs. In slums, 14% reported emptying themselves,
         which is likely to carry similar or greater risks due to lack of appropriate equipment and
         skills.

Containment and Emptying: Mechanical
The containment facilities where mechanical emptying was observed (two cases) were
considered to introduce a medium risk to the household. The risk was rated as higher, due to
the pit or tank being extremely full or overflowing immediately prior to emptying. This is likely
to be influenced by the fact that households often have to wait for some days for mechanical
emptiers to become available, during which time pits/tanks fill up and latrines may become
overfull, back-up and become difficult to keep clean.

The emptying action was observed to pose low risk to the household, as removal and transfer
of fecal sludge is well contained in the suction pipes connected directly from the pit/tank to the
tanker.

Transport and Disposal: Manual
Manual emptying in each case did not record a risk for a ‘transportation’ stage, as the fecal
sludge was discharged into either a water body (pond), open drain or covered stormwater
drain near to the household. In the first two cases, the actual risk is anticipated to be high,
due to the potential for spills and direct human contact with fresh fecal sludge – as seen from
the photographs below. In the third case (Korail), the transportation process introduced very
little, if any, risk to the household.

Disposal locations in the first two cases, being an open drain and dug trench leading to an
open waterbody, are considered to be high risk. The disposal of fecal sludge into a covered
drain in the third case (Korail) is considered to introduce no direct risk to public health, but
rather there will be high environmental pollution occurring beyond the final outfall of the
stormwater drain used and there could also be risks resulting from any human contact with the
discharge beyond the outfall.

Transport and Disposal: Mechanical
Transporting FS in the vacuum tankers was observed to pose little, if any, risk. The FS was
safely contained in the tankers without any spillage occurring on route to the disposal point.

Disposal practice by the mechanical emptiers was considered as medium risk. As far as can
be ascertained, the eventual discharge from the stormwater or surface water drain may not
interact directly with human activities – such as people using drain water for washing, cleaning
or other domestic uses, children playing in drains, drains overflowing into properties or drain
water reaching low-lying areas. Given the complexity and coverage of drainage networks in
Dhaka (and given the constraints of this study), identifying the actual risk from any given
disposal practice, its scale and location within the city, is extremely unlikely.

The impact more generally of such practices on wider environmental contamination, as
measured through levels of E. coli found in drain water running through areas within the scope
of the study, are reported and assessed further in Section 5.3.

Without enforcement of the by-laws, mandates or rules governing the management of fecal
sludge in the surface drains and small bore stormwater drains managed by the DCCs (North
and South), or the large bore stormwater drains managed by DWASA, the practice of
discharging fresh fecal sludge into the nearest available drain access point will continue.

While Dhaka has a sewage treatment plant at Pagla, it does not accept fecal sludge directly.
As such, there is no site in Dhaka available for anyone to discharge fecal sludge in a manner
where it can be safely treated.

5.2.4        Transport and discharge: associated with sewerage

The sewerage network in Dhaka is currently estimated to cover 20% of the city population
(Dhaka Sewerage Master Plan Report, 2013). The household survey identified that city-wide
25% of households reported having their latrine directly connected to a piped sewer system,
with no connections in slum areas. However, not all of the wastewater discharging into sewers
reaches the treatment plant in Pagla, due to either leaking sewers or non-functioning pumping
stations leading to sewers discharging into nearby drains or watercourses (via overflows).

The DWASA Sewerage Master Plan notes that 9 of the 27 installed pumping stations are not
functional, while a further 10 or more may not be working, or are currently by-passed. As a
result, it would seem that about 70% of the sewerage network is currently not operational.
Getting details of the actual level of failure, enabling leakage rates and overflows to be
identified, has not been possible during the course of the study.


5.3          Results: risks from wider environmental contamination
The 40 transect walks (30 conducted city-wide and 10 in slum areas) confirmed that fresh fecal
waste is visible or present in the majority of local environments and neighbourhoods – both at
a city-wide scale and within slum areas. This is primarily through the practice of latrines
emptying either directly, or via pits and septic tanks, into local drains. In many cases these
drains are open and fecal waste was directly observed.

Drain water

Where fecal waste was seen in drains on the day of the transect walk (in 50% of locations city-
wide and in slum only areas), during the short interview with community members, people
confirmed in 80% of both city-wide and slum areas that they would see fecal waste in the
drains on a daily basis throughout the year.27

When community members were asked about the practice of latrines emptying into drains, in
the city-wide areas people reported that this occurs daily in 57% of locations (17/30 locations),
while in slum areas people reported this as occurring in 80% of the locations (8/10 locations).
Samples of drain water taken in 20 areas (10 city-wide and 10 in slums) confirmed the
presence of E.Coli in the drains.

There is widespread recognition that the practice of discharging fecal sludge to drains
throughout the city generates a high environmental health risk. However there is little evidence
of chronic health risks resulting from this – indicated by the low prevalence of diarrhoeal
disease. This situation is however interspersed with high acute health risks during episodes
that generate high exposure levels, such as blockages to drains and drains failing to deal with
overloading during flooding, as well as poorly managed emptying practices.

Where the population are likely to be most at risk is where they have the opportunity to come
into direct contact with fecal contamination in drain water. For some people, this may be due
to a practice of using drain water for non-domestic activities (such as washing vehicles), but
the greatest risk often associated with drains is children playing in, or close to, drains without
being aware of the risks from contact with drain water, practicing safe handling or effective
handwashing afterwards. Although the transect walks did not directly identify cases of children
playing in drains, it was clear that children regularly play in close proximity to open drains and
are likely to pick-up contamination through for example contact with overflowing drains or
walking barefoot next to blocked and overflowing drains.

Dumped fecal sludge, removed from blocked drains

When either the shallow, open drains or deep, closed stormwater drains become blocked (as
happens frequently) they are eventually emptied. As the network consists of mainly open
drains, the bulk of this work is carried out by manual sweepers, with dredgers used in some
cases. The removed sludge will contain a mixture of fecal sludge, sand and silt (and in certain
locations of the city industrial pollutants) and is dumped directly next to the drains in the streets
or pathways. The extent to which this practice occurs is not clear. The transect walks only
noted fecal sludge dumped in one location out of 40, with this practice being reported by local
residents as occurring on roughly a monthly basis.

Open waterbodies

When asked about the extent to which fecal sludge reaches open bodies of water (such as
ponds, rivers, canals or streams), people reported that this is a daily occurrence in 5 city-wide
locations (17% of the 30 study areas) and in 6 slum areas (60% of the 10 study areas). The
question did not extend to identifying how the fecal sludge reached the ponds – whether it
came directly from latrine outlets, or by manual emptiers disposing of removed fecal sludge
into the waterbodies. In either case, open water in the local environment is frequently and
significantly contaminated.

Box 1 Solid Waste Management
  Health risks from people coming into contact with (potentially contaminated) solid waste in
  their local environment is not a direct part of this study. However, piles of solid waste
  accumulating close to where people live was noted in 47% of city-wide areas and 40% of
  slum areas, with these piles at times obstructing open drains in the area.




                                                                                                   46

  A further route of fecal contamination is when the feces of small children who are not using
  latrines is thrown-out with solid waste. Of households reporting having to handle children’s
  feces, 3 out of 94 families in city-wide areas (3%) and 8 out of 109 families in slum areas
  (7%) reported throwing the children’s feces out with their solid waste. The nation -wide
  MICS figures for 2006 report these values as 11% for all families and 14% amongst the
  poorest quintile (MICS, 2006). Levels in the urban context are understandably lower than
  national figures, but of concern is that the feces of babies and young children are known to
  contain a higher proportion of disease-causing organisms than adult feces – so
  contaminated solid waste in the environment poses a potential health risk to the whole
  community.



Water supply

Dhaka has significantly improved access to piped water supplies throughout the city in recent
years. In slum areas in any city however, these supplies often have additional connections
informally added to any formal arrangement, resulting in “spaghetti” networks where pipes are
connected using temporary joints/seals, leaving domestic supplies prone to contamination.
Where pipes run in drains, the risk of contamination can increase significantly.

Transect walks in the 40 PSUs did not identify any situations where the water supply
infrastructure as identified as being at direct risk from poor FSM services. Tests on drinking
water from piped or groundwater supplies, at the point of delivery, in 40 of the PSUs showed
a detectable level of E. coli in 3 piped water supplies from city-wide areas (10% of the 30
samples taken), in 1 piped water supply and 1 groundwater source from slum areas (20% of
the 10 samples taken in total). While these sample sizes are too small to be statistically
significant, they point to the fact that some piped water supplies are becoming contaminated
before, or as, they reach households.


5.4       Implications: assessing the public health risk from poor FSM
Risk to public health, as a result of poor FSM services, comes when there is human exposure
(i.e. some form of contact) to the hazard (i.e. feces that contains pathogens), through an event
(such as walking barefoot over fecal sludge, working or playing in drains that carry fecal sludge
discharged from latrines, drinking water or via hands contaminated with feces). The study has
identified that all areas of Dhaka are prone to fecal contamination, resulting from fecal sludge
being carried in drainage networks and eventually reaching open waterbodies, or being
dumped by the roadside when drains are unblocked. In certain areas of Dhaka, exposure to
fecal sludge is more direct and hazardous – such as where fresh fecal sludge is discharged
directly into open waterbodies (such as ponds) that are used for recreational purposes or
domestic water use, or contaminated drains overflowing into living areas. In other situations,
the cause and level of exposure may be more difficult to measure, such as the extent to which
contamination in water supplies is a result of poor FSM.

It is likely that the drain networks running through slum areas will be more informal and open,
as compared to those running through the city as a whole. It is also recognised that parts of
the city, most notably the eastern area, become inundated caused by external flooding from
rising rivers as well as internal flooding caused by stormwater and the poor drainage

infrastructure.28 What is clear however is that the problem of fecal contamination is occurring
throughout the city? Perhaps as a result of the extensive scale of poor FS management, the
complex integration of slum areas within the city as a whole and resulting spread of
contamination, assessment of the findings so far has not identified a strong association
between the locations (PSUs) of poor management practices and any risks identified within
that PSU – either through measured contamination of drain water or water supplies, or through
observed / reported human behaviours that bring people into contact with fecal sludge.

Further analysis is needed if results of where, how and to what level risk is occurring, are to
be clearly identified. In collaboration with the Centre for Global Safe Water at the Rollins
School of Public Health, Emory University, results from Dhaka have been initially analysed
using an adapted version of the SaniPATH tool.29 This initial analysis has identified
weaknesses in the data available from the Dhaka study to be able to carry out the SaniPATH
analysis. These weaknesses are both in terms of the reliability of certain results (essentially
the microbiological indicators of fecal contamination in drain water and drinking water
samples), as well as the extent of data available relating to human behaviours in the study
PSUs that expose people to pathways of fecal contamination.

At this stage, the study is not able to present an analysis of public health risk from poor FSM
services in Dhaka. However, the collaboration has informed ongoing development of a
SaniPATH tool for FSM services by; identifying minimum data requirements to conduct a
credible public health risk assessment, the need for preliminary assessment of the main
pathways of risk and the reporting requirements for target audiences such as municipal
managers or World Bank staff. Further collaboration will work towards developing a more
effective tool that addresses an appropriate level of data collection and analysis, with improved
visual presentation of the results.

6         FSM service potential demand and supply
          assessment

6.1       Introduction
In economic theory, markets for goods and services operate on the basis of demand and
supply. This chapter provides a brief assessment of demand and supply for FSM services in
Dhaka. At this stage, it is important to note the difference between potential (or notional)
demand and effective demand. The potential demand for FSM services is the quantity (and
type) of services which would be demanded in the absence of any market failures or
distortions. This is different from effective demand, which is the quantity (and type) of services
actually purchased in the context of current supply and current prices.

A simple way of illustrating this is to note that 75% of households city-wide use OSS, which
suggests high potential demand for FSM services. However, only 13% of households report
experiencing a pit or tank filling up (see section 4.3), suggesting low effective demand.
Reasons for a gap between potential demand and effective demand in Dhaka include: (i) 52%
of households city-wide report having pits/tanks connected to drains (reducing or removing the
need for emptying), which is illegal and therefore a market failure, (ii) 21% of households city-
wide do not even have a pit or tank – their latrine empties directly to a drain or ditch without
intermediate containment, (ii) many service providers may not be able to physically access
households, which affects the type of services demanded, (iii) market prices for services may
be higher than consumers are willing or able to pay, which is a market failure.

There can be different definitions of potential demand in the context of FSM, with varying layers
of complexity. The simplest definition is as per the above, i.e. services that would be demanded
if all OSS households used emptying services and were willing and able to pay. Qualifications
could be added for different scenarios, for example (i) given emptying of pits tanks every 10
years on average, (ii) given regularly desludging once a year, (iii) given that 30% of households
are unable to pay the market price and a further 20% are unwilling, and so on. For this study,
we have kept things simple.

On the supply side, the types of FSM services the market is currently providing to households
were studied.30 Dimensions of supply include the number of service providers of different types
(manual, mechanical etc.), the geographical areas they serve, the prices they charge, and so
on.

This section will argue that the main problem in Dhaka is on the demand side. Fewer FSM
services are demanded than would be expected given the population using OSS, primarily
because people connect to the drains. Where FSM services are demanded, manual emptying
predominates because slow traffic and poor accessibility to households demanding emptying
inhibits mechanical emptiers from entering the market, due to low perceived profitability.




30
  FSM services are obviously also demanded by the government, businesses etc. but households are the focus
of this study.

6.2        Methodology
This sub-section sets out key dimensions of demand and supply, and the data collected related
to those, from the various instruments. It was not intended to collect data on all of these
aspects, given the broad scope of the research and the limitations of some of the instruments
used.

6.2.1      Demand

The research framework (see section 1.3) poses the following question: “What is the existing
customer demand and preferences for FSM services?”, i.e. the current effective demand. This
is discussed in three parts: (a) physical and economic determinants of household demand, (b)
household satisfaction with current services, and (c) the barriers which households face in
obtaining FSM services.31 This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather those considered
important for answering the questions in the research framework.

Physical and economic determinants of household demand

It is useful to separate the physical and economic determinants of household demand,
because the differences between them have implications for any interventions; either in
stimulating or responding to that demand. Physical determinants are related to geography and
infrastructure, whereas economic determinants are more to do with markets and finance.

The main determinants are set out in Table 12 and

Table 13 below, which list various key determinants and the way they have been measured
them by the research instruments, as well as where it was chosen not to collect data in this
area.

1. Accessibility of location
                                                                          Household survey questions about

and privately owned or in shared ownership
2. Fill rate


31 Given  our focus on household demand, the primary concern is demand for emptying services rather than the
rest of the sanitation service chain. The research framework also asks about levels of satisfaction by providers of
emptying services with current transport, treatment and disposal/end-use arrangements. As the scale of
formalised emptying services is so limited and there is no effective treatment or end-use for fecal sludge in
Dhaka, this aspect does not form a significant part of the study.

3. Financial
Ability to pay (ATP) – poor people do not always have              No formal assessment of ability and

                                                                   added at the request of the World

4. Incentives
Tenancy status – households who rent property from a
landlord may not have authority to deal with sanitation
matters. Landlords may not want to pay for tenants’
ongoing services, connecting latrines instead to a direct          Household survey question
discharge. Tenancy status therefore influences the
incentives and decision-making role of the likely service
purchaser.
Alternative sanitation options – if there is space, then           No data, since it is hard to gauge
households can dig a new pit and cover the old one. If             what options are open to households.
there is not, the household may still abandon the latrine          The household survey did however
and use an alternative option (shared/public latrine or            ask what they planned to do next time
open defecation) rather than use an FSM service                    their pit or tank filled up.


Household satisfaction with existing services

Household satisfaction with the performance of service providers will be a determinant of
demand. This was addressed in two ways through household survey questions based on a

Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



four-point Likert scale.32 Firstly, households were asked to rate their satisfaction level with
various aspects of sanitation facilities used, including quality of construction, ease of access,
privacy and cleanliness. Secondly, households which had used an emptying service last time
their pit or tank had filled up, were asked to rate the service provider on price, overall service
quality, safety and ease of obtaining service.

Other barriers which households face in obtaining FSM services

Some reasons for a gap between potential and effective demand for FSM services in Dhaka
are already listed above (e.g. connecting outlets to drains, physical access to households and
willingness to pay). However, there are many other potential barriers which households may
face in securing FSM services (some of which are included in the economic and physical
determinants in the tables above).

There are further barriers to accessing services which it may not have been possible to predict
ex ante. These were therefore explored in qualitative research, particularly through Focus
Group Discussions with community members in slums areas. Several of the discussion
questions focused around perceptions and opinions of existing services, and what participants
would like to see in terms of improved services in the future. Discussions were semi-structured,
with participants able to discuss questions more openly, allowing further determinants of
demand not otherwise addressed in the household survey to be identified.

6.2.2     Supply

On the supply side, the research questions were around the current status and quality of FSM
service delivery. This was divided into assessments of physical capacity of service providers
(number of providers and the scale of service reach) and technical/institutional capacity (the
scope and quality of services). This is assessed along the sanitation service chain. All of these
factors were assessed mainly through Key Informant Interviews with service providers (SPs)
themselves, as carried out by local consultants contracted by WSP. The following areas were
to be covered:

        Physical capacity
            o Scale – number of SPs, their staffing capacity and areas they serve
            o Turnover – monthly income/expenditure of SPs
            o Clients – number of clients in past month

        Technical/institutional capacity
            o Formality – whether formal (i.e. licensed/registered) or informal
            o Compliance – local regulations, or fines/persecution imposed
            o Skills/equipment – types of skilled staff and equipment available

Much of this data came from the report submitted by the WSP consultant Mark Ellery. Answers
on all these dimensions were not always available or forthcoming.

6.3         Findings – household demand for FSM services
The results in each key area are presented below, with an overall assessment provided in the
concluding section, alongside implications for FSM in Dhaka.

6.3.1       Determinants of household demand

6.3.1.1 Accessibility of location

Whether a service provider can actually get to the facility requiring emptying (as well as the
household’s perception of that) will be a key determinant of whether services are demanded.
Data on this were collected from several angles, and were analysed starting from road/path
systems in the community, before focusing down to the household level and, ultimately, the
facility itself.

Some of the transect walk data sheds light on the kinds of housing density, paths and roads
experienced in the studied areas.

Table 14 provides scoring data separately for sub-samples A and B. 33 In terms of housing
density, only 30% of PSUs scored 4 or 5 in sub-sample A, as compared to 70% in B.34 There
are similar differentials for paths and roads. In terms of implications for FSM services, what
can be concluded from this table is that mechanised emptying equipment (such as the DSK
VacuTug) would find it relatively easy to access households city-wide. Only 10% of PSUs city-
wide had roads (in general) which were not wide enough for a car to pass. This figure was
80% for the slum PSUs, indicating that existing mechanised emptiers would find it hard to
access the majority of slum households.

buildings and, as Table 15 below shows, the majority of households city-wide (53%) live in
buildings of more than one storey, whereas this was only the case for 5% of households in the
slum sample. The nature of containment, and associated access to pits/tanks, is therefore
likely to be considerably different city-wide and in slums. In addition, the management of that
containment in a large building is likely to be different too. Accessibility to then pit/tank is only
tangentially related to this.

Focusing on the toilet itself, Table 16 below shows the accessibility of the main pit/tank
structure, followed by the presence of a purpose-built hatch (as one would expect with a
correctly-constructed septic tank). Following the theme from the TW data, households in slum
areas were again harder to access at the household level, with “poor access” for 93% of
households (against 69% for the city-wide sample).35 With regard to the pit/tank having access
points or hatches to facilitate emptying, it was more common for city-wide households to have
one (31%) than in slum areas (5%).36

Overall, from the perspective of accessibility it is clear that city-wide, households and the
contents of their pits/tanks are far more accessible to formalised emptying services (i.e. beyond
using buckets and ropes) than in slum areas in particular. This is an unsurprising finding, but

35 This data comes from observations by our enumerators during the household survey. There were three
categories: “Poor access, only accessible to hand-carried emptying equipment”, “Reasonable access for small
(manual or mechanised) emptying equipment” and “Good access for medium/large size (mechanised) emptying
equipment”. Definition of these categories was covered during the training.
36 This was also an observation. There is room for confusion between categories 2 and 3, so we would

emphasise comparison between category 1 and and the total of the others.



                                                                                                              54

the ability to back up assumed situations with hard data should help to explain how the
accessibility of households and their latrines should be a key concern in any interventions to
stimulate demand for FSM services.

6.3.1.2 Fill rate

Data on the type of containment was already shown in Table 6 in section 4.3.1 above. As noted
above, data were not collected on the volume of pits/tanks, since household estimates were
thought to be unreliable. Opel et al. (2012) did collect data on this indicator using a survey of
467 households in what are most likely slums areas of Dhaka.37 They estimated that the
average size of a septic tank was 14m 3 and a pit 2.5m 3, but it is not clear how this was done
since it was a household survey rather than a physical survey. Numbers of observations are
not disaggregated and the estimation method is not clear, so these figures should be viewed
with caution (see later comment at the end of this sub-section).

While not collecting volume data, households were asked how long it usually took for their pit
to fill up, which was considered more relevant, and a more reliable indicator for households to
estimate. The results are in Table 17 below. It should be noted that there are few observations
since so few households have experienced pits filling up at all (due to so many latrines being
connected to drains). The data shows that across the city, for many households that do
experience pits filling up, this happens at least once a year. Pits/tanks took less than 12 months
to fill up for 49% of households city-wide and for 76% of households in slums. Reasons for this
are considered in the next section, but could be related to smaller pit/tank size and/or a higher
number of users per latrine, given the high prevalence of sharing.

Moving to the data on shared latrines, the mean number of households sharing each latrine
was 1.2 city-wide and 8.4 in the slum sample (considering the whole of both sub-samples and
coding private latrines as 1).38 This fits well with the overall data on sharing as indicated in

37 The  sampling frame is not clear from the paper, but the methodology notes a focus on “areas mainly in the
fringe of the city which require emptying”. This data may therefore be most comparable to our slum sample.
38 For these estimates, households with private latrines (not sharing with any other households) are included and

coded as 1. If those households are excluded, the means become 5.3 and 10.9 for sub-samples A and B
respectively. In other words, from the city-wide sample, the average latrine used by 1.2 households but the
average shared latrine is used by 5.3 households.

Table 5 in section 4.3.1. Where toilets are shared, it is worth considering the numbers of
people which were sharing in more detail, as is shown in Table 18 below.39 This comes directly
from data reported by households, as opposed to from estimations based on secondary data;
it should be noted that the average household size was 4.8 in both sub-samples

As can be seen, the majority of latrines in the city-wide sample were used by fewer than 6
people, since most households (78%) did not share their latrine with other households. In the
slum sample, however, 35% of households reported that the latrine that they use was shared
by more than 30 people (with only 9% sharing with 5 people or fewer). To some extent, this
can be explained by the use of public toilets. Relating this data to demand for FSM services,
we would expect the average latrine in Dhaka’s slums to fill up faster than the average latrine
city-wide, since more people use it, all things being equal. However, this does not account for
other factors relating to fill rates (e.g. size of pit/tank).

Returning to the figures from Opel et al (2012) on average septic tank / pit volumes and
assuming that these represent slum areas of Dhaka, then using these volumes and the values
from this study for average users of household / shared facilities in defined slum areas, it can
tentatively be concluded that septic tanks or pits would take somewhere between 10-20 years
to fill with fecal sludge. This assumes that septic tanks are generally used in shared facilities
with at least 20 users sharing and pits are used in households with at least 5 users sharing. It
also takes a conservative value for sludge accumulation of 40 litres/person/year 40 for both
septic tanks and pit latrines and assumes that the systems are operating correctly, with final
effluent discharging to soakaways.

Where households have reported emptying their containment facility, the frequency of
emptying is much shorter (typically less than 12 months), highlighting that the effluent
discharge arrangement is not operating correctly, or does not exist. The removed contents
comprises the generated fecal sludge (i.e. including urine, water used for anal cleansing and
other liquids added to the pit such as wastewater, subtracting what infiltrates through the lining
of the pit or tank.)

Rapid filling is therefore likely to occur during times of heavy use of the facility, or where the
tank/pit cannot leach liquid into the surrounding ground, especially during the wet season and
when the ground is saturated. As shown in Table 18Table 17, pits/tanks filled up much faster

39 Thisdata was asked directly in a survey question as a categorical variable for the categories shown: “How
many people use this toilet regularly?”
40 These are common figures used for excreta sludge held in wet conditions – based on the gradual build-up

(accumulation) of sludge, allowing for decomposition and compacting of the sludge, over time



                                                                                                               56

in slum areas. The dense soil conditions within Dhaka city are known to hinder effective
infiltration, this is not a surprising finding, but again points to reasons why people rely so much
on drains to frequently remove the majority of the content of their tanks/pits from their property,
without having to pay for regular emptying services.

6.3.1.3 Financial aspects

As noted above, collecting data on ATP and WTP was beyond the scope of what was
achievable rigorously in the questionnaire time available. However, data were collected on
the price paid the last time an FSM service was used, and whether households thought that
price was fair.

First though, it is worth briefly considering finance for containment. Households were asked
how much they spent (in cash) to build their toilet at the time when it was built (including
materials and labour), if they spent cash at all. For the city-wide sample this question was only
answered by those in higher wealth quintiles so the data is not that representative (mean is
$579, n=52). However, for the slum sample, the mean for an improved latrine was $153 (n=61)
and for an unimproved latrine was $19 (n=19).41 In terms of paying to use a toilet, this was
very uncommon. Only 3% of households in the slum sample reported paying to use their toilet,
and 0% in the city-wide sample. Finally, regarding repairs/maintenance to toilets in the past 12
months (including repairs to mechanism, superstructure, or drainage, as well as FSM emptying
services), the mean was $53 city-wide (n=42) and $33 in the slum sample (n=41).42

Overall, this data gives us a picture of city-wide households investing more in their latrine than
slum households, which is logical since their incomes are higher, amongst other reasons. In
addition, it shows that, while few people pay to use toilets, those that do have toilets are
investing significant amounts of money annually in their upkeep (while noting that only 11-12%
of households in each sub-sample reported having this expenditure in the last 12 months).

With regard to payment for FSM services the last time emptying took place, the mean amount
paid was $30 city-wide (n=26) and $13 in slums (n=28). 48% of households city-wide reported
that the price they paid was “too high”, with this rising to 64% for slum households. Almost all
households paid the full amount on delivery, and for both sub-samples three quarters of
households paid a flat rate, with the remaining quarter paying a volumetric charge.

6.3.1.4 Incentives

The incentives that drive demand for improved FSM services are influenced by who is
responsible for the ongoing maintenance to keep toilets functioning, including whether it is
shared or not. While the household survey shows that approximately 50% of households rent
their property, both at city-wide scale and in slum areas, management responsibility for toilet
facilities varies more significantly between the two sub-samples.

City-wide, 77% of households used a private household toilet (on plot), while in slum areas
this was 19% of households. However, only 26% of households city-wide and 41% of

41 Nb. we did not ask how long ago this was, so are unable to account for inflation and exchange rates, so the
results are indicative only. We used the rate 1 BGD taka = 0.013 USD
42 Both city-wide and in slums, most households reported that this expenditure was mainly for repairs to the

bowl/slab etc. or for drainage. Only c.20% in both sub-samples reported that the expense was for pit emptying.



                                                                                                                 57
Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



households in slums reported being responsible for managing their facility (assumed to be in
relation to maintenance and repair needs of physical components of the toilet itself as well as
the maintenance, repairs and emptying of what the toilet empties into – i.e. a septic tank or
pit). Landlords were reported to be responsible for managing toilets in 68% of cases city-wide,
which does not tally completely with only 50% renting, which may illustrate some confusion
over the definition of “landlord” in Bengali. Landlords and N GOs together managed 50% of
facilities in slums; 39% and 12% respectively. The confusion over landlords could be explained
by the high proportion of households being based in multi-storey buildings in sub-sample A
(see Table 15 above), whereby even if the flat is owned, FSM may still be perceived to be the
responsibility of the overall building owner/manager, or some kind of caretaker. This could
explain why such a high proportion of households city-wide use a private toilet (77%) but such
a low proportion reported being responsible themselves for managing it (26%).

From this it can be ascertained that, even where households use a private toilet within the
dwelling, city-wide they are less likely to be responsible for servicing that toilet and/or what it
is connected to (i.e. a septic tank or pit) than households in slum areas. With such a significant
percentage of facilities under the management responsibility of landlords/managers, it is clear
that they are a key stakeholder in decision-making around investments and plans to improve
infrastructure and FSM services to support ongoing functionality of toilets from a city-wide
perspective, as well as in slum areas.

Where households invest in a toilet facility, they are likely to have stronger incentives for seeing
this toilet continue to function. City-wide, 100% of facilities were reported as having an overall
durable structure (with cleanable slab, waterseal, roof and providing privacy). Of houses
owning toilets in the slum sample, almost 90% of households made a level of investment in
their own toilet. 52% in a durable toilet, with a further 16% having a non-durable superstructure

a non-cleanable slab.43

6.3.2      Household satisfaction with current services

Households were asked to express their satisfaction with current services – both the sanitation
facility itself and the emptying services used – across a range of factors, as shown in the tables
following. City-wide, the vast majority (over 95% in all cases) reported being satisfied or very
satisfied with the sanitation facility, across all 4 categories of satisfaction. For slum areas the
emphasis shifted, with the majority being either satisfied (43-50%) or dissatisfied (35-43%)
across the 4 categories.

 For households who reported using a service provider (8% city-wide and 10% in slum areas),
 satisfaction levels for 3 of the 4 categories of service provision were similar between city-
 wide and slum areas. The biggest difference in the sub-samples came in satisfaction for the
 ease of obtaining services, with more households dissatisfied in slum areas. Price seems to
 be the factor with the biggest dissatisfaction, across both sub-samples.

 Households in both city-wide and slum areas also identified their intended action once their
 pit/tank fills-up (whether it had filled-up previously or not) as per the table below. Less weight
 was placed on this data than the action after the pit last filled up, as it may not be carried out.
 Nonetheless, it does signal market intention in some sense. In addition, all households were

permitted to answer (regardless of whether they had emptied in the past) as shown by the
higher total respondents. As can be seen, manual emptying is the preferred option by a long
margin in both sub-samples. It is intriguing that such a high proportion of households in slum
areas planned to manually empty themselves. Unfortunately, the data do not shed light on the
reasons for this stated preference, but it may be down to willingness and ability to pay.

6.3.3     Barriers faced by households in slum areas, in obtaining FSM services

Focus group discussions (FGDs) held in slum areas identified that the key barriers that
households face relate both to costs/affordability and awareness/information about (other)
available FSM services.

Families living in slums lack a reliable income as a result of working as day labourers and/or
being on very low incomes. Where households have hired the services of manual emptiers,
this can result in a trade-off with other significant household expenditure. During FGDs, two
individuals reported that these costs affected them being able to pay school fees or for
medicine, while other families in two communities were reported as having to borrow money
to pay the emptying charge.

Where shared latrines with septic tanks are used, people are more aware of the services
provided by mechanical emptiers, but in no case were these services reported as having been
used. In some cases because the tanks haven’t yet needed emptying (built within in the last 4
years), or the VacuTug can’t reach the facility. In no case did FGDs report people receiving
support for emptying services – either for household or shared toilets – with support only
extending to the construction of the toilets themselves. Households are generally not aware of
the actual costs of improving on current emptying services – i.e. changing from manual
emptying to mechanical emptying – but typically identified that the cost would be high.
Improving current emptying services was only seen as realistic in relation to shared latrines,
where costs could be shared between households.


6.4       Findings – supply of FSM services
As set out in section 6.2.2, the questions on the supply side related to the current status and
quality of FSM service delivery. This was divided into assessments of physical capacity of
service providers (number of providers and the scale of service reach) and
technical/institutional capacity (the scope and quality of services).

6.4.1     Services effectively supplied

The first stage of the supply analysis should be to consider what services are supplied in the
market, where effective supply intersects with effective demand. Some relevant context was
already provided in section 4.3.1 by the SFDs, especially Table 7 and Table 8. Those tables
show that when pits fill up, people generally empty them rather than abandoning them
(presumably due to lack of space and the sunk cost of the substructure, e.g. concrete rings).
The data show that city-wide, 8% of households in Dhaka overall have emptied a pit or tank,
as compared to 10% in Dhaka’s slums.

The households which emptied their pit last time it filled up were also asked the emptying
method and type of provider used. City-wide, 97% of emptying households reported using
informal manual sweepers to empty their pit or septic tank, against 78% of households in slum
areas.44 The results for the slum sample are shown in Table 22 below.45

These results again highlight the continuing high dependency on manual emptying. This is true
both at a city-wide level (virtually to the exclusion of all other options) and within slum areas
(where 17% of households using manual emptying reported doing it themselves).

Where technology was used, it was a manual pump (14% of emptying households used this
technology, mostly with an informal provider doing the work). Mechanical emptying services
are virtually absent. None of the emptying households in slums used this kind of service, and
only 3% of the city-wide emptying households used one.

Households were also asked about where the FS was discharged to during emptying.
Households were only asked the initial discharge point, since they would not always be in a
position to know where service providers eventually discharged to. Results are shown in Table
23 below. In both sub-samples, 73% of emptying households reported that sludge was
discharged directly into drain/water body/field from the pit/tank. The vast majority of the others,
in both cases, reported discharge into a drum or container – the eventual destination after that



44 Thiscompares with 69% of households reporting using manual emptiers in the WaterAid Landscape Analysis
and Business Model Assessment in FSM report (BMGF, 2011). The report notes that the results are based on a
non-representative sample of households. Furthermore, it is not that clear whether the indicator refers to all
households interviewed or only to the last time households experienced emptying (as in the present study), so the
indicator is possible not comparable.
45
   The city-wide table is not shown because it does not add much, since 97% of emptying households used
informal manual emptiers.

With regard to the type of payment made for services, about three quarters of emptying
households reported flat rates being charged, both in the city-wide sample and the slum
sample. The remaining households were charged on a volumetric basis. The mean amounts
paid are shown in Table 24 below. As can be seen, the average amount paid in the city-wide
sample was more than double that of the slum sample. One on level this is surprising given
that, in both sub-samples, the most common service used was an informal manual emptier
charging a flat rate. It is most likely that it illustrates effective price discrimination on the part
of the sweepers, given the flexible nature of prices for such services in Bangladesh.

6.4.2     Service provider capacity

Manual emptiers

In terms of physical capacity, there are two main service provider types: manual sweepers and
NGOs with VacuTugs. Taking the sweepers first, these were historically comprised of Hindu
low caste Dalit community members employed by the municipality to clean roads and drains
and remove solid waste. They are also engaged on a contract basis by private households to
empty septic tanks and pit latrines, as well as to unblock individual sewer lines and drains.
Municipalities historically also created separated colonies (i.e. housing areas) to house these
low-caste sweepers, which continue to house their descendants who today may be employed
by government departments, industries and private households. The number of sweepers
active in the private FSM market is very hard to estimate – no estimates were found in
secondary literature. In addition, the private demand for the emptying of tanks and pits is
decreasing. Government quotas and inheritance jobs for low caste sweepers are being
gradually replaced by more influential Muslim sweepers who are able to pay to get these jobs.



                                                                                                             62

The informal manual emptying service is generally quick response with sweepers generally
being close by and keen for the work. In most cases these sweepers are employees of the
DCCs (or if not employed by the DCCs at least they are often housed by the DCCs) but are
contracted privately for the provision of the service. Often the ‘call-out’ for this private service
of emptying is obtained through the public channels of the DCCs. The manual emptying service
is also versatile as it can easily include the unblocking of pipes, accessing difficult locations as
well as the pumping and carting away of the sludge. As a result of most of the work being
engaged informally by households negotiating the contract through the conservancy inspector,
the private cleaning fee is loaded to include a fee for the conservancy inspector.

Mechanical emptiers

There are very few sludge trucks in Dhaka which, on the face of it, is astonishing for a city of
its size in which such a high proportion of people using OSS. It is not so surprising in the
context of so much FS going into the drains. The main service providers who operate a
mechanical emptying service are NGOs. One is Dushtha Shasthya Kendra (DSK), a local NGO
that commenced primary health care in some of the slums in Dhaka City in the late 1980s.
Since then, DSK has become a major provider of water and sanitation services to urban slums.
They initiated the provision of a mechanized fecal sludge emptying service, after gaining
approval from DWASA to discharge fecal sludge into the Asad Gate and Tejgaon sewage
pumping stations. DSK reportedly has two VacuTugs but only one is operational.

Another NGO, the Population Services and Training Center (PSTC) also has a VacuTug. In
spite of advertising their FSM services (via leaflets, banners etc.), the VacuTug service is no
longer operational due to lack of demand. This was compounded by competition from manual
emptiers and their obstruction of VacuTug services in some places. Travel across the city to
discharge fecal sludge was also a huge problem. Without local safe places to discharge fecal
sludge it was felt that the safe collection and transportation of fecal sludge will never be viable
for the slow-moving VacuTugs. Finally, UNICEF recently donated two sludge trucks to
DWASA.

Factors affecting household decisions about which service provider to use

While the VacuTug emptying service DSK provides is hygienic, it faces various practical
challenges including poor access to latrines that are not close to roads, competition from more
responsive manual emptying services, and extreme traffic congestion to reach the sewerage
dumping points (which are not necessarily even operational). As a result there is limited
demand for these mechanized fecal sludge emptying services and high incentives for the
operators to save time and reduce transport costs by discharging the fecal sludge into storm
water drains.

The VacuTug service is limited in reach, scale, utility and accountability. The VacuTug service
does not provide other unblocking services and cannot reach locations where the pit is far from
the road. They also generally charge a fixed fee regardless of pit size. Employees seem to
have some incentives to try to secure business but it appears as though their salary is not
linked to the amount of work they generate.

In most cases, the quicker response time makes manual emptying more attractive to
households because they generally only request this service once their system already starts
to overflow (and they have no liberty to wait too long for emptying). As a result, the niche
demand for VacuTug services for emptying pits is low (i.e. very deep pits that are close to the



                                                                                                  63

road). Price is probably not the key driver. A WaterAid study on reasons for choosing manual
emptying across three different cities found that found less than a quarter of households chose
manual emptying because of the lower price compared with mechanical emptying (Opel et al.
2012). The main driver for households in choosing informal manual emptiers over formal
mechanical emptiers was the relative ease of accessing the manual emptiers with their
flexibility for attending call-outs at any time of day and night also being a significant factor.

7         Fecal Sludge Reuse Options

7.1       Fecal sludge characteristics
All of the samples of fecal sludge removed from on-site sanitation facilities in Dhaka were very
liquid, and could flow easily. The fluid nature of the wastes made it possible to empty pits and
tanks either manually (using buckets) or mechanically (using suction tankers). Suction tankers
were able to use pipes of approximately 100 mm diameter without any problems, because the
sludge behaved as a free-flowing liquid.

Samples of fecal sludge were collected from five districts within Dhaka for laboratory analysis,
with samples from each district being taken from latrines and tanks during both emptying and
discharge. Samples taken from tankers during discharge may have included fecal sludge from
more than one latrine. Results of the laboratory analyses are summarised in Table 8.1 below.

Numbers of bacteria were high, as was to be expected. Two different media were used for
culturing E. Coli bacteria; the media being MFC (Membrane Fecal Coliform Agar) and EMB
(Eosin Methylene Blue Agar). Both media gave broadly similar results, although bacterial
counts using the MFC medium were consistently slightly higher than those using EMB medium.
Helminth egg numbers were much lower than expected, with a maximum count of 781 eggs/L,
compared to counts of approximately 4000 eggs/L reported from other cities.

Most of the other parameters measured were also low, with COD and BOD values indicating
very weak waste strengths. These values, together with the very liquid consistency of the fecal
sludge, imply that the fecal sludge samples were very dilute, containing high proportions of
water. The COD:BOD ratios were within the range from 2.01 to 2.54, suggesting that the
wastes are predominantly organic, from domestic sources and relatively fresh. The measured
nutrient contents (Nitrogen and Phosphorus) were variable.


7.2       Current treatment and reuse, and possible future options
At present there are no systems in place for promoting better standards for fecal sludge
treatment and reuse within Dhaka, and no formal reuse arrangements exist. Some research
has been undertaken to assess the possibility of reusing fecal sludge for agriculture (rice and
vegetable crops) in Bangladesh (Dey, 2015) although detailed results have not yet been
published. By-laws promote and encourage containment of fecal sludge, but most septic tanks
and leach pits discharge directly to storm water drains, so wastes are not contained. There is
no likelihood of wastes being collected, treated and re used in the foreseeable future because
the wastes are not contained effectively, and there are no clear incentives for anyone to
improve fecal sludge service quality standards.

Currently there is one wastewater treatment plant (at Pagla), which does not function
efficiently. Pagla STP is located on a 110.5 ha site to the south east of Dhaka City,
approximately 8 km from the city centre. The Master Plan quotes a design capacity for Pagla
STP of 96,000 m 3/day, and 120,000 m 3/day at peak flow rate. This treatment plant does not
currently treat fecal sludge, although there are plans within the DWASA Master Plan for a
possible future upgrade of the Pagla treatment plant to include septic tank sludge
management. The Master Plan states that Pagla has sludge drying ponds, and land available
for sludge drying and disposal facilities on-site. It also states that Pagla is conveniently close

to rural and agricultural areas where sludge may be re-used, and that trials could also be
conducted into effluent re-use in nearby agricultural areas.

Although analyses of fecal sludge samples suggested that the wastes are predominantly
organic, it has been noted that sludge samples collected from open storm water drains
contained fecal sludge, sand and industrial pollutants. The presence of industrial chemicals
limits the opportunities for reuse of sludge taken from the drains, and reuse of this sludge
should be discouraged.

The fecal sludge characteristics show the wastes to be very liquid, very dilute, and very weak.
These characteristics suggest that the fecal sludge may be too weak or dilute to be of much
value for any type of beneficial re-use. However, it was a very small sample (n=5), and the
Master Plan recommends pilot tests for re-use of sludge as an agricultural fertiliser, and
effluent re-use in nearby agricultural areas.

7.2.1     Treatment

The Master Plan for Dhaka states that the treatment facilities at Pagla WTP consist of
sedimentation tanks, facultative ponds and disinfection, although the sedimentation tanks do
not collect and remove sludge, sludge has accumulated in the facultative ponds, and the
disinfection stage does not function. Pagla also has sludge lagoons, but no facilities for
treatment or disposal of sludge from septic tanks.

It is estimated in the Master Plan that approximately 30% of the population is potentially served
by the sewerage system, with only 20% having connections to the sewers. Several sewers
and manholes have become blocked and fallen into disrepair. Sewage that should flow to
Pagla from some parts of the city for treatment is therefore currently discharged, untreated,
into storm water drains and nearby lakes. In the Master Plan it is estimated that flows entering
Pagla STP are within the range 30,000 to 40,000 m3/day. As Pagla STP has a design capacity



                                                                                                       66
Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



of 96,000 m3/day, the estimated flows into Pagla STW imply that it is significantly under-loaded,
and that it could achieve good quality treatment. However, the effluent quality does not
currently meet the effluent standard for BOD5.

Calculations carried out by WSP’s short term consultant (Mark Ellery) suggest that only 1.2%
of wastewater entering the system is actually treated at the WWTP, which is down to leakage
(from people cross-connecting to drains and poor O&M) and poor treatment for the wastewater
which does eventually make it to the WWTP. He measured capacity throughput at the outlet
weir of 250 l/s (which implies 22 MLD entering the plant). 46 Because many of the processes
require some manual oversight he assumed 8 hours per day of operation, and 50% efficiency
based on general observations at the WWTP. This implies about 3.6 MLD is actually treated
by the WWTP. With an assumption of 118 litres per capita per day of wastewater generated,
and about 2.75m people connected, that implies 325 MLD entering the system. Overall then,
only about 1.2% of wastewater entering the sewerage system is effectively treated.




46 However, the WWTP had only been turned just before the team’s arrival (scum on the top of the clarifiers had
not been collected by the rotating arm and there were septic bubbles rising from the sludge).

8         City Service Delivery Assessment

8.1       Introduction
The FSM City Service Delivery Assessment (CSDA) is a crucial part of the analysis of FSM
services. It answers an overarching question around the quality of the FSM enabling
environment, the level of FSM service development and the level of commitment to FSM
service sustainability. The aim of the CSDA is to allow an objective assessment of FSM service
performance through all stages of the service chain, so as to identify priorities for reform. The
Prognosis for Change (in the next section) then attempts to explain why the CSDA looks like
it does.

The CSDA format builds on an approach developed under the 12-city study (Peal et al. 2013).
In turn, the 12-city method was based on similar exercises in water and sanitation (e.g. Country
Status Overviews produced by WSP).

The CSDA is arranged around three broad areas: enabling services, developing services, and
sustaining services. This is illustrated in Table 26 below, alongside the key question associated
with each area, and the indicators used.

8.2       Methodology
The CSDA aims is to be fully objective and transparent, so the analysis is clear and
stakeholders can engage with it and update it over time as the situation improves. It is primarily
a qualitative analysis, based on a review of key documents and interviews with stakeholders
at the city level. As set out in section 2.1, WSP’s overall study design was that the OPM/WEDC
team designed the methodology, but did not do primary data collection. For analyses such as
the CSDA and PEA, it is very hard to separate data collection from analysis. Therefore, the
collection and preliminary analysis was conducted by a short-term consultant contracted by
WSP, Mark Ellery.47


47
  The analysis for the SDA and PEA chapters of this report are therefore strongly based on Mark Ellery’s internal
report produced in December 2014.

There are several questions beneath each of the nine overall indicators in Table 26 above,
with 21 questions in total. For each question, there are objective criteria to enable a score to
be given for the city, with 0 (poor), 0.5 (developing) or 1 (good) on that question. Each question
is scored along the whole service chain from containment to disposal. An example is given in
Table 27 below, for the first question under the “policy” indicator.

scorecard, by summing together the scores for each indicator (policy, planning etc.). Because
there are different numbers of questions for each indicator, a final step is required, which is to
normalise the scores to a total out of 3 for each indicator. This is achieved by dividing the city
score for that indicator by the maximum possible city score, multiplying by 3, and finally
rounding to the nearest 0.5. This process delivers the overall CSDA scorecard. The output for
Dhaka is shown in Figure 9 below.

8.3       Findings
The overall CSDA scorecard for Dhaka is shown above as Figure 9. An explanation for each
score allocated to the full set of 21 questions is shown in Annex C, while the following
summarises the implications of those results.

8.3.1     Enabling

The challenge of tackling Dhaka’s fecal sludge manag ement requirements is enormous. After
many years of discussion however, the political climate is changing and commitments around
FSM services are higher on the agenda of D-WASA and the DCCs. FSM is not fully defined
within existing legal or regulatory frameworks, so the issue of where future responsibilities will
lie and the necessary institutional framework to secure change are a key part of the
negotiations, supported through the establishment of a new ministerial steering committee.
While discussions continue however, so will the fully informal nature of existing services –
notably in relation to containment and emptying stages of the sanitation service chain.




                                                                                                70

Households and landlords throughout Dhaka have made significant investments in
containment facilities so that use of sanitary latrines is at 95%. 48 Such investments overcome
the problem of localised fecal contamination through open defecation, as a short-term
response to the national target to “contain feces”. However, given the fact that so many latrines
are connected to drains (directly or indirectly) such changes have simply shifted the problem
of managing fecal waste away from homes and local neighbourhoods, via drains, into a
broader challenge of addressing pollution of public spaces and waterbodies. Like international
targets, the national target itself does not address either the quality of containment, or post-
containment stages of the service chain until effluent discharge. There has been little notable
public investment in Dhaka, in regard to strengthening stages of the service chain,
accountability mechanisms or a legal and regulatory framework. The challenge for both public
and private service providers in particular is ensuring adequate institutional capacity and
resources to improve on the availability of affordable containment and emptying arrangements,
while connecting household discharges to something other than drains that will eventually
eliminate both public and environmental risk through establishing a fully-functioning service
chain.

8.3.2      Developing

There is currently no identifiable public expenditure in FS infrastructure or services, with the
result that the availability of appropriate, affordable and safe services to the city population is
almost non-existent. This is notable especially in relation to the standards of containment and
emptying facilities for the urban poor, but affects all of the city’s population through the
ineffective transport and disposal stages of the service chain. Any future application of
subsidies or taxes would need to ensure adequate funds are reinvested into low income areas
to address the problem.

Property owners of new developments across the city easily find ways to side-step the building
codes and challenges found to be associated with them (such as dense soil or restricted land
area making soak pits unrealistic, or connections to sewer lines frequently being blocked).
Connecting to existing storm water drains is increasing the practice of shifting fecal waste out
of local areas, at the expense of contaminating public spaces and the wider environment.
Households living in the ever-increasing number of multi-occupancy dwellings are not
responsible for such decisions, which are taken by the landlords/managers of such dwellings,
and will often have no knowledge of the actual infrastructure, operation and maintenance
requirements beyond their latrine.

8.3.3      Sustaining

Operation and maintenance costs for FS services are primarily carried by households through
their investment in self-financed sanitation infrastructure and paying for any informal emptying
services. There are no government-provided services and only limited provision by civil society
of public latrine blocks – and even then maintenance and emptying of shared facilities falls to
the users. Any public costs are negative and externalised as city-wide environmental health
degradation and localised public-health risks resulting from incidents such as flooding, drain
blockages and unsafe emptying procedures. The non-enforcement of building codes is

48 In slum areas, this “investment” may be in terms of using shared latrines – often shared with significant
numbers of other users. This externalises costs for individuals, notably in relation to time spent using these
facilities.



                                                                                                                 71

resulting in existing sewered facilities being cross-connected to drains, or newly built facilities
directly connecting to storm drains, to overcome problems of frequent sewer blockages. Public
statements obliging households to build septic tanks and soak pits, in the absence of broader
improvements to ensure functionality of connected services, will continue to be unsuccessful.

Current service outcomes, representing the city as a whole and for slum areas only, are shown
in Section 4.3 as Figure 5 and Figure 6 respectively. These clearly demonstrate the extreme
lack of effective management of fecal waste through all stages of the service chain. The result
is public health risks for those affected by flooding, blocked drains and poorly managed
emptying services (notably the urban poor), but also environmental contamination affecting all
areas of the city.

8.3.4     Implications of the CSDA scorecard

The resulting CSDA scorecard of the FSM service delivery assessment in Figure 9 reveals a
complete absence of public policy, capital investment and operational oversight of FSM. This
has resulted in a situation where the majority of fecal waste is discharged to existing storm
water drains.

This current practice provides a relatively ‘desirable’ option for householders, landlords and
developers, as it removes the effort and financial cost of periodic maintenance and emptying
correctly built septic tanks and pits, to keep them functioning. It does however place significant
challenges for finding solutions. With no public investment in FSM services, the informality of
unregulated private provision is set to continue. This can only change when any newly adopted
FSM Framework translates into clearly defined, capacitated and financed action, with the aim
of providing a fully-functioning service chain for all of Dhaka’s fecal waste flows. This will
require recognition, dialogue and engagement of public, private and civil society bodies to
ensure appropriate infrastructure and services can be systematically developed and adapted
to respond to the various contextual challenges of the city (space, tenancy, flooding, poverty,
etc.). Any increasing formality of the dominant informal nature of FS services may need to
focus on opportunities in the transport, conveyance and end-use stages of the service chain –
before tackling the containment and emptying stages.

All of this suggests that bringing change to fecal sludge management practices in Dhaka will
demand significant reform of the regulatory systems that currently govern all stages of the
service chain. In the context of the general failure of existing regulatory systems, clearly
segregating the roles for regulation of failure by central government, from that of licensing of
compliance by local governments, from that of service management by providers, may improve
the incentives for overall compliance and investment.

9         Prognosis for Change

9.1       Introduction
This chapter provides a Prognosis for Change (PFC), by considering the positions of various
stakeholders, in particular the institutions and incentives at play. In the sanitation sector, key
studies considering these questions include a multi-country study carried out by WSP with
OPM (WSP, 2010) and a series of papers by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI, 2013).
In addition, SANDEC’s recent FSM book includes a chapter on stakeholder analysis, which is
a key methodology in this kind of analysis (Strande et al., 2014). Through this Prognosis for
Change (PFC), it is intended to understand three things, which are worth briefly outlining.

Firstly, a PFC considers how “institutions” function. Here, institutions are defined as “the rules
and norms governing human interaction”, rather than a narrower definition of organisations.
Institutions can be formal, such as codified laws – one example in FSM might be a by-law
about where FS can be legally dumped. More importantly, institutions also can be informal,
such as social norms. For example, prevailing attitudes towards reusing FS in agriculture are
an informal institution.

Secondly, a PFC considers the incentives which institutions provide to stakeholders. A
stakeholder is any individual or group with an interest in the outcome of a policy. In FSM, some
examples of relevant stakeholders may include (but are certainly not limited to) sludge truck
companies, the City Council, or slum-dwellers. Stakeholders can be defined broadly or
narrowly as required by the breadth and depth of the analysis. For example, the earlier three
stakeholder examples could be narrowed to recent entrants to sludge truck market, the
planning department of the city council, or female slum-dwellers. This would allow more
nuanced analysis rather than taking whole organisations as homogenous.

Finally, a PFC considers how stakeholders exert influence. Here, influence is defined as the
formal or informal power to cause something or to prevent it from happening. In FSM, it might
be worth considering city council by-laws on FS. A city council may have formal legal power,
but if all their by-laws are openly flouted by service providers without fear of punishment, then
their influence is very low by that measure. However, they may have informal power to
influence FSM in other ways, for example in the ways their employees act when they find a
blocked sewer pipe.

In addition, in order to be practically useful, a PFC should also consider the implications of the
findings for effective engagement in a reform or change process. This involves an assessment
of the options for engagement, and weighing them up in the context of the prevalent power
dynamics and the likely response of stakeholders.


Methodology
In this study, developing a PFC was only one concern alongside a large number of other
research priorities, as set out in Table 1 near the beginning of the report, which lists all the
project components. There was therefore a balance to be struck. The approach in this broad
study was to link a focused PFC closely to the service delivery assessment (see section 8
above). The aim is therefore to explain why the SDA is as it is – in other words, to explore why




                                                                                                73

the service delivery blockages exist, and what entry points are available to stakeholders to try
and resolve them.

Undertaking a PFC is a primarily qualitative exercise. It relies on targeted interviews or focus
groups with stakeholders, alongside secondary data in the form of key sector documents,
reports and studies. As noted in section 8.2 for the SDA methodology, the OPM/WEDC team
did not conduct primary data collection and preliminary analysis under this project, which was
done by other people contracted by the World Bank. Interview notes and reports from other
consultants were primarily used to construct this PFC. In order to keep the length of this report
manageable, only a brief summary of the full analysis conducted by the team is provided in
this section.

Developoing a PFC requires a structure in order to be clearly analysed and communicated.
There are a bewildering number of tools available, which can be applied to particular questions
so as to explore some of the issues described above. Many tools which are commonly used,
including in this study, are contained in a sourcebook which OPM produced for the Wold Bank
(Holland, 2007).. Rather than take up more space with explanation here, it is better to go
straight into the findings. Briefly, however, the main tools used include stakeholder mapping,
process mapping and stakeholder analysis.


Findings

Dhaka’s FSM context

As noted above, the main objective is to explore why the SDA results are as they are. For
Dhaka, the SDA is almost entirely red (i.e. “poor” scores), albeit with some orange
(“developing”) scores for policy and planning around the containment stage of the chain.
Scores for the rest of the chain are universally zero except for policy around emptying, where
the score of 0.5 is only given because D-WASA has given two NGOs permission to discharge
VacuTug contents into the intakes of two of their 30 sewage pump stations. Overall then, the
job of the PFC in the Dhaka context is to try and explain “why is nothing happening on FSM”
and what is the prognosis for change?
At this stage, it is worth reconsidering Dhaka’s context and the responsibilities of key actors,
which were already set out in section 3 above. In summary, three key characteristics of
Dhaka’s context include:
    (i)      rapid population growth alongside vertical expansion of the city into apartment
             blocks and high-rise buildings,
    (ii)     use of “sanitary” latrines approaches 95%, but almost none of the resulting FS is
             effectively contained. 99% of the waste enters the drains and local environment,
             either by a “long route” (e.g. pits/tanks with overflow to drains) or a “short route”
             (e.g. directly to drains with no intermediary containment) – see SFD in section 4.3.2,
    (iii)    a defective sewer system theoretically serving 20% of the population, but with only
             3% of wastewater entering the system actually being treated.
All this results in very low demand for FSM services, with the only households using proper
containment being (a) those in slums with no nearby drain, and (b) houses which have not
connected their latrines & septic tanks to drains – anecdotally, these are more likely to be older
residences according to some key informants. This in turn results in a thin market, with hardly



                                                                                                 74

any service providers providing mechanical emptying. The key service providers are manual
emptiers, but their services are only demanded by a small proportion of the city’s population.

There is emerging recognition that this situation cannot continue and, recently, ITN-BUET was
engaged to draft a Fecal Sludge Management Framework for Dhaka City, with the assistance
of the Gates Foundation. The impetus for this was discussions around the sewerage master
plan for Dhaka.49 While the draft master plan itself is extremely ambitious (aiming to move from
20% sewerage coverage in 2015 to 70% by 2025), discussions around it resulted in movement
towards acknowledgement that FSM has a role to play. This acknowledgement was hard to
avoid in the light of slow progress in extending sewerage coverage and problems with the
effectiveness of the existing network.

The ITN-BUET framework proposed a sanitation tax on all households by local governments
for the public good of FSM, the establishment of an environmental police, and a database of
disposal systems and payments for delivery of fecal sludge. Following the presentation of this
draft to the National Forum on WSS, the Ministry has requested ITN-BUET to develop a draft
National Fecal Sludge Management Framework under the guidance of a Ministerial committee.
In effect, this is a welcoming of the Dhaka framework, though it remains in draft.50

These are bold proposals to improve FSM in Dhaka, in the context of the existing situation
suiting many stakeholders. The use of storm drains for eventual FS disposal to some extent
makes life easier for many stakeholders. The impetus for the decision is therefore discussed
in more detail alongside the use of tools below, alongside the caveat that nothing appears to
have changed on the ground as yet.

In some ways, the current situation persists not only because it suits people, but also because
of the apparently low visible costs it imposes on the majority. For example, there is hardly any
expenditure on FSM services, any health impacts may not be perceived to be related to FSM,
and potential costs of sewerage system blockages are avoided by cross-connecting to the
drains. The hidden costs become far more apparent during the rainy season when the drainage
system becomes overloaded and low-lying areas of the city are flooded, especially poor areas.
The nature of these costs, and whether they are as low as they are perceived by stakeholders,
is addressed in Section 11 on the economics.

Overall, the context is an almost absent market for FSM services despite a rapidly growing
population. Most FS is simply not managed – the problem is avoided by FS being re-routed to
the drains either directly or indirectly. There is, however, an emerging discussion around
resolving this situation. The next section maps out stakeholders’ current responsibilities.

9.1.1     Mapping institutional responsibilities

As set out above, the focus is how institutions function, the incentives which those institutions
provide to stakeholders, and how those stakeholders exert influence. It is therefore important
to understand who those stakeholders are, alongside their formal and informal roles. A useful

and sanitation system.

tool for this is stakeholder mapping, as set out in Table 28 below. This table represents a
summary of a far longer and more detailed table, which has been shortened in the interests of
space.

Stakeholders are categorised by type (e.g. national or local government, NGO etc.), and their
formal role in FSM in Dhaka is listed. In the next column, the reality of how they operate (often
informally) is described. A final column summarises the core challenge represented by how
that type of stakeholder operates.

Overall, the message of the above table is that very few stakeholders are fully implementing
their formal responsibilities with regard to FSM. The current situation suits many stakeholders,
whether it is the property developers cutting corners because it saves them money or
households paying informal manual sweepers because they are quicker/cheaper. It seems
that no single stakeholder has blocked progress particularly, but rather the status quo suits

almost everybody, despite being affected by the externality of poor FSM, whether they know
it or not.

9.1.2     Illustrating the incentive problem

It is helpful to consider the ongoing problem of poor FSM in Dhaka in two dimensions. The first
dimension is static, that is, the way households and businesses are dealing with their FS at
present. At present millions of people in Dhaka have their latrine outflow directly or indirectly
connected to some kind of drain. The second dimension is dynamic – the city is changing
rapidly, both spatially (e.g. more high-rise buildings, slums transferring to periphery) and
demographically (population growth and inward migration).

In terms of policy, the static problem requires a response which could be implemented slowly
over time – for example, there may be ways of persuading or obliging households to disconnect
their toilets from the drains. The dynamic problem, however, requires engagement in areas
that are more the domain of urban planning than sanitation policy and practice. If property
developers are to be prevented from connecting the wastewater outflow of new buildings to
the drains, they must be compelled to build proper septic tanks which are not connected to
drains. As new migrants to Dhaka arrive, and as existing households upgrade their living
conditions, they must have sanitation options open to them offer the potential of effective FSM.

It is possible to illustrate the first aspect of the dynamic problem by using a tool called process
mapping. This aims to understand the interaction of formal and informal “moments” in a
process, and to identify entry points for engagement. It is important to identify the roles of
stakeholders in a process, how and where they exert influence over the process, and the
incentives they face in the informal system.

The process for constructing a new building in Dhaka is shown in Figure 10 below. The central
column shows the formal process which is supposed to be followed by the property developer,
RAJUK (the capital development authority) and the occupants of the eventual building. The
third column, however, shows elements of the informal process, i.e. what really happens. For
example, RAJUK is supposed to consult the DCCs and DWASA about services to be provided
(e.g. water supply, sewerage, drainage, solid waste etc.) when a new building is constructed.
However, this may be limited to only the bare minimum (e.g. water) or RAJUK may sometimes
simply expect services to be provided. Another example would be that the developer is
supposed to construct septic tanks (and leach pits) which be easily accessed for desludging,
but in reality they connect these to the drains. There is also some anecdotal evidence of
developers constructing ‘sham’ facilities to fool or placate overworked RAJUK inspectors.

                                         tanks when req'd

In terms of entry points, there are two ways in which the formal process could be improved so
as to make it less likely that the informal process is followed. Firstly, process for planning
applications could be tightened up, so that the DCCs and DWASA have greater scrutiny of
what is going on. This would not necessarily be easy to implement, and would bring new
problems (e.g. time/inclination of staff to engage, desire to slow down development due to red
tape, etc.). In any case, the relevant DCC and DWASA staff involved in the planning process
would need time to engage. A second entry point could be at the inspection stage. If RAJUK’s
inspectors were better resourced, or if their incentives were better aligned towards preventing
unscrupulous property developers from connecting to the drains, then this could improve the
situation.

Several more key processes could be mapped, to try and identify more entry points. The main
message of this sub-section is that informal processes, and the incentives which make them
happen in that way, are crucial to understanding why good ideas do not always work out in
practice.

9.1.3     The influence and interests of stakeholders in FSM reform

When considering reform options, it is crucial to consider how stakeholders might respond,
e.g. who would be supportive, who would oppose – in other words, their interest, or whether
they stand to gain or lose from any change. With a limited amount of time and effort to put into
preparing the ground and working with different stakeholders, it would be wise to use that time
efficiently and target it at the right people. Therefore, information about stakeholders’ interests
is not enough. It must be used in combination with an analysis of their relative influence. It is
not worth spending as much time on people who oppose the reform but have no power, as
with those who oppose it but have decisive power to prevent it from happening.




                                                                                                       78
Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



For example, it would be useful for those leading on FSM reform to consider whether each
stakeholder in Table 28 would support or oppose a move towards better containment and
emptying practices in Dhaka. This could help start a conversation about stakeholder
engagement in reform processes.

For example, the DCCs would stand to gain in terms of a smaller load being placed on their
small-bore drainage system, which might be expected to become blocked less often as a
result. If FSM reform creates more work for them, in terms of the new responsibilities now
apparent (see Table 28 above), then this might make them less enthusiastic.

Informal sweepers are in a similar situation. Stopping latrines being connected to drains would
work well for them in the short term, in the sense that they would get more business doing pit
emptying. However, they may be wary of market developments which would enable
mechanical truck emptiers to break into their market into the medium term. However, sweepers
have relatively little influence over FSM reform. They can affect the day-to-day situation on the
ground (for example, there is anecdotal evidence that sweepers have interfered with the ability
of mechanical operators to empty pits), but they are not an influential constituency on the
whole. It is also worth noting that many of them are DCC employees, who carry out private
emptying work on the side.

Households and property developers, on the other hand, might be expected to oppose reforms,
as they do not perceive the societal damage costs of inaction, but only the personal costs they
would bear from a change to the situation. Both would stand to face higher costs, households
from having to adapt their toilet facility and eventually pay emptying fees, and property
developers from having to spend more on proper septic tanks and appropriate access to them.
Both are likely to be influential, households in terms of public opinion, and developers in terms
of their political connections.


9.2       Implications for FSM in Dhaka
In conclusion, this chapter has summarised aspects of the analysis conducted through key
informant interviews by World Bank consultants, to help explain why the SDA looks as it does.
That is, why is the whole SDA showing poor FSM service delivery overall. The fact that the
whole thing is red, not just parts of it, has precluded a focused look at key parts of the chain,
which may be more appropriate in other cities.

The implications of all this for FSM in Dhaka is mainly that it is crucial to maintain momentum
on the emerging reform agenda. Progress could easily stall if opposing forces emerge to try
and block it, or if DCC and DWASA drop it due to lack of priority. The various analyses above,
as well as a lot more in the associated report by Mark Ellery, show that while the status quo
suits almost everybody, there are also many stakeholders who would gain from reform as well.
The only influential stakeholders who risk losses are households and property developers, so
special care must be taken to try and win them over.

Householders may be responsive to public education campaigns which increase awareness
of the impacts of poor FSM, especially during or after times of flooding when the contents of
the drains suddenty matters to everybody. As for property developers, the cynical view is that
they will get away with whatever they can. They may well oppose reforms. However, as long
as those in favour can form a strong coalition to put things through, it is unlikely that the costs
to the developers of proper containment are significant enough to warrant them wanting a fight.
All they have to do is put in septic tanks, and the costs of emptying and maintaining those are




                                                                                                 79
Case study report – Fecal Sludge Management in Dhaka, Bangladesh



borne by those eventually managing the building, who in turn can pass them onto the occupant
households.

Strategies are needed to bring along those stakeholders who might be expected to be
cautiously in favour. RAJUK, the DCCs or the sweepers could easily become obstructive if
they perceive a risk of losing out. What the process mapping shows, even of one process, is
that institutions such as regulations and by-laws do not always operate in the way they are
supposed to. It would be disappointing if reform efforts culminated only in yet another set of
by-laws which are ignored by all stakeholders. Special care must therefore be taken to ensure
that any reforms properly consider the changes in incentives they may cause, or indeed fail to
cause.

To address the “so what” questions which are often a response to this kind of analysis, a
section at the end of the next chapter (which focuses on intervention options) considers the
feasibility of proposals in the context of the above analysis.

10        Intervention options
This section proposes interventions to improve fecal sludge management services in Dhaka
and provide an effective enabling environment within which those services can be
appropriately developed and sustainably managed. These interventions are initially informed
by results of the survey data that highlight problems with existing services (as most clearly
represented in the fecal waste flow diagrams). Th interventions most directly affecting service
delivery are then considered in the context of results from using the broader detailed diagnostic
tools, in particular the service delivery assessment (SDA) and the Prognosis for Change (PFC),
as presented in other sections of this report.

This section does not identify or propose specific and detailed actions to be taken, who is best
placed to undertake those actions, what information is needed in advance of taking action
(such as additional feasibility studies), or the likely outcome of those actions. A number of
studies and initiatives are ongoing in Dhaka to do this. The intervention options presented here
take account of those studies and can hopefully support the further development of details and
recommendations from those other studies.

To support planning decisions for improving FSM services over time, this chapter starts by
referring back to key results responding to the question “Where are we now?” using the fecal
waste flow diagrams as a means to illustrate the key challenges. It then goes on to propose
responses to the question “Where do we want to get to?”, that acknowledge components of
the enabling environment, current studies and ongoing sectoral reforms, as well as good
practice and relevant experience from elsewhere.

Addressing the next question “How do we want to get there?” is a further process that requires
strong leadership at city level, engagement of city authorities and key stakeholders, detailed
studies and analysis to identify specific plans and solutions that can support an incremental
and strategic planning approach. Some ideas on how a phased and pragmatic approach may
be necessary for this process to take shape are identified in Section 0).


10.1      Identified weaknesses, through the service chain
The key starting point for presenting weaknesses in the existing services is the fecal waste
flow diagrams, as they identify the extent to which FS is managed (or not) through the current
sanitation service chains (sewered and non-sewered).

From these diagrams, “problems” or “weaknesses” in the process of managing wast ewater
and FS at the key stages in the chain can be highlighted (see following figures), pointing to
where interventions are needed to improve the status quo.

10.2      Proposed solutions, through the service chain
Taking the highlighted problems, it is possible to identify possible solutions to address them,
based on findings from the FSM study, results and discussions emerging from ongoing studies
within the city – such as the recommendations from the DWASA Dhaka Sewerage Master Plan
Project (March 2013), DWASA Low-Income Customer Service Improvement Plan (LICSIP,
May 2015), and the Dhaka Water and Sanitation Project (DWSSP) consultancy identifying
sewage collection and treatment options for Uttara and Mirpur (on-going).

These proposed solutions are grouped according to the types of containment / discharge
arrangements (system type), then consider possible interventions through the later stages of
the service chain.

At the level of analysis possible from the FSM study, the solutions are not identified on the
basis of specific locations within Dhaka, although they provide guidance on what needs to be
addressed within the city as a whole and for slums in general. This level of detail and analysis
requires further data sets and investigation, such as ongoing through the DWSSP consultancy.
These findings can offer guidance as to the types of interventions to be explored in more depth
as part of that and other work.

Table 29 on the following pages sets out possible technical interventions, whereas the sections
following the table consider interventions more related to the enabling environment. The
options in the table are not necessarily mutually exclusive and in presenting the “Where do we
want to get to?” they do not specify interim or staged approaches. These are discussed in the
following section. Some examples of where these kinds of options have been successful in
other cities around the world are also provided within the subsequent section.

10.3       The Service Delivery Context: priorities to address
The WSP desk study review of Dhaka city FSM, conducted as part of the Review of Fecal Sludge
Management in 12 Cities (Peal et al, 2013), placed Dhaka within the 3 city typologies as a Type 1
city: Poor FSM. For Type 1 cities, the WSP report states that investments in infrastructure would
be ineffective if carried out in isolation to addressing the broader enabling environment, due to the
absence of an overall FSM framework at the time of the study.

Based on analysis of broader findings from the FSM study, the following sections consider the key
areas of the Enabling Environment (as defined and grouped within the Service Delivery Analysis of
Enabling, Developing and Sustaining components) and identify priority actions to support any
infrastructure-focused investments in Dhaka. While drawing on the SDA results as presented in
Section 8 and Annex C, it also accounts for current studies and ongoing sectoral reforms taking
place in Dhaka, as well as good practice and relevant experience from elsewhere.

10.3.1 Enabling: policy, planning and budget

Policy: Ongoing policy revisions must give attention to the needs of all aspects of the FSM service
chain (particularly emptying, convenyance, treatment and disposal), not only access to containment
infrastructure. This will require significant investment of time and resources to achieve, but should
start with clear commitments from the lead agencies to an agenda for change and recognition of
FSM services as a key compo nent of Dhaka’s sanitation provision for the foreseeable future.
Establishing a separate strategy for FSM services is seen as a good starting point by a number of
stakeholders. It is currently a strategic component of the National Strategy for Water Supply and
Sanitation (2014), with a draft FSM framework in place for consultation.

Regulation: A strong set of regulatory laws, bylaws and enforcement procedures will be needed,
reflecting updated policy and strategy to ensure construction standards for containment
infrastructure and services along the FSM chain (emptying through the treatment / disposal) are
adhered to. This requires commitment from all key players, including the Ministry of Environment,
RAJUK, City Corporations, DWASA, service providers (formal and informal) and households – so
that each is aware of their duties, responsibilities and rights.

Institutional roles: there remains a significant absence of clearly understood roles assigned to
appropriately regulated and resourced institutions in relation to sanitation and FSM services. This
remains a key aspect in the ongoing process of developing and adopting a new FSM Institutional
Framework for Dhaka (discussed in more detail in the Prognosis for Change section), prior to
approval and adoption. In addition, mechanisms to support and encourage stronger inter-agency
cooperation, reporting and response will be essential for the FSM Institutional Framework to be
successfully implemented. This process may require – and be supported by – the establishment of
a designated and dedicated national agency addressing the range of on-plot sanitation, FSM
services and sewerage services, as in the case of ONAS and ONEA in Senegal and Burkina Faso
respectively. The FSM framework, in place for consultation, proposes a few organisations for these
purposes. At city level, it may be prudent to identify a single body to hold principal oversight and
accountability for the full sanitation service chain (incorporating sewerage and FSM services), with
appropriate actors (government, private sector or CSOs) delegated the responsibility to deliver
defined services along stages of the service chain where they have the greatest potential to deliver
effective, efficient and safe services. Amendments to the City Corporation Act (2009) and WASA Act
(1996) could then ensure that FSM services are more explicitly defined, using current terminology
and giving clarity to the agreed mandated roles of these principal actors.


                                                                                                   88

Service provision and planning: Service improvement plans at a city-wide level, as well as to
specifically identified (targeted) areas, must continue to thoroughly assess the feasibility of a range
of technical options (i.e. beyond the more typically constrained choice of septic tanks and soak pits,
or conventional sewerage), affecting all stages of the service chain. This can include options for
household container-based latrines, holding tanks or interceptor tanks for households, means of
reducing the BOD of effluent discharging from tanks, pumps for safer manual removal of FS from
pits and tanks, local treatment units for larger installations such as multi-occupancy high rise
dwellings or community-based facilities (e.g. anaerobic baffled reactors), non-conventional
sewerage networks (including small-bore sewers), transfer stations with/without on-site partial
treatment and so on. Those responsible for developing improvement plans need to identify a range
of cost-effective operation, maintenance and management arrangements that can be competently
managed at as local a level as is necessary and reasonable (i.e. the principle of subsidiarity). These
may include for example, responsibilities to arrange desludging of septic tanks for individual
households, or those shared within a compound, or for making repairs to tanks, connecting pipework
and valve chambers, and so on.

Such an approach requires incentives to encourage the uptake and running of effective services –
these could be linked to further business opportunities for those showing themselves to be
competent. Any such service arrangements must respond to current and expressed needs of those
to be served, in line with Developing components (next section). It should also be noted that without
improving on containment infrastructure, and so reducing the extremely high levels of connectivity
to drainage infrastructure, little else is likely to bring about significant change in the FSM service
chain.

Budget: Development of comprehensive FSM plans have to identify realistic budgetary requirements
that can inform the required level of public and external investment in infrastructure and services,
through the service chain. The ESI Toolkit is a good first step in this process.

10.3.2 Developing: equity and outputs

Equity Choice / reducing inequity: the city needs to identify a wider range of responsive, accessible
and affordable FS emptying and transportation options that can service existing and newly
developed household containment facilities. This process needs to bear in mind and develop variable
costs for variable service levels: so for example customers receiving on-site services are paying less
than those receiving sewered services (see under Cost Recovery for examples).

    -    The emptying services that people currently have access to – formal mechanised vacutug (in
         some areas), or informal manual emptiers – may benefit from a wider range of options.
         Enabling and encouraging a greater range that can overcome some of the limitations
         experienced by existing service providers (limited access and space in high-density areas,
         procedures involving direct contact with fresh fecal sludge, etc.), within a regulated service
         sector, is likely to increase competition and therefore promote greater customer-focus and
         cost-control amongst service providers. The service chain must respond to both current user
         demand, as well as the generally expressed willingness to pay more for responsive and
         reliable emptying services.51 To achieve this, services must be able to access some of the
         hardest to reach communities, be easy for households to contact and provide more flexible
         call-out and payment arrangements – all of which were identified as constraints during
         consultation with focus groups..



51 Peopleconsulted in focus groups stated a level of interest to pay more for improved sanitation and FS services, but
these comments were not made within a structured willingness-to-pay study.

                                                                                                                         89
Report of a FSM study in Dhaka, Bangladesh


    -    A range of technical options for alternative sewer arrangements (Small Bore and Settled
         Sewers) is proposed in the LICSIP and DWSSP reports. The proposal of a zero-fee
         connection is intended to encourage higher connection rates. However, more detailed
         assessment of the feasibility of each option in terms of cost-effective operation, maintenance
         and management arrangements must be thoroughly and critically explored to identify the
         most likely opportunity for functioning systems in a range of localities. At the same time, the
         DWSSP Uttara and Mirpur study (Interim Report, May 2015) must give greater attention to
         options for improving and servicing on-site sanitation systems.

Outputs Quantity / capacity: The SFDs presented earlier show that even if households have
emptiable latrines, emptying does not achieve safe disposal of FS. It has also been identified that
demand for emptying from the current formal providers is not achieving a self-sustaining business
opportunity and may even be declining.

    -    Where facilities are connected to the existing or future conventional sewer network,
         attention must be given to ensuring continued functionality of sewers, for example through
         quick action taken to address reported blockages, sewer collapse and failures in pump
         stations. LICSIP introduces the implementation of penalties for customers refusing to connect
         to sewers, once they become available in an area. However, only where sewer functionality
         is maintained can cross-connections being made to drains be expected to stop, or
         environmental standards and a “polluter pays” principle be enforced to any level of success.

    -    Where facilities are to be connected to new non-conventional sewer arrangements , it
         will be essential that the roles and responsibilities of the various actors are clearly defined
         (the draft FSM framework entrusts this responsibility to the city corporations) and resourced.
         Areas needing specific attention will include: arrangements for operation and maintenance
         of settling (septic/ interceptor) tanks and service lines within properties, plus arrangements
         for emptying tanks (LICSIP includes options for scheduled emptying arrangements by D-
         WASA to improve functionality); or responsibility for repairing manholes at the point where
         the service line and small bore line connect needs to be clearly defined. An effective
         scheduled emptying service, funded by costs levied onto water bills, could significantly
         improve response times for pit/tank emptying. A range of emptying services would then need
         to be available, to match the level of access to facilities for road-based emptiers.

    -    For those households that will continue to use on-site systems, emptying and
         transportation service providers (formal and informal) will need to have the means and
         support to gain access to other convenient, flexible and safe emptying equipment,
         transporting fecal sludge to managed disposal locations where they can discharge sludge for
         safe disposal or treatment. As identified in the LICSIP study, the use of effectively managed
         transfer stations and decentralised treatment facilities at strategic locations within the city
         could support this.

    -    Where septic tanks / pits are currently discharging into drains , the de-connection of
         such arrangements is seen as a crucial issue. Mechanisms to effectively achieve this will
         require, for example; public awareness campaigns and consultation, enforcement of the
         regulations and imposing fines, technical interventions at household level to improve the
         construction quality and accessibility of containment facilities, helping households to identify
         and make use of emptying service providers. Such actions are crucial to protecting those
         most at risk from contaminated drainage water in low-lying and flood-prone areas. In reality,
         an incremental approach to addressing this difficult issue will be required, as considered
         further at the end of this Section10.5.

Report of a FSM study in Dhaka, Bangladesh


Outputs Quality and reporting: The faecal waste flow diagrams and proposed technical interventions
outlined in Table 29 show that the greatest complexity in the service chain presently occurs at the
containment and emptying stages. Current practices of handling fecal sludge introduce significant
risk to the public and wider environment through a lack of facilities to contain fecal waste, combined
with unregulated and unsafe disposal practices. The study has highlighted the huge and city-wide
scale of the problem and a range of interventions will need to be matched carefully to current
practices, as well as opportunities and constraints that exist in different locations within the city. The
following comments support the technical recommendations identified as Potential Solutions in the
earlier Table.

    -    Considering existing infrastructure and services: 21% of households city-wide and 71% of
         households in slum areas have a non-emptiable arrangement (e.g. toilet empties straight into
         a drain). In such cases, the toilet would need converting to include some form of emptiable
         containment or to connect to sewer arrangement. Meanwhile 84% of households in cities and
         65% of households in slum areas with emptiable pits/tanks have not had them emptied, as
         they discharge into drains or elsewhere. In these cases, stronger enforcement is needed to
         ensure these households take steps to convert existing pits/tanks into holding tanks as a step
         towards complying with the law, as well as increasing availability of emptying / transport
         services, so that they can physically connect into a viable and functioning service chain.
    -    New infrastructure provision must enable better containment of fecal sludge, either through
         correctly constructed on-site sub-structures (septic tanks or pits) with access for emptying
         built-in, and/or correctly constructed connections to effectively managed off-site networks.

Only when a minority of households practice informal or illegal practices can meaningful reporting
occur in relation to poor construction practices, or illegal discharges resulting from poor servicing of
on-site facilities and poor maintenance off-site facilities. Currently the majority follow this practice.

10.3.3 Sustaining: O&M, expansion and service outcomes

Cost recovery and standards: Cost recovery mechanisms will need to address all stages of the
service chain – considering costs affecting households, service providers and financial transfers from
other sectors. An approach is successfully being implemented in Hai Phong, Vietnam where
households connected to the sewer are charged a fee for wastewater services, while households
who are not connected to the sewer are charged a lower ‘environmental fee’. In Maputo,
Mozambique a similar arrangement is applied for solid waste services. The draft FSM framework for
Dhaka proposes a sanitation tax to cover costs associated with collection, treatment and disposal of
FS.

    -    Any development of service standards must be informed by an assessment of what can be
         realistically achieved (as opposed to what may ultimately be required over time to achieve
         levels of “good practice” or nationally recognised service level standards) within a given
         timeframe and under a range of contextualised constraints, incrementally working towards
         improved standards over time and as service levels improve and infrastructure becomes
         available. Minimum standards can be set that ensure basic protection of public health and
         critical services (such as water supplies).

    -    A willingness-to-pay survey was not a component of this study and it is not clear that a WTP
         survey has been conducted as part of current studies looking at identifying options within
         Low-Income Communities in general, or target areas in particular. WTP information is most
         useful and reliable in the context of clearly-defined service options, which do not yet exist in
         Dhaka – so would be a valuable component of prior to committing to specific service
         investment plans and programmes.

                                                                                                       91
Report of a FSM study in Dhaka, Bangladesh


Key to this process will be a review of the tariff structures for water supply and sewerage currently
in operation in Dhaka. Many stakeholders note that the heavily subsidised sewerage charges leave
little financial ‘space’ within which to set lower, appropriate tariffs for FSM services. The ongoing
review of tariffs by the Water Supply and Sanitation Regulatory Commission is seen as a critical
component.

Demand and sector development: As plans for service enhancement are developed, it is important
to engage civil society, households, landlords and informal service providers, in ways to stimulate
demand for improved FSM services. This could help to generate interest and commitment to carrying
out duties to improve the service chain, where each actor has most influence and the most to benefit.

Customer demand for improved services remains latent while proper containment is almost non-
existent and access to service options is so highly constrained. This report identifies key
determinants affecting household demand – including limited access for service providers, low
percentages of pits/tanks that ever fill up (and long filling times where they do fill), lack of awareness
of services and affordability of those services. These findings could be used to undertake carefully-
designed formative research to identify the motivators and messages for a behaviour change
communication and promotion campaign to stimulate willingness to pay for improved infrastructure
and services. Such a campaign should be undertaken alongside changes in legislation, enforcement
of building standards for correctly-constructed containment facilities (septic tanks and pits) and the
availability of FSM services.

    -    Focus group discussions with residents of slum areas highlight a general willingness from
         households to contribute towards more effective and responsive emptying services. This
         willingness is however significantly constrained by households’ lack of access to formal
         financial services (especially to help with large one-off payments such as mechanised
         emptying), or if as tenants they have little influence over services installed and managed by
         landlords. Consideration should be given to how, for example, existing savings and loans
         schemes supporting water and sanitation improvements, or tenancy agreements stating
         minimum service standards tenants can and should expect from landlords, could support
         households and informal service providers to improve containment, emptying and
         conveyance stages of the service chain – to reduce unregulated and unsafe practices.

    -    As service improvement plans are considered, discussed and developed, representatives of
         landlords, service providers and residents need to be brought into this process.


10.4       Resulting hierarchy of interventions
    1. Conveyance, treatment, end-use: Issues formalising transport, treatment and end-use stages
       of the service chain (the downstream stages) need to be addressed, in parallel with
       addressing the containment and emptying stages, so that FS can be received and managed
       when upstream arrangements are improved. Effective business models need to be identified,
       which ongoing studies WSUP may be in a good position to help identify.

    2. Containment: The number of existing sanitation systems that discharge directly or indirectly
       to drains needs to be reduced – particularly where this has a direct impact on public health
       through overflowing drains in low-lying areas. This requires a systematic and progressive
       process of disconnecting existing systems from the drains as alternative ‘outlets’ are
       introduced. These alternatives may include, for example: conventional sewers where these
       are extended (particularly for servicing public / communal toilet blocks), interceptor tanks
       discharging to small-bore-sewers; holding tanks frequently serviced by small mechanised
       emptying trucks; pits serviced by improved (safe) manual emptying using a devise such as


                                                                                                       92
Report of a FSM study in Dhaka, Bangladesh


           the Gulper. Newly-constructed buildings should not be permitted to discharge fecal materials
           directly to drains. The aim should be to focus on achieving properly constructed containment,
           and to ensure that sanitation facilities are systematically serviced by the most appropriate
           technical option(s).

    3. Emptying: Entrepreneurs and NGOs require encouragement to offer a range of affordable
       mechanical or improved manual emptying services, and to be able to respond quickly,
       especially for shared sanitation facilities and for the urban poor. Licencing, service
       agreements and contracts issued by the regulating agency could help service providers to
       invest in equipment and business operations, as well as improving the regulation of service
       standards. The WSUP study into business models may a helpful starting point, to further
       explore suitable arrangements to achieve appropriate service standards.

The experience from Dakar, Senegal of the Market Structuring of FSM Program (PSMBV) would be
worth exploring further. This programme identifies institutional structures, customer-based services,
private sector incentives and regulation, as well as technical innovation and development through
the full FSM service chain.52

Any improvements to sanitation services should also seek to achieve the following overarching aims:

    -      ensure the needs of vulnerable family members (including elderly and disabled people,
           pregnant women, and small children) are considered in the provision of facilities and services;
           and

    -      adopt an integrated response to addressing sanitation, solid waste, and drainage
           infrastructure and services. Only in this way can equitable, functional and sustainable
           services be delivered.

Adopting a phased and pragmatic approach

Given the extent of the lack of effective and safe sanitation services, a pragmatic approach is needed
for Dhaka. Only in this way will all customers be eventually able to access services in some way or
other, informed by the range of customer types and supported by a broad range of service level
options appropriate to different income levels.

As part of this approach, it will be important to identify key time-bound stages that can respond to
the “How are we going to get there?” question, within a strategic planning process. It would be helpful
to identify milestones for phases of incremental improvements in all FSM and sewerage services,
within the current planning timeframe of 2015-2035. Objectives can be set for each phase, with
specific indicators and activities identified to support those objectives – including minimum standards
to protect public and environmental health. For this process to work, decision-points will be needed
to identify where in the city and at what phase services will aim to be predominantly i) FSM services
for on-site sanitation, ii) a mixture of conventional sewerage and non-conventional piped networks
with supporting services, or iii) conventional piped sewerage networks.

If the intention is to incrementally connect customers to effective and safely managed sewerage
services, this may require the adoption of certain non-standard approaches, that are gradually
addressed and overcome with time. For example, in low income communities in particular, but also
in other parts of the city as and when appropriate, this may mean prioritising investments in improving
household, communal and public containment facilities (various forms of tanks have been mentioned

previously) while developing a series of transfer stations for FS handling and decentralised treatment
sites (STPs and FSTPs).

As options for piped networks (predominantly non-conventional for LICs) are identified, planned and
implemented, it may be necessary to allow the improved tanks to continue to discharge effluent into
the drains (open surface and deep stormwater drains), without prosecution, until a piped network
(conventional or non-conventional) is available and functioning for the users to connect into. This
could be by way of offering a “grace period” to customers, before which penalties will not be applied
providing the containment facilities are correctly operated and maintained (i.e. regularly desludged),
and with clear guidance about the conditions under which penalties would be imposed once sewer
connections become feasible. In the interim, households discharging to stormwater drains could be
charged on the basis of using the drains as a form of combined sewer. Basic treatment would need
to be provided at the drain outlets (primary screening and management of the discharge points as a
minimum) to reduce impacts on the environment and public health risks. Special attention would be
important to those drains most at risk of discharging into living environments, especially in low-lying
areas. This sort of approach, though unconventional and requiring careful management to ensure
transitioning as soon as feasible, would allow the development of sewered networks to be planned
in line with changes to urban settlements, as the city develops and sewers can be introduced
throughout the city, or new forms of sanitation are identified.


10.5       Feasibility of these options in the context of the Prognosis for
           Change
As set out above, these intervention options were developed with a solid understanding of the PFC
(section 9). Therefore, they are all deemed feasible, if carried out in an appropriate sequence with
the engagement of the right stakeholders. Nonetheless, it is worth specifically highlighting what will
be the key factor requiring special consideration in the context of the PFC, particularly the
stakeholder analysis. That factor is enforcement of laws and regulations, particularly at the
containment stage of the chain.

There are three key aspects of this: (i) ensuring existing emptiable systems are disconnected from
drains (or replaced with an appropriate sewered option), (ii) ensuring existing non-emptiable systems
are upgraded, (iii) ensuring newly constructed buildings have an appropriate system. Each of these
is a slightly different problem, but all have one thing in common. There is currently little incentive for
the household or property developer concerned to act. This is because the externality is public and
dispersed, while addressing the problem would involve the stakeholder incurring private costs
themselves.

Therefore, it is crucial that interventions aimed at converting existing containment infrastructure, or
ensuring developers don’t break the law, are planned in the context of this incentive problem. Public
education will not be enough. There must be a credible threat of penalties, through publicising of
fines imposed on households and developers. It would be worth studying other sectors in Dhaka
which have successfully enforced the law in this way and, if there are no examples, looking further
afield, including to other countries.

11         Economic analysis of intervention options
The costing is based on secondary data. All costs and benefits are given at the HH level, since the
secondary data was not suitable for extrapolating total costs and benefits for Uttara and Mirpur as
a whole. Results should therefore be treated with caution.


11.1       Introduction
Economic analysis compares interventions on the basis of how much they cost and what benefits
they bring. This chapter presents a cost analysis of possible sanitation intervention options for the
slums of Uttara and Mirpur and a partial damage costing. The analysis spans the sanitation chain
and is broken down by cost component allowing a detailed view of where costs are incurred and
their significance in generating value for money.

Two key pieces of information are required to conduct this analysis. Firstly, an estimate of the
damage cost which monetises the negative consequences of poor sanitation i.e. the cost of doing
nothing. Secondly, an estimate of the costs of the proposed intervention is required. This second
component requires that there is a clear intervention designed for a well-defined population and
that the components of that intervention can be costed.


11.2       Methodology
Four hypothetical intervention options were tested; three non-conventional sewer models drawn
from the Low-Incomes Customers’ Service Improvement Plan (LICSIP) (DWASA 2015); and one
postulating a hypothetical situation for full fecal sludge management based on secondary cost
data drawn predominantly from an unpublished 2012 study (Mikhael (2012)). The damage cost
analysis is based on the survey data collected as part of this study, covering the health and time
cost impacts associated with diarrhoeal disease. There were insufficient data to model other
negative impacts associated with poor sanitation included in the damage cost module of the ESI
Toolkit (e.g. water resources, broader environmental impact, tourism etc.).

These intervention options are hypothetical and do not necessarily reflect what may be technically
feasible. The main objective is to illustrate the types of costs which might be incurred for different
interventions. The aim on the benefits side is a secondary one, and compares the benefits of the
hypothetical interventions leading to calculation of the net present value.

In each case, the sanitation chain was modelled for the whole population of Uttara and Mirpur. In
other words, for each of the three scenarios it is assumed that the whole population moves from
whatever they are currently using to a single homogenous sanitation option along the whole chain,
although in reality this is unlikely to happen


11.3       Sources and analysis of data
Data on intervention costs was collected from published and unpublished studies on the costs of
different sanitation technologies in different contexts. Where possible data was used that pertains
to Dhaka, where this was not possible this was expanded to include data available from other
urban areas of Bangladesh, and if not available, then other South and South East Asian cities. All
cost data were derived from secondary sources, and these are quite limited given the relatively low
number of comparable FSM systems (cf sewerage systems). The cost data available were often
lump sum costs and had to be converted into per capita costs. These secondary costs come in a
variety of units. First the costs are adjusted for inflation and all converted to Taka. Beyond that the

                                                                                                     95
Report of a FSM study in Dhaka, Bangladesh


unit has to be adjusted before it can be applied to a population. All cost data were converted into a
per capita figure. For onsite technologies this is done based on the number of HHs that would use
that latrine. The logic behind this is that sharing latrines is widespread and the cost per capita is
largely driven by the extent of sharing. The survey conducted for the slum sample indicates that
78% of households share a latrine with 1 or more other households. On average, 7 households
share one latrine and given an average household size of 4.8, of those who share toilets the
average is 34 people sharing one latrine. In all models it is assumed that all HHs move to having a
private onsite facility, which represents a considerable and unrealistic change from the existing
situation especially given space constraints. Hence this analysis is illustrative only.

Per capita costs for the other parts of the sanitation chain (extraction and conveyance, treatment
and disposal and reuse) are estimated on a volumetric basis and as such are less sensitive to
assumptions surrounding sharing. The logic behind this is that the volume of fecal waste that any
system would need to deal with does not vary with the level of sharing; although the frequency of
extraction and conveyance will increase if many people are sharing a small facility. As such, the
costs associated with treatment and disposal and reuse are sensitive to assumptions surrounding
the volume of fecal matter produced per capita.

There is a danger in applying limited secondary data to hypothetical models. Firstly, the original
cost figure is rooted in the context from which it came; which is not necessarily the same as the
context in which they are being applied. In selecting the input data the costs most relevant to the
hypothetical situations were selected. The hypothetical options described also highlight the
situations in which the intervention would be suitable and the key assumptions used in calculating
the costs. The second major challenge is that it is not immediately apparent how the costs are
calculated in the secondary sources. If any given cost figure does not include the full costs of
delivering that part of the sanitation chain it will be underestimated relative to more complete
costings.


11.4       Summary of the three hypothetical intervention options
Four models were considered; the data sources for these and a brief summary of the proposed
models follows.

    i)        Full coverage of non-conventional sewerage I: small bore sewers connected to sewer
              lines (SBSs).

                       Onsite facility and   Extraction and       Treatment          Disposal and
                            collection        conveyance                                Reuse

 Technology               Flush to sewer          SBS          Additional WWTP           None
                                                                   capacity

Small bore sewers are small diameter pipes which rely on gravity to transport the waste directly
from the latrine into the conventional sewer system. They rely on a minimum of 50 lpcd of
greywater to move the blackwater through the system. This implies that all households convert to a
private ‘flush to sewer’ latrine from whatever they are using now (known from survey data), and the
sewers lead to WWTPs. The additional capacity required is built into the DWASA cost data. The
LICSIP report states that SBS are a good option for areas where there is a low risk of eviction, are


                                                                                                     96

within 600 metres of a planned or existing DWASA sewer, and where there are few existing
operational septic tanks.

It should be noted that a SBS sewer system was installed in Mirpur in 1991 under the Dhaka Urban
Infrastructure Improvement Project (DUIIP); the system was not effectively commissioned and
subsequently failed. The reasons for the system’s failure include:

    i)        The institutional responsibilities were not defined for the various activities required to
              assure operations and maintenance.
    ii)       Lack of maintenance of the sewer system and de-sludging of the interceptor tanks may
              have led to early failure of the system.
    iii)      Only 50-60% of the original appraised pipe connections to interceptor/septic tanks were
              installed by the DUIIP. Un-served houses were probably never connected to the sewer
              pipes in order to minimise expenditure.
    iv)       The SBS system was developed for low income areas with single storey houses and
              one toilet per family. Presently most of the low income areas have developed to middle
              income areas with fully developed multi-storey buildings. The SBS system was
              reportedly not designed to serve the increased number of people and it is likely that
              parts of it have been destroyed during later development. The sizing of the pipes and
              interceptor tanks cannot meet the current needs in the middle income areas.
    v)        Community participation is a critical factor to ensure proper O&M of the facilities and
              ultimate delivery of services. Periodic cleaning of the interceptor tanks is the
              responsibility of the owners. However there are no septic tank sludge management
              facilities available in Dhaka and there is limited incentive for sludge tank emptying. The
              awareness of periodic interceptor tank de-sludging has not developed, as most of the
              tanks are not in use and are currently filled with garbage.

Consequently the DWASA Master Plan recommends that the SBS systems are not suitable for
areas in which there is high population growth, areas where there is a high risk of population
overspill from a growing area, and areas where it is anticipated that many multi story buildings will
be constructed over the lifespan of the system. The LICSIP estimates that SBSs may be suitable
for 30% of low income households.

    ii)       Full coverage of non-conventional sewerage II: small bore sewers connected to
              Anaerobic Baffled Reactors (SBS ABR).

                       Onsite facility and   Extraction and         Treatment           Disposal and
                            collection        conveyance                                   Reuse

 Technology               Flush to sewer       SBS ABR           Additional WWTP            None
                                                                     capacity

 of data




ABRs are a form of decentralised waste water treatment that remove solids at points throughout
the network, the effluent flowing from the ABRs is largely solid free but high in pathogens and flows
on into the main network through SBSs. This route down the chain implies that all households
convert to a private flush to sewer latrine from whatever they are using now (known from survey
data), and those SBS lines lead to the ABRs which in turn are connected to the main sewer lines
via SBSs.

In the LICSIP SBSs with ABRs are taken to be a suitable option for communities that are farther
than 600 metres from a planned or existing DWASA sewer line and have suitable space for the

                                                                                                       97

ABR. This option is subject to some of the same vulnerabilities as the SBSs. The lessons and
conditions applying to the SBSs implementation in Mirpur in 1991 also apply here. The LICSIP
estimates that SBSs connected to ABRs may be suitable for 30% of low income communities.

    iii)      Pour flush latrines connected to Septic tanks and Settled Sewers

                       Onsite facility and             Extraction and                Treatment        Disposal and
                            collection                  conveyance                                       Reuse

This option proposes that grey and blackwater are mixed at the HH level and flow into a septic tank
connected to a settled sewer itself flowing to a conventional sewerage. The septic tanks require
desludging; this is to be done by mechanical emptying. The sludge is taken directly to a sewage
treatment plant or to a sewage treatment plant via a transfer station.

For this option there must be sufficient space to construct the septic tanks and communities should
have a low risk of eviction. This LICSIP states that this option is suited to areas where there are
already a number of existing septic tanks. Settled sewers also require less greywater than SBSs
and as such this option may be more suitable to areas where the greywater per person per day is
below 50 Litres. The LICSIP estimates this option may be suitable for 40% of low income
communities.

    iv)       Fecal sludge management technologies

                            Onsite facility and               Extraction and            Treatment     Disposal and
                                collection                      conveyance                               Reuse

 Technology            Flush to an accessible lined        Small vehicle transport        Sludge         None
                         pit, septic tank or similar         direct to treatment        drying beds

 Main sources                  Hutton (2012)                  Mikhael (2012)              Mikhael          -
 of data                                                                                   (2012)




This option assumes that all HHs move to having some form of safe containment facility wherefrom
the sludge is conveyed either by a small vehicle directly to treatment or via transfer stations.
Treatment in this case is sludge drying beds. In all of the cases it is assumed that all Households
(HHs) move to having an individual private connection. Again, it is not completely clear from the
source data which costs are included and which are not.

This option is suitable for where there is adequate space for the sludge drying beds; the closer
drying beds are located to the communities which they would serve the more efficient the system
becomes by reducing journey time. This cost study assumes that the drying bed would be located
11 kilometres from the community served. A second important option for this intervention is that the
small vehicle used in the extraction and conveyance of the fecal matter can reach the latrines as
proposed in a recent study of Ward 2 and 11 of Mirpur. In Ward 2 12% of households are
considered to be in areas where fecal sludge management is the only option (i.e. these areas are


                                                                                                                     98
Report of a FSM study in Dhaka, Bangladesh


unsuitable for simplified sewage). In Ward 11 7% of HHs are in areas that must be served by fecal
sludge management technologies (Mikhael 2012)

As discussed below, all three of these would be quite extreme changes in the context of current
levels of private latrine ownership, septic tank use and sharing of latrines by multiple households.


11.5       Design populations
Table 30 presents the total populations in Uttara and Mirpur. The figures presented in the
technology cost analysis are based on the 2015 design population.

The second key piece of information in determining the design populations for any given
intervention is the starting sanitation situation. This is assumed to have two key dimensions
relevant to this analysis; the type of latrine/ catchment and the blackwater disposal method. The
survey data for the slum sample under this study (sub-sample B) provides the basis for this
assessment as it is representative of slums in Dhaka and consequently the slums of Uttara and
Mirpur. In addition, 20 of the 30 sampling units were in Uttara and Mirpur.

 Where HHs already possess part of the proposed technology a proportion of the total secondary
 cost was excluded. These is only done for the HHs facility not the other parts of the sanitation
 chain as the rest of the sanitation chain is taken to be largely absent based on the slum SFD done
 as part of this research.


 11.6       Technology cost analysis
 Figure 13 presents the total annualized costs for the three routes through the sanitation chain
 which are proposed in the LICSIUP report. Annex E contains a table summarising the data
 underscoring these calculations. Overall the SBS ABR option has the lowest overall cost per HH.
 The FSM option is the cheapest with regard to treatment and the most expensive with regards to
 onsite facilities (i.e. containment). This is largely driven by the high conveyance costs associated
 with the FSM option, this is discussed more below.

 The graphs presented below use abbreviations for the different options; Table 32 is a key to these.

      costs associated with the FSM conveyance option (vacutugs). These compare unfavourably with
      the costs given in the LICSIP for SBS and SBS ABR recurrent and capital maintenance costs. The
      high recurrent costs for the FSM option are based on a study by WaterAid (WaterAid 2011) which
      contains a detailed and comprehensive breakdown of costs including personnel. The basis for
      recurrent costs included in the LICSIP are less clear and may pertain only to infrastructure,
      meaning this is not a like-for-like comparison of costs. The other key driver of the FSM costs are
      the capital costs of infrastructure.

      The FSM costs for capital expenditure compare unfavourably to those in the LICSIP options; this is
      likely driven by the source data in this case. As with all four of the option presented recurrent costs
      are highest in the extraction and conveyance part of the chain. The treatment costs associated with
      the sludge drying beds compare favourably to the conventional options considered in the LICSIP.

      Unlike the other non-conventional sewerage options the costs of treatment for the small bore
      sewers connected to the conventional sewer network are high. Comparing the SBS option with
      SBS combined with ABRs the overall cost of treatment is considerably lower for SBS with ABRs,
      though this is counterbalanced by the high extraction and conveyance costs associated with the
      SBS ABR option. Of all the options the SBS option has the lowest onsite and extraction and
      conveyance capital costs.

The treatment costs associated with the SBS ABR option are roughly half of those of the other
simplified sewage options. However the extraction and conveyance costs are the highest of all
three. This is driven primarily by the high recurrent costs associated with the use of the ABRs.

Of all the simplified sewage options the septic tank connected to settled sewer is the most
expensive by a small margin. The single largest set of costs are those associated with treatment
infrastructure capital expenditure. The annualized costs of extraction and conveyance and the
onsite technology compare favourably to the other simplified sewage options and the FSM option.

Relative to the technology cost analysis in Mikhael (2012) the costs of FSM conveyance compared
to sewage are high; this is partially as the options it is being compared to are non-conventional and
low-cost sewage options. This may be because the costing in the LICSIP report only applies to the
areas where the option is suitable. In Mirpur it is estimated that simplified sewage is unsuitable for
12% of the population in Ward 2 and 7% Ward 11.

Though these hypothetical routes down the sanitation chain have been applied to the whole
population it is more appropriate to interpret the costs as unit costs for a HH where the technology
is applicable, and as such not to treat them as costing which could apply to the whole population.


11.7       Damage costs and cost effectiveness analysis
As mentioned in the introduction the damage costing here is based only on the impacts from
diarrhoea (premature death, morbidity, and productivity loss). This was based on household survey
data for Dhaka’s slums, including questions on self-reported diarrhoeal episodes. The premature
mortality estimate is based on national level figures on the probability of dying.

The Barkat et. al. (2012) analysis of the economic impacts of poor sanitation in Bangladesh
estimates that poor sanitation costs 6.3% of GDP nationwide. In the 2012 analysis premature
death attributable to diarrhoea accounted for a total of 37% of the economic costs of poor
sanitation; which is equivalent to 2.33% of GDP.

Table 34 present data on the cost of avoiding mortality and morbidity. These figures assume that
half of the cases of diarrhoea are avoided through the interventions. There is an emerging
consensus that if the cost per DALY averted is less than three times annual GDP per capita it may
be considered cost effective and any intervention that costs less that annual GDP per capita are
highly cost effective.

Under this definition all four of the interventions are classified as cost effective. The cost per DALY
is between 1.9 times GDP per capita (FSM) and 1.73 times GDP per capita (SBS). The
interventions fall out of this cost effectiveness bracket if they mitigate less than 29-32% of the
damage costs and become highly cost-effective if they mitigate over 90-96% of the damage costs.


11.8       Conclusions and implications for FSM in Dhaka
Overall, the value of the analysis is in drawing together the costs data relevant to Dhaka in a
comparable form using standardized units. Drawing only on secondary data is also the primary
limitation of this analysis as the costs presented in the literature are described using a wide variety
of terminology and calculation methods. Hence, there is a risk that the comparison of costs using
data from different sources is inaccurate at best, or invalid at worst. Due to these limitations it is
difficult to develop any implications for FSM in Dhaka; primary data collection and data from
operational services is required before the technology costing can be taken to be reflective of the
costs of implementing different sanitation interventions.

12         Conclusion
This report has outlined the main findings of a case study on faecal sludge management in Dhaka,
Bangladesh. This section concludes summarising the key points of each aspect of the analysis. It
ends with recommended intervention options, as well as implications of the ‘prognosis for change’.

Fecal waste flow diagrams (SFDs) were constructed based on a household survey and secondary
data, one for the a city-wide situation and one for a slum-specific view. The analysis makes it clear
that in both cases, almost all fecal sludge ends up in the drains or environment one way or another.
Only 10% of households city-wide have experiencing a pit filling up.

Analysis of demand and supply for FSM services finds that demand is very low and supply is
weak. That is not surprising in the context of the SFD, and particularly the household survey finding
that only 13% of households city-wide who had a toilet with a pit or septic tank had ever experienced
it filling up. The drains are effectively running as sewers. Various other facts affecting demand for
FSM services (type of building, accessibility of facility, fill rate and the extent of sharing) are also
considered. On the supply side, there are very few mechanical emptiers in operation. The bulk of
service provision, when demanded, is carried out by manual emptiers. Of those households who had
emptied a pit tank city-wide, 97% had used a manual emptier last time. This is also reflected in
reported intentions next time the pit or tank filled up.

Findings from the transect walks emphasise that all of Dhaka is affected by poor FSM – it is not
only a problem for slum-dwellers. Latrines empty into drains throughout the city, and drains run
through all areas – slums and non-slums. Having large amounts of FS in the drains and environment
is an externality which affects everyone in Dhaka. Therefore, poor FSM is not only a private
household matter – it is a public health and environmental hazard.

The Service Delivery Assessment shows that there is a severe shortage of public policy, capital
investment and operational oversight of FSM services throughout Dhaka. This allows the current
practice of latrines emptying into drains, in place of safe emptying practices, to continue. This in turn
removes many of the efforts and financial costs required to achieve effective construction,
management and maintenance of appropriate infrastructure. The result is significant challenges for
finding solutions, which will only come about when an FSM Framework translates into clearly
defined, capacitated and financed action. The overall aim of the Framework and actions must
therefore be to provide a fully-functioning service chain for all of Dhaka’s fecal waste flows. This
requires recognition of the scale of the problem, dialogue and engagement of public, private and civil
society bodies to ensure appropriate infrastructure and services can be systematically developed
and adapted to respond to the various contextual challenges of the city (space, tenancy, flooding,
poverty, etc.).

All of this suggests that bringing change to fecal sludge management practices in Dhaka will demand
significant reform of the regulatory systems that currently govern all stages of the service chain. In
the context of the general failure of existing regulatory systems, clearly segregating the roles for
regulation of failure by central government, from that of licensing of compliance by local
governments, from that of service management by providers, may improve the incentives for overall
compliance and investment.

Economic analysis of four hypothetical intervention options was undertaken, three of which are
non-conventional sewer models and one of which was full fecal sludge management. This aimed to
illustrate the types of costs which might be incurred for different interventions. In each case, the
sanitation chain was modelled for the whole population of Uttara and Mirpur, where an intervention
financed by the World Bank is to take place. Since the analysis is hypothetical, its value is in drawing

together the costs data relevant to Dhaka in a comparable form using standardized units. There is a
risk that the comparison of costs using data from different sources is inaccurate at best, or invalid at
worst. Due to these limitations it is difficult to develop any implications for FSM in Dhaka; primary
data collection and data from operational services is required before the technology costing can be
taken to be reflective of the costs of implementing different sanitation interventions.

A ‘Prognosis for Change’ assessment surmises that the externalities of poor FSM are both public
and dispersed, whereas addressing the lack of proper containment would involve private costs (from
households and property developers). A credible threat of enforcement, which would raise the cost
of inaction on the part of these stakeholders, is therefore critical. Proper containment will require the
enforcement of ensuring existing emptiable systems (pit/tank) are disconnected from drains, that
existing non-emptiable systems are upgraded, and that newly-constructed buildings have an
appropriate containment system. Change is achievable on this front, but interventions will not be
successful unless they address the incentives which deliver the current outcome, which is the drains
running as sewers.

Recommended intervention options from the study are identified, grouped according to the key
stages of the sanitation service chain. These relate to the following areas, and are discussed in detail
in section 10.

     Formalised and operational transport, treatment and end-use stages of the fecal sludge service
      chain need to be identified and put in place, enabling fecal sludge to be safely received, treated
      and managed as upstream arrangements are improved. Effective business and financial
      models will be needed for each stage.

     Systematic and progressive steps to improve existing containment infrastructure must include
      disconnecting latrine outlets from drains as alternative ‘outlets’ are introduced. Newly -
      constructed buildings should not be permitted to discharge fecal materials to drains. For on-site
      systems, the aim must be to introduce correctly built containment that enables systematic and
      safe emptying services to function.

     A range of affordable mechanical, or improved manual, emptying services are needed that can
      respond quickly to demand, especially for shared sanitation facilities and for the urban poor.
      Licencing, service agreements and contracts can help service providers to invest in improved
      business operations, as well as improve regulation to achieve service standards.

The main implication of the study’s findings for FSM in Dhaka are that it is crucial to maintain
momentum on the emerging reform agenda. Progress could easily stall if opposing forces emerge
to try and block it, or if DCC and DWASA drop it due to lack of priority. While the status quo suits
almost everybody, there are also many stakeholders who would gain from reform as well. Influential
stakeholders who risk losses are households and property developers, so special care must be taken
to try and win them over.

The intervention options proposed were developed based on the prognosis for change (PFC).
Therefore, they are all deemed feasible, if carried out in an appropriate sequence with the
engagement of the right stakeholders. However, there are some factors which will require special
consideration in light of the PFC, particularly the stakeholder analysis. That factor is enforcement of
laws and regulations, particularly at the containment stage of the chain.

There are three key aspects of this: (i) ensuring existing emptiable systems are disconnected from
drains (or replaced with an appropriate sewered option), (ii) ensuring existing non-emptiable systems
are upgraded, (iii) ensuring newly constructed buildings have an appropriate system. Each of these
is a slightly different problem, but all have one thing in common. There is currently little incentive for

                                                                                                       106

the household or property developer concerned to act. This is because the externality is public and
dispersed, while addressing the problem would involve the stakeholder incurring private costs
themselves.

Therefore, it is crucial that interventions aimed at converting existing containment infrastructure, or
ensuring developers don’t break the law, are planned in the context of this incentive problem. Public
education will not be enough. There must be a credible threat of penalties, through publicising of
fines imposed on households and developers. It would be worth studying other sectors in Dhaka
which have successfully enforced the law in this way and, if there are no examples, looking further
afield in Bangladesh or to other countries..

Annex B                       Faecal Waste Flow matrices

This section contains the raw data which goes into producing the SFDs. As an example, in the city-
wide matrix in Figure 19 below, 21% of households in Dhaka use an OSS latrine which empties
straight to a drain without any intermediate containment. A further 54% use an OSS latrine which in
theory empties to a septic tank or pit which contains FS, but in reality the vast majority of these
pits/tanks (84%) are also connected to drains. Therefore, FS is only partially contained and
eventually, as the chamber becomes full, it will flow through to the drain any intermediate storage.
As a consequence, only 8% of households’ FS is actually emptied (54% * 16% = 8%).

Annex D                Public health risk assessment: scoring used

Observations: To standardise this process, a number of pre-set questions are answered by the
observer at each stage of the process, with the observer selecting the most appropriate response
from a pre-selected list (including Other and Don’t Know options) in each case. Each set of
responses is ranged to indicate a High / Medium and Low risk activity, with a score allocated to each
response High risk = 3, Medium risk = 2, Low risk = 1. Other or Don’t know responses had to be
considered separately and an appropriate score allocated depending on additional information
provided (photographs, notes, etc.).

    - For example, one transport stage question was “During the transport of faecal sludge, does
        sludge spill into the surrounding environment?” Response categories were: Sludge spillage
        occurs along the route at various times (scores 3 = High risk); Slight sludge spillage occurs
        at specific times, e.g. going down slopes or over rough ground (scores 2 = Medium risk); No
        spillage occurs – equipment contains all of the sludge during transport (scores 1 = Low risk).

Tables showing the full set of observation questions and the rating values of responses are available
from the links in Error! Reference source not found..

For each stage of the service chain, a collated score was put into a risk category based on scoring
ranges (again, High / Medium / Low ranges). These scoring ranges were based on experience of
approaches for assessing risk to water supplies and from sanitation facilities in other studies. In
some cases, the highest risk score would be considered as the most relevant to identify – particularly
in relation to contact between fecal sludge and drinking water supplies or human directly (through
hands, feet, etc.).

 * Note relating to Disposal scores:
 If Qn1 scores 2 or 3, and Qn2 or Qn3 score 2 or 3, this implies medium (no scores of 3) or high (one or more scores of 3)
 risk
 If Qn1 scores 2 or 3, and Qn4 and Qn5 both score 2 or 3, this implies medium (no scores of 3) or high (one or more scores
 of 3) risk


Using the rating and scoring process during observations of emptying practices, a summary of
identified risks is shown in Table 36. The observations only followed the practice to the disposal
point, as treatment / end-use of fecal sludge is not practiced in Dhaka. Given the small number of
observations carried out, these results cannot be taken as representative of the vast number of
emptying practices (most notably those done by manual emptiers) occuring on a daily basis in
Dhaka.

Transect walks: Participants used a standard reporting format to allocate scores to help represent
a qualitative assessment of the relative impact from physical and environmental conditions on being
able to achieve effective and safe FSM services in that locality.

Categories included in the conditions that were recorded included: drainage infrastructure and use
(noting the presence of storm water, greywater and/or blackwater); evidence of open defecation,
dumped fecal sludge or solid waste; public latrine coverage; access to water points; housing density;
conditions of roads and paths. Each category was pre-allocated 5 observed responses, ranging from
very poor conditions (scoring 5) through to very good conditions or no evidence found (scoring 1).
Scores of 1 therefore represent the lowest impact and 5 the highest impact on FSM services. Results
from the 40 transect walks (10 in subsample A PSUs and 10 in subsample B PSUs) are shown in
Table 37.

For certain categories relating to FSM (for example evidence of open defecation, fecal sludge,
blackwater in drains) that scored 3 or more, participants identified the location of the observation,
how often the particular risk occurred in the area, by asking members of the community for
information, and the mechanism for human contact and contamination route (through people walking
in bare feet, entering drains, blackwater in drains overflowing near to homes, etc.).

Tables showing the format for scoring conditions in the PSUs during the Transect Walks and for
collecting further details where high risks were seen, are available from the links in Annex E.
