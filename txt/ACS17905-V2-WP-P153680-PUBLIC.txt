Acknowledgments
This report discusses the findings of the second phase of the Tunisia WASH and Poverty
Diagnostic, conducted by the World Bank.

The implementation of the diagnostic was entrusted to the consulting firm Oxford Policy
Management (OPM) and was led by Ms. Sophie Trémolet, Task Team Leader (TTL) at the World
Bank. The report was drafted by Mr. Madih Mnif (Independent Consultant), Ms. Faouzia Said
(Independent Consultant), Ms. Ana Mujica (OPM), and Mr. Ian Ross (OPM).

The Tunisia diagnostic was steered by a Steering Committee, comprised of members of several
ministries and institutions working in the WASH sector and chaired by Mr. Belgacem Ayed, Head of
the General Committee for Regional and Sectoral Development within the Ministry of
Development, Investment, and International Cooperation (MDICI). Ms. Radhia Ben Aziza, Head of
Unit at the Directorate of Infrastructure at MDICI was the focal point of the diagnostic.

The team would like to thank all members of the Steering Committee, especially Mr. Belgacem
Ayed and Ms. Radhia Ben Aziza, for their material and moral support.

The World Bank expresses its deep appreciation of the collaboration of the Government of Tunisia-
especially the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of International Cooperation and Investment,
SONEDE, ONAS, and INS in the preparation of this report.

WASH Accounts for Tunisia


Executive Summary

Background

Tunisia has made substantial progress in improving its population's access to drinking
water and sanitation services over the past decades. From 1990 to 2012, the rate of access to
improved drinking water went up from 82% to 97%, whereas the rate of access to improved
sanitation increased from 73% to 92% (EGIM, 2012). More than four million people gained access
to sanitation between 1990 and 2015. Despite this progress, approximately 250,000 people are still
using unimproved sources - mainly wells, as well as other unprotected sources - to supply
themselves with drinking water. On top of that, 900,000 people are using unimproved sanitation
services.

The sixth Sustainable Development Goal binds Tunisia to guarantee universal access to
water and sanitation services (WASH). This includes ensuring adequate management of fecal
sludge and wastewaters across the full chain of sanitation services. This also calls for a safely
managed universal access to water supply, which entails that all households should have on-
parcel access to water by 2030.

Tunisia is divided in 7 regions and 24 governorates and 33% of its 11 million inhabitants live
in rural areas. Most WASH services in Tunisia are ensured by two public utilities. The main water
service provider is SONEDE (Société Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux, i.e.
National Water Development and Distribution Company) - it serves 100% of the urban population
and 51% of the rural population. The majority of the remaining rural populations are supplied by the
Rural Engineering services. The management of drinking water is ensured by GDAs (Groupements
de Développement Agricole, i.e. Agricultural Development Groups). GDAs are community-based
entities tasked with ensuring water distribution for human consumption and irrigated farming.
Sanitation services, mainly sanitation and waste water treatment, are provided by the public utility
ONAS (Office National d'Assainissement, i.e. National Office of Sanitation).

ONAS is in charge of ensuring services in communes located in its coverage area (covered
communes). The State may entrust it with the implementation of sanitation infrastructure even out
of its covered communes, sometime in rural localities as part of rural sanitation projects.
Responsibilities as regards rural sanitation were defined in an inter-ministry council in June 2016
and have been distributed between ONAS (in charge of localities of more than 3,000 inhabitants),
regional councils, communes and local communities with the support of CRDAs. However, legal
texts (decrees and acts) required for actual effectiveness of responsibilities as regards rural
sanitation in Tunisia have not yet been published.

It was in this context that the Tunisia Poverty and Access to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene
Diagnostic (WPD) was launched. Phase 1 of the diagnostic looked into links between WASH and
multidimensional poverty. Phase 2 reviewed financial flows in the WASH sector, to allow for better
targeting of financial resources at the areas that need them the most.

Methodology

The review used the methodology developed by the TrackFin initiative of the World Health
Organization. This methodology aims to improve the monitoring and analysis of financial flows in
the WASH sector at the national level and allows for answering four key questions:

    1. What is the total amount of expenditures in the sector and how did it change over time?

    2. How are the funds distributed across the different sectors (water and sanitation), types of
       WASH services, types of area, and types of water- and sanitation-related expenditures?

    3. Who pays for WASH services and how much?

    4. Which entities are the main vehicles of funding of the sector and how much do they
       contribute to total expenditures?

Considering the findings of the WPD Phase 1, which indicate a close relation between poverty, its
spatial distribution (at the level of regions and governorates), and access to WASH services,
additional questions were expressed:

    1. How are public expenditures in the WASH sector distributed across governorates?

    2. How can these expenditures per governorate be compared with the data on the regional
       distribution of poverty, access to WASH services, nutrition, or other socioeconomic
       indicators?

Under the TrackFin methodology, the review draws on six types of classifications laid down in the
guidance document on WASH Accounts estimation:

       WASH services: water, sanitation, etc.

       WASH service uses: domestic, non-domestic, etc.

       Service providers:       companies     providing     networked   services,   community-based
        organizations, etc.

       Financing units: users, national authorities, etc.

       Types of funding: tariffs, national public transfers, etc.

       Types of costs: investment costs, operating and maintenance costs etc.

Findings

Total WASH expenditures (both public and private, in nominal terms) increased by
approximately 17% on an annual basis between 2013 and 2015. Total WASH expenditures
increased between 2013 and 2015, from TND 958 million to TND 1,317 million, i.e. approximately
1.5% of the GDP. Taking into account the inflation rates observed over the review period (5.7% in
2013, 4.8% in 2014, and 4.1% in 2015), the average annual increase in real terms is 12%.

Expenditures per capita on water and sanitation are higher in urban areas than in rural ones. The
higher level of water expenditures in urban areas versus rural areas is accounted for by higher
levels of consumption and higher expenditures on bottled water. As for sanitation, levels of public
and private expenditures are much lower in rural areas.

Public expenditures on water and sanitation make up approximately 1.6% of the total
amount of public expenditures, whereas health expenditures make up 14%. Total
expenditures per capita on water and sanitation have slightly increased from TND 83 in 2013 to
TND 112 in 2015, i.e. less than TND 10 per month. Nevertheless, wide disparities remain between
urban and rural areas and across governorates. For instance, in 2015, total water and sanitation
expenditures per capita in urban areas amounted to approximately TND 129, against only TND 75

in rural areas. The disparity is even more marked between governorates, with total water and
sanitation expenditures ranging from TND 58 per capita in Le Kef (one of the most vulnerable
areas) to TND 214 in Tozeur in 2015.1

Most financial resources allocated to water and sanitation go to O&M, followed by
investments. In 2013, O&M expenditures (including payroll expenditures, fuel, and other
expenditures needed to run the services and keep them running) made up 65% of total water
expenditures and 52% of sanitation ones. O&M costs do not include major capital maintenance
costs (e.g. renewal of water and sanitation systems and rehabilitation works) which benefit from
only 5% of the resources allocated to water and sanitation altogether, a situation that endangers
the sustainability of the investments.

Water and sanitation expenditures are mainly funded by households themselves , either
through the payment of tariffs for the services rendered, or through investments in self -supply. This
"private expenditure" is particularly high in predominantly urban governorates such as Tunis,
Arianna, Ben Arous, and Monastir.

The targeting of WASH public expenditures could be improved. Public water expenditures are
fairly well targeted at governorates with high poverty rates. Investments are planned based on
existing resources while prioritizing those governorates with service rates below the national
average. Nonetheless, they could be better targeted at governorates with high numbers of
population unserved by formal water providers. Both objectives should be achievable.
Governorates with a high number of people unserved by formal water providers, such as Kairouan,
do not receive comparatively higher amounts of public resources per capita, while this action might
be necessary to bridge the gap.

As for sanitation, as found in the review in this report, public expenditures are not sufficiently
targeted at areas lacking access to the services and the challenge of rural sanitation should be
given high priority.

Unlike water, public expenditures on sanitation are in negative correlation with poverty
levels. This is partly due to the lack of clear definition of service provision responsibilities in rural
areas, i.e. areas where poverty is concentrated. While coverage of urban areas (i.e. communes)
falls to ONAS, no service provider has actually been appointed to serve governorates that are
predominantly rural. Although the distribution of public resources for sanitation should be a focus,
especially in rural and poor areas, responsibilities relating to service provision should be clearly
defined before any reallocation of financial resources is made.

 The high level of expenditure in the governorate of Tozeur in 2015 was due to special circumstances, namely the implementation of
desalination plant.

1          Introduction

1.1        Background and objectives of the diagnostic

The first phase of the Tunisia Poverty and Access to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)
Diagnostic reviewed links between WASH and multidimensional poverty. The diagnostic
especially assessed four key dimensions of WASH and poverty:

      1. The social and economic profiles of access to WASH services

      2. Correlations between WASH services and monetary well-being

      3. Effects of adequate access to WASH services on child nutrition

      4. Impacts of changes in WASH service tariffs on equity and poverty

Regarding the funding of the WASH sector, Phase I of the diagnostic especially highlighted
the need to adjust financial flows and the fact that better resource allocation would increase
the rates of access to improved water and sanitation facilities among unserved populations
and regions. However, the cost structure of WASH services, as well as the general funding of
the sector showed major gaps (e.g.: amounts, sources, cost recovery, etc.).

Against this backdrop, this second phase of the WASH and Poverty Diagnosis (WPD)
proposes to review financial flows for the purpose of developing an overall vision of the
funding of the WASH sector and providing better understanding of the funding of the sector.
Specifically, this review establishes where funding come from (sources) and how they are
assigned to the different sectors, areas or regions, types of providers (public, networked,
non-networked, etc.), and type of funding (tariffs, transfers, loans, etc.).

The review of financial flow used the methodology developed by the TrackFin initiative of the
World Health Organization (WHO)2. This methodology aims to improve the monitoring and
analysis of financial flows in the WASH sector at the national level, allow for making
comparisons across countries, and contribute to the reinforcement of national financial
information collection and analysis systems. The TrackFin methodology allows for answering
four key questions:

      1. What is the total amount of expenditures in the sector and how did it change over
         time?

      2. How are the funds distributed across the different sectors (water and sanitation),
         types of WASH services, types of area, and types of water- and sanitation-related
         expenditures?

      3. Who pays for WASH services and how much?

      4. Which entities are the main vehicles of funding of the sector and how much do they
         contribute to total expenditures?

Considering the results of Phase 1 of WPD, which indicate close correlation between
poverty, its spatial distribution, and access to WASH services, additional policy-related
questions were raised. These questions aim to assess the extent to which the distribution of
funding can contribute to reducing inequalities of access to WASH services:

    1. How are public expenditures in the WASH sector distributed across governorates?

    2. How can these expenditures per governorate be compared with the data on the
       regional distribution of poverty, access to WASH services, nutrition, or other
       socioeconomic indicators?

A review of financial flows in the WASH sector can help the Government of Tunisia improve
public funding allocation, so as to generate maximum benefits, especially for the poorest
households and most vulnerable regions. More generally, this review allows to:

      Define strategies for advocating for resource allocation to the water and sanitation
       sectors

      Plan future investments and their funding arrangements

      Monitor resource use and sectoral objective achievement

      Ensure coordination within and across sectors

The outcomes, or WASH Accounts, also provide the basis for expressing recommendations
for a better allocation of sectoral funds, especially public resources, and on the way results
can be used to define sectoral policies, which allow for reducing inequalities of access to
WASH services. The outcomes can help define support to the WASH sector in Tunisia.

2          Background of Tunisia

2.1        Geography3

Tunisia has a total surface area of 163,610km 2. It is divided in four physiographic regions -
the mountains of the Northwest, the mountains of the South, the coastal plains, and desert
plains - and in 24 governorates, shown in Error! Reference source not found.. Tunisia has
a Mediterranean climate, with an average rainfall of 207mm per year. However, the spatial
distribution of rainfall varies substantially: annual rainfall amounts to 594mm in the North,
296mm in the Center, 156mm in the South, and less than 100mm in the extreme Southwest
(Tataouine). Nearly 70% of the surface area of the country can support vegetation but this
area is slightly decreasing because of the development of urban centers and water dams and
increasing desertification.

 Tunisia is divided in 24 governorates, each one of which comprises several delegations. Individual delegations
comprise, in turn, several sectors which are the smallest administrative division of the country.

The water system is dense in the North - Northern basins account for approximately 82% of
the surface water inputs of the country - while, on the other hand, the system is scattered in
the Center and South, with basins providing poor and erratic inputs. The North is also
characterized by a wealth of surface water, whereas the Center and South have lower quality
groundwater: they are located deeper and are not all renewable. Two categories of
groundwater resources exist:

         Water tables (of a maximum depth of 50m) which can be used for private or public
          use and with a potential estimated at 745 million m 3/year

         Deep groundwaters (more than 50m deep), with a potential estimated at 1.420 million
          m3/year. Access to deep groundwaters require specific authorization.

The uneven geographic distribution of water resources accounts for the existing water
transfer infrastructures from the North to coastal towns, i.e. the big dams and supply of
coastal towns with groundwater in the central part of the country. There are also several
desalination plants, mainly intended to ensure the drinking water supply to urban centers in
the Southeast.

2.2        Demographics and socioeconomic indicators

In 2014, the total population of Tunisia was estimated at 11 million inhabitants. It grew by a
rate of 11% between 2004 and 2014, i.e. approximately 1% per year. The population growth
rate has been decreasing from an average of 2% per year since the 1980s and Tunisia has
been going through a period of demographic transition: while the proportion of the population
aged 60 on increased from 7 to 11% between 1984 and 2014, the population aged between
0 and 4 decreased from 15% to 9% (INS, 2016).

Estimations also show that approximately one third of the population lives in rural or non-
communal areas5, with a strong trend towards urbanization since the 1960s. The distribution
of the population across regions and governorates is shown in Table 1. The regions of
Greater Tunis and Central East concentrate approximately 48% of the population. This
population is also rather urban: figures indicate that 100% of the population living in Tunis
and Monastir reside in communes (urban areas). On the other hand, the smallest urban
population is found in the governorate of Sidi Bouzid: it only makes up 27% of the total
population of the governorate. Figure 2 more clearly shows the distribution of rurality in
Tunisia.

 Territories in Tunisia are classified as either communal (urban) or non-communal (rural). It is noted that
communal areas, as defined by the National Statistics Institute (INS), "is a well-delineated part of the territory,
instituted as such by a decree which subjects it to municipal law and is comprised of one or several urban
sectors". Because rural communes do not exist in Tunisia, any part of the territory that is not under the commune
status is considered rural.

Regarding socioeconomic indicators, Figure 3 shows poverty and extreme poverty rates, as
well as the number of poor and extremely poor according to governorates. On one hand, it is
noted that poverty is concentrated in the regions of the Northwest (28% of the region's
population) and Central West (31% of the region's population).

Greater Tunis holds the lowest poverty and extreme poverty rates: poverty concerns only 5%
of the population in the region. Poverty rates tend to be higher in the more rural
governorates. At the national level, the poverty rate reached 15% in 2015 compared to 25%
in 2000. Also, the extreme poverty rate reached 3% in 2015 compared to 8% in 2000.

Tunisia has made significant progress in terms of human development. According to the
2015 report of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Tunisia ranks 96 th out of
187 countries when considering its human development index (HDI), an index that
encompasses health, education, and standard of living aspects. In fact, Tunisia's HDI has
increased from 0.49 in 1980 to 0.72 in 2014 and all its health and education indicators have
followed this upward trend. Life expectancy at birth reached 75 years and under 5 mortality
has been reduced to 16 per 1,000 births in 2014 (UNDP, 2015).

3           Overview of the WASH sector in Tunisia

3.1         Access to drinking water and sanitation services

3.1.1       Drinking water

The drinking water sector in Tunisia is mainly managed in two ways:

      1. SONEDE has mandate to ensure water supply across the Tunisian territory.
         Currently, SONEDE supplies water to all urban areas as well as rural agglomerations.
         In 2015, SONEDE ensured the drinking water supply of 85% of the Tunisian
         population. This rate includes 100% of the urban population and 51% of the rural
         population. In total, the population served with drinking water by SONEDE is in the
         region of 9.5million (Table 2).

      2. The Rural Engineering services of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and
         Fisheries are in charge of implementing drinking water systems in scattered rural
         areas. The systems are managed by GDAs. Currently, there are approximately 1,400
         drinking water GDAs and 140 mixed GDAs for drinking water supply (DWS) and
         irrigation (Table 2). These associations benefit from support and supervision from the
         Rural Engineering services, namely at setting up.

According to the 2015 Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) of WHO and UNICEF, about 2% of
the Tunisian population (unserved) supply themselves from unprotected wells or sources,
surface waters (e.g. rivers), or other unimproved sources of water (e.g. cistern or cart). 6

The table hereafter summarizes the data relating to the population served by SONEDE and
DGGREE in years 2014 and 2015 based on figures from SONEDE, namely access rate to

3.1.2       Sanitation

The sector of sanitation in Tunisia has significantly developed since the creation of ONAS in
1974. Indeed, ONAS, the main sanitation operator in Tunisia, has completed several study
programs and works to equip various Tunisian towns with sanitation networks and water
treatment infrastructures.

Urban areas
ONAS currently works in 173 communes out of a total of 283 distributed across the entire
Republic. The towns covered by ONAS hold a population of 6.8 million inhabitants, making
up 91% of the country's urban population (7.4 million inhabitants in 2014). 8

Communes that are not covered by ONAS (110 Communes) are generally small. These
communes have poor or no sanitation infrastructures. Households use septic tanks or
cesspools.

The number of inhabitants connected to the sanitation network in the communes covered by
ONAS amounts to approximately 6.2 million (2014), i.e. a rate of connection of 91%.
Households that are not connected to the ONAS network use septic tanks or cesspools. It is
noted that the Government can request ONAS to construct sanitation infrastructure works
even out of the communes it covers.

Rural areas
ONAS's mandate does not include rural sanitation but since the rural commune status does
not exist and governorate councils are not equipped to perform this activity, it would appear
that there are no institutional provisions to govern rural sanitation. It was in this context that,
as early as 1999, ONAS was tasked with conducting a strategic study to determine sanitation
systems suited to rural areas and setting up a management mode allowing to ensure the
sustainability of the structures planned.

The study allowed for defining a priority action plan involving 50 localities. Under a pilot
project, ONAS embarked into a first round in 2001, resulting in the sanitation of up to 26
localities, with about 32,000 inhabitants.

According to the 2015 JMP of WHO/ UNICEF, about 92% of the Tunisian population has
access to improved sanitation; this entails that approximately 900,000 people do not have
access to an improved sanitation facility. Approximately 7% of the population use
unimproved sanitation facilities that range from shared toilets to pit latrines and wall-hung
toilets, with 1% practicing open air defecation. When the place of residence is considered,
strong disparities are found between urban and rural areas. In 2015, approximately 97% of
Tunisians living in urban areas used improved facilities, compared to 80% of those living in
rural areas.

To ensure sanitation services in rural areas and to remedy to the noted institutional vacuum,
it was decided during an interministerial council, dated June 13, 2016, that the
responsibilities for rural sanitation will be assigned as follows, according to locality size:

    Calculated on the basis of data from INS and ONAS (List of Communes covered).

WASH Accounts for Tunisia



         In localities where the population exceeds 3,000 inhabitants, sanitation services will
          be ensured by ONAS who will collect sanitation tariffs in this regard

         In localities where the population ranges between 1,000 and 3,000 inhabitants, the
          sanitation service falls to the Regional Councils and Communes, under the lead of
          the Ministry of Local Affairs and Environment, with the participation of the private
          sector and technical assistance of ONAS

         In localities with a population under 1,000 inhabitants, the population will be
          encouraged to use on-site sanitation systems with the support of CRDAs. The
          Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Fisheries has been invited to plan for
          the mechanisms required to help construct these infrastructures.

It must be noted that the legal texts (decrees and acts) required for the enforcement of
sanitation responsibilities in rural areas in Tunisia have not yet been published. It may be a
better option to implement collective sanitation facilities in the case of some localities with
less than 1,000 inhabitants but where habitat is grouped.

3.2        Institutional organization

The drinking water and sanitation services provision in Tunisia is almost entirely ensured by
the public sector. The institutional organization of the sector is structured around:

         The Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Fisheries (MARHP) for water
          policy (urban and rural)

         The Ministry of Local Affairs and the Environment (MALE) for sanitation policy
          (urban and rural); and

         Two historic public operators – the Société Nationale d’Exploitation et de
          Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE), in charge of drinking water supply services since
          1968 and the Office National de l’Assainissement (ONAS), in charge of sanitation
          services in communal areas since 1974.

         The Rural Engineering Units at the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and
          Fisheries are in charge of providing water services in rural areas not served by
          SONEDE. Users' associations called Groupement de Développement Agricole
          (GDA) are appointed to manage the services in the field of rural drinking water
          supply.

Other public actors, such as the Ministry of Development, Investment, and International
Cooperation (MDICI) and Ministry of Health (MS) are also involved in the water and
sanitation sector.

Figure 4 summarizes the key institutions involved in the water sector. It is structured
according to three levels of decision-making:

      1. Advisory boards, represented by the National Water Council, chaired by the Ministry
         of Agriculture and comprised of representatives of several ministries, businesses, and
         national organizations

3.3          Sectoral plans and policies

Tunisia’s new constitution, adopted in 2014, enshrines the right to water for all Tunisians. It
falls to the Government and relevant institutions to guarantee the safeguarding and proper
governance of water resources (SONEDE, 2014b).

The Water Code, set in 1975, is the basic legal text governing any action in the water sector.
Water policies in Tunisia mainly aim to increase water resource mobilization and include
(FAO, 2016):

           Master Plans (Waters of the North, Waters of the Center, Waters of the South) which
            are oriented on the setting up of water mobilization, distribution, and use
            infrastructures

           The 1990-2000 National Ten-Year Strategy

           The 2000-2011 Complementary Mobilization Strategy, and

WASH Accounts for Tunisia



         The 2030 Long-Term Strategy

All these plans and strategies allowed for defining current and future orientations for the
development of the WASH sector, which are summarized as follows (MARHP, 2013)

         Construction of medium- and small-sized structures to achieve a resource
          mobilization rate of 95%,

         Integrated management of water resources,

         Water saving and demand control for all users, and

         Water resource protection.

3.4        Actors and financial flows in the WASH sector

3.4.1      Drinking water

The key actors involved in the funding of the drinking water sector in Tunisia are:

         The Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Fisheries, which is in charge
          of managing water resources and supply. It is the line ministry of public
          establishments working in the water sector, including SONEDE and CRDAs.

         The Ministry of Development, Investment, and International Cooperation
          (MDICI), by reinforcing international and regional cooperation in the water sector
          through the directorates in charge of international cooperation and by promoting
          regional development through the Directorate General of Regional Directorate
          (DGDR) and the General Commission for Regional Development (CGDR).

         The Ministry of Health, through the Directorate General of Environmental Health and
          Protection, which ensures the control of waters in terms of health both in rural and
          urban areas (drinking water, mineral water), as well as the sensitization of users and
          health education.

         Regional Governorate Councils, through the development and implementation of
          regional development projects in the drinking water sector.

         SONEDE has mandate to ensure the drinking water supply of urban areas across the
          Tunisian territory, as well as part of the rural areas.

         DGGREE covers scattered rural areas through the Rural Engineering
          arrondissements of the Regional Agricultural Development Commissions (CRDAs) -
          twenty-four (24) arrondissements, i.e. one per CRDA. Rural DWS projects are
          planned under a close collaboration between DGGREE and SONEDE, in consultation
          with regional services.

         Agricultural Development Groups (GDAs) are users' associations in charge of
          managing the drinking water supply systems set up by the Directorate of Rural
          Engineering of the Ministry of Agriculture in rural areas. They have a management
          contract with the administration.

3.4.2      Sanitation

Key actors involved in the sanitation sector in Tunisia include:

        The Ministry of Local Affairs and the Environment (MALE) through the units in
         charge of the Environment (formerly Ministry of the Environment). It is in charge of the
         general policy of the Government in the fields of environmental protection and has
         supervisory authority over the public establishments under its jurisdiction.

        The Ministry of Development, Investment, and International Cooperation
         (MDICI) reinforces international and regional cooperation in the sanitation sector
         through the directorates in charge of international cooperation, DGDR, and CGDR.
        The Ministry of Health through the Directorate General of Environmental Health and
         Protection, which ensures the sanitary control of waste and treated waters, as well as
         the sensitization of treated waste water users.
        Regional Governorate Councils through the development and implementation of
         regional development projects in the sanitation sector. Regional Councils were tasked
         with operating the sanitation networks constructed by ONAS as part of the rural pilot
         project.
        ONAS is the main operator in the sanitation sector in Tunisia. Its mandate is to
         control all sources of water pollution in its intervention areas.

4          Methodology for WASH Accounts
The process followed for this exercise is the one proposed in the inception report. It is based
on the methodological guide (guidance document) of the TrackFin initiative.

The diagnostic was officially launched in Tunis, on October 7, 2016, during a launching
workshop that involved a meeting convening the Steering Committee, the World Bank, and
the Consultant in charge of the second phase of WPD (OPM). This launching workshop
allowed for (i) defining the scope of WASH accounts (subsectors considered, period of the
analysis, and geographic coverage) and (ii) identifying the key sectoral policy issues that
WASH Accounts can help address.

The launching step was followed by a preliminary data collection which the Consultant drew
on to make an initial identification of the key actors of the WASH sector and financial flows,
as well as an inventory of available documents and data (e.g. investments, fixed assets,
operating and maintenance costs, etc.). The Consultant developed an Inception Report on
the launching of the diagnostic which was submitted and discussed with the members of the
Steering Committee during a workshop held on November 22, 2016.

The key methodological issues highlighted in the Inception Report, especially the possibility
of disaggregating data per governorate and type of area for each sector and the availability
of data on self-supply, were discussed during this workshop. After this launching workshop,
the Consultant continued collecting the required data with the relevant ministries and entities.
The list of the documents collected is provided in Annex B.

To develop the WASH Accounts, the data received had to undergo specific processing and
the missing data had to be estimated. Flow estimation mainly pertained to geographic
distribution, self-supply, and costs in support of the sector. These estimations are based on
the data from the Institut National de Statistique (INS)9 and, among others, the data on water
consumption from SONEDE.

4.1        Scope of WASH Accounts

The diagnostic was identified to have the following scope during the discussions the Steering
Committee members and the World Bank at the launching workshop and the initial inventory
of the documents and data received.

Sectors considered
The WASH areas selected for this diagnostic include:

         Drinking water - domestic or non-domestic (institutional, industrial, and commercial
          users)

         Sanitation - domestic and non-domestic

         Hygiene - domestic, as well as hygiene promotion activities conducted by the Ministry
          of Health


9
 They include the 2004 and 2014 General Census of Population and Housing (RGPH) and the 2005-2010 and
2015 National Survey on Household Budget and Consumption (NSHBC).

WASH Accounts for Tunisia



Period
The period considered for the review are years 2013, 2014, and 2015.

Geographic coverage
The diagnostic covers urban and rural areas at the national level and includes a detailed
review of each of the 24 governorates of Tunisia.

4.2        Classifications adopted to assess WASH Accounts

This section provides a summary of the classifications used to assess WASH Accounts in
Tunisia with respect to types of services, their use, and providers; types of funding; and types
of costs. The classification set by the Consultant takes as reference the rankings proposed in
the Inception Report of this diagnostic and the TrackFin guidance document.

The proposed classifications are set forth in Annex C. As can be seen in the Annex, the
definitions used in Tunisia are similar to those described in the TrackFin guidance document.

Regarding WASH services, support to the sector (S4) had to be estimated on the basis of the
budgets of the Ministries in charge of Agriculture and the Environment. For hygiene services
(S5), the hygiene promotion conducted by the Ministry of Health, as well as household
expenditures on soap for personal hygiene were considered.

For domestic use of a provided service (U1), we considered the consumption of paid WASH
services (whether networked or not) provided to households by operators (SONEDE, GDA,
ONAS, mineral water bottling companies, and street vendors). For non-domestic use
involving self-supply (U4), we considered non-domestic users such as the Groupe Chimique
Tunisien (GCT) and the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa (CPG).

For service providers, non-networked service provision companies (P3), private water
bottling companies, informal water retailers, and septic tank emptying businesses,
promoters, and real estate developers were considered. Category P4 (NGOs and
community-based organizations) mainly includes rural drinking water users' associations
(GDAs). 10

Concerning financing units, FU3 (Regional Authorities) and FU4 (Local Authorities)
categories are not relevant in Tunisia.11 Bilateral and multilateral donors (FU8) include IRDB,
KfW, AFD, EU, EIB, AfDB, the Swiss Cooperation, and JICA. Banks and financial
establishments (FU10) are not involved in funding the WASH sector.

4.3        Data collection and processing methodology

This paragraph sets forth the key elements relating to the methodology used for collecting
and processing the data provided by the different sources, as well as the key assumptions
selected to estimate missing data, so as to establish the amounts of financial flows in each of
the WASH services.


10
    According to the interviews with managers, NGOs and community-based organizations provide but minimal
funding to the WASH sector.
11
   CRDAs represent the Ministry of Agriculture at the regional level. They are not decentralized administrative
units.

overall amount of the flows from these sources make up approximately 85% of the total. In
addition, the financial flow estimations were mainly based on the results of the INS censuses
and surveys and statistics from SONEDE and ONAS. As such, the findings of this exercise
can be considered reliable and provide a credible picture of the WASH sector's situation in
Tunisia.

Drinking water service provided by SONEDE
The financial data on drinking water service users provided by SONEDE were mainly
obtained from audit reports on the financial statements of SONEDE for years 2012, 2013,
and 2015, as well as the management and development budget reports of the period
between 2014 and 2016. The data are consistent and reliable.

For SONEDE’s operating expenditures (e.g. payroll costs, power, chemical products, etc.),
the Consultant used the database on the Management Accounts of year 2013 where
management expenditures are distributed according to districts (39) and headquarter costs.
Current expenditures per governorate were calculated by adding up the expenditures of all
districts of a governorate and in consideration of the headquarters' costs share on the basis
of the percentage of water volume sold per governorate against the total volume of water
sold. The same distribution key was used for years 2014 and 2015.

Operating expenditures relating to the drinking water supplied by SONEDE increased from
TND 320 million in 2013 to TND 408 million, i.e. a nominal average increase by 13% per
year.

SONEDE's current expenditures were disaggregated per urban and rural areas, on the basis
of the 2013 Management Accounts data used to distribute governorate expenditures. The
distribution of expenditures per governorate and type of area (rural/urban) was based on the
structure of the population covered per type of area for each of years 2013, 2014, and 2015.
Ratios of approximately 80% and 20% were found in urban and rural areas respectively, at
national level.

The review of financial flow took into consideration public subsidies on the cost of energy.
The subsidies were estimated at 27% of the energy expenditures of SONEDE 12 and were
calculated on the basis of the 2014 baseline price. As a result, public subsidies on energy
received by SONEDE increased from TND 14 million in 2013 to TND 18 million in 2015.

Regarding SONEDE’s investment expenditures, the Consultant used the database on budget
preparation which includes data on SONEDE projects per governorate, with details on
forecasts, according to funding source (SONEDE, Government, loans, donations, etc.). On
the other hand, actual expenditures (achievements) are not detailed. Concerning the
estimation of investment expenditures per governorate and type of funding, the Consultant
chose to use the same distribution as the one planned at budget preparation. It is noted that
the project completion rate by SONEDE did not exceed 50% over the 2013-2015 period
(achievements versus forecasts), which could be partially accounted for by the fact that the
forecasts exceeded SONEDE's execution capacity by far, as well as the post-revolution
social context.

SONEDE's investment expenditures (actually completed) increased from TND 95 million in
2013 to TND 176 million in 2015, i.e. an average increase by 37% per year.

Some projects completed by SONEDE cover more than one governorate. As such, regarding
the distribution of investment expenditures across governorates, a distribution key was
applied on the basis of the individual governorates' water consumption, versus the total water
consumption.13

The distribution of the investment and operating expenditures on the drinking water supplied
by SONEDE according to domestic and non-domestic use was based on the data relating to
the consumed volumes included in SONEDE's Statistical Report. Domestic and non-
domestic use respectively account for 77% and 23% of the total use.

12
  With the information in the Financial Equilibrium Study by SONEDE.
13
 It was not possible to base the distribution on the number of connections as it is difficult to distinguish new
connections linked with new investments from those linked with the existing infrastructure. In fact, most of
SONEDE's projects consist in reinforcing the existing infrastructure, as well as expanding networks.

Drinking water service provided by GDAs
The financial data on the use of the drinking water services provided by GDAs was obtained
from the GDAs' database for years 2012, 2013, and 2014, as well as the budgetary data
extracted from the SBD Budget Management System14 for years 2013, 2014, and 2015. The
data were provided by the relevant units of the Ministry of Agriculture.

The data derived from the SBD Budgetary Management System are reliable. However, data
on GDAs were provided by the DGGREE units and are partial, pertaining to approximately
one third of all GDAs. Their reliability is hard to confirm.

In the light of the data provided, the Consultant based the estimation of the total current
expenditures of GDAs (payroll costs, energy, chemicals, etc.) on the water consumption of
GDA users and the average (actual) expenditures of GDAs per m 3 of distributed water. The
average expenditure was estimated on the basis of the data provided, at approximately
0.700 TND/m3 for all governorates, except the governorate of Ariana where the expenditure
amounts to 0.174 TND/m3 (which is equal to SONEDE's rate). For years 2014 and 2015, an
estimated current expenditure increase rate amounting to 10% was applied to make
estimates.

The annual water consumption relating to GDA-provided services was estimated on the
basis of the population served by the rural engineering units - i.e. the coverage rate per
governorate from the Statistical Reports of SONEDE and the population per governorate
indicated in INS reports - and specific consumption per governorate were calculated on the
basis of GDA data. Once extreme values are removed, it appears that the average specific
consumptions considered over the analysis period (2013-2015) vary according to
governorates from 43 l/cap./day to 68 l/cap./day, with a national average of 50 l/cap./day.

Total GDA expenditures calculated for year 2013 are in the region of TND 19 million. They
increased to approximately TND 22 million in 2015.

The review of financial flows also took into consideration public subsidies to the cost of
energy that is provided by the Government to all users. This grant was estimated at 27% of
the GDAs' energy expenditures as with SONEDE. Based on the detailed statement of GDA
expenditures, GDAs' energy expenditures were estimated to amount to 25% of the total
expenditures. The energy grant was equivalent to TND 1.3 million in 2013 and TND 1.5
million in 2015.

Regarding the investment expenditures on the drinking water provided by GDAs, the
Consultant used the data on drinking water projects completed by CRDAs provided by the
Ministry of Agriculture. These data were provided per governorate and type of funding (public
budget/ loan).

Total investment expenditures on drinking water systems managed by GDAs increased from
TND 30.4 million in 2013 to TND 73.2 million in 2015. This increase was mainly funded by
AfDB loans. 15 The table hereafter summarizes the amounts invested on these projects.

   The share of the projects' amount funded by the loan is transferred to the relevant CRDAs (implementing
agency). The repayment of the loan (principal and interests) is made from the State budget as part of debt
repayment.

The data on the investments on SDWSs managed by GDAs, made by the Ministry of
Agriculture (through the Rural Engineering units of individual CRDAs), over the period
considered, were provided by CRDA (per governorate).

In addition to these investments and over the 2013-2015 period, MARHP incurred
expenditures to support GDAs on major maintenance works of the facilities. These amounts
increased from TND 1.0 million in 2013 to TND 2.8 million in 2015.

Expenditures relating to new connections are borne by subscribers. They were estimated
based on an average cost of TND 250 /connection. The number of new connections to the
GDAs' water systems increased from approximately 6,000 connections in 2013 to
approximately 15,000 in 2015, increasing the total number of households having a private
connection from 146,000 in 2013 to 170,000. This extension is accounted for by the fact that
households increasingly resort to private connections.

Expenditures on new connections increased from TND 1.5 million in 2013 to TND 3.7 million
in 2015.

Regarding drinking water services provided by GDAs, we additionally considered the current
expenditures of CRDA services, in relation with this activity. To estimate these expenditures,
we have financial data derived from the ADEB System for the RE Subprogram of Program 3
of the MARHP Budget.16 The share of the drinking water supply activity in the RE
Subprogram was estimated at 43%. This rate was calculated based on the average of the
investment share on DWS projects, compared to the total amount of investments (DWS
projects and irrigation projects) over the review period.

The current expenditures of these CRDAs' services in relation with DWS increased from TND
7.4 million in 2013 to TND 10.0 million in 2015.

Regarding the distribution across governorates and with only the data on the current
expenditures of CRDA units for year 2014 available, we applied the same distribution key as
for other years. It must be noted that the considered expenditures are those relating to the
use of domestic drinking water supplied by GDAs.

Drinking water supplied by non-networked service providers
Non-networked drinking water service providers in Tunisia can be classified as either formal
or informal providers. Informal providers are mainly cistern water vendors supplying
themselves from a private or public or even uncontrolled source.


16
  The MARHP budget is distributed among six programs that are individually broken down into subprograms.
Program 3 is the Water program and it includes three subprograms: SP3.1 Water Resources; SP3.2 Dams and
Major Hydraulic Works; and SP3.3 Rural Engineering.

We have INS data on the number of households disaggregated per drinking water supply
source for years 2004 and 2014 (2004 and 2014 Census), governorate, and type of area
(rural/urban). The number of households that use a non-networked drinking water source has
decreased from 217,000 in 2004 to approximately 187,000 in 2014. The expenditures of
these households on water purchase were estimated on the basis of their water consumption
and average expenditure per m3 of purchased water based on the following assumptions
made by the report’s authors:

The annual water consumption of these households was estimated on the basis of the
following assumptions:

        Water consumption: 25 l/cap/day.

        Average purchasing price of one water cistern (5m 3): from TND 15 to 25 or from TND
         3 to 5/m3

The total expenditures made on water purchases from informal providers in year 2015 were
estimated at approximately TND 14,7 million.

To estimate expenditures on water purchases for years 2013 and 2014, we calculated
expenditures in year 2004 and came to estimate that the costs of the water purchased in
2014, as indicated above, annually increased by 3.6% over the 2004-2010 period.

Although the number of households supplying themselves with informal service providers is
decreasing (approximately 1.6% per year), the total expenditures on water purchase
increased from TND 14 million in 2013 to TND 15.3 million in 2015. This increase is mainly
due to increased water purchase costs.

Formal drinking water supply service providers are mainly water bottling companies. We
have data on the expenditures on mineral water of the seven socioeconomic regions of the
country and according to type of area (urban, rural), from the 2005 and 2010 household
consumption surveys.

Expenditures on mineral water purchases were estimated per governorate on the basis of
the number of inhabitants and average expenditure calculated for the relevant region. The
average expenditure per region was calculated on the basis of the increase rate noted
between 2005 and 2010 and corrected by the increase rate of mineral water companies'
turnover between 2010 and 2015. Expenditures on mineral water purchases increased from
TND 120 million in 2013 to TND 170 million in 2015.

Drinking water - self-supply
To estimate expenditures on drinking water self-supply, we used the data from the 2011-12
MICS survey on the percentage of housing equipped with a well or borehole, on one hand,
and the percentage of those equipped with rainwater collection cisterns ( Majel / Feskia)17, on
the other (Table 5). These percentages were applied to the new housing units constructed
during years 2013, 2014, and 2015 and calculated on the basis of the data from the 2004
and 2014 General Census of Population and Housing (RGPH).



17
  A Majel or Feskia is an indigenous water collection system that collects rainwater from the roof of a house and
channels it to an underground cistern generally made of clay.

                                              Source: MICS (2012).

The annual number of self-supply structures (wells, boreholes, Majels, Feskias) over the
analysis period was estimated on the basis of the numbers of new housing units built,
calculated on the basis of the results of the 2004 and 2014 RGBH censuses and applying an
annual average increase rate.

Expenditures in years 2013, 2014, and 2015 were estimated on the basis of unit investment
costs on the following required structures:

        For wells/ boreholes: between TND 600 in 2013 and TND 700 in 2015 in urban areas
         and between TND 500 in 2013 to TND 550 in 2015 in rural areas

        For Majels/ Feskias: between TND 1,000 in 2013 and TND 1,200 in 2015 in urban
         areas and between TND 600 in 2013 to TND 700 in 2015 in rural areas

Investment expenditures on self-supply increased from TND 9.8 million in 2013 to TND 11.6
million in 2015. The expenditures were fully assigned to domestic use.

4.3.3      Sanitation service

ONAS-provided sanitation service
The financial data on the use of the sanitation service provided by ONAS were mainly
derived from the audit reports on the financial statements of ONAS for years 2013, 2014, and
2015 and from the ONAS projects database.

To establish current expenditures (payroll costs, energy, chemicals, etc.) per governorate in
year 2013, the Consultant used the information on operating costs (network and pumping
stations) and water treatment costs per regional directorate derived from the Analytical
Report of year 2013 (there is one regional directorate per governorate). The same
distribution key was applied to years 2014 and 2015.

The operating expenditures on the use of ONAS-provided sanitation services increased from
TND 164 million in 2013 to TND 180 million in 2015, i.e. an average increase by 4% per
year.

Regarding the distribution of current expenditures per type of area (rural/urban) and
considering the mandate of ONAS, it appears that all expenditures were made in urban
areas.

The review of financial flows took into consideration public subsidies on energy. The
subsidies were estimated at 27% of the ONAS's energy expenditures. This rate was
calculated on the basis of the 2014 baseline price. The energy subsidies increased from TND
4.4 million in 2013, to TND 6.2 million in 2015.

WASH Accounts for Tunisia



Concerning investment expenditures, we used the database of ONAS projects which
includes detailed information on all projects by ONAS since 2010 (project cost, governorate,
nature, value of contract, annual disbursement forecasts, annual achievements, etc.). For the
purpose of the present diagnostic, specific processing was made to derive the data needed
on the projects covered by the diagnostic. Over the review period, the data derived pertained
to 90 projects. ONAS provided us with the distribution per source funding (e.g. State budget,
loans, donations etc.) of the data on these projects.

The investment expenditures on the ONAS-provided sanitation services increased from TND
94 million in 2013 to TND 134 million in 2015, i.e. an average increase by 20% per year.

Information is also provided on the nature of the project (studies, construction, WTP,
network, rehabilitation, etc.). The expenditures that went to rehabilitation projects (networks
pumping stations and treatment plants) and wadi and urban stream maintenance projects
were classified as major maintenance costs, as per the TrackFin classification. The rest of
the expenditures were classified as investment costs.

To calculate ONAS's expenditures per governorate, type of area (rural/urban), source of
funding and nature (e.g. investment, major maintenance), the Consultant compiled the data
collected by developing pivot tables.18

Sanitation supplied by non-networked service providers
Non-networked sanitation service providers mainly include septic tank emptying and network
unclogging companies and property and land developers.

Expenditures on pit emptying were estimated on the basis of the number of housings
equipped with septic tanks (not connected to a sanitation network), a periodicity of emptying
of six (6) years, and a unit cost of TND 50 to 60 in communal areas and zero cost in rural
areas.

According to INS's data, 18% of urban housings were using septic tanks (not connected to a
sanitation network) in 2014. However, this rate varies widely across governorates: indeed, it
ranges from 3% in the governorate of Ariana to 77% in the governorate of Médnine.

The total expenditures on septic tank emptying by relevant companies 19 increased from TND
3.5 million in 2013 to TND 4.0 million in 2015.

Property and land developers in Tunisia are mainly public (SNIT, SPROLS, AFI, AFH) and
private entities. These developers are considered as non-networked sanitation service
providers. In fact, when implementing their real estate, tourist, or industrial projects,
developers are expected to construct the sanitation infrastructure that goes with them. Once
completed, these infrastructures are handed over to ONAS that subsequently ensures their
management and operation.

The investment expenditures incurred by these non-networked service providers are
accounted for in ONAS's assets as projects executed by third parties. Data relating to this
could not be obtained. Failing them, the Consultant did not consider them in the financial
flows of the sanitation sector. According to ONAS, only few such handovers of infrastructures

18
     The pivot tables were then exclusively used to process the data relating to ONAS projects.
19
     These are operating expenditures borne by users.

occurred over the review period and the value of such investments is therefore not
significant.

Self-supplied sanitation
Expenditures on self-supplied sanitation were estimated on the basis of the 2011-12 MICS
survey on sanitation structure equipment of housings non-connected to the sanitation
network. These percentages were applied to the new housing units constructed during years
2013, 2014, and 2015 and calculated on the basis of the data from the 2004 and 2014
RGPH.

                                              Source: MICS (2012).

Expenditures in years 2013, 2014, and 2015 were estimated on the basis of the unit costs of
the following required structures:

        Pits: between TND 800 in 2013 and TND 900 in 2015 in urban areas and between
         TND 400 in 2013 to TND 500 in 2015 in rural areas

        Slab latrines: between TND 500 in 2013 and TND 600 in 2015 in urban areas and
         between TND 300 in 2013 to TND 350 in 2015 in rural areas

        Latrines without slab: between TND 300 in 2013 and TND 400 in 2015 in urban areas
         and between TND 200 in 2013 to TND 250 in 2015 in rural areas

The annual number of sanitation structures (pit, slab latrine, pit latrine without slab)
constructed (investment) over the review period was estimated based on the number of new
housings built, calculated from the results of the 2004 and 2014 RGBH and with application
of an annual average increase rate.

Investment expenditures on self-supply increased from TND 13.4 million in 2013 to TND 15.4
million in 2015. The expenditures were fully assigned to domestic use.

Expenditures on self-supplied sanitation for non-domestic use mainly include investments in
and operating of pretreatment plants made by some industrialists and sometimes hotel
operators. Subsidies up to 20% of the amount of investment are provided via the Fonds de
Dépollution (FODEP, pollution reduction fund). According to the information provided to the
National Environmental Protection Agency (ANPE), since 2010, no industrialist has
benefitted from this pollution reduction instrument because the KfW credit line has been used
up.

4.3.4      Service in support of the WASH sector

The service in support of the WASH sector in Tunisia is mainly ensured by:

        The Ministry of Agriculture through its directorates working in the drinking water
         sector, namely DGGREE and DGRE

        The Ministry of Environment through the directorates working in the field of sanitation,
         namely the Directorate General of the Environment and Quality of Life (DGEQV)

        SONEDE

        ONAS

        ANPE

To estimate the expenditures of the service in support of the WASH sector, the Consultant
based itself on the budgets of the Ministries of Agriculture and 21 the Environment22 dedicated
to the WASH sector, on one hand, and on the percentages of SONEDE's and ONAS's
operating expenditures on the other.

The following percentages were applied with respect to the Ministry of Agriculture23:

        RE subprogram: 42 %24 of central expenditures and 10% of expenditures at regional
         level
        RE subprogram: 10 % of central expenditures and 5% of expenditures at regional
         level
        Steering and Support Program: 1%
The following percentages were applied with respect to the Ministry of the Environment:

        Program 1 - Environment and Quality of Life: 10%
        Program 3 - Steering and Support: 1%
With respect to SONEDE, the share of the support to the WASH sector was estimated to
amount to 10% of the headquarter costs. As for ONAS, the share of the support to the
WASH sector was estimated to amount to 1% of operating costs.

   According to ANPE, it would appear that few treatment facilities for industrial users were constructed over the
2013-2015 period since the pollution reduction mechanism is no longer operational. Most industrial users are
connected to the ONAS network. In fact, industrial units are either located in urban areas or in industrial zones
close to urban areas and connected to the sanitation network. Polluting industrial units must pretreat their waste
waters before discharging them in the ONAS network as per disposal standards. We do not have data on their
number or operating expenditures and recommend to include these data in the next exercises by conducting
specific surveys.
21
   The Budget of MARHP is distributed across six programs that are respectively broken down into subprograms:
Program 3 is the Water Program and Program 6 is the Steering and Support Program.
22
    The budget of the Ministry of Environment is distributed across three programs: Program 1 - Environment and
Quality of Life; Program 2 - Sustainable Development, and Program 3 - Steering and Support.
23
   Failing data, percentages were set in a relatively arbitrary manner.

Expenditures on actions in support of the sector that were funded by a number of donations
over the 2013-2015 period were also taken into account. They include:

          Support to the implementation of the National Sustainability Strategy (KfW-AfDB)

          Twinning document water policing (Program in support of Public Policies - PAPS -
           funded by EU)

          Strategic Operational Plan (PSO) of SONEDE (PAPS)

          Study of the Financial Balance of SONEDE (funding IRDB)

          National Water Information System (SINEAU) funded by AfDB.

The total expenditures on the service in support of the WASH sector were estimated at TND
11.8 million in 2013, TND 12.6 million in 2014, and TND 15.8 million in 2015.

4.3.5        Water resource management relating to water and sanitation service provision

Water resource management relating to water and sanitation service provision in Tunisia is
mainly ensured by:

          The Ministry of Agriculture through its directorates working in the drinking water
           sector, namely DGRE

          The Ministry of Environment through the directorates working in the field of sanitation,
           namely DGEQV and ANPE.

Expenditures on resource management were also estimated on the basis of the percentages
of the operating expenditures that the Ministries of Agriculture and of the Environment have
incurred in relation with the WASH sector.

The following percentages were applied with respect to the Ministry of Agriculture25:

          RE subprogram: 90 % of central expenditures and 95% of expenditures at regional
           level
          Steering and Support Program: 0.5%
The following percentages were applied with respect to the Ministry of the Environment:

          Program 1 - Environment and Quality of Life: 5%
          Program 3 - Steering and Support: 1%
Total expenditures on water resource management in relation with water and sanitation
services were estimated at TND 8.8 million in 2013, TND 10.5 million in 2014, and TND 15.4
million in 2015.

4.3.6      Hygiene services

The hygiene services considered in this diagnostic include hygiene promotion ensured by the
Ministry of Health, as well as hygiene activities at the household level.

Hygiene promotion in Tunisia is ensured by the Ministry of Health through the Directorate of
Environmental Health and Protection (DHMPE). The tasks assigned to this directorate
include control of waters in both rural and urban areas in terms of health (drinking water,
mineral water), user sensitization, control of waste and treated waters in terms of health, as
well as the sensitization of treated wastewater users.

The expenditures incurred by the Ministry to promote hygiene were estimated on the basis
of:

        The data communicated by DHMPE on investment expenditures on the sanitary
         control of drinking water, untreated waste waters, and treated waste waters

        Operating costs, as calculated on the basis of the number of staff involved in hygiene
         promotion (selected assumption is 50% of the total staff numbers of DHMPM)

Total expenditures on hygiene promotion were estimated at TND 7.5 million in 2013 and
TND 9.5 million in 2015.

Regarding hygiene activities at the household level, the expenditures considered included
household expenditures on soap purchase for personal hygiene. These expenditures were
estimated using the data from the 2005 and 2010 Household Consumption Surveys
(ENBCM) relating to soap expenditures for personal hygiene in the seven socioeconomic
regions of the country and also according to the type of area (rural/urban). It is noted that
these data are not featured in the 2015 ENBCM.

Expenditures were estimated per governorate on the basis of the number of inhabitants and
average expenditure calculated for the relevant region. The average expenditure per region
during the period considered (2013-2015) was calculated on the basis of the average
expenditure increase tariffs calculated between 2005 and 2010.

Over the 2013-2015 period, the average expenditures on soap purchase for personal
hygiene were estimated at TND 30 million,26 with 84 % incurred in urban areas.

  5          WASH Accounts findings
  The data collected were structured into a database developed by the Consultant. This
  interactive database may, in the future, be used to estimate financial flows in the WASH
  sector when making WASH Accounts calculations. After the processing and compilation of
  the data, it became possible to develop WASH Accounts - detailed in Annex A - and highlight
  a number of indicators described and analyzed in this section.

WASH Accounts for Tunisia



Overall expenditures

A review of the indicators shows that the total expenditures of the WASH sector in Tunisia
increased from TND 958 million in 2013 to TND 1,317 million in 2015, entailing an annual
increase rate of 17%. Taking into account the inflation rates observed over the review period
(5.7% in 2013, 4.8% in 2014, and 4.1% in 2015), the average annual increase in real terms is
12%.

The amount of WASH expenditures, as a share of the GDP, has also increased over the
review period but to a lesser extent (approximately 10%).

Total expenditures in the WASH sector in Tunisia, estimated on the basis of WASH
Accounts, make up an average of 1.4% the GDP. This percentage is higher than that of
Brazil (1.1 %) and lower than that of Morocco (2.3 %). This percentage is much lower than
that of other social sectors in Tunisia, such as health, whose expenditures made up 7.1% of
the GDP in 2013.

The total expenditures of the WASH sector, when considering the full population, increased
from TND 88.2 per capita in 2013 to TND 118.1 per capita in 2015.

For year 2014, the water and sanitation expenditures calculated in relation with the number
of inhabitants amount to TND 96 per capita. However, this rate fails to reflect the wide
variations across governorates. It ranges from 50 TND/cap. in the governorate of Sidi Bouzid
to 148 TND/cap. in the governorate of Tunis.

The amount of the total expenditures of the WASH sector in Tunisia, as a share of the total
expenditures of the Government, increased from 3.6% in 2013 to 4.9% in 2015.

The share of public expenditures on the WASH sector in Tunisia, as a share of the total
expenditures of the Government (including debt offices), increased from 1.0% in 2013 to
1.8% in 2015. This increase shows that the importance that public policies give to the WASH
sector is increasing.

Expenditures per sector

The majority of WASH sector expenditures were incurred for water and sanitation.
Expenditures on support, water resources, and hygiene make up but only 5% of the amount
of the total expenditures.

The share of water expenditures in total WASH sector expenditures increased from 65% in
2013 to 69% in 2015, whereas the share of sanitation expenditures decreased from 28% in
2013 to 25% in 2015 over the same period.

Expenditures per use

The total expenditures on domestic use make up approximately 80% of the total
expenditures of the WASH sector.

WASH Accounts for Tunisia



Expenditures per type of funding

The funding mobilized by operators and generated from the sale of water and sanitation
services make up approximately 65% of the overall funding. It must nevertheless be reported
that the share of these funding decreased from 68% in 2013 to 60% in 2015. This decrease
is mainly accounted for by the rate freeze of water services in 2015. Public transfers
consequently increased from 18% in 2013 to 21% in 2015.27

The share of expenditures per repayable funding (loans) nearly doubled from 2013 to 2015,
increasing from 6% in 2013 to 12% in 2015.

The contribution of self-supplied households decreased from 5.4% in 2013 to 4.5% in 2015.

Expenditures per type of cost

The review of expenditures per type of cost highlights the following:

         They are predominated by operating expenditures which make up approximately 65%
          of all WASH sector and water expenditures, and 55% of sanitation expenditures.

         Expenditures on major maintenance operations make up 5% of the total expenditures
          of the WASH sector. However, this percentage does not reflect the fact that there are
          wide variations across sectors and they are especially low in the water sector (under
          1%), against over 15% in the sanitation sector.28

5.2        Geographic distribution of WASH sector expenditures

The estimation of the geographic distribution of WASH expenditures pertained only to water
and sanitation services, which make up approximately 95% of the total expenditures of the
sector. The other components of the sector's expenditures, namely sector support and water
resource management cannot be disaggregated per type of area or governorate.

5.2.1      Distribution per type of area (rural/urban)

The figures hereafter show the distribution of the expenditures and their structure per type of
area in the WASH sector, as well as in the water and sanitation sectors.

It emerges from these graphs that the overall expenditures of the WASH sector, in urban, as
well as rural areas have increased, with the share of rural areas improving from 19% in 2013
to 22% in 2015.


27
   According to the financial statements of SONEDE and ONAS, SONEDE paid taxes amounting to approximately
TND 5.2 million in 2014 and approximately TND 7 million in 2015. ONAS paid taxes amounting to approximately
TND 2 million in 2013. The VAT paid by SONEDE's customers (18 %) was taken into account in calculating fiscal
costs. However, it is noted that VAT does not apply to sanitation fees.
28
   The item “Major maintenance” includes rehabilitation projects by SONEDE and ONAS. As for projects
implemented by the Rural Engineering Services all the expenditure were put under the item “investment” given
the lack of specific data. This assumption may lead to underestimating of major maintenance expenditure given
that a big share of investment is dedicated to rehabilitation in rural areas. Taking as an alternative assumption
that half of the investment made by DGGREE are for rehabilitation projects, the share of “major maintenance”
would increase from 1% to about 3%. Due to the lack of reliable data on the share of “major maintenance”
investment, these assumptions cannot be verified. This review highlights the need to improve information to allow
for monitoring upkeep and major maintenance activities, namely in rural areas.

However, although the share of water expenditures in rural areas is relatively significant (29
% in 2015), the share of sanitation remains extremely low (in the region of 2%).

WASH sector expenditures per capita in urban areas increased from 100 TND/cap in 2013 to
130 TND/cap in 2015, i.e. an annual average increase by 9%. Expenditures in rural areas
increased from 48 TND/cap in 2013 to 75 TND/cap in 2015, i.e. an annual average increase
by 16%.

The increase in WASH sector expenditures per capita in urban areas mainly owes to the
increase in water sector expenditures, which make up approximately 65% of the total.

5.2.2      Distribution per governorate

The figures hereafter describe the distribution of water and sanitation expenditures per
governorate and capita. The water and sanitation expenditures of the total population
increased from 83 TND/cap in 2013 to 112 TND/cap in 2015. However, these ratios hide
wide disparities across governorates. Extreme values were found in a few governorates.

The water and sanitation expenditures per capita in urban areas increased from 101
TND/cap in 2013 to 129 TND/cap in 2015, i.e. an annual increase by 13%. The highest levels
of expenditure were found in the governorates of Tozeur, Médnine, and Kébili and are due to
the exceptional expenditures incurred for the execution of the desalination plants projects in
these governorates.

Expenditures in rural areas increased from 48 TND/cap in 2013 to 74 TND/cap in 2015, i.e.
an annual increase by 25%. The ratio found in the governorate of Jendouba amounts to
nearly double of the average ratio, which owes to the expenditures made on the
implementation of the drinking water transfer line in rural areas project during the review
period.

The figure hereafter shows the average water and sanitation expenditures per governorate
and capita, as well as the poverty rates observed in 2015. It appears from this graph that
expenditures per capita and the governorate poverty rate are correlated to a certain extent. A
correlation coefficient of -0.748 is found, which confirms that water and sanitation
expenditures per capita increase as the poverty rate decreases.

     The figures hereafter show the distribution of expenditures, as well the structure of WASH
     expenditures per type of service. These figures mainly show that expenditures have
     increased across all types of service, although the share of rural drinking water has
     increased from 17% in 2013 to 20% in 2015, whereas that of urban drinking water decreased
     from 28% to 25% over the same period.

     5.1.2      WASH expenditures per type of provider

     The figures hereafter show the distribution of expenditures, as well the structure of WASH
     expenditures per type of provider. These figures mainly show that the expenditures of all
     providers have increased, with predomination from networked service provision companies,
     whose expenditures make up approximately 70% of the WASH sector. The share of these
     providers has slightly decreased (from 72% in 2013 to 71% in 2015) while the share of NGOs
     increased (6 % in 2013 to 8 % in 2015), mainly as the result of an increase in investment
     expenditures in rural drinking water infrastructures managed by GDAs.

     The sanitation sector is dominated by networked service provision companies, accounting for
     95% of the expenditures.

            reminded that expenditures relating to self-supplied non domestic use could not be
            assessed, it is noted that domestic use of provider services accounts for the largest part of
            the expenditures. Indeed, domestic use makes up 80% of the sector's expenditures, with
            75% going to provider services and 5% to self-supply. As a comparison, the share of self-
            supply in Tunisia is the same as in Morocco and ranks lower than that of Brazil (9 %).

5.1.4      WASH expenditures per type of cost

The figures hereafter show the distribution of WASH expenditures and expenditures in the
water and sanitation sectors, as well as the structures of the expenditures per type of cost. It
mainly appears from these figures that:

        Operating costs account for the largest part of WASH expenditures but their share is
         decreasing in favor of investment expenditures, in the water sector (Figure 21), as
         well as sanitation sector (Figure 22).

        The share of expenditures on major maintenance in the WASH sector decreased
         from 6% in 2013 to 5% in 2015.

        The share of major maintenance operations in the water sector is low (under 1%),
         which negatively impacts network performance - for instance, SONEDE recorded 28
         breaks per 100km of network in 2013, and this figure increased to 32 in 2014 and 34
         in 2015.

        The share of major maintenance operations is bigger in the sanitation sector, as
         compared to the water one. This could be accounted for by the impacts of the harsh
         environment on the life of the infrastructures.

      5.2        Funding of the WASH sector

      5.2.1      WASH expenditures per type of funding

      The figures hereafter show the distribution of WASH expenditures and expenditures in the
      water and sanitation sectors, as well as the structures of the expenditures per type of
      funding. These figures mainly show that:

               Tariffs for service provision are the main source of funding with a share of
                approximately 65%. It must nevertheless be reported that the share of these funding
                decreased from 68% in 2013 to 60% in 2015. This is due to the fact that the increase
                in sector expenditures did not go hand in hand with a similar tariff increase. The water
                sector accounts for the largest part of the decrease of the share of tariffs. Public
                transfers consequently increased from 18% in 2013 to 21% in 2015.

               The share of expenditures per repayable funding (loans) nearly doubled from 2013 to
                2015, increasing from 6% in 2013 to 12% in 2015. The increase in this category of
                expenditure is most notable in the water sector where it went up from 5% in 2013 to
                13% in 2015.

               Over the 2013-2015 period, the share of funding by donation amounted to an average
                of 3%.

               The contribution of self-supplied households decreased from 5.4% in 2013 to 4.5% in
                2015.

     5.2.2      Public and private expenditures

     This paragraph groups the different types of funding mentioned in the previous paragraph
     into two types of expenditures, i.e. public or private. Public expenditures include national and
     international public transfers, as well as donor repayable funding, whereas private
     expenditures encompass tariffs for services provided and self-supply expenditures.

     The figures hereafter show the distribution of WASH expenditures and expenditures in the
     water and sanitation sectors, as well as the structure of expenditures in these two categories
     of funding. The figures mainly show that:

             Even though private expenditures, mainly comprised of tariffs, increased in volume on
              annual basis by approximately 10% over the 2013-2015 period, their share has
              significantly decreased to 64% in year 2015, against 72% in 2014 and 73% in 2013.
              This decrease was compensated by an increase in the public expenditure share. This
              raises the issue of the actions that national authorities will need to take in terms of

         tariff adjustment and public expenditure increase in the sector, while taking into
         account the financial balance of key operators.

        It is noted that the share of public expenditures in the sanitation sector is larger than
         in the water sector.

        The increase in public expenditures owes mostly to the water sector. In 2015, these
         expenditures were multiplied by 1.7 as compared to 2014.

5.2.3      Public and private expenditures per governorate

Public expenditures
The figures hereafter describe the distribution of public expenditures in the water and
sanitation sectors per governorate and capita.

The amount of public expenditures in the water sector across the total population increased
from 11 TND/cap in 2013 to 25 TND/cap in 2015. However, these ratios hide wide disparities
across governorates.

Public expenditures in the sanitation sector increased from 11 TND/cap in 2013 to 14
TND/cap in 2015. The increase in public expenditures recorded in the sanitation sector over
the 2013-2015 period is not very significant compared to the ones recorded in the water
sector. This reflects the fact that public expenditure efforts in the water sector are more
sustained than in the sanitation sector.

The amount of private expenditures in the water sector across the total population increased
from 47 TND/cap in 2013 to 56 TND/cap in 2015. The highest ratios were recorded in the
biggest water consumption centers (Greater Tunis, Sahel, Gabes and Médnine).

Private expenditures in the sanitation sector increased from 14 TND/cap in 2013 to 16
TND/cap in 2014 and 2015. The highest ratios were also recorded in the same big centers of
water consumption.

Public and private expenditures in the water sector
The following figures show the public and private expenditures per capita and governorate in
the water sector, as well as the correlations between these expenditures and poverty rates.30

Public expenditures in the water sector accounts on average for 25% of the total amount of
expenditures. Zaghouan, Kef, Bejà, Sidi Bouzid, Kairouan, Kasserine, and Siliana (Figure
33).

A low positive correlation (0.3) is observed between public expenditures per capita and
poverty rates per governorate (Figure 34). This indicates that public resources could be
better targeted when it comes to poverty per governorate. On the other hand, a strong
negative correlation (-0.8) was noted between private expenditures per capita and poverty
rates per governorate (Figure 35). This indicates that private expenditures, mainly comprised
of tariffs and household investments, are better borne in regions where poverty rates are
lower - i.e. water consumption is lower among the poor than the non-poor. The poor also
incur less expenditures on bottled water.

Public and private expenditures in the sanitation sector
The following figures show public and private expenditures per capita and governorate in the
sanitation sector, as well as the correlations between expenditures and poverty rates.

Public expenditures in the sanitation sector accounts on average for 43% of the total amount
of expenditures. The highest ratios were observed in the governorates of Gafsa, Siliana,
Nabeul, and Manouba (Figure 36).

WASH Accounts for Tunisia



Public expenditures per capita in the sanitation sector and poverty rates per governorate
(Figure 37) are in negative correlation (-0.5), which indicates that public resources are not
adequately targeted at the regions that need them the most. This is partly due to the lack of
definition of responsibilities for sanitation in rural areas where poverty is concentrated and
the lack of public subsidies to encourage households to invest in on-site sanitation systems.
As such, although the distribution of public resources for sanitation appears necessary,
especially in rural and poor areas, responsibilities relating to service provision should be
clearly defined before any reallocation of public resources is made.

A strong negative correlation (-0.7) is also observed between private expenditures on
sanitation per capita and poverty rates per governorate (Figure 38). This result is no surprise,
given that there are no formal service providers in rural areas - i.e. households do not pay
any tariffs for sanitation services in rural areas. Self-supply expenditures are lowest among
the poor.

                 WASH sector funding in the water sector are mainly channeled by networked service
                  provision companies (SONEDE and ONAS), followed by national authorities
                  (MARHP) for the sanitation sector and non-networked service provision companies
                  (cistern water sale).

                 The share of funding channeled by non-networked companies (cistern water sale,
                  bottled water, septic tank emptying, etc.) amounts to approximately 14%.

6          Conclusions
This is the first detailed study on financial flows for the water, sanitation and hygiene sector
in Tunisia. Although information may be missing or may be incomplete, the review gives a
picture of the total amount of expenditures and their allocation between urban and rural
areas, governorates and the different sectors.

The TrackFin methodology also allows for a specific breakdown between different types of
costs, sources of funding (public or private), types of providers, and other relevant
categories. The main purpose of the TrackFin methodology is to develop the WASH sector’s
accounts. Each account provides answers to specific questions and can help in public policy
decision-making.

The review’s findings allow for the following conclusions:

        Total expenditures in the WASH sector increased over the review period (2013-2015)
         from TND 958 million to TND 1,317 million, i.e. an annual increase of 17% in nominal
         terms. Taking into account the inflation rates observed over the review period (5.7%
         in 2013, 4.8% in 2014, and 4.1% in 2015), the average annual increase in real terms
         is 12%. The expenditures, expressed as a share of the GDP, also slightly increased
         from 1.3% to 1.5%. Nevertheless, spending for the sector remains at a low level and
         below that estimated for the health sector, i.e. about 7% of the GDP in 2013.

        Nearly two-thirds of the expenditures were allocated to the water sector against the
         sanitation and hygiene sectors. The share of expenditures going to hygiene is low,
         making barely 4% of the total expenditures for the WASH sector.

        Most expenditures relate to domestic use.

        Although expenditures between rural and urban areas may be uneven, with more
         resources allocated to the urban environment, the allocation of total WASH
         expenditures per capita between urban and rural areas is similar. Thus, there is no
         sound evidence of inequities between rural and urban areas as for total expenditures.
         Nevertheless, estimates show that there are inequities in public spending on
         sanitation. Since poverty rates are higher in rural areas and there is a negative
         correlation between per capita public spending and poverty rates at the governorate
         level, one may conclude that public resources for sanitation could be better targeted.
         It should be noted, however, that the low level of public expenditures on rural
         sanitation is linked to the lack of clear definition of responsibilities for the provision of
         services.

        On the other hand, with regard to public expenditures for the water sector, estimates
         show that there is a positive correlation between expenditures and poverty rate by
         governorate. Thus, one may conclude that public spending on water is relatively well
         targeted. Nevertheless, there is a negative correlation between per capita private
         expenditures (especially tariffs) and poverty rates by governorate, which is linked to
         lower consumption among the poor and also lower spending on bottled water.

        Most resources for the sector come from tariffs paid for services provided (around
         60% in 2015) and public transfers (around 21%). It should be noted that repayable
         funding doubled over the review period from 6% in 2013 to 12% in 2015.

        Most of the expenditures are allocated to operation and maintenance (almost two
         thirds), and only 5% of the expenditures is allocated to major maintenance (renewal,
         replacement and rehabilitation of water supply systems, etc.). This allocation hides
         significant disparities across sectors and particularly low expenditures on major
         maintenance for the water sector (less than 1%), compared with more than 15% for
         the sanitation sector. These estimates are consistent with previous studies that report
         that the majority of GDAs (in rural areas) are able to cover their operating costs, but
         only 20% also cover maintenance costs. However, cost classification should be
         improved in the GDA monitoring system in order to allow for making the distinction
         between maintenance activities aimed at improving the functionality of existing
         facilities and major rehabilitation works that are classified as investment.

7          Recommendations for future WASH accounts
This effort to prepare for the first time Tunisia’s WASH Accounts has allowed for mapping out
the sector’s actors and for estimating total funding flows to the sector.

It was agreed that the actual value of WASH Accounts would come out from repeating this
exercise in the future, as a tool to track expenditures in the sector, namely under the
implementation of the five-year development plan (2015-2019). The Government’s five-year
plan includes public investment in sanitation, water resources management, and rural
drinking water, but do not include SONEDE’s investment. It provides for investments in
sanitation amounting to about TND 1,000 million, i.e. about TND 200 million per year or twice
the amount of investment made in 2015. As for water, the amount provided, including for
water resources management and investment in extension to rural areas, is TND 2,553 over
the five-year period.

Information coming out of the WASH Accounts will also provide a better basis for the drafting
of the next development plan as well as for sector resources allocation. Thus, WASH
accounts could be established again in two or three years and, if so, it would be necessary
from now on to improve sector data, especially financial data, so as to fine-tune the review
and enhance its reliability in the future.

Financial data on the water and sanitation services are available for most actors but
considerable efforts had to be made to process data and compile them according to the
TrackFin methodology. The key operators, namely the Ministry of Agriculture, Water
Resources and Fisheries, SONEDE, and ONAS have information systems with the capability
to generate financial information.

However, the exercise also pointed to some challenges relating to the availability of the data
needed. Therefore, a number of recommendations are presented below for the preparation
of Tunisia’s WASH Accounts in the future.

        Financial data for S3- Support to the WASH sector and S4-Water Resources
         Management in relation to water and sanitation services are very difficult to obtain or
         are even unavailable. As a consequence, the Consultant based its estimates on the
         percentages of the operating costs of the budgets of the ministries of agriculture and
         environment in relation to the WASH sector. The expenditures for these two sub-
         services could be better estimated on one hand by better defining the structures
         involved, and on the other by improving the method used for estimating the
         percentage of time allocated by these structures to provide support and to ensure
         water resources management in order to deduct the associated expenditures.

        For households served by GDAs, the data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture
         on the GDAs-DWS cover about one third of the total number of GDAs. The reliability
         of the data received is difficult to prove. Significant efforts have been made by the
         ministry to collect data from the GDAs and these efforts need to be strengthened to
         supplement missing data and improve data reliability.

        For households served by non-networked service providers (water sales by tank,
         septic tank emptying, etc.), data are available on their number and sources of supply,
         but data expenditures on these services are not available from providers. These

         expenditures could be better identified through Household Budget and Consumption
         Surveys (ENBCM).

        For self-supplied households, data are available on their number, sources of
         supply (wells, majel), and sanitation methods (open pits, latrines, etc.), but
         expenditures incurred for self-supply are not available. These expenditures could be
         better identified through Household Budget and Consumption Surveys (ENBCM). It
         should be noted that in the current surveys, questions on expenditures in the water
         sector pertain to the purchase of market water. There are no specific questions on
         self-supply and in particular on sanitation where expenditures are included in the
         expenditures on SONEDE’s bills or included in other items (masonry, cement, etc.).

        Investment expenditures incurred by real estate developers could not be collected for
         this exercise. The data can be extracted from ONAS’ accounting (as an item included
         in tangible assets), but doing so, care should be given to taking into account the time
         between the disbursement period and receipt by ONAS.

        Data on expenditures on self-supplied sanitation services for non-domestic use
         could not be collected or estimated due to a lack of information sources. This
         information could be the subject of a specific investigation.

        Data on hygiene activities at the household level, such as the purchase of soap for
         bodily hygiene, are not included in the last ENCBM survey (2015) though they were
         available from the previous survey rounds (2005 and 2010). It is recommended to
         maintain this information in the next survey rounds.

        The review period selected for the study (2013-2015) is characterized by almost no
         appropriate increase in water tariffs. However, the water tariff sharply increased in
         2016 at a rate of 15%. Therefore, it is recommended to renew the exercise in two or
         three years to understand the effect of this increase.

More generally, it should be pointed out that while the guidance document for the TrackFin
methodology was developed in a clear way with a pedagogical approach, the methodology
comes with many specific features, which, in our opinion, calls for:

        Dissemination of the methodology to all stakeholders involved in the preparation of
         WASH accounts (actors, national statistics agency, etc.).

        Support by all partners based on the understanding of the scope and interest of the
         development of WASH accounts.

        Consideration of the requirements for the development of WASH accounts by data
         providers.
