             Improvements in the Business Environment are Confirmed by Other Indicators

 Improvements in the business environment are confirmed by other indicators, namely: (i) the World Bank’s Regulatory
 Quality Indicator (RQI), and (ii) the Economic Freedom Index (EFI), developed by the Heritage Foundation. There are
 however some significant differences, compared with DB rankings. Both the RQI and EFI confirm Rwanda’s marked
 improvement, although its lead on Liberia and Sierra Leone is narrower, both in absolute and relative terms. This is
 particularly the case for the rate of improvement, with the RQI showing Liberia and Sierra Leone improving their
 business environment at a pace similar to that of Rwanda. Also, according to both indicators, Burkina Faso’s positioning
 is much better than the one in DB rankings, as it comes in a close second to Rwanda. For South Sudan, the RQI
 captures in part the improvements in the basic legal and institutional framework that are neglected by DB. While these
 differences must not be overemphasized, they nonetheless clearly highlight the importance of the choice of yardstick
 against which performance is assessed.

        The surveys of local SME were aimed at:
          •	 Investigating SME’s perceptions regarding the evolution of the business environment, with special emphasis on
             aspects covered by the WBG programs;
          •	 Collecting information on investments and employment useful for estimating the impact of IC reforms; and
          •	 Assessing the influence of IC reforms on the formalization of firms that had been previously operating informally.

        The surveys covered firms established after the launch of the IC programs (in practice, firms registered in 2008 or
        2009) and that were still in existence in early 2014. They covered firms based in the capital city and another location,
        usually the second largest urban center.4 The surveys were initially expected to cover between 25-30 SME per country,
        and because of the small sample size, they were essentially exploratory in character without the ambition of generating
        statistically significant results. However, during implementation it was decided to expand the coverage of the survey
        in Rwanda in order to increase the robustness of data. All in all, the surveys covered 209 SME, of which 30 were in
        Burkina Faso, 28 in Liberia, 101 in Rwanda, 25 in Sierra Leone, and 25 in South Sudan.

   	 The starting point for the reform counting exercise was a list of IC reforms tracked by WBG over the FY08-13 period, accompanied by a description of reforms supported
     in FY10-13. This information was verified and augmented (namely, to account for and describe earlier reforms) with elements retrieved from WBG project documents,
     the FIAS Annual Reviews and the DB reports. It is important to note that counting reforms is a complex exercise, fraught with both conceptual and practical difficulties.
     In fact, the definition of reform used by the WBG varied overtime and the various sources analyzed are not always consistent. More importantly, some reforms claimed by
     WBG documents in reality have little to do with WBG activities, as they were driven by other factors (typically, other donor/IFI initiatives). These reforms were eliminated
     from the reform count but there remain several doubtful cases, in which the role played by the WBG was seemingly modest. Therefore, the figures presented here are likely
     to overestimate the WBG contribution to IC reforms.
11
   	 In the case of Sierra Leone, the reform count includes a couple of reforms implemented after the end of WBG operations at end 2011 but that can be traced back to the
     advice provided by the WBG programs.

     WBG work in trade logistics has parallels in a number of other donor/IFI initiatives. In Liberia for instance,
     the introduction of ASYCUDA World was financed by AfDB; the EU assisted in the revision of the Customs
     Code; USAID financed the construction of the Customs House at the port of Monrovia; and ICF financed the
     computerization of the Customs Department. In Rwanda, customs reform received extensive support from DFID;
     the scanners used to speed up inspections were financed by the World Bank; while the introduction of the electronic
     single window was supported by TMEA. In Burkina Faso, customs modernization was extensively supported by the
     EU, with funds channeled through UEMOA, and additional support from ICF. Such a multitude of complementary
     interventions makes it extremely difficult to assess with any degree of accuracy the contribution of WBG programs.

     	 This figure is probably too generous, due to the presence of some duplications. For instance, in Sierra Leone, the WBG counts as separate reforms both the enactment of
       the Credit Reference Act (in FY11) and the actual setting up of the central bank’s credit reference system (in FY12). Similarly, in Rwanda, the enactment of the Insolvency
       Law of 2013, was counted twice by WBG, under both the insolvency and investor protection headings. The latter situation, is quite common in DB reports, with several
       cases of a single legal act being yielding more than one reform. For more details, see the comments to the various IC reforms listed in Annex B.

                            Box 5.4 Counterfactual Assessment of Business Registrations in Rwanda

     In the case of Rwanda, the impact of IC reforms on business registrations was also assessed using the so-called
     Synthetic Control Method (SCM), which involves the building of a counterfactual scenario based on experiences from
     comparable economies. Due to data limitations, it was only possible to compare Rwanda with a limited number of
     comparator countries, which reduces the significance of the analysis. Subject to this major caveat, the results are quite
     similar to those obtained through simpler extrapolation techniques. In fact, based on the SCM exercise, the number
     of incremental registrations attributable to IC reforms for the 2009-2013 period can be estimated at about 19,400,
     which is not too different from the 21,000 resulting from the comparison of historic and actual trends. A more detailed
     analysis is provided in Annex E.

                                              Box 5.5 Influence of IC Reforms on Enterprise Types

 IC reforms, and in particular reforms of business registration procedures, cover all enterprise types but usually go
 deeper for firms adopting a corporate form, i.e. limited liability companies and corporations. As a result, the share of
 companies in total registrations has been increasing overtime. The change was quite marked in Rwanda and Burkina
 Faso, where the share of more ‘sophisticated’ enterprise types nearly doubled. Signs of a growing preference for
 companies are also noticeable in Liberia and Sierra Leone, but data limitations do not allow for a full appreciation of
 long-term trends. The exception is South Sudan, where companies have always been the predominant enterprise type.

   	 In Rwanda, business registry sources estimated previously informal firms to account for about 25-30% of all new registrations, at least up to 2010. In Burkina Faso, a study on firms
     registered in the late 2000s found that formalized firms accounted for 23% of all new registrations. See Maison de l’Entreprise du Burkina Faso, Etude sur le profil des créateurs

                Box 5.6 Difficulties in Assessing the Impact of FDI Attraction Activities
 Foreign investors’ decisions are based on a variety of considerations, and structural aspects, such as security conditions,
 access to certain resources or the size of the prospective market, typically play a key role. Therefore, promotional activities
 enter into the equation only indirectly to the extent that they are able to effectively communicate the desirable features
 of possible investment destinations. Similar considerations apply to aftercare services, which are only one of the many
 factors that contribute to transforming investors’ initial expressions of interest into tangible investments. Also, the
 importance of FDI attraction initiatives varies across sectors and investor types, being comparatively less important for
 multinational investors active in resource-based activities, as they are accustomed to operating in difficult environments.
 Finally, information on FDI initiatives is usually less than ideal, as the figures on prospective investment and job
 creation issued by investors are often inflated. Under these circumstances, it is extremely difficult to objectively measure
 the impact of FDI attraction initiatives and one has to resort to circumstantial evidence, which in turn, introduces an
 element of subjectivity.

                         cost savings – Methodology

Private Sector Cost Savings (PSCS) are defined as savings accruing to private economic agents as a result of
reforms in the investment climate. PSCS can result from three situations, namely:
     •	 A reduction in out of pocket expenses associated with the abolishment/simplification of certain procedures
        (‘cost savings’);
     •	 A reduction in the time spent by private operators in dealing with certain procedures that have been
        abolished/simplified (‘time savings’); and
     •	 A reduction in the financial burden related to changes in the payment profile for certain procedures
        (‘financial savings’).

Cost savings refer to two items, namely: (i) the elimination/reduction of certain fees (stamp duties, service
fees, etc.), and (ii) the elimination/reduction of the need to rely on service providers for certain formalities
(e.g. elimination of the obligation to hire a solicitor to prepare and sign the Memorandum and Articles of
Association).

Time savings refer to the gains in terms of opportunity cost of labor resulting from regulatory simplification
and/or from the adoption of improved organizational models for certain services. This is relevant for a wide
range of areas of intervention, from business registration (e.g. as a result of the establishment of one stop
facilities) to taxation (e.g. reduced number of tax forms to file).

Financial savings result from the reduction in the financial burden shouldered by private operators as a result
of changes in the payment modalities for certain fees or taxes. For instance, in Sierra Leone, following WBG
recommendations, the government decided to eliminate the tax advance payment system for newly registered
companies, and this provides some cash flow advantages to tax payers.

Estimating PSCS. In analytical terms, estimating PSCS is quite a straightforward exercise, as it essentially
involves the multiplication of a ‘price element’, i.e. the savings achieved in one particular case, times a ‘quantity
element’, i.e. the number of relevant observations, referred to as ‘transactions’.

The price element depends upon the nature of the reform under consideration. In the case of cost savings, e.g.
the elimination of a certain fee or tax, the impact can generally be ascertained quickly. However, when the fee
is expressed in ad valorem terms it is necessary to make reference to the value of the goods on which the fee is
levied. The value of time savings is the result of the multiplication of the time saved thanks to a certain reform
(expressed in terms of hours) times the unit value of labor (expressed in hourly total labor costs). Finally, the
value of financial savings is determined by multiplying the amount of the payment deferred thanks to a certain
reform by the relevant interest rate.

The nature of the quantity element, i.e. the number of transactions, also differs depending upon the reform
considered. In certain cases, e.g. the registration of newly established businesses, the number of transactions
coincides with the number of economic agents affected by a certain reform. In other cases, e.g. the payment of
a certain tax, the number of transactions is the result of the multiplication of the number of economic agents
subject to the tax times the number of times these agents have to undergo a certain procedure.

Two further aspects are worth highlighting. First, PSCS are calculated for the whole life of IC projects. As
benefits may occur at different points in time, in order to properly aggregate annual values it is necessary to
proceed to compounding, taking the terminal year of the project as the reference point. This is done using the
relevant real interest rate. Second, some costs incurred by private operators (e.g. fees on specific transactions) are
deductible for profit tax purposes, and this reduces the burden of complying with regulations. Therefore, in order
to calculate the net impact of reforms, it is necessary to adjust the savings considering the relevant profit tax
rate. However, this does not apply to economic agents subject to simplified tax regimes involving the payment
of a flat tax or a turnover tax.

Practical Issues. While the method of calculating PSCS is relatively simple, the method is data intensive and
significant problems may arise in collecting the relevant information. Data were retrieved from a variety of
primary and secondary sources and the exercise proved quite challenging. In the case of time savings, information
on the time required to comply with the various procedures was usually obtained from professionals active in the
relevant fields, sometimes supplemented with data drawn from documentary sources (e.g. the time to comply
with tax payments published in DB Reports). In the case of cost savings, data on fees imposed on private
businesses were retrieved from official sources. Data collection was particularly complex in the case of fees
expressed in ad valorem terms, as this required also estimating the value of the assets on which the fees and
taxes were levied (i.e. the value of land plots being registered or the value of buildings for which a construction
permit is required). Similarly, in the case of financial savings, it was necessary to estimate the value of the tax
payments postponed. Finally, in several cases the identification of the population affected, i.e. the number of
economic agents or the number of transactions benefiting from reforms, posed significant problems and it was
often necessary to resort to crude estimates.

PSCS vs. Compliance Cost Savings. The PSCS concept is similar to that of Compliance Cost Savings (CCS)
that are commonly used by the WBG to assess the impact of IC reform projects.31 However there are significant
differences between PSCS and CCS, concerning the nature of cost savings considered and, especially, the
method of calculations. First, the notion of PSCS is broader of that of CCS, as it also includes financial savings,
which instead are not considered when computing CCS. Second, PSCS are calculated with reference to the
terminal year of IC projects, whereas CCS are calculated with reference to the ‘baseline’ year. Accordingly, in
the case of PSCS the savings occurring at different points in time over the period analyzed are compounded
using the relevant rate, while in the case of CCS the cost savings are discounted back to the ‘baseline’ year. Third,
PSCS refer to ‘life time’ cost savings of IC reforms, i.e. consider cost savings irrespective of when the reforms
were implemented during the reference period. Instead, CCS consider cost savings over only a period of four
years, under the assumption that after a period of four years, the reforms would still be implemented even
without WBG assistance. Fourth, and most important, PSCS are calculated considering the actual number of
transactions over the relevant period, whereas CCS are calculated with reference to the number of transactions
in the ‘baseline’ year. In practice, in the case of PSCS the number of transactions is assumed to reflect a ‘natural’
trend, not influenced by the reform. There are, however, two exceptions in which the reforms are indeed
considered to have influenced the number of transactions.32 In these cases, the actual number of transactions is
replaced by the predicted number of transactions, on the basis of the trend prevailing in the pre reform period.
As a result of the above, for any given reform the value of PSCS is greater than the value of CCS.

        Annex D: Assessment of Sustainability – Methodology

This annex illustrates the approach used in the analysis of the sustainability of WBG-supported IC reforms.
The analysis covers a total of 39 reforms, across all the five countries and 11 reform areas. In several cases, more
than one reform were implemented in succession within the same reform area. As these reforms are obviously
linked, the sustainability analysis is carried out for homogenous groups of reforms. Also, while the analysis mostly
focuses on reforms that have been in place for some time (‘completed reforms’), in a few cases an assessment is
also provided for reforms that have just been completed or that are still ongoing (‘recent/ongoing reforms’).

The assessment of sustainability focuses on three aspects, namely: (i) the current degree of sustainability (i.e.
reflecting the situation at end 2013/early 2014); (ii) the factors influencing sustainability; and (iii) the prospects
for future sustainability. In the case of completed reforms, the assessment concerns all three aspects, whereas
for recent/ongoing reforms no assessment of the current sustainability is provided. The exercise makes use of
a Reform Sustainability Assessment Tool, which is based off a similar instrument developed by the WBG’s
Investment Climate’s Impact Program. This tool is illustrated in detail at the end of this Annex.

Assessment Criteria. The assessment of current and future sustainability is based on four criteria, corresponding
to the four basic dimensions of IC reform work, and focusing on:
     •	 The polices and/or laws and/or regulations developed and adopted with WBG support;
     •	 The administrative procedures developed and adopted with WBG support;
     •	 The institutions and/or coordination mechanisms established/strengthened with WBG support; and
     •	 The operational and/or analytical tools developed and adopted with WBG support.

For each criterion a score is provided on a 1 to 4 scale, with 1 representing the least favorable situation (e.g.
law abolished) and 4 being the most favorable outcome (e.g. law still fully in force). Individual scores are
subsequently combined, using a weighting system (see below), so as to provide a summary assessment, also on
a 1 to 4 scale. The ratings used for the summary assessment are indicated in the table below. It should be noted
that the rating system for the current degree of sustainability is deliberately narrower than the one used for
future sustainability, as the ex post perspective allows for a more precise assessment of the various factors at play.

                        Current Degree of Sustainability                   Prospects for Future Sustainability
             Rating        Assessment                           Rating          Assessment
            3.9 - 4.0      Reform fully sustainable            3.6 - 4.0        Positive sustainability prospects
            3.1 - 3.8      Reform mostly sustainable           3.1 - 3.5        Fairly positive sustainability prospects
            2.1 - 3.0      Reform partly sustainable           2.1 - 3.0        Uncertain sustainability prospects
            1.0 - 2.0      Reform not sustainable              1.0 - 2.0        Negative sustainability prospects


Not all the assessment criteria are equally relevant for all IC reforms. In general, the assessment of ‘purely’
legislative or regulatory reforms (e.g. the enactment of a new company law) does not require the assessment
of institutional aspects. Instead, an institutional analysis is necessary in the case of reforms involving the
modification of operational procedures (e.g. the reform of procedures for tax audit) and/or the setting up or
strengthening of institutions (e.g. an investment promotion agency, a one-stop-shop for business registration,
etc.). Therefore, IC reforms were categorized into four typologies, namely: (i) classical simplification initiatives,

involving the ‘cutting’ of procedures and/or fees (SIM); (ii) policy and legal reform initiatives (P&L); (iii)
institution strengthening initiatives (INS); and (iv) ‘mixed’ initiatives, combining simplification and/or policy
and legal reform with institution strengthening (MIX). For each reform type, different weights were assigned
to the four assessment criteria. The weights used are shown in the table below.

       Reform Type              Polices and/or Laws                    Administrative                    Operational and/or                  Institutions and/or
                                and/or Regulations                      Procedures                        Analytical Tools                Coordination Mechanisms
            SIM                                           75%                                                                       25%
           P&L                                            75%                                                                       25%
            INS                                                              25%                                                                      75%
            MIX                         25%                                  25%                                 25%                                  25%


Factors Influencing Sustainability. The analysis of the determinants of sustainability takes into account six
different factors, namely:
    •	 degree of commitment to the reform displayed by higher level government authorities;
    •	 degree of commitment to the reform displayed by government officials;
    •	 degree of rent seeking prevailing in the pre reform situation and the opposition to reform from vested
       interests;
    •	 degree of support to the reform displayed by intended beneficiaries (i.e. typically, the business community)
       and/or by other stakeholders (i.e. typically, professionals — lawyers, etc.— or intermediaries somehow
       involved);
    •	 extent to which institutions responsible for implementing the reform can count on adequate material
       means; and
    •	 extent to which institutions responsible for implementing the reform can count on adequate human
       resources.

Each factor influencing sustainability is also scored on a 1 to 4 scale, with 1 being the least favorable situation
(e.g. government bureaucrats are/were strongly opposed to the reform) and 4 representing the most favorable
outcome (e.g. the institution is well endowed with material means). However, contrary to the assessment of
current and future sustainability, the scores attributed to the various factors are not combined into one single
summary rating, as the various elements are not ‘additive’. This part of the analysis is therefore only descriptive.

Reform Sustainability Assessment Tool. The Reform Sustainability Assessment Tool (the ‘Tool’) is broadly
based off the Sustainability Diagnostic Checklist (the ‘Checklist’) developed by the WBG’s Investment
Climate’s Impact Program.33 The Tool consists of three sections, dealing respectively with current sustainability,
factors affecting sustainability and prospects for future sustainability. Each section of the Tool consists of a
series of statements describing specific sustainability conditions (e.g. whether the ‘reformed’ legal texts are still
in force, whether the resources available to ‘reformed’ institutions are sufficient, etc.) and each statement is
scored in terms of its truthfulness (4 = the statement is true; 3 = the statement is mostly true; 2 = the statement
is mostly untrue; 1 = the statement is untrue). Each score is accompanied by a comment, providing the basis for
the assessment.

                      Annex E: Counterfactual Analysis of Business
                                 Registrations in Rwanda

The counterfactual analysis of business registrations in Rwanda relied on the so called Synthetic Control
Method (SCM). The SCM involves the creation of a control entity for a country (or other geographic area)
where a policy change (the ‘intervention’) has taken place (the ‘treatment country’). The control entity is called
‘synthetic’ because it is constructed using a linear combination of alternative countries where the intervention
has not taken place (the ‘control country’).34

In essence, the exercise aimed at replicating an earlier study35 that analyzed business registrations in Rwanda
in the year 2009, with a view to extending the analysis to subsequent years. However, the scope of the analysis
was limited by the lack of recent data on business registrations in several countries that could potentially
contribute to the construction of the ‘control country’. This reduced to number of comparator countries to
only five (Cambodia, Indonesia, Moldova, Pakistan and Uganda), of which ultimately only two were used to
construct the ‘Synthetic Rwanda’.

The diagram plotting business registration data for both Rwanda and Synthetic Rwanda is provided below.
The fit for the variable of interest (number of registrations per 1,000 people) in the pretreatment period
is reasonably good, but the features of Synthetic Rwanda as defined by a series of ‘control variables’ are at
times quite different from those of real Rwanda (e.g. GDP per capita of US$ 700 compared with US$ 330
for real Rwanda).
	
A comparison of the hypothetical business registrations in Synthetic Rwanda with actual registrations in
Rwanda in the 2009-2012 period yields a total of 13,579 incremental registrations attributable to IC reforms.
As the exercise only covers companies and assuming that a similar pattern would hold also for other firms
(sole proprietorships and partnerships), which account for about 30% of all registrations, the total number of
incremental registrations can be estimated at about 19,400, which is not too different from the 21,000 estimated
though the crude extrapolation for the 2009-2013 period.
