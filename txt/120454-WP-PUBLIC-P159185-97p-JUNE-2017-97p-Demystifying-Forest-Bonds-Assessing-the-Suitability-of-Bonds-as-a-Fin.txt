Executive Summary
Forests have been receiving increased attention over the past few years, particularly through international
climate change negotiations and efforts to develop a mechanism for reducing emissions from
deforestation and forest degradation. In many forest-rich countries, the implementation of the recently
declared COP21 INDC 1 targets builds significantly on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and emission
avoidance related to forests. Most of these countries will require considerable new investments in forestry
that can be realized only through an increased level of financing over the next few years. Given the scale of
the financing requirements, prevailing macroeconomic conditions, and fiscal constraints, it is unlikely that
these countries will be able to fund these programs alone.

Financing mechanisms, especially those related to carbon finance, have not yet been able to deliver the
resource flows necessary to sustain investments in the reforestation and restoration of degraded lands,
forest management, and forest conservation at required levels. While there have been some promising
examples for carbon-based forest finance on a pilot and/or project basis, these are largely reliant on single-
donor and one-off contributions rather than larger-scale institutionalized financing mechanisms with steady
income streams and cash flows. Forestry activities targeted by carbon finance may also not cover the entire
range of forest sector interventions needed to meet NDC targets. Although COP21 made important advances
for forest-based carbon finance, the overall resources available for global forest investments still fall far short
of what is required to meet investment needs under NDC.

With the limitations of conventional financing through donor-led approaches, bonds – especially Green
and Forest Bonds – have been increasingly viewed as a promising financing instrument to meet NDC-
related investments in the forestry sector with advantageous financing terms. However, available data on
the use of bonds to finance forest investments presents a sobering picture. Although the Green and Climate
Bonds market has been growing exponentially in recent years, the share of agriculture and forestry
investments supported by bonds is marginal and amounts to less than 3% of all such bonds.

This report presents a systematic assessment of the viability and comparative advantage of bonds as a
financing instrument to meet forest-based NDC targets. The assessment considers the sectoral framework
conditions of the forest sector and how these impact financing and investment decisions. Special reference
is made to Brazil as a case study. However, the analysis is relevant for the broader global discussion on NDC
financing for forest-based financing in other countries, as well as other sectors relevant to meeting NDC
targets. The report seeks to address the subject from an issuer perspective, and mainly for public sector
entities.

Forest country context
Many countries where the forest sector is important in meeting NDC commitments are characterized by
their high political risks and low economic performance, resulting in low credit ratings and higher costs of
public debt. These conditions not only make it more difficult to raise resources for public investments, they
also indicate a less favorable environment for private investments as these prefer low risk and stable
economic performance, especially investments in forestry that are long-term and commonly more sensitive.

   Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. The word “intended” was used because countries were
communicating proposed climate actions ahead of the Paris Agreement being finalized. However, as countries formally
join the Paris Agreement and look forward to implementing these climate actions, the “intended” is dropped and an
INDC is converted into a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). (WRI 2015b)

Reliable long-term land and tree tenure arrangements are the most important among the criteria required
by investors for making forest investments. Countries with lower development performance are confronted
with a range of important and urgent public investment priorities – not least those related to energy,
infrastructure, or education sectors. They must choose carefully which investments will yield the greatest
development benefits, commonly measured in economic growth and shared prosperity.

Among the rich set of forestry countries, Brazil represents a particularly pertinent example for analyzing
the use of bonds as a financing instrument for forest investments. Brazil’s GHG emission profile has
historically been characterized by the prominence of Land Use and Land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF),
which are mainly emissions related to deforestation and forest degradation in the Amazon and the Cerrado
biome. However, deforestation rates have been declining since 2004, and there has been a dramatic shift in
the pattern of emissions. By 2010 LULUCF accounted for less than 20% of the total, down from close to two-
thirds. To achieve this, Brazil has implemented important policy and governance reforms, especially targeting
re- and afforestation with the objective of restoring degraded and deforested landscapes. Forest restoration
is of particular importance for Brazil and is featured prominently in the NDCs, with an estimated cost between
R$ 31 and R$ 52 billion (USD 9.5–16 billion) over the next 25 years.

As is the case for many other forest countries, Brazil also faces a challenging development framework,
especially with respect to its macroeconomic performance. This poses significant hurdles for mobilizing
public resources needed for investments to meet NDC targets. The country’s growth performance has
continually declined since 2011, culminating in flat growth in 2014 and a contraction (i.e. negative growth)
of 3.8% in 2015. A devaluation of the currency increased the cost of raising money on international markets,
and rating agencies reduced Brazil’s long-term foreign-currency rating to BB with a negative outlook in 2016.
Brazil’s cost of issuing debt on the capital market increased substantially. The government had to pay more
than 16% interest to place its ten-year bonds in 2015. Since March 2016, yields have been returning to the
level of 2013–14.

Bonds, Green Bonds, and Forest Bonds
A bond is a debt instrument under which the issuer owes the holder a certain amount on which the issuer
pays interest. Investing in bonds is generally viewed as a lower-risk investment option compared with other
types of investment, such as stocks. Bonds guarantee a fixed income stream through interest payments and
the return of the principal payment at nominal value at maturity. The level of risk is dependent on two
factors: (1) the type of bond in question; and (2) the issuing entity. From an investor’s viewpoint, corporate
bonds typically yield higher returns than bonds issued by public entities because they are characterized by
higher risks of defaulting on their financial obligations, whereas countries “can always raise taxes”. In
contrast to this general rule, bonds issued by countries with unstable economies maybe characterized by a
higher risk premium than for corporate bonds issued by financially solid private sector issuers. For example,
in February, Moody’s (2016a, 2016c) rated the two Brazilian companies BRF and Fibria at Ba1, which was one
step higher than the Brazilian government credit rating of Ba2 at the time.

The concept of the Green Bond was developed in 2007 as a response to increased investor demands for
engagement in climate-related opportunities. The first entities to issue such a bond were the World Bank
and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The World Bank has issued over USD 9 billion worth of such bonds
through more than 125 transactions in 18 currencies (as of October 2016) since its first issuance in 2008. The
majority of eligible projects are from the energy (38%) and transport (34%) sectors. Only 12% of the eligible
projects fall into the category of agriculture, forestry, and ecosystem projects.

The underlying rationale for issuing Green Bonds is twofold: first, Green Bonds allow issuers to broaden
the investor base by reaching those investors that may not invest in a plain vanilla bond from the same
institution or corporation; second, Green Bonds can serve as a communication tool between issuer and
investor, especially with the objective of promoting environmental performance of issuers, which may not
be realized through plain vanilla bond issuances. From an investor perspective, the demand for Green Bonds
is commonly rooted in the need to demonstrate commitment to environmentally responsible investments.
Investors are increasingly focused on integrating environment, social and governance (ESG) factors into their
investment portfolios, and Green Bonds can meet their environmental objectives. In this context, the need
for independent certification of eligible proceed use becomes evident.

Different criteria and approaches to ensure that bond proceeds are indeed resulting in positive “green”
impacts have been established by financial groups, non-profit organizations, and corporate investment
firms. These “green” impacts can be related to climate and carbon emission reductions, targeting climate
adaptation benefits, waste reduction, or for sustainable forest management, reforestation and afforestation,
to list just a few. The three most common standards for labeling Green Bonds are the Green Bond Principles
(GBP), the Climate Bond Standards, and Green Bond Indices (key features are highlighted in Annex A).
However, the realities of certification of Green Bond investments as being “green” may be more flexible and
subject to interpretation than expected. CICERO (2016), for example, uses a dark green, medium green or
light green classification in its independent reviews of Green Bond frameworks. These “Shades of Green”
give investors a signal about the extent to which a project is contributing to building a low-carbon and
climate-resilient society by 2050.

Green and Forest Bonds market analysis
The market for officially labeled Green Bonds is expanding rapidly and important milestones have been
reached over the last three years. Until 2013 the Green Bonds market was comparatively small and
dominated by multilateral development banks such as EIB or World Bank, which were the first institutions to
issue Green Bonds. Since 2013, corporations have been starting to tap into the field of Green Bonds, and
municipalities have also launched their first Green Bonds.

In contrast to the general strong demand for Green Bonds, the forestry sector continues to play a negligible
role in this market. The volume of outstanding Green Bonds is USD 118 billion, with 2% being issued in the
forestry sector. The most important sectors are the energy sector, with more than USD 50 billion (43%), and
the buildings and industry sector, with USD 28.6 billion (24%). Bonds issued in the forestry and agriculture
sector, however, make up only USD 2.5 billion (2.1%). The amount of Green Bond issuances has grown
exponentially from USD 3.3 billion to over USD 80 billion in 2016 (CBI 2016b).

Bonds and Forest Investments: issues and approaches
Forest Bonds can be viewed as more encompassing than traditional timberland bonds that cover basic
needs like new infrastructure, equipment, refinancing, or working capital, although they are not focused
on environmental services for which payments have been elusive. At this point carbon finance is still an
emerging player in Forest Bond issuances and market prices for carbon credits are still low. Investors are
beginning to look at other assets that can be generated through forest-related investments (i.e. the role of
forests in providing environmental services like regular quantities of high-quality water or reducing the
likelihood of flooding), but the sale of future incomes from such forests is rare.

In comparison to Green Bonds that are characterized by high credit ratings, Forest Bonds have on average
a lower credit rating. 43% of the outstanding bonds fall into the AAA credit ratings band, primarily due to
large development banks. 14% of outstanding Green Bonds have no rating, possibly because the issuing
entities are fairly small or new to the market. Most of the issued Forest Bonds have no credit rating at all,
and none of the issuing entities has an AAA rating. The lack of a good credit rating can be a serious challenge
for issuers. This applies especially to large-scale bonds that have to be attractive to institutional investors.

For a public institution, issuing a Forest Bonds is likely to be less attractive than other Green Bonds as social
returns on forest projects tend to be lower, less immediate and less visible compared with other green
projects. One reason is that the economic returns on green energy and infrastructure investments – defined
in terms of contribution to economic growth and shared prosperity – are commonly higher than investments
in forests. As more people may be immediately affected by public investments in renewable energy, clean
transport, health, and education, the provision of these services may always be preferred over investments
in forestry that yield tangible returns only in the medium-to-long term.

Bonds related to the forest sector are regularly issued by large, frequently multinational, pulp and paper
or wood product companies that use large areas of private industrial plantations to source raw materials.
These companies have a good record of implementation based on a successful business model, and seldom
advertise their issuances as “green” or “forest”, but simply as bonds designed to help a successful corporation
cover general costs. Such issuers have issued bonds up to USD 600 million, with proceeds not used exclusively
for forestry activities. Instead, proceeds are oriented towards general operations and refinancing debt with
relatively short tenure averaging less than eight years. Another reason why forest companies do not always
promote their corporate bonds as “green” is that labeling increases costs, while institutional investors expect
the same returns on Forest Bonds as they obtain for other more traditional bonds.

Compared with Green Bonds or even plain vanilla bonds, additional costs can arise for bonds that are forest
sector-specific. These include additional expenditures for defining green criteria, monitoring and maintaining
the proceeds as green, and transparently communicating performance to investors over the lifetime of the
bonds. The costs of contracting a second party opinion and preparing projects and reports are most notable.
During their life cycle, Green Bonds create additional costs at several stages and through different agents. In
contrast, the definition of a successful forest investment may be more difficult. Moreover, the possibility of
forest investment efforts being offset by simultaneous deforestation in other regions of the country, for
example when dislocating agricultural production, is omnipresent. Monitoring of the ongoing compliance
may require a geographic information system, which is costly and not always available. Hence, it is
particularly difficult to define criteria and monitoring, which is therefore costly for forestry projects.

Issuance options for a Forest Bond and the role of the World Bank
This report proposes several theoretical structures for issuing Forest Bonds, ranging from public sector
models through an international financial institution (IFI) such as the World Bank, private sector structures,
or issuances using a dedicated financing facility. The selection of the appropriate model depends on the
type of revenues, the institutional arrangements, the delivery of funds, and the risk. The question of how
revenues are generated to pay back the bond is crucial for investors and issuers alike. The funds to repay the
bond do not necessarily have to come from forest activities directly, especially for public investments, but
can be tax money, for example. A second important question is how financing is managed and by whom.
Whether the financing is managed by the government, a corporation, or a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) will
influence the delivery of activities and the associated risk. The kind of activities that are financed through the
bond depend largely on the institutional arrangement, as governments can, for example, finance monitoring

                                                        4

systems while corporations are more likely to finance plantations. Finally, the risk and the risk premium
depend mainly on the institutional arrangement because the default risk constitutes the primary risk in all
models. The reliability of revenue flows is only a secondary risk, as these may be offset by other income
sources such as taxes or revenues from other activities.

For the public sector, the most common models for bond-backed finance are tax-backed and revenue-
backed government bonds. In the tax-backed model, the government issues a bond to raise capital and uses
that to fund forest activities. These activities could range from public-sector-driven afforestation
investments, supporting smallholder forest management and reforestation, improving governance in the
forestry sector, to research and development. Furthermore, the government collects taxes, as usual, and
uses these to repay the bond. This approach increases the country’s debt burden and depends on the
credibility of the government’s policy framework in using the funds raised only for forest activities. The main
difference between the tax- and revenue-backed models is that revenue-generating forest activities are
funded and used to repay the bondholders. If these revenues fall short, however, the government will have
to step in, using tax revenues as a back-up because the bond is still on its balance sheet. Therefore, the
primary risk for the bondholders is still the government default risk. From the government’s perspective, this
approach has the advantages of using less tax money, and that parties benefiting from the forest activity pay
for it. Earmarking the forest-based revenues can help increase confidence that there are specific revenues of
a known scale available to repay the bond.

The role of the World Bank in these issuance models may vary – from being the issuer of the bond when
proceeds will be used in support of the green share of the broader investment portfolio, providing advice
in the process of a bond issuance by a country, to providing in-depth technical assistance for more complex
bond issuance and resource-flow arrangements. It is important to note that the World Bank cannot issue
any kind of bond – plain vanilla or Green/Forest Bonds – on behalf of a country or for a specific pre-identified
investment. The World Bank issues Green Bonds on the basis that it will match proceeds with certified green
investments sometime after the overall investment operation has been identified and agreed between the
Bank and the client. It therefore makes no difference for a client country if projects are financed through
Green Bonds or plain vanilla bonds. Logically, the risk for the bondholders is reflected in the risk rating of the
World Bank, and not of the project or the country in which the forest operation is being financed.

For a private sector company with a sustainable forestry portfolio, asset location, ownership and stability
of related cash flows are the central considerations in the resource flow frameworks. The framework for a
corporate Forest Bond is similar to a public revenue-backed Forest Bond, with the main difference being that,
as a back-up, the corporate has to rely on revenues from other activities instead of tax payments. In this
framework, the corporate issues a bond to raise investments, and uses these to fund revenue-generating
forest activities, such as plantations. Moreover, the corporate collects the revenues from the forest activities
and, since this bond is held on the balance sheet, the corporate will have to complement the revenue stream
if necessary with income from other activities in order to repay the bondholders. Whether the revenues stem
from forest activities or another source – maybe even from non-sustainable activities – does not affect the
green label as long as the activities financed through the bond comply with the Green Bond Principles (GBP).

Similar to the public sector model, the role of the World Bank or other IFI in the context of private sector
bond issuances can range between being the issuer of a Green Bond to raise resources to be matched with
green private investments, to providing technical assistance in an issuing process, or providing a more
complex support structure. The support that the Bank could offer through its private sector arm, the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), includes, for example, client risk management, anchor investments,


                                                        5
The World Bank | Demystifying Forest Bonds


and credit. To reduce the risk of an issuance for a client, the IFC can offer hedging instruments directly to
clients who do not have full access to hedging products, such as interest rate or cross-currency swaps. The
IFC could also commit to subscribing to an issuance ahead of the public offering, which can be communicated
to prospective investors to send a positive signal. This aspect is critical as it is likely to result in an over-
demand for a Green Bond, which can lead to basis point reductions. This price correction, however, is then
not an attribute of the green investment; rather it is due to the IFC’s pre-issuance subscription.

A finance facility set up by public sector entities could include other donors and thereby take the global
public good character of forests into account. In such a scenario, a separate legal entity would be created to
issue the bond and manage the proceeds. The bond would fund any kind of forest activities. The revenues
would be generated through commitments made by one or a group of governments and be used for paying
back the bondholders. The risk would therefore still remain in the ability of the governments to service the
debt. Similar finance approaches have been successfully implemented to finance vaccination programs such
as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI Alliance), which issued bonds based on legally
binding grant payments from its sovereign sponsors. However, compared with a vaccination program, forest
investments require a much longer investment horizon, and output and outcome are much harder to
ascertain. It seems therefore unlikely that donors would be willing to commit pledges over such a long
horizon to countries with low political stability.

Using bonds for forest financing to meet NDC targets
At this point, it is unlikely that Green Bonds will deliver on the prospect of meeting finance needs for forest-
related investments that will have to occur under NDCs. While there is little doubt that the volume of Green
Bond issuances will continue to increase for energy and infrastructure, the potential for bond-based forest
sector financing is likely to be limited as a result of the current structure of the bond market and the attributes
of Green Bond finance.

The specific needs of forestry investments do not align well with the financing characteristics of bonds,
including Green Bonds. For example, the time between investment and revenue flow that is characteristic
to forestry is regarded as a critical bottleneck. It is further magnified by the fact that average credit ratings
for Forest Bonds are lower than for average Green Bonds. This results in higher coupon payments, which
reflects the elevated degree of risk of forest investments. Although some bond-based financing structures,
such as zero-coupon bonds, are theoretically suited to mitigating the forest investment-specific financing
challenge, the market analysis did not provide any revealing insights to suggest that such structures are yet
used at larger scale in forestry. A possible explanation for the very limited use of zero-coupon bonds is that
they are, not only if used for a Green Bond, unconventional compared with other fixed-income products.
Zero-coupon bonds constitute rather a niche product that does not align with most investors’ preferences
(e.g. having a regular cash flow or just being a more standard product). Furthermore, it is likely that other
forestry-specific attributes will remain a major disincentive for such financing. Lower investment volumes,
investment scope, spatial and stakeholder heterogeneity, and the lack of secured and immediate income
streams are secondary, but equally important, differences that hamper the forest sector from using bonds
as a financing tool.

Regardless of whether an issuance is made with the objective of meeting forestry-related NDC investment
needs, Forest Bonds must meet market expectations for returns. This is difficult when the issuing entity is
not a well-financed corporation or public entity with a positive track record. It is unlikely that NDC activities
would yield the 10% internal rate of return (IRR) target desired by many investors in forest plantations, or
higher targets associated with natural forests, to compete with traditional investments (partly due to the

                                                        6
The World Bank | Demystifying Forest Bonds


lack of competitive manufacturers with solid revenue streams). IRRs are positively impacted when forest
investors can lease land or use public land through other forms of government agreements as land purchase
costs represent significant cost factors. For example, the IRR for plantation investments in Brazil without land
costs (i.e. existing landowners) ranged from 17% to 23%, and for investments including land costs from 9%
to almost 12% (Cubbage et al. 2007).

The stigmatization of productive forest management as a driver of deforestation disadvantages bond
investments due to perceived reputational risks for the investor. Governments have the option to employ
complementary safeguards that mitigate these risks and stimulate the demand for forest products. Such
complementary measures could range from facilitating a framework for transparent third-party certification,
to increasing the demand for wood through green public procurement policies. Other sectors, especially
agriculture, may provide additional models for stimulating demand for forest commodities, especially from
smallholders.

Public investments in forestry should further strengthen the governance framework, especially addressing
illegal logging, but also incentivizing smallholder approaches to re- and afforestation. In Brazil, existing
support programs for rural producers (ABC, PRONAF, etc.) have had an uneven performance, with the
availability of financial resources not being the limiting factor. Accordingly, there is a need to better
understand the disincentives for investment in forest activities from the landowner’s viewpoint and, on that
basis, occasion appropriate adjustments to incentive mechanisms. Investing in such reform efforts may
eventually yield the multiplier effects for private sector investment that are necessary to meet NDC
investment targets.

This analysis suggests that the potential for bonds-based forest finance to meet NDC targets is limited –
particularly when characteristics specific to forest investments are matched with forest/country economic
performance parameters. However, there is room for enhancing the incentive framework for this finance
instrument through further innovations. For example, bond issuances related to carbon finance may be
promising once critical issues such as carbon tenure and carbon pricing are resolved. Some recently piloted
forest carbon-based financing models, such as Debt for Climate Swaps, Environmental Policy Performance
Bonds, or Debt for Climate Policy Performance Swaps, are still small in scale and have not yet moved beyond
the pilot stage. The underlying structures of these financing instruments and options for scaling-up have yet
to be analyzed. Furthermore, guarantees provided by national development banks could mitigate some of
the risk associated with forest investments, even though such efforts might again be in competition with
other sectors and development priorities.

To achieve a true breakthrough in bond-based forest finance, it will be necessary to identify and design
concrete and bankable solutions that integrate international support into bond structures to achieve both
scale and efficiency. The ultimate aim of such bond structures would be to provide governments and the
private sector with access to lower-cost capital than they currently get from capital markets. This, in turn,
will enable them to expand credit volumes for forest investments that deliver against NDC targets. These
structures would also aim to leverage international support commitments – resulting in more investments
and greater GHG reductions per dollar granted. While there is potential for reducing deforestation and forest
degradation (REDD+) and climate finance to play a leveraging role, there must be demonstrable
improvements in achieving mitigation and other outcomes.

Finally, demand-side interventions may be even more promising as an indirect measure to stimulate
investments in forestry than an a priori focus on the supply of finance. In this regard, stimulating the


                                                       7

demand for wood products as an indirect measure could trigger investments in the forestry sector, including
reforestation and regeneration of degraded lands. For example, reforming public procurement favoring
sustainably managed forest products, including the use of wood for energy, could increase the demand for
wood and attract investors to the sector. Secured demand coupled with reliable price levels and, hence,
revenue streams, could be an important factor in driving forest investments, especially for mitigating the
investment risk resulting from a lack of immediate revenue streams after the initial investments. Not only
could this motivate small investors, it might also facilitate the use of thus far little-used bond structures such
as zero-coupon bonds.

1. Introduction
The Paris Agreement reached in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is regarded as setting a
fundamentally new course in the global climate effort. More than 190 nations, whose joint greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions represent more than 98% of global GHG emissions (CAIT 2016), committed to “Intended
Nationally Determined Contributions” (INDCs). 2 Through these, countries determine their contributions to
GHG reductions in the context of their national priorities, circumstances and capabilities, but within a global
framework for “collective action toward a low-carbon, climate-resilient future” (WRI 2015b). In that sense,
NDCs are seen as creating a feedback loop between national and international decision-making on climate
change.

The Paris Agreement achieved a particular breakthrough for the forestry sector by acknowledging
mitigation efforts from reducing deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). While the Kyoto Protocol
still excluded forest-sector-based emission reductions in developing countries, where emissions from
deforestation often exceed those in other sectors, REDD+ is now permanently included in Article 5 of the
Paris Agreement. Forest-based commitments under the NDCs of China, Brazil, Bolivia, and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) alone could achieve a reduction of 2.5% of the current total annual emissions
globally over 15 years (WRI 2015a). This reveals the importance of acknowledging forest-based GHG
emissions when talking about climate change.

The inclusion of REDD+ in the Paris Agreement is of particular importance since it serves as a political signal
to mobilize urgently needed financial resources, especially because financing under REDD+ programs –
although substantial – still falls significantly short of meeting actual needs. Before the Paris Agreement,
REDD+ programs had already attracted an estimated USD 10 billion in international investments, largely from
government sources from member countries (see Figure 1), but the governments of Norway, Germany and
the UK have also agreed to commit another USD 5 billion for REDD+ over the next five years (Forest Trends
2014). In contrast, the funding required for sustainable forest management is projected to be between USD
70 billion and USD 160 billion per year globally (UNFF 2012). Other recent estimates suggest that the scale of
financing required to halve deforestation will increase over the current decade, reaching USD 30 billion
annually by 2020 (Eliasch 2008). Specific to Brazil, most recent estimates put the price tag of attaining the
country’s NDC commitment at USD 10 to 16 billion (Instituto Escolhas 2015). 3 For the forestry sector, the
Paris Agreement only extended the current goal of mobilizing USD 100 billion a year by 2020 through 2025,
with a new, higher goal to be set for the period after 2025 – for all NDC objectives.

Consequently, and as confirmed by a rapid assessment of INDC implementation needs post-Paris, countries
continue to rank financing needs highest among the challenges identified. With the limitations of


2
  The word “intended” was used because countries were communicating proposed climate actions ahead of the Paris
Agreement being finalized. However, as countries formally join the Paris Agreement and look forward to
implementation of these climate actions – the “intended” is dropped and an INDC is converted into a Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC). (WRI 2015b)
3
  The wide range of this estimate reflects the still prevailing uncertainties in Brazil as to what land restoration
techniques will eventually be employed and their location.

conventional financing approaches, additional and new financing sources and instruments are needed to
avoid the promising momentum of the NDC process grinding to a halt before ever reaching full speed. There
is considerable hope that the Paris Agreement will attract new long-term investments, not only from other
developed countries, but also from private sector actors. With the elimination of the strict differentiation
between developed and developing countries that characterized earlier efforts of UNFCCC negotiations, it is
also expected that countries mobilize and leverage their own resources to help meet NDC objectives under
a common framework that commits all countries to apply their best efforts and economic capabilities.

In the broader context of global NDC implementation and finance, Brazil represents a particularly
important country example. While the Brazil’s commitments put forward under the Paris Agreement would
induce a 2% reduction of GHG emissions globally compared with 2005, 4 its NDC targets build significantly on
GHG emission reductions and emission avoidance in the land-use and land-use change sector.
Commensurate with this situation, the country will require considerable new investments and financing over
the coming years. 5 Given its advanced development status compared with other economies, such as Sub-
Saharan African countries, Brazil will also have to mobilize its own – and additional – financing, and will not

 It is estimated that achieving the target of 12 Mha of restored forests in Brazil’s NDC over 25 years alone will cost R$
31–52 billion (USD 10–16 billion) (Instituto Escolhas 2016).

be able to rely exclusively on external financing to meet NDC targets in supporting and sustaining its
ambitious forest-related NDC targets.

The option of financing NDC-related investments – especially those pertaining to land-use and forestry –
through the issuance of Forest Bonds as a subset of Green Bonds has received particular interest. With the
emergence of Green Bonds on international financing markets, expectations arose that those resources could
not only play an important part in unlocking much needed resources to bridge the financing gaps identified
for meeting climate investment needs, but that those financing options would be additional and in some way
associated with preferential attributes vis-à-vis conventional market finance – not least cost advantages.

At first sight, however, available data on the use of Green or Climate Bonds to finance forest investments
presents a sobering picture. Although the Green and Climate-aligned Bonds markets have been growing
exponentially in recent years, reaching nearly USD 118 billion and USD 700 billion, respectively, by June 2016,
the agriculture and forest sectors amounted to less than 3% of the Green Bond market (CBI 2016b).

Given this lackluster experience, there is a need to analyze the reasons for the low uptake of Green Bonds
that are specific to the forest sector, as well as to calibrate the expectations in forest-specific Green Bonds
as a new and additional financing source to meet the finance needs for forest-based investments under
NDCs. Given the determination of Brazil and other forest countries in addressing the challenges of land-use
change and implementing ambitious restoration and reforestation targets, there is a need to better
understand what instruments, including financial market instruments, are promising and viable for
buttressing the NDC implementation agenda and the development of national policies in key sectors. With
this objective, Brazil’s Ministry of Environment requested the World Bank Group’s support in (i) exploring the
potential of Green/Environmental Bonds for the forest sector; (ii) in reviewing whether and how this
financing instrument could be put into practice as one possibility from a menu of diverse financing sources
and mechanisms for forest and land restoration investments; and (iii) in comparing those experiences with
those where Green Bonds were already successfully used to finance climate investments for mitigation and
adaptation objectives in other climate-related sectors. Hence, this report seeks to address the subject from
the issuer perspective, and mainly for public sector entities such as federal governments.

The objective of this report is to conduct a systematic assessment of the viability and comparative
advantage of bonds as a financing tool to meet Brazil’s forest-based NDC targets. The assessment will
consider the sectoral framework conditions of the forest sector and how these impact financing and
investment decisions. While the report intends to address Brazil’s interest in exploring this financing option,
the associated analysis is relevant for the broader global discussion on NDC financing – both for forest-based
financing in other countries, but also regarding other sectors relevant to meeting NDC targets. The value-
added of this assessment to the global NDC financing debate is that it will be embedded in the factual context
of one of the most important forestry countries, and that comparisons may be made with other existing
forest financing mechanisms.

The following questions reflect a set of issues raised in discussions with various stakeholders prior to this
analysis. They serve as guidance to the analysis and discussion presented in this report.

1. Terminology: Green Bonds, Climate Bonds, Forest Bonds, Carbon-backed Bonds and other terminology
   refer to the same instrument in the minds of some, but are regarded as different to each other in the
   minds of others.
   − Are there differences between these terms or are they mere labels for the same instrument?
   − How do these bonds differ from regular bonds and what is the difference between Green and Forest
       Bonds?

2. Experience: The issuing of Green and similarly labelled Bonds is relatively recent.
   − What do we know of bonds that were tried for raising funds for green investments, especially as
      regards land use and forestry?
   − What were the key barriers to, or ingredients for, success?
   − What forms of securitization were applied?

3. Demand and supply: With the Green Bonds family being relatively new, the sub-category of Forest Bonds
   has not been widely explored.
   − What was the rationale/motivation for introducing Green Bonds to the financial market?
   − What risks do Forest Bonds entail that make them different from mainstream Green Bonds? And why
       do they make up only a very small fraction of the total Green Bond market?
   − Are there strategies that could be pursued to make Forest Bonds more attractive, especially given
       the increased need for forest financing to meet NDC targets?
   − How are future developments of this bond market segment currently anticipated by financial
       experts?

4. Institutional aspects: With Green Bonds originally being explored by multilateral finance institutions
   (MFIs), there may also be a particular role for these institutions with regard to Forest Bonds.
   − What are the possible ways in which resources that are raised through the issuance of Green and
       Forest Bonds can be channeled toward forest investments?
   − Are there specific roles for MFIs in the issuing of Green and Forest Bonds?
   − Does the investment type for which bond-raised resources are dedicated influence the underlying
       rationale for using bonds vis-à-vis other financing mechanisms and sources?

5. Private sector: While public bonds for public investments to meet NDC targets are the primary concern,
   particularly for forestry targets, it is widely acknowledged that complementary private sector
   investments will need to be raised.
   − Has the private sector utilized Green or Climate Bonds for forest investments?
   − Is it attractive for the private sector to issue bonds for investments in forestry? Under what
       circumstances?
   − Are private sector investments likely to meet some of the NDC targets?
   − What are the commonalities and differences between public and private sector forest investments?
   − Is the securitization of private sector Forest Bonds different from those issued by the public sector?
   − What role does the public sector play in mobilizing bond-based private sector investments in forestry
       to meet NDC targets?

To meet the objectives of this study and to respond to the questions outlined above, the remainder of this
report is structured as follows.
−   First, to contextualize the assessment of bonds as financing options for meeting NDC objectives, a brief
    summary of the global role of forests in the context of low-carbon development is provided. With Brazil
    serving as the country of analysis, the global summary is complemented by highlighting selected factoids
    of the broader Brazilian context relevant to the assessment of bonds, including brief summaries of the
    Brazilian economic and fiscal situation, investment environment, forestry sector, and the national NDC
    with emphasis on reforestation and forest restoration targets. Given the broad scope of these topics, this
    summary discussion will highlight only a few of the most pertinent forest-specific issues relevant to the
    subsequent analysis.
−   Second, the underlying characteristics of bonds are presented, including a more detailed discussion of
    Green and Forest Bonds. While this part will mostly focus on bonds issued for public sector finance, key
    aspects of private sector bonds are also discussed.
−   Third, an analysis of how bonds could be applied in the Brazilian context is conducted, building on a set
    of selected hypothetical scenarios. This analysis will highlight the principal roles and responsibilities of
    different actors and the associated advantages and disadvantages of each scenario.
−   The report concludes with a discussion of the key findings of the analysis, broadly following the set of
    guiding questions outlined above. Recommendations regarding the use of bonds for forest-based climate
    finance will be elaborated, including the identification of topics for further analytical work. While the
    concluding discussion is focused on the specific case of Brazil, broader considerations for the global
    debate on NDC financing will also be included.

2. Contextualizing Forest Financing to Meet Forest-based Emission
   Reductions under NDCs
2.1       The global context
Forests are a priority for Low-Carbon Development (LCD) policies given their key role as both a major
source of GHG emissions – carbon sinks – and in actively reducing emissions. According to the latest
assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Smith et al. 2014), 12% of GHG emissions
(from 2000 to 2009) come from forest and other land-use changes. The potential of forests to contribute to
LCD can be broadly categorized as follows: (i) reducing emissions from forest degradation and deforestation
(REDD+); (ii) enhancing the carbon sequestration potential of forests; and (iii) material substitution using
wood instead of fossil-fuel-intensive materials, including biomass energy in lieu of fossil fuels. Global
estimates for broad forest financing needs are rather scarce, show great variability, and their accuracy is
questionable. The United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) estimates annual global finance needs for forestry
and sustainable forest management at between USD 33 billion and around USD 70 billion (Castrén et al. 2014,
UNFF 2006). In a more recent study from the UNFF Advisory Group on Finance Collaborative Partnership on
Forests (2012), the global need for funding for sustainable forest management is estimated to be between
USD 70 billion and USD 160 billion per year. The FAO expects annual financing needs to “range between USD
35 billion to meet the Bonn Challenge targets 6 up to more than USD 300 billion for land degradation
neutrality” 7 (FAO 2015).

For some countries, the relative share of land-use change and forestry-related GHG emissions can reach
over 80% of total national emissions. Ranking the top 20 countries according to their relative GHG emissions
from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), eight countries are from Africa, seven from Latin
America, and five from the Asia-Pacific region (see Figure 2). Measured in absolute terms, Latin America leads
with eight countries, followed by seven from Africa, and four from the Asia-Pacific region. Indonesia, Brazil,
and Nigeria are the top absolute emitters, but Canada with its large boreal forest areas also makes it into the
top 20. While relative emissions from LULUCF are likely to fall as soon as industry- and transport-related
emissions increase, absolute GHG emissions from LULUCF may develop differently.




6
  The Bonn Challenge is a global effort to restore 150 Mha of the world’s deforested and degraded land by 2020, and
350 Mha by 2030.
7
  Land degradation neutrality is defined as a state whereby the amount of healthy and productive land resources
necessary to support ecosystem services remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales.

Consequently, a majority of countries include actions in the forest sector in their NDCs. According to the
latest available data provided by UNEP (2015), a total of 109 countries (counting the EU as one) 8 made
statements regarding their willingness to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, or to
enhance forest carbon stocks. 9 While the most commonly proposed activity is the protection of carbon stocks
in standing forest ecosystems through avoided deforestation and degradation, many countries indeed aim
for achieving an enrichment in forest-based carbon simultaneously through reforestation and forest
regeneration. Figure 3 provides a global summary overview of national commitments. These commitments
are made in the context of a range of institutional arrangements, such as UNFCCC, bilateral arrangements,
the Carbon Fund, and international multi-stakeholder partnerships (UNEP 2015). The emission reduction
contribution of LULUCF in NDCs is estimated as an approximate contribution of 1.6 GtCO2 (of which 0.5 GtCO2
comes from Annex I countries) from full implementation of unconditional NDCs, increasing to 1.9 GtCO2
(range: -0.1–4.3) under full implementation of both unconditional and conditional NDCs. The forest-related
mitigation potential under the NDCs will be less than this, as forestry comprises a subset of LULUCF activities
described in the NDCs. 10

  This includes 94 developing countries according to a definition applied by UNEP. See UNEP (2015) for a full
elaboration of its assessment methodology.

  These numbers were published before all countries had submitted their NDCs. As of June 2017 updated data are
unavailable.

However, the technical potential of forests to contribute to GHG emission reductions can differ
significantly from the economic potential (UNEP 2015). 11 Smith et al. (2014) present estimates of global
mitigation potential at different cost levels, ranging from 0–1.5 GTCO2e for costs < USD 20/tCO2e, to
mitigation potentials of 0.1–9.5 GtCO2e for costs < USD 50/tCO2e, and ranging from 0–13.8 GtCO2e for costs
< USD 100/tCO2e. From a regional perspective, REDD+ is stated as the most cost-effective forestry option for
Latin America and the Middle East and Africa regions, whereas forest management dominates the Asia region
(Smith et al. 2014). Results are summarized in Table 1, which uses earlier findings from Nabuurs et al. (2007)
to compare technical and economic potential of forest-based GHG emission mitigation.

  Technical mitigation potentials represent the full biophysical potential of a mitigation option and account for
constraining factors such as land availability and suitability. Economic potential refers to mitigation that could be
realized at a given carbon price over a specific period. Economic mitigation potentials tend to be context-specific and
are likely to vary across spatial and temporal scales – for example, due to varying policy incentives and competition for
resources across various mitigation options. Economic potentials are generally expected to be lower than the
corresponding technical potentials (Smith et al. 2014).

A detailed contrasting of technical and economic potential forest-based GHG emission reductions reveals
that in many cases the technical potential could not even be realized at carbon prices of USD 100/tCO2e
(see Table 1). For reduced deforestation, only Africa could meet its technical potential by 2030 at carbon
prices of USD 20–50/tCO2e, while the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions would remain below their
technical potential even at carbon prices of USD 100/tCO2e. 12 In contrast, Asia-Pacific and Latin America can
achieve their technical potential for reduced degradation and forest management at carbon prices of USD 1–
10 USD/tCO2e, while African countries would require carbon prices above USD 50/tCO2e. For afforestation
and reforestation, only Asia-Pacific can achieve its technical potential, but would require carbon prices at
USD 100/tCO2e, while Africa and Latin America fail to meet their technical potential by large margins even
at USD 100/tCO2e.

The importance of the economic dimension of the mitigation potential of forests further underlines the
relevance of the economic situation of countries that include the forest sector in their NDC for achieving
these targets. Differentiating countries by both their economic performance (approximated by poverty
prevalence 13) and their forest area as a share of total land area, a quadrant categorization results as depicted
in Figure 4. 14 Several countries with high relevance for reducing forest-based emissions display poverty rates
of 50% and above, indicating a challenging economic context in which the economic and technical potential
for forest-based GHG emission reductions may diverge significantly.

High poverty prevalence and low economic performance may cause governments to decide to converge
toward investment choices yielding the highest returns for economic and social development, which can
be aggravated by high opportunity costs of capital. Figure 5 shows that countries with lower GDP per capita
and higher public debt tend to face higher capital costs for public investments. 15

   The World Bank definition of people living on less than USD 3.10/day is applied here.

   Four general categories can be delineated: (1) high poverty, low forest cover; (2) high poverty, high forest cover; (3)
low poverty, high forest cover; (4) low poverty, low forest cover.

Analyzing these aspects in more detail for countries with a high relevance for reducing forest-based
emissions confirms that economic realities for reducing forest-based GHG are not promising. Taking a sub-
set of the top-ranked 20 countries with respect to total GHG emissions from forest-based emissions shows
that, on average, these countries have a poverty rate of 37%; GDP per capita of USD 7,400; an annual inflation
rate of around 6%; a budget balance of -4.1%; and public debt of 39% of GDP (see Table 2). Approximated by
government bond yields, these countries face opportunity costs of capital of about 12% at credit ratings
averaging the medium-to-low B range. For some of the countries, such as DRC, there is no bond market at all
and the government is raising funds entirely through other means. For example, tax revenues or tariffs and
development assistance is covering a significant share of the public spending (see African Financial Markets
2016). Figure 6 and Figure 7 show that tropical forest countries tend to have unfavorable credit ratings and
high political risks. For countries like Venezuela or Brazil, these parameters are even worse today than the
maps below suggest.

  It should be noted that the credit ratings have changed since 2011; however, the shift has not been sufficiently
radical to affect the message that the map presents.

Under such financial framework conditions, the fiscal space for public investments in forestry is often
limited. Without either significantly reducing the opportunity costs of capital or the realization of large
international transfer payments to subsidize investments in the forest sector, there is likely to be a large gap
between the technical and the economic potential for reducing forest-based GHG emissions. Depending on
whether forest-related commitments under NDC are closer to the technical or economic potential, countries
may find themselves more or less well-positioned to achieve their commitments. This need for low-cost
financing options has given rise to the hope by some that Green or Forest Bonds might be able to deliver on
lower-priced funds.

2.2          The Brazilian context
2.2.1        The forest sector
With 60% of its land covered by forests and totaling 13% of the planet’s total forest area, Brazil has
abundant forest resources, a forestry industry rated one of the top five globally due to growing exports
(8% since 2003), and substantial private investment in the value chain. In addition, Brazil is the world’s
largest charcoal producer; the fourth-largest pulp producer; the eighth-largest composite panel producer;
and the ninth-largest paper producer (Mendes 2014). Forest production shows a great variation by region,
with high log production in the south and low production volumes in the Amazon and Cerrado regions.

Brazil has 520 million hectares (Mha) of natural forest, of which 307 Mha are in federal (225 Mha) and
state (82 Mha) public lands. Most public forest lands in the Amazon (39% or < 121 Mha) are managed by
federal and state governments, with a similar amount (37% or 117 Mha) held by indigenous and non-
indigenous communities. Less than 3% of Brazil’s Amazon is legally allocated for long-term forest
production. In 2011, Brazil had over 1.3 Mha of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified forests,
producing 596,000 m3 of logs annually. In 2012, total log production from all Amazonian natural forests
was 13.5 million m3. This high volume is due in part to Brazil having high average commercial wood
volumes for natural forests of 13–18 m3/ha in the Amazon (SBF 2015a).

The main access mechanism for such production is the concession model whereby the government of
Brazil provides private enterprise with long-term rights and responsibilities to a fixed area of public
forests. The administrative procedures to grant concessions have been slow in the past. In 2013, only
1.2 Mha of federal and state public lands (0.5% of all public lands) were actually allocated for forest
concessions on the roughly 5 Mha currently designated for concessions (and the 33 Mha of undesignated
lands which could be used as a productive forest estate). The maximum total area available for production
forestry on federal lands could be as high as 38 Mha (SBF 2015a). 17

With an annual consumption of 24.5 million m3 of tropical hardwood from throughout the country,
Brazil is the second-largest domestic log consumer in the world, and the world’s largest consumer of
tropical lumber, with an annual volume of 14 million m3 (CONSUFOR 2010). Internal demand for tropical
hardwoods is estimated to grow to 21 million m3 annually by 2020, and require 36 Mha of natural forest
under sustainable management. Brazil exports around 1.5 million m3, thus making it the world’s third-
largest tropical lumber exporter. In 2009, the natural forest management sector supported over 2,000
companies that provided jobs to over 200,000 people, and generated USD 2.5 billion in gross revenues
from wood products (SBF 2015a).

Brazil has been able to reforest large expanses of land for the purposes of industrial production,
primarily for pulp and paper. By 2015, it had established 7.8 Mha of planted forest, of which 37% was
independently certified via the FSC system. While notable in absolute terms, this area barely represents
1.5% of the country’s total forest cover. Fiber production from these plantations is largely from large-scale
industrial development in regions outside of the Amazon (Kanieski da Silva 2013).

Brazil has become the world’s leader in plantation forestry, with eucalyptus growth rates having
quadrupled in the past 40 years to reach an average annual volume growth of 40 m3/ha. This has
resulted in the plantation industry accounting for USD 69 billion of Brazil’s GDP (1.2%), 540,000 jobs, and
USD 10.9 billion in exports (4.8% of the country’s total) in 2015 (IBÁ 2016). The main drivers behind these

17
     This excludes the 124 Mha for communities, 34 Mha of parks and reserves, and 28 Mha of state lands.

trends have been the low cost of large areas of land with suitable growing conditions for wood fiber, and
strong technical innovation by both public and private sectors (SFB 2015a).

In addition to the infrastructure, human capacity and lack of capital issues discussed previously,
obtaining capital for Brazil’s forestry sector, particularly in the Amazon, remains a challenge for several
reasons:
−    law enforcement is still weak and there remains a large supply of cheap illegal or informally sourced
     wood;
−    the transaction costs for legal operations can be prohibitively high due to the low administrative
     capacity to regulate sustainable forest management;
−    the government offers few incentives for sustainable forestry – most mills that process logs from
     natural forests are under-equipped or rely on antiquated machinery that cannot competitively
     manufacture wood products;
−    the silvics of most native species are still poorly understood; 18
−    land conflicts and lack of secure title.

2.2.2     Deforestation and NDC
Under its NDC, Brazil committed to reducing net GHG emissions by 37% below 2005 levels by 2025
(UNFCCC 2015). This marks the first time a major developing country has committed to an absolute
reduction in emissions from a base year (WRI 2015a). However, compared with 2012 levels of GHG
emissions, Brazil’s commitment represents a reduction of GHG by only 29%, not 37%. If Brazil achieves its
NDC goal, global GHG emissions will have been reduced by 1.8% compared with 2005 levels.

Brazil's GHG emission profile has historically been characterized by the prominence of LULUCF as
compared to Agriculture and Livestock, Energy, Industrial Processes and Waste Disposal. LULUCF
emissions comprise mainly emissions related to deforestation and forest degradation in the Amazon
region and the Cerrado biome – two huge carbon reservoirs. Deforestation rates have declined since 2004
and there has been a dramatic shift in the pattern of emissions (see Figures 8 and 9). By 2010, LULUCF
accounted for less than 20% of the total, down from close to two-thirds.

  “Silvics” is the term used for the characteristics that define the life history, growth, behavior and ecology of a
tree species. It is often linked to – and used interchangeably with – the term “silviculture”, which strictly refers to
the science of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests and woodlands to
meet the diverse needs and values of landowners and society, such as wildlife habitat, timber, water resources,
restoration, and recreation on a sustainable basis. Silvics describes all aspects of a tree species life cycle, from
germination to death, including the environmental and soil conditions that are suitable for its growth, and the
insects and pathogens that can harm it.

The progress in limiting deforestation has made a major contribution to reducing Brazil’s GHG emissions
over the past decade, and NDC commitments can be achieved only if forest- and land-use-based targets
are realized. Limiting the deforestation of the Brazilian rain forest and protecting other sensitive biomes
has been largely achieved through increasing the designation of protected areas and improving
accountability and control. Without further advances in land-use change and forestry, Brazil will actually
increase GHG emissions by 36% above 2005 levels by 2025 (Climate Action Tracker 2016). These numbers
reveal the importance of the forestry sector in Brazil in achieving GHG reduction on a global scale. One of
the core elements of Brazil’s NDC commitments represents the restoration of 12 Mha of forest and the
elimination of illegal deforestation by 2030 (UNFCC 2015).

Despite the recent achievements, continuing public policy and public investment efforts addressing
forest conservation and reforestation are of utmost importance for meeting NDC targets. The
deforestation rate in the Amazon is still one of the highest in the world and Brazil remains one of the
largest GHG emitters. Cattle ranching and soybean production for export accounted for around one-third
of Brazil’s GHG emissions between 2000 and 2010 due to their impact on land use (Lenzen et al. 2013).

The Brazilian government established and amplified a variety of important laws and policies to address
deforestation and restoration in Brazil, not least the Native Vegetation Protection Law, or Forest Code
(Law 12.651/2012), as one of the cornerstones of these policies. The Forest Code aims to establish a
trading system that provides the opportunity for landowners to “offset” their legal reserve debts 19 by
purchasing surpluses from other landowners. The compensation instrument is termed the Environmental
Reserve Quota (CRA), a tradable legal title for landowners which could create a market for forested lands,

adding monetary value to native vegetation and providing the opportunity for additional income streams
for reforestation. Enforcing this law alone would deliver the intended 12 Mha of reforestation in Brazil
(World Bank 2016b).

Lack of compliance has prompted recent changes to the Forest Code (Brancalion et al. 2016). Further
institutional tools were developed to ensure comprehensive and integrated management of the Forest
Code, including implementation of an Environmental Rural Cadastre (CAR) and the Environmental
Compliance Program (PRA). The CAR system provides georeferenced maps and images, enabling
documentation of over 5 million rural properties in Brazil. This should allow all landowners to register
their property and identify the precise limits of their Areas of Permanent Protection (APPs) and legal
reserves. The PRA establishes criteria for the definition of areas in APPs and legal reserves that need to be
recovered if landowners face a deficit of natural vegetation on their properties.

It is estimated that achieving the target of 12 Mha of restored forests in Brazil’s NDC over 25 years will
cost R$ 31–52 billion (USD 9.5–16 billion; Instituto Escolhas 2015). Variation in this cost is due to the
uncertainty over how and where this restoration will be implemented (e.g. depending on the relative
share of reforestation versus natural regeneration, etc.). The National Revegetation Plan of Brazil
(PLANAVEG 2013) proposes at least five restoration methods that affect the cost, extent, and quality of
vegetation restoration. For example, it does not require that reforestation be limited to the use of native
species. Regardless, the cost of reforestation under PLANAVEG will need to be borne by many of the
private landowners who are currently not complying with the Forest Code, and who will therefore need
access to finance in order to comply with their obligations.

Brazil has several credit programs that target the financing of reforestation or sustainable forestry
activities at a subsidized price to facilitate the access to finance for landowners (for an overview of
available programs see SFB 2013). The Low Carbon Agriculture Program (ABC) aims to reduce GHG

                                                                                                 26

emissions from agriculture and livestock production activities, and to reduce deforestation and prevent
land degradation. Producers from all over Brazil can apply for the subsidized credits. FNE Verde aims to
promote the development of economic projects and activities that encourage the preservation,
conservation, and restoration of the environment. It is part of Brazil’s Northeast Financing Constitutional
Fund, and therefore only producers located in the North and Northeast of Brazil are eligible. The program
FNO Biodiversidade is available only in the North region, and has credit lines that are exclusively intended
for projects that regularize and recover legal reserve areas and APPs. The National Program for the
Strengthening of Family Farming (PRONAF), initiated in 1995, features subsidized credit tailored to
smallholder farmers, and explicitly includes the forest sector in its PRONAF Floresta module.

The Brazilian Development Bank, BNDES, offers further possibilities, and has been progressive in
establishing loan programs for various activities in the forest sector with long tenures, attractive grace
periods, and reasonable interest rates (e.g. BNDES Florestal and BNDES Fundo Clima). However, the
government-funded loan programs have proven difficult to access, with terms considered less useful than
originally intended. As a result, uptake has been lower than anticipated.

2.2.3      Economic considerations
The profitability of forest operations in Brazil is estimated to be among the highest in the world. The
IRR is the most common method of expressing the profitability of a forestry investment, and their average
values serve as benchmarks to understand the basics of investing in the sector. Cubbage et al. (2007) find
that without land costs (i.e. existing landowners), timber investment returns for exotic timber plantations
in Latin America are generally much greater than those for the native plantations of loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda) in the southern US.

Investment returns in forestry are generally among the highest worldwide, based on excellent growth
rates and good prices for timber. Cubbage et al. (2007) find that Brazil has the highest growth rates and
the highest timber prices for exotic species, but also the highest land costs. The IRR for Pinus taeda
plantation investments without land costs in Brazil is estimated at 17%, while this value is 13% in
Argentina, 9.5% in the US, and 16.9% in Chile (see Table 4). When land costs are included the IRR is
reduced by around 10%. The land costs could be eliminated or at least substantially reduced through
leasing schemes or logging concessions on public lands. These approaches could improve returns, but limit
the possibility of using the land and its appreciation as collateral.

After years of economic slowdown and with an ongoing economic crisis, 20 mobilizing public resources
needed for investments to meet NDC targets represents a significant challenge for Brazil. Since 2011 the
country’s growth performance has continually declined – from an average of 4.5% growth between 2006
and 2010, to 2.2% between 2011 and 2014, culminating in flat growth in 2014 and a contraction
(i.e. negative growth) of 3.8% in 2015. Growth in the past decade was largely based on favorable external
conditions, credit-fueled consumption, and an expanding labor force. As these drivers were exhausted,
structural constraints on potential growth have become more relevant.

The large fiscal deficits have translated into rapidly rising public debts. General government gross debt
rose from 57.2% of GDP at the end of 2014 to 64.5% in 2015, surpassing the level reached during the
global financial crisis (61.2%). The level of gross debt is high for an emerging market country and is a cause

for concern given the rising trajectory and high interest costs. Net debt remains significantly lower, but
has also increased from 33.1% of GDP in 2014 to 36.0% in 2015. Nonetheless, low foreign-currency
exposure (5.5% of gross public debt as of January 2016), a decreasing share of fixed-rate domestic debt
(36% of gross public debt), and a comparatively low share of foreign-held government debt (19% of gross
public debt), limit rollover risks in the near term. 21

Because of these developments, the Brazilian real has been devalued, the cost of raising money has
increased, and rating agencies have reduced Brazil’s long-term foreign-currency rating to BB with a
negative outlook in 2016. The new country rating is two steps below investment grade and puts Brazil on
a par with countries like Bolivia, Paraguay, and Guatemala. The BRL lost almost 30% of its value in 2015. 22
Similarly, Brazil’s cost of issuing debt on the capital market increased substantially. Under such
circumstances, raising funds through bonds for public investments is challenging and costly, thus public
investments are constrained. For example, the government had to pay more than 16% interest to place
its ten-year bonds in 2015. Since March 2016, yields are returning to the level of 2013–14 – i.e. 11%
(Investing.com, 2016).




21
   Rollover risk is commonly faced by countries when their debt is about to mature and needs to be rolled over into
new debt. If the yields for the government bonds are rising, debt has to be refinanced at a higher rate, thus
incurring more interest charges in the future.
22
   The market and the BRL have shown signs of improvement since President Temer took office in August 2016
(Bloomberg 2016).

The economic crisis is also affecting the Brazilian forest sector; wood and paper production has been
declining for the past two years after eight years of growth. Since most of the production is absorbed by
domestic demand, economic contraction has a strong effect on these products. Cellulose, on the other
hand, is mostly exported and therefore a devaluation of the BRL makes the production economically more
attractive and resilient to domestic economic changes. The devaluation of the real by about 15% in 2015
has benefitted wood, pulp and paper exports and increased their profits. The costs in the forest sector are
increasing faster than Brazil’s average rate of inflation. In 2015 alone, inflation in the planted tree sector
was 12.8% , while national inflation was 10.7% (IBÁ 2016). Consequently, costs in the industry grew 2.1%
– more than the average increase in costs and prices in the Brazilian economy (IBÁ 2016).

Brazil’s privately owned forest plantations are economically significant and constitute an important
element for achieving Brazil’s NDC commitments; however, they require the establishment of a
favorable public policy and investment framework. Although they represent only 1.5% of Brazil’s forest
area, planted forests are an important driver of economic growth and employment. In 2015, the Brazilian
planted tree industry was responsible for generating 0.9% of all domestic taxes collected; created
3.8 million jobs (direct, indirect and income-effect); and generated approximately 6.0% of the industrial
GDP (IBÁ 2016).23 However, forestry production costs in Brazil have been increasing by more than the
inflation rate over the last 14 years (IBÁ 2015) due to increasing wages, high inflation, and stagnant labor
productivity.

Internal structural and natural constraints that impede the growth of forest-based economic
development and conservation for which bond proceeds might be allocated include the following:
−    Overall focus on exporting raw materials rather than value-added products reduces profitability;
−    Inefficient clearance processes for international trade adds to costs;
−    Poor infrastructure and transportation bottlenecks make access to remote areas costly and difficult;
−    Limited access to finance (particularly for small companies) results in underfunded operations that
     cannot comply with additional requirements; and
−    Skills shortages coupled with onerous labor regulations that create disincentives to hiring.

Bonds play an important role for raising funds for private sector investments. According to
FEBRABAN (2016), the majority of bond issuances that qualify for Green Bonds over the past five years
have been in the forest sector, although the issuance amounts of such bonds have oscillated greatly from
year to year. High issuances in 2010 and 2014 contrast with no issuances in 2013 and 2015, and smaller
issuance amounts in the remaining years.




23
  Around 92% of the 7.7 Mha plantations are Pinus or Eucalyptus plantations (IBÁ 2015), and 65% are located in
the South and Southeast regions (IBÁ 2016).

While this shows that bonds are financing instruments actively used for private sector investments in
forestry, the suitability of Green Bonds for forest sector investments by the public sector is still in open
to question. To better understand and gauge the use of bonds, the next section recaps key definitions
and costs and benefits associated with the issuance of Green Bonds. This is followed by a discussion of
scenarios with reference to the previous country analysis and international context, especially with a view
to the resulting macroeconomic constraints due to credit rating and investment security.

3. Bonds, Green Bonds, and Forest Bonds
A bond is a debt instrument under which the issuer owes the holder a certain amount (the principal),
based on which the issuer pays interest. The maturity date of a bond is the date on which the issuer pays
back the principal to the bond holder. Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals. The bond is often traded
on the secondary market, meaning that the ownership of the instrument can be transferred and turned
into a liquid asset on the secondary market. The most common types of bond include sovereign municipal
bonds and corporate bonds. By purchasing debt via a bond, an investor becomes a creditor to the
corporation or a public entity. For corporate bonds, the investor has a greater claim on the assets than
equity shareholders. In the case of bankruptcy, bondholders are paid before shareholders, but do not
participate in profit-sharing (FED San Francisco 2005).
The key characteristics of bonds are summarized below.
Standard senior bonds
− Standard senior unsecured issuances where proceeds are designated to fund green projects/activities
    (e.g. World Bank Green Bonds).
− Similar to a loan (bond issuers must repay the capital they borrowed plus interest).
− Raises money in the market at fixed or variable cost (benchmark rate plus a spread).
− Repays interest (annually or semi-annually, depending on the characteristic of the issuance).25
− Repays the principal all at once at maturity (bullet type repayment).
Securitization bonds
− Securitization of a bond is the process whereby certain types of asset are pooled such that they can
   be repackaged into interest-bearing securities.
− A financial institution (“the originator”) identifies the assets it wants to securitize and pools them into
   the reference portfolio. It then sells the assets to a special-purpose vehicle (SPV). For legal purposes,
   the SPV is a separate entity from the financial institution, but the SPV exists only to purchase the
   financial institution’s assets. By selling the assets to the SPV, the issuer receives cash and removes the
   assets from its balance sheet, providing the issuer with greater financial flexibility. The SPV issues
   bonds to finance the purchase of the assets; these bonds can be traded in the marketplace and are
   referred to as securitized products.
− A collateralized bond refers to a debt instrument where the first source of repayment is cash flow
   from the collateral.
Project bonds
− Project bonds are linked to a specific project and its output and are directly exposed to the project
    risk. These projects generally have long tenures and have received an investment-grade rating
    (although this is not a necessary condition).
− A typical issuance would be from a project-operating company with a long-term off-take contract,
    with the debt amortizing fully by the term of the contract. The issue would be rated by rating agencies,
    which provide specific guidelines for projects to achieve investment-grade ratings (i.e., minimum debt
    service coverage ratios, minimum requirements for commercial framework, etc.).
− The project bond market is highly suitable for many projects, either as the sole financing source or in
    combination with bank loans for larger projects. Common characteristics are as follows: large projects

  Zero-bond coupons are an exception. They do not pay interest but are sold at a substantial discount on the face
amount that is paid back on maturity.

    (total capital in excess of USD 450 million); operating projects; long-term contracted cash flows from
    creditworthy off-takers; fixed-price off-take agreements; highly rated project participants.
Revenue bonds
− Revenue bonds are backed by the revenues generated from the financed project, which are held on
   the balance sheet.
− General examples include toll revenues from a road project or revenues from a public transportation
   system. In the forest sector, national parks could be financed through revenues from park entrance
   fees, for example.
− The direct link between revenues generated from the project and repayments alleviates political
   difficulties associated with using general tax or company money to repay a project that benefits only
   a sub-population.

3.1      Green Bonds
The concept of the Green Bond was developed in 2007 by the Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB and
the World Bank as a response to increased investor demands for engagement in climate-related
opportunities. The first entities to issue such a bond were the World Bank and the European Investment
Bank (EIB). The World Bank has issued over USD 9 billion worth of such bonds through more than 125
transactions in 18 currencies (as of October 2016) since its first issuance in 2008. The clear majority of
eligible projects are from the energy (38%) and transport (34%) sectors. Only 12% of the eligible projects
fall into the category of agriculture, forestry, and ecosystem projects (World Bank 2015b). From a market
originally dominated by international development banks (e.g. World Bank, EIB, etc.), the Green Bond
market has attracted a variety of new issuers, among them corporates and municipal issuers.

The trend of increasing World Bank issuances of Green Bonds is reverting, and issuances have been
declining since June 2014 (see Figure 13). Development banks in general have little to gain from issuing a
second-party verified Green Bond since financing social and environmentally friendly projects is their
raison d’être. World Bank bonds finance only World Bank projects, which are expected to comply with the
organization’s rigorous environmental and social safeguards in any event. Current evidence does not
suggest a price advantage for Green Bonds (see section 3.4) and therefore the additional selection,
monitoring and reporting costs prevail. The future rationale for issuing Green Bonds depends on the
development of the Green Bond market. The market could continue to grow if environmental, social and
governance factors (ESG factors) gain further popularity and Green Bond standards are developed further.
Such a development would increase the demand for Green Bonds and is likely to result in a price
advantage of Green Bonds over plain vanilla bonds, giving issuers an incentive to tap further into the
market. If the market is approaching a point of saturation – for example, because ESG factors are
sufficiently addressed, or because Green Bonds are too complex, the market price might remain virtually
equal to plain vanilla bonds. Finally, in the event of other, more attractive, instruments to address ESG
factors emerging, or if “green washing” becomes a pressing issue, the demand for Green Bonds could
plummet.

3.1.1        Definition and rationale for issuing Green Bonds
A Green Bond differs from a plain vanilla bond in terms of the activities it finances and the restrictions
imposed on its use. The issuer must ensure that the proceeds are invested in green projects, ideally
confirmed by an independent certification. 26 The Green Bond Principles (GBP) and the Climate Bond
Initiative (CBI) have established requirements that need to be met by Green Bonds, although these are
voluntary. In theory, Green Bond proceeds could be used for a wide variety of environmental projects,
but in practice they have been used largely for similar projects such as Climate Bonds. In some cases,
proceeds have gone to areas regarded as environmental but not necessarily related to climate change,
such as organic farming (CBI 2016b).

The labeling of a bond as “Green” – or something similar such as a Blue Bond, Climate Bond, or Forest
Bond – was initially a value judgement by the issuer. In the early days of Green Bond issuance, this
judgement was made by dedicated environmental specialists at the World Bank or other development
banks. What had to be confirmed or certified was that the proceeds raised through the issuance of Green
Bonds were used for the intended purpose. As discussed, independent of using Green Bond proceeds to
finance project implementation, all World Bank projects are subject to the same rigorous social and
environmental safeguards review and approval process to ensure that projects meet client countries’
development priorities. Hence, a Green Bond may be issued when there is a sufficiently strong pipeline of
eligible projects that will be selected from the Bank’s portfolio. These will meet all requirements of the
GBP, whereas the investor will not know ex ante the composition of the bond by sectors – unless it is a
themed bond (e.g. a water sector bond, see also Figure 14).




26
     There are no binding rules to determine when a bond can be advertised as “Green”.

The World Bank has not yet issued a Forest Bond per se, but it does finance forest-related activities in
certain countries with the proceeds generated from Green Bond issuance. Forestry projects financed
from Green Bond proceeds tend to address reforestation – for example, through investment operations
in China, Mexico, and Uruguay.

The underlying rationale for issuing Green Bonds is twofold: first, Green Bonds allow issuers to reach
different investors looking for a responsible and low-risk rated (i.e. AAA-rated) fixed-income product;
second, Green Bonds can help promote investors’ environmental credentials by demonstrating their
commitment to environmentally responsible investments. Investors are increasingly focused on
integrating ESG factors into their investment portfolios, and Green Bonds can help them meet their
environmental objectives (CBI 2016c). With an increasing number and diversity of Green Bond issuers, the
need for independent certification of eligible proceed use becomes evident. Independent groups have
already emerged to provide such second opinions, such as the Center for International Climate and
Environmental Research in Oslo (CICERO).

3.1.2    Green certification approaches
Different criteria and approaches to ensuring that bond proceeds are indeed resulting in positive
“green” impacts have been established by financial groups, non-profit organizations, and corporate
investment firms. These “green” impacts can be climate- and carbon-emission-related, target climate
adaptation benefits or waste reduction, or be for sustainable forest management, reforestation and
afforestation, to list just a few aims. The three most common standards used to label Green Bonds are
the GBP, Climate Bond Standards, or Green Bond Indices (key features are highlighted in Annex A). The

criteria are mostly similar but vary in terms of the requirement for an independent third-party certification
to monitor the performance of the Green Bond. 27

BOX 1: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “SECOND OPINION” AND “THIRD-PARTY” VERIFICATION IN GREEN BOND ISSUANCE
PROCESSES

     − Second opinion: this type of verification generally declares if a bond’s intended use of proceeds and its
       intended governance framework comply with the GBP. This verification method lacks a standard form or
       process.
     − Third-party verification: this is recognized as the more rigorous form of assessment by the GBP. Verification
       is against a declared set of industry-specific criteria, which assess whether the projects being funded are
       green. It is also conducted by audit professionals in line with standards such as the International Standard on
       Assurance Engagements 3000 for the verification of GHG emissions.
     Source: Standard & Poor’s (2016)


Independent certification enhances the credibility of Green Bonds as a new product, accentuates
marketing efforts, and provides regular assurance regarding performance as proceeds are deployed.
According to Bloomberg (2016), as of mid-2016 some 80% of Green Bonds have used a second opinion or
third-party certification (GFSG 2016). A second opinion is a valuable improvement on issuer disclosure
since it provides additional assurance to investors regarding the validity of the issuer’s claims. Yet reviews
may lack independence as the second opinion providers can be involved in the development of the
issuance’s Green Bond framework. A third-party certification is more independent than the second-party
review as it has to adhere to international assurance standards (see Box 1 above for more details). The
development of robust sector-specific certification criteria is time-consuming and resource-intensive. The
limited availability of certification criteria in different sectors has curtailed the use of standards in the
early stages of the market and the CBI is, as of October 2016, still working on land-use certification criteria
(CBI 2016d). However, increased availability of sector-specific criteria is reducing this barrier (GFSG 2016).
Table 7 provides examples of how second opinion and third-party verifiers are integrated into the issuance
process. All these actions are necessary only for a Green Bond issuance and are not required for a plain
vanilla bond issuance. They therefore constitute an additional step or “transaction cost” for Green Bond
issuance.




27
   Only the CBI requires third-party certification. A second-party opinion reviews environmental criteria which the
issuer will use to select projects for funding. This approach does not address whether the bond has been managed
as intended. Third-party opinions provide the highest level of confidence that the bond issuer uses robust
processes to track proceeds management and report on outcomes.

Source: CBI (2016c)

Specific to Forest Bonds, a common approach to ensuring that proceeds from Forest Bonds are invested
in eligible forest investments is to require certification through the independent, third-party
certification systems. CICERO, for example, uses the certification by the FSC to ensure that investments
comply with internationally accepted criteria for sustainable forest management. 28 The FSC utilizes
independent, accredited certifiers to verify that an operation meets FSC sustainable forest management
standards. Given the fixed-cost characteristics of forest management certification, it is usually more
feasible for larger companies as the costs can be between USD 0.06 and USD 36 per certified ha,
depending on the size of forest area (Potts et al. 2010). 29 The majority of bonds that have had a positive
climate impact on the forestry sector come from companies with FSC-certified forests and a chain of
custody certification. Certification is especially important in the forest sector and, as Cranford et al. (2011)
put it, “the most important attribute for any Forest Bond is that its environmental credibility must be
assured” (p. 13).

But the realities of certification of Green Bond investments as being “green” may be more flexible and
subject to interpretation than expected. For example, CICERO (2016) grades its independent reviews of
Green Bond frameworks as dark green, medium green or light green (or brown). These “Shades of Green”
indicate to investors how much a project is contributing to building a low-carbon and climate-resilient
society by 2050. The grading builds on a broad qualitative assessment of each project and reflects the
climatic and environmental ambitions of the bond as well as the robustness of the associated governance
structure. It is hard to determine how green these bonds are, especially for on-balance-sheet bonds,
because they are backed by the issuers’ general balance sheet or tax revenues. This general balance sheet
can have mostly non-green activities. Such Green Bonds might be perceived as general finance
instruments for investments that would have happened in any case.



28
   The FSC has established global principles and criteria for responsible forest and plantation management
including issues such as: maintaining water quality, preventing the loss of natural forests, prohibiting the use of
highly hazardous chemicals, and reducing the impacts of logging.
29
   FSC management was contacted as part of the research conducted for this project but has not indicated whether
it has engaged specifically in the certification of Forest Bond Issuances.

3.1.3    Market statistics of Green Bonds
The market for officially labeled Green Bonds is expanding rapidly and important milestones have been
reached in the last three years (see Figure 15). Until 2013 the Green Bond market was comparatively
small and dominated by multilateral development banks such as the EIB or World Bank, which were the
first institutions to issue a Green Bond. Since 2013 corporations and municipalities have been starting to
tap into the field of Green Bonds. Initiatives such as the CBI and the GBP have helped to develop the
market further by setting standards and providing guidelines for both issuer and investors. Large banks
launched green indexes in 2014 designed to track the global Green Bond market. In 2015 the first Green
Bond was issued in South America by the Brazilian food company BRF, and in 2016 Moody’s launched a
service to assess the “greenness” of investments. The first sovereign Green Bond was issued in 2016 by
Poland. Although experience with such products remains limited, it is interesting to note that this first
sovereign bond included support to some forest-relevant activities, such as sustainable land-use and
national park management, while explicitly excluding others, such as support to wood-based biomass
energy. This first sovereign Green Bond had a slightly higher price than plain vanilla bonds. 30

In contrast to the general strong demand for Green Bonds, the forestry sector is playing a negligible role
in this market. The volume of outstanding Green Bonds is USD 118 billion, with around 2% being issued

in the forestry sector. The most important sectors are energy, with more than USD 50 billion (43%), and
the building and industry sector, with USD 28.6 billion (24%). Bonds issued in the forestry and agriculture
sector, however, amount to only USD 2.5 billion (2.1%). The number of Green Bond issuances increased
by 92% between 2015 and 2016 alone, reaching almost USD 81 billion in 2016 (CBI 2016b). As discussed
in section 2, the estimated amount Brazil needs in order to finance its NDCs is probably USD 9.5–16 billion.
This points to a fourfold finance gap, even if all of the current Forest Bonds were issued for investments
targeting Brazil.

Labeled Green Bonds have on average a shorter tenure than unlabeled climate-aligned Bonds.
According to the CBI, this is due to the dominance of large state-backed entities in the rail sector within
the climate-aligned universe where investment horizons are long (CBI 2016b). Within the World Bank, the
average of Green Bonds is three years shorter than for plain vanilla bonds issued in USD. The relatively
short tenure maturity of Green Bonds could, on one hand, point towards the risk-averseness of investors.
On the other hand, the majority of Green Bonds fund renewable energy investments, which have a fairly
short investment horizon. Short tenures for Green Bonds could be problematic for investments that pay
off only after several years, like forest investments.

Compared with Green Bonds that are characterized by high credit ratings, Forest Bonds have on average
a lower credit rating. 43% of the bonds outstanding fall into the AAA credit ratings band, primarily due to
large development banks. 14% of outstanding Green Bonds have no rating, possibly because the issuing
entities are small or new to the market. In the forest sector, most of the issued Green Bonds have no
credit rating at all and none of the issuing entities has an AAA rating. The lack of a good credit rating can
be a serious challenge for issuers. This applies especially for large-scale bonds that have to be attractive
for institutional investors.

3.2          Forest Bonds
Thus far, Forest Bonds have been rare and the supply of suitable projects for them appears to be small.
A Forest Bond is defined more by the forest-friendly activities it delivers and less by the revenues it uses
to repay the bond (Cranford et al. 2011) 31. Such bonds allow issuers to:
−      reforest degraded lands;
−      facilitate the transition from livelihoods based on forest conversion or degradation to more
       sustainable systems that protect forests;
−      develop capacity and infrastructure for public sector agencies;
−      manage and preserve natural forests;
−      process sustainably harvested forest products (both timber and non-timber from natural or plantation
       operations) for sale into local and international markets.

In light of this, suitable projects could include:
−      reforestation of degraded lands;
−      support to harvester cooperatives for non-timber forest products;
−      capital investments to strengthen a national or sub-national forest agency;
−      development and implementation of national monitoring and tracking systems;
−      timber production from natural forest concessions;
−      payment for environmental services;
−      agroforestry systems that combine trees with crops (IFC 2007).

Most issuers of bonds that invest in forestry and agriculture (88%) label and promote their offerings as
Green Bonds (CBI 2015). For forestry, the reasons for this could be that while the green labeling
increases the positive visibility of the project, an explicit forest labeling could achieve the opposite as
the public perception of productive forestry projects (e.g. logging and plantations) is often negative.
This attests to the importance of the green label, without which such bonds might not prove sufficiently
attractive to investors. Forest investments are sometimes judged unfavorably when rating their
environmental sustainability and social attributes, especially where the productive use of forests is
involved. Uncertain land tenure, potential violations of indigenous people’s rights, or the perceived
destruction of forests because of timber harvesting are just a few examples of the reputational challenges
faced by the sector. Even third-party sustainable management certification may not be sufficient to
change these views. Investors tend to prefer a perceived clear cause–effect impact relationship, as is the
case with renewable energy or green infrastructure projects when seeking to demonstrate their corporate
and social responsibility by investing in Green Bonds. In that way, Forest Bonds stand in contrast to other
Green Bond issuances that are frequently oversubscribed, indicating superiority regarding market
demand for non-Forest Bonds. The factors that lead to this difference for Forest Bonds, and what
interventions could possibly – if at all – address this development, need to be analyzed.

A key obstacle to generating investor interest in Forest Bonds is the lack of a direct revenue stream.
Infrastructure-based Green Bonds (e.g. energy) can easily generate direct revenue streams, such as tariff
incomes for energy consumption that guarantee a steady and almost immediate income stream. It is
harder to establish such a direct income stream for forestry-based Green Bonds. This is important for both
on- and off-balance-sheet investment structures, as it either contributes to an enhanced income base for

on-balance-sheet investments or represents the sole income stream and justification for an off-balance-
sheet investment. This observation is supported by CBI (2016b), which states that the lack of an obvious
revenue stream of public forestry investments is a key barrier, and is likely the reason for the low demand.
The public good character of forests is difficult to translate into direct financial revenue streams and
constitutes the core challenge to acquiring private finance.

Even if there is a direct revenue stream, it is subject to many uncertainties, such as site heterogeneity,
management objectives, long production periods, demand volatilities and natural disasters. The
conventional way to address this is to have a fast-growing monoculture plantation that produces a certain
mass product (i.e. fiber for pulp and paper or energy). However, even here production is perennial,
implying that no significant revenues will accrue in the first seven years (or more). Alternatively, risks can
be addressed with a wide management portfolio – i.e. multi-age and multi-species forests, where
managers can flexibly react to changing market demands, but which are also more resilient to calamities.
However, here the disadvantage is much longer production periods (40 years and more for high-value
timber species). In other words, the most critical aspect of forestry is the time lapse between investment
and revenue generation. Investments in forestry have long tenures, requiring significant capital
expenditures before revenues are realized. 32 To investors, long-term investments in a country with a low
credit rating are unappealing as the risk of default on commitments remains for a longer period of time.
There are other, more short-term, investment options. Likewise, the probability of natural disasters such
as wildfires, pests and diseases increases with longer time horizons.

From the perspective of the public institution issuer, Forest Bonds are likely to be less attractive than
other Green Bonds, as social returns on forest projects tend to be lower and less tangible when
compared with other green projects. One reason is that the social returns on green energy and
infrastructure investments are higher than investments in forests. As highlighted in a World Bank Policy
Research Paper (World Bank 2000), high social returns on infrastructure are a function of the shortage of
the infrastructure in question. While the paper concludes that its results apply to electricity investments
in the poorest countries and road infrastructure investments in middle-income countries, shortages for
green infrastructure investments exist across all country income groups. Therefore, social returns on these
investments are large. More importantly, even where this shortage is only a perceived shortage by select
stakeholders, the nature of democratic governments and short political cycles may impact the
prioritization towards satisfying critical voter demands rather than following a different, possibly more
balanced, prioritization process for public investments. In that vein, as more people may be immediately
affected by public investments in renewable energy, clean transport, health, and education, the provision
of these services will usually be preferred over investments in forestry that may yield “tangible” returns
only in the medium-to-long term.

Corporations in the forest sector that issue bonds are typically large, multinational pulp and paper
companies that already have a good credit rating, a solid implementation record, and a diversified
business portfolio. The companies seldom advertise their issuances as “green” or “forest”, but simply as
bonds designed to help a successful corporation obtain capital to expand its business. These bonds enjoy
a greater flexibility in the use of their proceeds than Green Bonds, and are not systematically different
from other corporate bonds. This may suggest, however, that the quantity and value of Forest Bond
issuances is underreported since there are, for example, pulp and paper companies that are not

   Generating large revenue streams typically takes at least seven years for high-yield pulp and paper plantations.
High-quality timber production is characterized by rotation periods of 40–100 years, and even longer in temperate
climates.

necessarily registering or promoting their bonds as Forest Bonds. The predominant issuance of corporate
Forest Bonds is mostly relevant for investments in plantations, forest concessions, and their operation.
The associated processing and manufacturing could increase the value added and revenues from forest
products. In Brazil bonds are, however, not commonly issued by companies within the agriculture and
forestry sector, and out of all companies in the agriculture, forestry and farming sectors, fewer than 10%
have issued bonds (CBI 2016b). Governments can only seek to provide an enabling environment to
incentivize corporate Forest Bond issuance, but not appoint these issuances.

One reason why forest companies do not always promote their corporate bonds as green is that labeling
increases the costs, while institutional investors expect the same returns on Forest Bonds as they obtain
from other, more traditional, bonds. According to GFSG (2016), certification costs can range between
USD 10,000 and USD100,000 per issuance. These costs must be mobilized before the bond issuance and,
although comparatively small as a total amount, mobilizing this before capital is available could represent
a burden at this initial stage of the issuance. Furthermore, Green (and Forest) Bond issuers must meet
market expectations for returns, which is a difficult task when the issuing entity is not a large, well-
financed corporation (or municipality) with a track-record of positive results. In such cases, the labeling of
“Green” or “Forest” may raise additional questions about the financial viability and payback period. In
Brazil and other South American countries, large companies with some forest-related projects can issue
such long-term corporate bonds based on their overall financial strength. Brazil’s BRF, one of the world's
largest food companies, for example, became Brazil’s first corporation to issue a Green Bond in 2015, and
parts of the proceeds are designated for forest-related projects. But for those large companies, the
issuance is backed by the overall credit rating and indirectly secured through a portfolio of diversified
revenue streams (Sustainalytics 2015).

Smaller companies that cannot rely on a diverse business portfolio with a range of income streams will
find bonds less attractive as a financing instrument given the need for annual interest payments,
relatively short tenures, and certification/labeling costs. For smaller companies, bonds may be feasible
only if the investment can realize immediate and direct revenue streams to pay annual interest and the
repayment of the bond principal after a short tenure. In the forestry sector, this is realistic only in the
processing industry, where bond resources could be used for financing equipment or infrastructure that
leads to efficiency gains or additional product lines. However, for reforestation investments, bond
characteristics like annual interest rates and short tenures are a disadvantage due to the characteristic
time lapse between the investment and the generated revenue stream – even when fast-growing and
high-yield plantations are involved. Typically, smaller companies cannot use a balance sheet of a diverse
revenue portfolio to finance the bond, but would ultimately have to rely, at least partially, on the revenue
stream that is generated by the bond-based investment. In such a situation, a zero-coupon bond would
be a logical approach to accessing the capital market, as these essentially allow for a very long grace period
and reduced stress on issuers with limited cash flow. However, zero-coupons are unconventional
compared with other fixed-income products, and that zero-coupon bonds tend to be rather a niche
product. As such they do not align with most investors’ preferences (e.g. having a regular cash flow or just
being a more standard product) – probably even more so if, like forestry, the sector is not “mainstream”.

Impact and institutional buyers are the main investors targeted by the issuance of a Forest Bond
(Cranford et al. 2011). While impact investors are willing to accept an upper-medium-to-high investment-
grade credit rating, institutional investors are looking for AAA ratings. Impact investors are often willing
to compromise on their preferred investment characteristics (rating, liquidity or return) in exchange for
the assurance that the investment provides environmental benefits. Institutional investors, on the other
hand, act on behalf of large groups and therefore have the fiduciary duty to select secure investments.

                                                     46
The World Bank | Demystifying Forest Bonds

They are therefore constrained to select bonds with a high investment-grade credit rating and assured
high liquidity – characteristics not commonly associated with Forest Bonds.

A review of existing Forest Bonds revealed that neither project bonds nor bonds relying on REDD+ are
yet a reality in the forest sector. In our dataset, we found only one small pilot project in Chile (SIF Chile,
USD 13 million that would count as a forest project bond, and none that relied completely or partially on
REDD+ payments as a revenue source (see Annex B). This has not changed since Cranford et al. (2011)
observed that a project bond in the forest sector “has not yet been issued” (p. 26). It therefore appears
that project bonds in the forest sector are only a theoretical concept for now.

A recently issued Forest-Carbon Bond may change this and serve as an interesting pilot for issuing bonds
related to the carbon-performance of the associated investments. The investors of the bond that was
issued by the IFC in October 2016 were offered the option to receive either “cash or carbon” – i.e. choose
a regular monetary payment flow or a repayment in the form of carbon credits that the investor can then
use against their own carbon mitigation commitments, or trade and sell in the (carbon) market. It remains
to be seen how many investors opted for the carbon credit as repayment; what share of these used the
carbon credit to comply with enforced or voluntary mitigation commitments; and, if traded on the market,
what prices could be realized. Given that dominant carbon trading schemes such as the EU Emissions
Trading Scheme (ETS) do not yet accept forest-based carbon credits for trading, it also remains to be
analyzed if and how these credits would be sold. Another possible issue with such a scheme revolves
around the question of the property rights of carbon and whether “double counting” is permitted. Even
though private companies may own land and trees, national governments may prefer to count carbon
credits from private investments against their national commitments. It is not yet clear whether such
credits can be privately sold and included in national commitments at the same time – i.e. if the
government can benefit from the mitigation actions of the private sector.

In summary, the review of bonds issued in the forest sector further revealed the following
characteristics (for details see Annex B).
1. Since 2013, the number of forest-related bonds has increased but remains at a low level; 12 out of 20
   Forest Bonds have been issued since 2013.
2. Most of these bonds finance operations in countries with large forestry sectors (i.e. the US, Sweden
   and Brazil). 33
3. The issuance volume depends mainly on the company size and its experience in the forestry sector.
4. Two Brazilian corporations are among the companies with the highest issued volume of forest-related
   bonds (BRF and Fibria). These bonds are all high-yield forest plantations of species with well-known
   characteristics.
5. Most bonds are issued in USD, yet currencies other than USD are also used.
6. The tenure varies between three and 20 years, with an average tenure length of eight years.
7. The majority of forest sector bonds are issued by private companies, and the approaches employed
   are rarely transferable to a public sector bond issuance.

While the above discussion already indicates that an institutionalized lower-yield advantage is not the
primary motive for the issuance of Green Bonds, the explicit and implicit benefits and costs of Green
Bonds need to be analyzed further. This section aims to clarify which costs and benefits issuers may
expect from issuing a Green Bond versus a plain vanilla bond.

3.3.1      Benefits of Green Bonds
As one of the first issuers of Green Bonds, the World Bank explicitly stated that the broadening of the
investor base and the promotion of environmental credentials were the primary motives. Accordingly,
no advantages with respect to lower yields were expected or explicitly targeted. Current ex post analyses
do not suggest that Green Bonds receive a financial benefit per se, but that there is a slight interest rate
advantage over plain vanilla bonds on the secondary market due to demand and supply mismatches
(Standard & Poor’s 2016). The main challenge in analyzing the financial benefit is that information on the
relevant primary market trades is not publicly available.

This price advantage is not institutionalized but rather results from the demand and supply situation
for the specific bond issuance on the secondary market. In other words, the price advantage of a Green
Bond is not determined ex ante, but is a result of the issuing process and is fully visible only after it is
complete. Therefore, issuers can attempt to design the issuance in such a way that demand from investors
is high and likely to exceed the bond supply. The effective demand and supply situation and resulting price
advantage remain uncertain. A price advantage is not guaranteed and could be higher or lower for a
number of reasons – but ultimately it remains a function of a supply shortage, if any.

Barclays (2015) finds that investors (i.e. bondholders) are paying a 16.7 basis point (0.167%) premium
to acquire Green Bonds on the secondary market. 34 The model differentiates between the spread of
Green Bonds and comparable issues controlling for credit rating, currency, spread duration, etc. It argues
that this premium is partly attributable to opportunistic pricing based on strong demand from
environmentally focused funds. However, it should be noted that this analysis refers only to prices
achieved through trading on the secondary market, not on the primary market, and hence the issuer does
not benefit from this strong demand. Barclays’ results are confirmed by a yield curve analysis conducted
by Bloomberg Blog, which illustrates that green IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development) bonds trade on the secondary market at lower yields than plain vanilla IBRD bonds over
time. 35 If there is really a premium in the secondary market, it could indicate that the original pricing was
too low, and it could be a question of market development (Barclays 2015). However, whether such an
analysis is meaningful is open to question, and caution should be applied when drawing conclusions for
primary bond market prices. There is little trading for Green Bonds since investors tend to hold the bonds
for long periods –to comply with ESG requirements, for example. Hence, pricing indications become
theoretical prices that are not trading prices. If a bond tightens in the secondary market this does not
necessarily mean the original price the issuer paid was too high –i.e. that Green Bonds are cheaper from
an issuer’s perspective.



34
   A premium in this context means that bondholders accept a lower interest rate for the periodical interest
payments than they would accept for a comparable plain vanilla bond. The motivation is possibly the positive
association made with investing in a Green Bond.
35
   A yield curve displays the interest rate or yield of bonds with differing maturity dates. A lower yield curve is
advantageous for the issuer as their interest payments will be lower.

Even if this yield advantage were indicative of the actual cost savings for issuers, the cumulative benefit
would decrease with increasing coupon prices. For example, for a 12% baseline coupon the saving effect
would be only 1.4% of the total interest payments. Using a stylized numerical example to illustrate cost
savings, and assuming that an investment volume of 100 million were to be financed through bond
issuance, the total financial advantage gained through a Green Bond issuance accumulated over 15 years
would be roughly USD 2.5 million, or 1.4% of the total interest payment. This seems to be a rather small
amount compared with the overall investment burden, and might be insignificant when additional costs
for the issuance of the Green Bond are included. To put this into perspective, underwriting fees typically
range from 15 to 35 basis points depending on the size of the offering, the term, and other complexities.

While it is acknowledged that some analyses suggest a financial advantage of Green Bonds in secondary
markets, this comparison can be challenging as the parameters that influence secondary market prices
are complex. This reduces the reliability of such conclusions. Comparing one-on-one World Bank
issuances of Green Bonds and plain vanilla bonds with very similar characteristics (same currency, year of
issuance and tenure) reveals that Green Bonds are not systematically sold under better conditions than
the plain vanilla counterpart. Price advantages, price equalities and price disadvantages for Green Bonds
can be found for the different matches. Broadening the analysis and comparing Green Bonds versus their
mainstream counterparts across issuing entities shows an indicative price disadvantage for the issuer of
Green Bonds. A comparison of supranational Green Bonds shows a yield of at least a 15 basis point higher
than their supranational plain vanilla counterparts, while having a similar average maturity (Schroders
2015).

It is generally very challenging to make a valid comparison between Green Bonds and plain vanilla bonds
because a bond issuance price is derived from many factors which are difficult to determine in advance.
Factors that influence the price and are relatively easy to account for are issuance size, tenure and credit
rating. However, some of the previous results do account for the different credit ratings and should hence
be treated with some caution. Other factors are known but harder to account for. For example, corporate
and public bond issuances will likely contain different characteristics. The timing of the issuance is of vital
importance as credit market conditions change or alternative investment opportunities emerge and
vanish. Factors that are very tricky, if not impossible, to account for are investor relations; marketing
efforts associated with Green Bond issuance; or complementary measures, such as IFC’s offer to choose
between a cash or carbon-credit coupon for their Forest Bond. These factors can enhance the
attractiveness of a Green Bond but are highly case-specific.

Currently, examples can be found of Green Bonds trading both above and below the yield curve of their
plain vanilla counterparts. The consensus is that they largely trade in line with conventional bonds
(Standard & Poor’s 2016). Elders and Mammadov (2016) confirm this statement, asserting that labeling a
bond as green “has helped issuers attract new investors. Yet, these bonds have failed to offer a clear yield
advantage for issuers and suffer from added verification costs.” Anecdotal evidence from market insiders
indicates that a 2–3 basis point tightening could be achieved with European Green Bond issuance
(Standard & Poor’s 2016). But no such tightening has yet been experienced in the US market, where the
level of understanding and demand for environmentally driven issuance currently lags behind Europe
(Standard & Poor’s 2016).

This confirms the earlier finding that the reason for the premium paid in the secondary market for Green
Bonds is likely the result of a demand and supply mismatch leading to an undersupply of the bond in


                                                      49
The World Bank | Demystifying Forest Bonds

question. The reasons for this are manifold. Many of the Green Bonds that have been issued in the past
have been oversubscribed (Schroders 2015; The Economist 2014; see Annex B). 36 In the case of Forest
Bonds it is not clear whether the actual demand is strong enough to lead to oversubscription, as the
analysis of existing Forest Bonds found only three examples of Bonds with reported oversubscription (see
Annex B). In the general green-labeled bonds market, there are currently not enough bonds available to
meet investor demand, and this is driving up the price on the secondary market, whereas on the primary
market, investors might not be willing to pay such a premium.

Possible explanations for the oversubscription for Green Bonds are as follows.
−    Green Bonds attract a greater diversity of investors seeking environmental impact, thus increasing
     demand.
−    Green Bonds might be perceived as inherently less risky (or volatile) than comparable unlabeled Green
     Bonds, leading to higher risk-adjusted returns (Barclays 2015).
−    Some investors are obligated to invest a certain share of their capital in environmentally friendly
     activities.
−    Green Bonds provide additional value (public good) by delivering verifiable environmental benefits.

Investors’ strong interest in buying Green Bonds often results in a broader investor base, which is
advantageous for issuers, but governments might not be able to expand their already broad investor
base. Many sources report that Green Bonds attract investors who would not usually invest in a plain
vanilla bond of the same issuer (Morgan Stanley 2016; World Bank 2015b; CBI 2015). Issuers benefit from
strong investor demand in several ways. Most importantly, it means they can attract new kinds of investor,
diversifying the pool of individuals and institutions with an interest in their projects. It is also an attractive
feature from an issuer’s perspective that most Green Bond investors are “buy-and-hold investors”
(CAIA 2015). The broader interest in Green Bonds enables issuers to be selective and sell only to certain
investors, like those who are signatories to the GBP or to the Global Investor Statement on Climate Change
(Environmental Finance 2016). Moreover, issuers can try to increase the size of their offering, demand a
longer payback period, or seek better pricing through artificially low issuance volumes (whether this is
actually achieved is another question) (Citiscope 2016). However, the possibility of broadening the
investor base is probably more attractive for less-well-known issuers than for larger bond issuances such
as governments. Sovereign bonds issued by governments are probably among the most well-known
financial products in the market, and the scope to draw the attention of new investors to this bond by the
addition of a green label seems very limited. In addition, the market analysis for existing Forest Bonds
undertaken for this report has shown oversubscription to be less prevalent in the forest sector than in
other sectors.

Both investors and issuers can benefit from using Green Bonds as they can help to boost their reputation
or simply enable them to comply with self-imposed corporate social responsibilities (Environmental
Finance 2015a). Both governments and investors can improve their international reputation by using
Green Bonds to finance climate mitigation and economic development efforts across borders. Quality-
labeled Green Bonds have generally received favorable press coverage – especially if the bond is the first
for a given jurisdiction (Environmental Finance 2015a). Many pension funds and other institutional

36
  A bond is oversubscribed when the issuance price is too low or demand by investors is higher than expected.
When a new bond issue is oversubscribed, the issuer can adjust the price or offer more securities to reflect the
higher-than-anticipated demand.

investors are now mandated to include responsible and sustainable investments in their portfolios. Ethical
reasons play a role, and managers are seeking strategies to address the risk that climate change imposes
on other fund assets (Bloomberg Blog 2015).

Underwriters face a trade-off between a growing reputation for a broader investor base and the cost
of familiarizing themselves with Green Bond particularities. Green Bonds offer an opportunity to grow
the underwriter’s reputation as a high-value service provider that can attract a variety of investors. Large
buyers’ networks and access to high-demand offerings are indicators of quality for underwriters. Given
the growing number of responsible investors looking to buy quality Green Bonds, underwriters have a
great deal to gain if they acquire expertise in this new and growing area of debt financing (Environmental
Finance 2015a). This comes at the additional cost of understanding the eligibility criteria of this new and
not standardized financial product, which increases the opportunity cost for the underwriter.
Furthermore, the placement process may be hampered by the longer tenure and the need to retain
additional services, like the second opinion (FEBRABAN 2015).

The complexity of achieving a price advantage through the issuance of a Green Bond is exemplified by
a recent issuance of a Sustainability/Green Bond by a Turkish bank with dedicated investments in direct
and indirect climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, and sustainable infrastructure
(IFC 2016). The issuance, which was accompanied by the World Bank’s private sector arm, the IFC, and
realized in May 2016, started with an initial price considered to be 450 basis points, but resulted in a final
price of 387.5 basis points, or 62.5 basis points lower than the initial offering (due to a significant demand,
13 times oversubscription, and associated triple-price revision). However, while about a third of this gain
(20 basis points) is attributed to the green nature of the bond (IFC 2016), the remaining basis point gains
should be attributed to other factors such as the implementation of the pre-issuance roadshow and the
advisory support provided by the IFC.

3.3.2     Costs of Green Bonds
An assessment of the costs of Green Bonds shows that issuance and ongoing costs are at first usually
greater than those of plain vanilla bonds, but are difficult to quantify. The costs include additional
expenditures for defining the green criteria, monitoring and maintaining the proceeds as green, and
transparently communicating performance to investors over the lifetime of the bonds. The costs of
contracting a second-party opinion and preparing projects and reports for them are among the clearest
cost factors. During their life cycle, Green Bonds create additional costs at several stages and through
different agents. Figure 19 illustrates when additional costs may occur.

Both issuance and ongoing costs for a Forest Bond might be even higher than for “regular” green
projects. Comparing, for example, a solar energy project and a reforestation project can help illustrate
this point. For a solar plant the final output is easy to determine and verify. The day the solar plant
produces energy and feeds it into the system, the goal of producing renewable energy has been achieved
and tracking is straightforward. In contrast, the definition of a successful reforestation project is more
difficult. How tall would the trees have to grow, or what would be the stocking rate per ha for an area to
be considered reforested? Does an exotic species plantation count as reforestation under NDC?
Moreover, the possibility that reforestation efforts are offset by simultaneous deforestation in other
regions of the country – to relocate agricultural production, for example – is omnipresent. Wherever
reforestation and land restoration are undertaken on scale, monitoring the ongoing compliance often
requires detailed satellite image interpretation which is costly and not always available. Overall, defining
criteria and monitoring are particularly difficult and thereby costly for forestry projects. Table 8 contrasts
the costs and benefits of a Green Bond issuance.

3.4        Risks
Investing in bonds is generally viewed as a lower risk compared with other types of investment, such as
stocks. Bonds guarantee a fixed income stream through interest payments and the return of the principal
payment at nominal value at maturity. The level of the risks is dependent on two factors: (1) the issuing
entity – i.e. the default risk; and (2) whether it is an on-balance or an off-balance-sheet bond, where
commercial and market risk are relevant. Corporate bonds typically yield higher returns than bonds issued
by public entities because they are characterized by higher risks of defaulting on their financial obligations,
whereas countries “can always raise taxes”. In contrast to this general rule, bonds issued by countries with
unstable economies may be characterized by a higher risk premium compared with corporate bonds
issued by financially solid private sector issuers. In February 2016, Moody’s (2016a, 2016c), for example,

rated the two Brazilian companies BRF and Fibria at Ba1, which was one grade higher than the Brazilian
government credit rating of Ba2 at the time.

The default risk is the primary risk for on-balance Green and Forest Bonds that bondholders assume;
commercial and market risks, on the other hand, are relevant mainly to off-balance or project bonds.
There is no difference regarding risk for an investor between “normal” public sector bonds (on the balance
sheet) and Green and Forest Bonds. Furthermore, the default risk is independent of the investment’s
characteristics as it depends only on the ability and willingness of the issuing entity to repay the bond.
The ability to repay the bond is affected by the market and commercial risk, yet investors will most likely
look at the overall credit-worthiness of the originator when making the investment decision. For project
bonds (off the balance sheet) commercial and market risk are the primary risks, yet, as discussed
previously, forest project bonds have thus far rarely been issued.

For an “off-balance-sheet bond” (e.g. a project bond) investors could anticipate commercial risk and
demand insurance or guarantees against these risks. 37 Forestry is an unfamiliar sector for many investors
and therefore the perceived risk profile is high, as is the desire to insure against these risks. Insurance can

  It appears unlikely that investors would demand such a hedge for an “on-balance-sheet bond” since the overall
solvency of the issuing entity is decisive.

cap large losses, increase overall financial certainty, and improve credit terms and thereby access to
finance. Around 30% of all issued insurance is to attract investments to enterprises in new territories that
may be perceived as high-risk-bearing (Pardus 2016). The typical risk coverage for forest companies
includes events like fires, windstorms, or snow. Issues such as industrial action, malicious damage, and
civil commotion can be covered, but pests, diseases and theft are typically not. In Brazil, 40% of the insured
risk must stay in the local market and has to be covered by a Brazilian company (and not sold on the
international reinsurance market; Pardus 2016).

The insurance of traditional risks (i.e. fire, floods, etc.) to projects financed through Forest Bond
proceeds is not a necessary condition since the risk is reflected in the Bond’s price. Few forestry projects
actually use insurance. Rather than purchase insurance per se, issuers can apply large discounts to the
projected benefits or earnings of the project (Reddy, personal communication). For example, a project
could claim only half of the projected revenue - the other 50% could be an upside gain if realized but not
utilized in the pricing. The insurance costs will ultimately be reflected in the bond price and the question
of whether to insure or not becomes a zero-sum game.

BOX 2: MIGA INSURANCES IN PRACTICE
 In 2013, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) backed a World Bank and Santander Bank loan for
 the State of Sao Paulo for a transportation project. With MIGA’s credit enhancement, the cost of the commercial
 loan was lower and the tenure longer than São Paulo could have achieved on its own. World Bank Group (WBG)
 involvement allowed Banco Santander to book the risk of the transaction as World Bank/MIGA exposure rather
 than São Paulo or Brazil exposure, and helped preserve lines of credit for other operations in Brazil. MIGA, on the
 other hand, had an easier insurance process since the project had already gone through the World Bank due-
 diligence process, such as safeguard reviews (MIGA 2014).
 In Nicaragua, MIGA backed an investment of USD 48.8 million in support of the Bamboo Plantation for up to 15
 years against expropriation, war and civil disturbance. MIGA’s backing enabled the company to more than triple
 the original investment in Nicaragua and move forward with other international expansions. The possibility for
 MIGA to insure such Forest Bonds has existed only since late 2010. Before that, MIGA had insured equity
 investments and loans for timber and reforestation projects. MIGA is suited to insuring Forest Bonds because it
 has the financial scope to insure large amounts and for long periods of up to 15–20 years, matching the long-term
 nature of forest investments (EcoPlanet Bamboo 2015).


The MIGA of the World Bank Group can provide political risk insurance and credit enhancements, and
can thereby offer insurance that other companies are not able to provide. MIGA can help investors by
insuring eligible projects against losses relating to currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction,
expropriation, war, terrorism, and civil disturbance, breach of contract and non-honoring of financial
obligations. Moreover, MIGA can offer insurance with up to 15–20 years’ maturity, matching the long-
term nature of forest investments. The guarantee volume can be up to USD 600 million for any single
investment project with the option to use reinsurances for leveraging it up to the tenfold sum (Global
Canopy Programme 2014). MIGA’s political leverage with host countries and a strong capital position
provide it with an implied AA credit rating. The price for MIGA’s guarantee premiums is based on a
calculation of both country and project risk. Fees average approximately 1% of the insured amount per
year, but can be significantly lower or higher. An issuance of USD 10 billion would incur an annual fee of
USD 100 million (MIGA 2016).

4. Use of Bonds to Finance Forest Sector Investments under NDC: Options
   and Limitations
Bonds are only one of several instruments available to public or private investors to realize investments
in forestry. Taking account of the characteristics of bonds that were analyzed in section 3, investors
undergo a selection process to identify the optimal financing instrument specific to their needs. Although
different in its nuances, such a selection process as outlined in Figure 20 is largely analogous for public or
private investors and the steps taken are also relatively independent of the targeted type of forest
investments, such as conservation, productive forest management, or downstream processing.

The World Bank | Demystifying Forest Bonds

Following the suggested selection criteria illustrates possible bottlenecks for using bonds for forest
investments:
Step 1: Is there an urgent need for large-scale intervention?
Public: As discussed above, the public prioritization process for competing investments is a political
        process that is influenced by certain factors, such as immediate impact on economic growth and
        shared prosperity, which entails how many people are impacted by those investments and in what
        time span. Compared with other green investments, such as renewable energy, clean transport,
        or green housing, investments in forestry may be regarded as lower-tier development priorities,
        hence they will often have lower priority.
Private: A private investor would probably not even initiate this identification process if there were not
         already a conclusion – and decision – that an investment is needed and that funds needed to be
         raised.

Step 2: Are there sufficient resources available to finance that large-scale intervention?
Public: For public investments, resource availability is a complex question and, inter alia, again related to
        the competing investment priorities that were addressed in the first step. Governments rarely
        issue themed bonds but rather opt for general budget support. Similarly, financial commitments
        on bond issuances are met through the collection of taxes and other fees and revenue sources.
Private: When going through a process to identify suitable financing options, a private sector player has
         already concluded that additional resources are needed; hence the question of whether sufficient
         resources are needed is superfluous.

Step 3: Is there currently capacity to absorb large-scale finance and to implement that intervention?
Public: From an institutional perspective, for the specific case of NDC commitments, there must be a
        reality check to determine whether those commitments are indeed realistic – i.e. the associated
        expenditures. Institutional capacity is limited in many World Bank client countries. Disbursements
        at scale will not occur as the policy and implementation framework is not in place. However,
        whether such a criterion is explicitly evaluated or implicitly included in the public investment
        prioritization process of a country is beyond this analysis – i.e. further political economy analyses
        are required.
Private: For a private sector actor, the capacity of resource implementation is much simpler to address.
         Depending on the technical and financial size and nature of the anticipated investment, either
         existing capacity is sufficient or capacity needs to be increased –through hiring new staff, investing
         in technical capacity, or both.

Step 4: Is there a reasonable expectation for mechanisms to be in place soon for repaying the bond?
Public: For the public sector, this issue is related to the question of how much impact the investment
        would create for economic growth. It is therefore indirectly addressed in the first step of the
        financial instrument selection. The reasonable demonstration as to how associated revenue
        streams and employment would be created through a proposed forest investment – with impacts
        on tax and other revenues – is thus one of the most critical determinants for bond-based finance.
Private: Given that steps 1–3 are of less relevance for private sector actors, the structure of the anticipated
         revenue stream is the most important determinant of whether bonds should be used as a
         financing instrument. For plantation investments, the time lapse between the investment and the

                                                      58
The World Bank | Demystifying Forest Bonds

        revenue stream is critical. Only large-scale players that can cross-subsidize bond issuance can
        manage this forest-specific feature and provide adequate confidence to investors for making a
        bond issuance realistic. Bonds would be more feasible for wood-processing industries, such as
        pulp and paper – as soon as the investment is realized, revenue can be generated through the
        sale of wood products.

Looking at public and private sector investments combined, the reasonable expectation for mechanisms
to be in place for paying back the bonds emerges as the most critical parameter for determining the
suitability of bonds to finance forest investments. Taking account of the risk-related challenges
associated with this criterion, as discussed in the previous section, this structural analysis explains why
the share of Forest Bonds is currently limited. Only if this decisive bottleneck can be successfully addressed
will the propensity to select bonds as a financing instrument for forest investments increase.

Another argument that favors the use of plain vanilla over Forest Bonds is that making forest
investments through general budget allocations allows for a more flexible project selection than would
be the case for a Green or Forest Bond. Commitments that have been made at the date of issuance of
such a specific bond have to be met. It could, for example, become more feasible to intensify reforestation
efforts in one specific region of the country and less so in other states, and thereby shift the focus of the
investments in a way that is not congruent with the original bond strategy. In the event of tax income
being too low, governments have the option to issue plain vanilla government bonds to address financing
gaps. Only if there is a need – and reliable potential – for broadening the investor base would a Green or
Forest Bond become a noteworthy option. The decision tree can help policymakers decide whether a bond
is a desirable option at all.

Once a bond issuance is selected as the most suitable financing instrument, the financing structure and
resource mobilization flows need to be designed. A bond can have various structures that will be
determined by the generation of revenues, the institutional arrangements, the delivery of funds, and the
risk. The question of how revenues are generated to repay the bond is crucial for investors and issuers
alike. The funds for repaying the bond do not necessarily have to come from forest activities and could
be, for example, tax revenue. A second important question is how finances are managed, and by whom.
Depending whether the finance is managed by the government, a corporation, or an SPV, will influence
the delivery of activities and the associated risk. The kind of activities that are financed through the bond
depend largely on the institutional arrangement. Governments can, for example, finance monitoring
systems while corporations are more likely to finance plantations. Finally, the risk and the risk premium
depend mainly on the institutional arrangement because the default risk is the primary risk in all models
and the reliability of revenue flows is only a secondary risk, as they can be offset by other income sources,
such as taxes or revenues from other activities. Figure 21 presents a framework that summarizes these
key features.

In the following sections, several bond-financing models will be used to exhibit different options of how
bond issuance could be operationalized in support of forest investments. For this purpose, we first
discuss the resource flow and risks of different bond frameworks, before elaborating in a second step the
potential scenarios of the World Bank’s role to support the bond issuance. These stylized implementation
arrangement models were differentiated between public and private sector investments with the aim of
further contributing to understanding the practicalities of bond-based forest investments.


4.1      Public sector models
Public investments aim to benefit the economy at large. Hence, policymakers will allocate tax revenues
according to the government’s priorities. Public investments can be in support of policy changes,
governance enforcement, and other provision of public goods. They are not necessarily a physical entity
from which a stream of revenues is directly generated. In that vein, public sector investment decisions
should be theoretically targeted towards those yielding the highest social returns. On the other hand,
public sector decisions may also be motivated by a political economy framework – e.g. favoring voter-
positive outcomes that deviate from a socially optimal investment with the highest welfare gains.

Governments are in a privileged situation in that they can issue a bond that is backed solely by tax
payments to fund forest activities, such as conservation measures, which do not provide an immediate
financial return. Such an approach would follow the conventional example of bond issuances and would
allow the government to tap into a new pool of investors who are looking for green investment
opportunities. In this framework (Figure 22), the government issues a bond to (1) raise finance, and (2)
fund forest activities. These could range from public afforestation investments, to support to smallholder
forest activities, conservation measures, improving sector governance, to research and development.
Furthermore, the government (3) collects taxes as is customary, and (4) uses tax revenues to repay the
bond. This modality increases the country’s debt burden. Its success depends on the government’s
credibility to use the funds for the forest activities it has advertised. A key feature of such a bond is that
it is held on the balance sheet of the issuing government. As such, the primary risk to the bondholder is
the creditworthiness of the government – i.e. its ability to collect, and willingness to use taxes to pay back
the bond. In other words, investors will look at the default risk of the country as indicated by the country’s
credit rating and not any specific, ring-fenced forest activity.

Using revenues generated from forest activities as a revenue source is very similar to a tax-backed bond
in terms of risks and the general framework. In other sectors, governments have already issued similar
revenue-backed bonds – e.g. to raise funds for toll roads. The main difference between this and the
previous framework is that (2) revenue-generating forest activities are funded, and (3a) used to repay the
bondholders. If these revenues fall short, however, the government will have to (3b) step in using tax
revenues as a back-up because the bond is still on its balance sheet (see Figure 23). Therefore, the primary
risk for the bondholders is still the government default risk. From the government’s perspective, this
approach has the advantages of potentially using less tax money, and that parties benefiting from the
forest activity pay for it. Earmarking the forest-based revenues can help increase confidence that there
are specific revenues of a known scale available to pay back the bond.

Considering the frameworks examined, the role of the World Bank or other IFIs in supporting the
issuance of a Green Bond can take a variety of forms. For this analysis, four stylized scenarios are
selected. At this point, how revenues are generated and what kind of activities are financed are not
relevant for the scenarios. Rather we are looking in detail into the institutional arrangement and the roles
of the World Bank, governments or national development banks. The government’s economic
performance and credit rating will determine the bond coupon. Any immediate cash return on these
public sector investments is important only for the government’s internal selection process among
investment alternatives, if at all. As stated previously, from an economic perspective, it would be expected
that governments aim at investments with the highest social return on capital, but this may also be driven
by the political motives defined by the political economy framework of the sector (see section 3.2).

A misunderstanding that frequently arises in global forest financing discussions is that the World Bank
cannot issue any kind of bond on behalf of a country – either plain vanilla, Green, or Forest Bond. In
fact, the World Bank issues Green Bonds on the basis that it matches proceeds with certified green
investments. For a client country it makes no difference if projects are financed through Green Bonds or
plain vanilla bonds as the conditions are the same (see section 3.4. above for further detail). The risk for
the bondholders in this scenario would be the risk of the World Bank and not of the project or the country
in which the forest activities are executed. Such a situation is depicted in Scenario 1 in Figure 24.

Similar to the first scenario, the World Bank can also advise a country issuing Green or Forest Bonds
(Scenario 2). In this scenario, the government would issue a Forest Bond to fund forest activities and use
tax revenues (or revenues it generates from forest activities) to repay bondholders. The World Bank – or
other financial institutions – can provide advisory services regarding the specificities of the bond issuance
process by relying on its own experience and other client countries’ experience in the issuance of Green
Bonds. This model applies to IBRD countries that are perceived as sufficiently mature to issue their own

                                                     62

bonds since the risk of default is the main credit risk. The resources raised would then be invested in forest
sector activities supporting the delivery of NDC objectives, which do not necessarily generate revenues.

In Scenarios 3 and 4, a national development bank, such as BNDES, would act as the issuing entity, with
the government providing the enabling framework for Green or Forest Bond issuance. Again, as in
Scenario 2, the World Bank or other financial institutions could provide advisory services. The important
aspect in this scenario is that the government creates a supportive enabling environment for Green Bond
issuance, which could address, for example, aspects of certification or other features specific to Green
Bond issuances. The government could also enhance the investment framework for green investments so
that the pool of investments that are eligible for certification would be increased and deliver against the
Green Bond targets. The selection of feasible projects likely requires commensurate technical expertise
within the respective local development bank. The World Bank could provide support to the selection
process through technical assistance, such as establishing selection criteria. The main risk would be the
default of the national development bank, which is linked to the government’s capacity and willingness
to provide support, if needed. However, in the case of Brazil, federal government-owned banks have even
lower credit ratings than those in the private sector due to the currently prevailing weaknesses in their
operating environment (Fitch 2016).

Scenario 4 deviates from Scenario 3 insofar as it employs a different model for use of the bond-based
resources. Instead of a direct interaction between the national development bank and the forest
investment, the resources will be provided to one or several intermediaries. These could be regional
development banks or other decentralized financial institutions, but also existing forest financing funds
dedicated to providing financial resources for sustainable forestry to small landholders, for example,
through subsidized credit lines. Such financial arrangements are especially important when NDC
objectives require investments by many small landowners, either for re- and afforestation or the
sustainable management of existing forests.

This approach is especially appealing where it provides capital to structurally disadvantaged regions
that are targeted for NDC reforestation activities. Outgrower schemes are a nuanced model when active
forest product value chains are associated with such investments. 38 For Brazil, such intermediary
programs could include among others ABC, FNE verde, or Bolsa Floresta. On a global scale, there is an
increasing number of examples of financial incentive schemes for re- and afforestation and sustainable
forest management targeting small land holders (Kapp 1999, Kraienhorst 1999, Mes and Tarazona 1999,
Souter and Kapp 1999). Again, the risk that bondholders will consider is the default of the issuing national
development bank and not the intermediary or the small landowners.


4.2       Private sector models
For a private sector company with a sustainable forestry portfolio, asset location, ownership and
stability of related cash flows are the central considerations in the resource flow frameworks. The

38
  Outgrower schemes are binding arrangements through which a company (e.g. a pulp and paper producer)
ensures its supply of forest products by individual or groups of farmers.

                                                     63

financial viability of sustainable natural growth forestry in Brazil exists in many places, but the failure of
governments to restrict illegal logging, and to clarify and enforce land rights as well as the country’s
infrastructure gap have detrimental effects on sustainable forestry investments. Lack of enforcement and
the influx of illegally harvested timber into markets erodes the competitive position of legally, and most
often more expansively produced timber. Likewise, disputes over land rights can be costly and take many
years to be resolved, if ever.

The framework for a corporate Forest Bond is similar to that of a public revenue-backed Forest Bond.
The main difference is that, as a back-up, the corporation has to rely on revenues from its operations
instead of tax payments. In this framework (see Figure 25), the corporation issues a bond to (1) raise
investments, and (2) use these to fund revenue-generating forest activities such as plantations. Moreover,
(3a) the corporation collects the revenues from the forest activities and, since this bond is held on the
balance sheet, the corporation will have to (3b) complement the revenue stream if necessary with income
from other activities, in order to (4) repay the bondholders. Whether the revenues stem from forest
activities or source, or even from non-sustainable activities, does not affect the green label as long as the
activities financed through the bond comply with the GBP.

The primary risk associated with a bond issuance by a private corporation differs from that associated
with public sector bonds. While it is also the credit rating of the company that determines the coupon of
the bond, this credit rating links the bond and the targeted investment more directly, especially the
smaller and more homogeneous the private sector company (e.g. for companies focusing only on
plantation management). In those cases, the generated financial (cash-flow) revenues from the
investment and other activities of the company can play a vital role in attracting investors. It is likely that

in most contexts, the so-called “sovereign ceiling” applies, 39 which means that no firm is more
creditworthy than its government, and hence the costs for a corporate to issue a Forest Bond are at least
as high as for a government (Durbin and Ng 2005).

A Green Project Bond would represent an alternative to avoid the issuer’s default risk, by separating
the project risk from the corporate risk. If a corporation decides to finance a forest project through a
project bond, it would first (1) set up an SPV to keep the bond off the balance sheet and separate eligible
assets from the other assets and liabilities of the project company. Investors would (2) purchase the bond
from the SPV, which (3) uses these funds to finance forest activities, that will (4) generate revenues that
can (5) be used to repay the bondholder. Within this framework, investors are directly exposed to
commercial and market risk as the default risk of the project is intertwined with these two risks. The risks
include fluctuations, regulatory risk, natural hazard risk and political risk, to name just a few.

FIGURE 26: FRAMEWORK FOR A CORPORATE FOREST PROJECT BOND

A cost-reduction strategy in these corporate frameworks is to pool natural forest management with
plantation forestry to create a blended portfolio of assets to mitigate some of the commercial and
market risks. While natural forest management offers high returns at high risks, plantations offer a high
degree of consistency and predictable cash flows. From a commercial standpoint, these assets are less
risky, and are generally more attractive for lenders than the management of natural forests. Different
cash flows within the portfolio could flow to different tranches of the structure of a project bond. More
predictable revenues, such as those from plantations, would be assigned to the senior note, while less
certain revenues such as natural growth would flow into junior notes.

The scenarios for private sector Forest Bond issuance and the roles of the World Bank and other
financial institutions are similar to the public sector and build on the previously presented resource
flows. In the simplest scenario, the IFC, as the World Bank’s private sector arm, would issue Green Bonds

39
  As discussed previously, Brazil has seen instances where the “sovereign ceiling” did not apply; however, this
could easily change in the future.

(based on criteria as defined in the Green Bonds issuance) and make the raised resources available to
private companies investing in green projects, which in turn would use the generated revenues to repay
the IFC. The primary risk for bondholders would be the default of the IFC. As for the public model, the
financial terms of the transaction would be no different than for other IFC transactions and, very likely,
without any price advantage despite the IFC’s AAA credit rating. In Scenario 2, the IFC could act as an
advisory service provider to a company that aims at issuing Green Bonds on the financial market. The risk
premium would depend on the corporate or project credit rating.

FIGURE 27: STYLIZED PRIVATE SECTOR GREEN BOND-BASED FOREST FINANCING MODELS

Scenario 3 represents a mix of the public and private sector approach, as a national development bank
issues the bond and uses the resources raised in support of private sector forest investments, such as
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) specializing in forestry. In contrast to larger forestry
companies that can issue bonds on their own, SMEs and community groups need an intermediary financial
institution to make use of these financing instruments. The IFC could provide advisory services to both
the SME and the issuing entity. In this scenario, the default risk would apply to the national development
bank and not to the corporation. Supporting forestry SMEs is likely the most effective way to promote
pro-poor growth in the forestry sector. Private companies focusing mainly on wood processing could also
support smallholders through outgrower schemes and, depending on the size of the company, could set
up such a model through bonds without the help of an intermediary. By taking a proactive stance on
ownership rights, local sustainable trade networks and payments for environmental services revenue,
such a facility would help develop the potential market for loan providers by enhancing their knowledge
of borrower assets.

The advisory service that the IFC and probably other development bank private sector entities could
provide can be categorized as client risk management, anchor investments, and credit enhancement
(see Figure 28). To reduce the risk of an issuance for a client, the IFC can offer hedging instruments directly
to clients who do not have full access to hedging products, such as interest rate or cross-currency swaps
The IFC could also commit to subscribing to an issuance ahead of the public offering, which can be
communicated to prospective investors in order to send a positive signal. This aspect is critical as it is likely
to result in an over-subscription for the Green Bond, which, as discussed before, can lead to basis point
reductions. This price correction, however, is then not an attribute of the green investment, but is due to
the IFC’s pre-issuance subscription. Moreover, the IFC can provide a partial credit guarantee to improve
the credit rating of an issuance for wider investor access and longer-term financing. Similar to the pre-
issuance subscription, this move will motivate investors and could lead to over-subscription and basis
points reductions that are not at all a result of the green nature of the bond issuance. This demonstrates
that the analysis which suggests an average 16.7 basis points advantage for Green Bonds (see section 3.3)
may even be too optimistic, as some of this advantage must be attributed to factors other than the green
nature of the bond issuance.

4.3       Special financing mechanisms
The World Bank successfully used a commitment-backed method to raise funds for the GAVI vaccination
program (GAVI 2016). The unique feature of this approach was to issue the bond against future donor
pledges for the program. Thereby funds became available immediately, before the donors actually
contributed their share. The future financial pledges are used to pay the bond’s yield and, eventually,
redeem it. From the donor’s perspective, this approach did not constitute an additional liability in their
current budget as its obligation is phased over time.

Following the example of the GAVI alliance, a commitment-backed Forest Bond could be used to raise
funds on the capital market. The bond would be 1) issued by an independent and off-balance-sheet forest
finance facility to 2) fund forest activities. 3) Revenues would be generated through commitments made
by one or a group of donors and 4) used to pay back the bondholders. Since the revenue generation is

                                                       67
The World Bank | Demystifying Forest Bonds

decoupled from the underlying forest investment, the financial means raised through this type of bond
could be delivered to forest activities that do not have a financial return but that likely feature large social
returns on a global level. The primary risk to bondholders will reside in the ability and willingness of
countries that have backed the bond to honor their commitment – i.e. the default risk of the committed
countries. The World Bank could serve in this framework as an advisor due to its experience with the GAVI
alliance, and as a convener while also acting as a donor to the facility. Likewise, the governments of the
targeted countries could make commitments to the facility.

While appealing in theory, a duplication of the GAVI approach for the forestry sector is unlikely for now:
monitoring and attribution of results is more challenging and direct effects are not immediate. For
vaccinations, cause–effect relationships are very clear. The resources raised through the bond pay the
vaccine and other related expenses. The result is the immunization of a certain number of people against
a disease. For forestry, the relationship is less clear as it involves multiple steps with significant transaction
costs and the evaluation of success would be significantly more complex.

As has been shown, Green Bonds do not decrease the funding costs for issuers of a Forest Bond;
however, price advantages could be attained through securitization. Securitization provides capital
market investors with two key benefits (IFC 2007):
−   Structural preference: The collection of assets included in a securitization have either performed well
    on a historical basis or are believed likely to do so in the future, so the default risk is low.
−   Legal preference: While a conventional investor claim is subject to the bankruptcy procedures of the
    jurisdiction in question in the event of a default, an asset-backed investor will already have legal
    control of the assets securing their claim. Creating this legal preference – isolating the asset from any
    other claim – is the key to securitization, and requires the establishment of an SPV to hold the assets.

However, Green or Forest Bonds do not offer any particular advantage in the process of securitization.
It might be even more difficult to create an attractive diversified portfolio with strictly green assets. From

                                                         68
The World Bank | Demystifying Forest Bonds

an investor’s perspective, having a claim over a diversified portfolio is a significantly lower risk than a claim
over an individual asset. In other words, investors are not interested in “putting all their eggs in one
basket”. The diversification, for example, of a portfolio based exclusively on forestry projects in the
Amazon would be very low, and thereby the risk and required interest rate would be expected to be high.

Securitization works well with collections of relatively homogeneous but illiquid assets. Once pooled
and repackaged, incoming cash flow and other economic benefits from a pool can be sold as securities.
The most common example of this is the pooling and repackaging of repayments on mortgages and car
loans. The question of whether securitization could help to overcome the finance gap for the NDC needs
to be answered. However, this would be a separate analysis that goes beyond the scope of this report.

5. Conclusions
The expectation that the significant financing needs for land restoration and reforestation under NDCs
may be met by Green, or more specifically Forest Bonds is unlikely to be fulfilled. This report has
exposed important limitations, but also misconceptions, associated with bonds as a forest financing
tool, resulting in an overall sobering picture. Although the Green, Climate, and Forest Bonds market has
grown exponentially in recent years, the agriculture and forest sectors amount to less than 3% of all Green
Bonds. While there is no doubt that the volume of Green Bonds will continue to grow, the potential for
bonds-based forest sector financing are likely to be limited due to the current structure of the bond
market and the attributes of Green Bonds financing. Even for general Green Bonds, it is not yet clear
whether the financial benefits resulting from the current over-demand can eventually off-set transaction
costs entailed in Green Bonds issuances, such as second opinion and financial flow monitoring. A broader
or more diversified investor base and a better marketing potential appear to be the most tangible
advantages of a Green Bond over a plain vanilla bond.

Sectors such as renewable energy, green transport, or sustainable housing appear better suited for
employing Green Bonds as a financing tool. In contrast, the specific needs of forestry investments do
not align well with the attributes and financing requisites of bonds, including Green Bonds. This
mismatch relates predominantly to the underlying forest financing challenge of facing a significant time
lapse between the initial investments and the resulting income stream, which is emblematic of forest
investments. As discussed, the tenure of a Green Bond is, on average, shorter than for an unlabeled Green
Bond (or average bond more generally). Furthermore, most bonds require annual or semi-annual coupon
payments directly after issuance. This demands a near immediate income stream, combined with the
need to repay the principal at a shorter maturity. Considering the lengthy time lapse between investment
and eventual revenue streams, this is especially challenging for forest sector investments.

Although some bond-based financing structures, such as zero-coupon bonds, are theoretically suited to
mitigating the forest-investment-specific financing challenges, the report’s market analysis did not
suggest that such structures are employed in the forest sector. Moreover, it is likely that other attributes
specific to forestry continue to form a major disincentive for motivating such finance. For example, the
time lapse impediment of forest investments is further magnified by the fact that average credit ratings
for Forest Bonds tend to be lower than for average Green Bonds, resulting in higher coupons payments
that reflect the risk profile of forest investments. Compared with other sectors, the lower investment
volumes, investment scope, spatial and stakeholder heterogeneity, and the lack of secured and immediate
income streams are secondary but equally important differences that disadvantage the forest sector. This
may explain why, so far, most of the innovative bond issuances in the Green Bond market, such as zero-
coupon bonds, were undertaken by international finance institutions, especially the World Bank.
However, as discussed in the analysis, here the bond issuance is not related to a specific investment, but
serves to finance a resource pool of the IFI’s green investments. Even here, many of the issuances had an
exploratory character and were relatively small in volume, and the suitability for further mainstreaming
and scaling remains to be seen.

The objective disadvantage of forest financing attributes for using bonds as a financing instrument is
further increased by the investors’ subjective preferences for other sectors. Land tenure challenges,
possible interference with indigenous people’s rights, or the perceived destruction of forests due to
timber extraction are just a few examples of the sector’s reputational challenges. Consequently, forest
investments are often unfavorably judged as regards their green, climate, or sustainability attributes,


                                                    71
especially when logging and other productive uses of forests are involved. Even third-party sustainable
management certification may be insufficient to allay these concerns.

From an environmental impact point of view, a secondary effect of the observed investor preferences
could be that due to a rather “soft” interpretation of “greenness”, Green Bonds will become increasingly
mainstream, with their incremental environmental impact uncertain. This concern is further amplified
by the current lack of transparent and widely accepted global standards, as well as the absence of clearly
defined environmental impact benchmarking for regulating the certification of green investments in the
matching process with the resources raised by a Green Bond. What kind of effect this situation has on
financing bond-based forest investments remains unclear.

The broader global discussion on deforestation is still commonly (although casually) associated with
timber extraction and the productive use of forests. This preconception makes it doubtful that
productive forest management – i.e. the sustainable extraction of timber and other wood and non-wood
products – would necessarily benefit from an elevated regulatory framework, better benchmarking of
green impacts, or independent third-party sustainability certification. With the dominant concern of
global forest loss and an unfavorable political economy around the productive use of forests, the
opportunities associated with such uses to meet low-carbon growth objectives and to provide value chains
for incentivizing investments into re- and afforestation remain either largely unnoticed or are perceived
as having too many risks and challenges.

Although the disadvantages of using bonds for forest finance apply to public and private sector
investments alike, the constraints on public sector financing are of primary concern when discussing
financing needs under NDCs. The principal reason is that NDC commitments are public commitments and
are not directly linked to private sector interests. Although it is widely acknowledged that a combination
of public and private sector investments is needed to meet NDC targets, it is the public sector’s primary
responsibility to provide an enabling framework of policies that incentivize private sector investments,
including the facilitation of the use of bonds as a possible financing instrument for such investments.

Forest Bonds must meet market expectations for returns regardless of whether issuances are made
with the objective to meet forestry-related NDC investment needs or not. Some of the NDC activities,
for example improved forest-monitoring systems, are unlikely to yield returns that are sufficiently high to
compete with other green investments (e.g. renewable energies). For forest plantations the returns can
be boosted through land leasing or using public lands because land costs are a considerable cost factor
that can hereby be avoided. However, this limits the potential of using the land and its appreciation as
collateral. In 2010, the IRR for plantation investments in Brazil without land costs (i.e. existing landowners)
ranged from 17% to 23%, and for investments including land costs, the return ranged between 9% and
12% (Cubbage et al. 2007).

In contrast to the demand on the public sector for taking the lead role in these investments, the uneven
economic performance of most forest countries and the competition for scarce public finances by other
sectors and development priorities create an additional constraint on the governments of forest-rich
countries. As the analysis demonstrated, many forest-rich countries are confronted with unfavorable
credit ratings resulting in high bond coupons and high costs of public investments. This fiscal constraint,
coupled with a high demand for basic infrastructure related to energy, transport and housing, provides
for conditions where a government integrates green investments more easily into countries’ broader
development agenda and economic growth strategy, hence favoring these sectors over forestry. As green
infrastructure investments generate co-benefits, including many environmental benefits and the delivery


                                                      72
against low-carbon development objectives as well as NDC targets, public perceptions of such
prioritization outcomes will likely be favorable.

Many forest-rich developing countries also experience significant institutional constraints that stand in
the way of efficiently disbursing public funds for NDC-linked forest programs – even if the constraints
regarding instruments and perception were absent. This situation further elicits decision-makers to
allocate public funds to sectors where there is an investment gap but elevated institutional capacity,
together with the promise of higher political returns such as conceivably would be the case for
infrastructure.

Reflecting on these constraints in the context of forest-related NDC targets, governments would have
to prioritize those forest sector investments that yield high economic returns and stimulate a high
degree of private investment. Most likely, those would not be direct investments in forestry activities,
such as re- and afforestation. The focus would be on investments that indirectly impact the forestry sector,
especially those that have the potential for creating multiplier effects in terms of crowding-in additional
financing. Independent of whether resulting financing is mobilized from abroad as foreign direct
investments or originates domestically, such measures could also have a positive impact on the use of
bonds for forest financing as investors might respond to more favorable investment conditions.

Countries can choose from multiple options for stimulating increased investments in the forestry sector,
especially bonds-based forest finance, which can be clustered into five broad groups: (i) improving
forest sector governance; (ii) enhancing the regulatory framework determining the use of bonds for
forest investments; (iii) enhancing the financial incentives for investments into forestry; (iv) stimulating
demand for forest products, especially wood and timber; and (v) providing incentives to smallholders
for forest investments, especially as regards re- and afforestation. It is unlikely that addressing only one
of these topics will yield the expected results. Contingent on country conditions, only a mix of policy
interventions from these groups would stimulate NDC-related forest investments, while also creating the
desired co-benefits for economic development. As many analyses have pointed out in the past, forest
governance and tenure reforms would need to be given highest priority, especially for incentivizing private
sector investments. However, while governance reforms are a necessary condition, they are not sufficient,
as only the rigorous enforcement of such governance frameworks will have the desired effects.

To scale up private sector forest investments, one challenge identified by the analysis in need of
immediate attention is that bonds-based forest finance to date suits only the financial capacities of
larger companies and institutional investors. In contrast, and contingent on prevailing forest and land
tenure regimes, the private sector can comprise a rather heterogeneous group of actors ranging from
large-scale forest companies to community-based forest enterprises, to smallholder investors. Each of
these actors responds to different, though related, incentive frameworks. Given that the broad financing
terms for Green and Forest Bonds are not very different from general bond issuances, further innovation
is needed to make bonds-based finance suitable for the wide range of medium- and small-scale
stakeholders and potential investors.

As investors seem to disfavor investing in bonds that support investments in productive forest
management due to a perceived reputational risk, one option for governments to stimulate
investments in forestry may be through complementary measures that target a mitigation of these risks
and stimulate the demand for forest products. Those complementary measures could range from
facilitating a framework for transparent third-party certification to increasing the demand for wood
through public procurement policies. Other sectors, especially agriculture, may provide additional models


                                                    73
for stimulating demand for forest commodities, especially from smallholders. Secure demand coupled
with reliable price levels and, hence, revenue streams could be important for driving forest investments,
especially for mitigating the investment risk resulting from the lack of immediate revenue streams after
the initial investments. This could not only motivate smallholder investors, but may also facilitate the use
of innovative bonds structures, such as zero-coupon bonds, that have not been utilized to date.

Even though the country context that determines the suitability of bonds as a financing instrument for
forest investments may vary, several implications for the country case of Brazil can be identified. First,
the current economic environment makes it difficult for Brazil increase public debt. Second, pressing
investment needs in sectors other than forestry reduce the importance of issuing Green and Forest Bonds
for forest financing to meet NDC financing needs. In this situation, public sector investments should target
leveraging private sector investments by enhancing the overall incentive framework for such investments.
Potential activities could range from targeting illegal logging that undercuts prices of legally and
sustainably produced timber, to incentivizing smallholder approaches to re- and afforestation. Investing
in targeted research to buttress such reform efforts may yield the multiplier effects for private sector
investments that are needed to meet NDC investment targets.

The following themes, while not particularly costly, do need to be researched or supported to further
the Forest Bonds agenda in Brazil.
−   Innovative approaches to securitizing bonds based on standing timber volumes from natural forest
    concessions, purchase agreements with international development banks for carbon; “Performance-
    based Payments” for reduced-impact logging or reduced deforestation; and aggregation models of
    small operators via associations which scale up less-traditional assets.
−   Production and processing of lesser-known timber species and non-timber forest products to increase
    revenues and efficiency of operations.
−   Incentives for project-specific bonds based on productive activities with reliable revenue streams,
    flexible tenures, variable rates, and less traditional sources of revenue.
−   Incentive programs based on reduced costs to producers (rather than subsidies) to promote long-
    term investment in forest-friendly sectors rather than in activities with a shorter payback period and
    negative environmental impacts.
−   Incentives to high-quality underwriters with strong credit-worthiness to achieve high bond ratings.
−   Local agencies to offer second opinions on the use of proceeds and general allocation process by
    Forest Bonds to reduce costs (but linked to international agencies to ensure global credibility).

Further recommendations aiming to improve the overall environment with a view to accomplishing the
country’s NDC targets may be found in the World Bank report “Brazil’s INDC Restoration and Reforestation
Target” (World Bank 2016a).

Current constraints notwithstanding, there are promising areas for enhancing the incentive framework
for this finance instrument through further innovation. For example, bond issuances related to carbon
finance may be promising, although aspects such as carbon tenure and carbon pricing remain critical
issues. Some recently tested forest carbon-based financing models, such as Debt for Climate Swaps,
Environmental Policy Performance Bonds, or Debt for Climate Policy Performance Swaps, are still small in
scale and have not yet moved beyond the pilot stage. The underlying structures of these financing


                                                    74
instruments, and the options for scaling-up, are yet to be analyzed. In addition, guarantees provided by
national development banks could serve to mitigate some of the risk associated with forest investments.
However, such guarantees are also employed in other green and climate finance models, with the risk of
triggering competition with other sectors and other development priorities.

From an investor’s perspective, unenhanced bonds will not provide a solution, as they are simply a
vehicle for capital in search of stable and secure returns, while offering no advantages to issuing
governments in terms of the financing cost. Hence, attention must be paid to the role that the
government and international donors can play in improving the risk–return profile of the bond structures.
For bonds to increase the flows of finance to forest restoration and protection, they must be at least as
attractive to investors as Green Bonds of other, competing sectors. Given their fiduciary responsibility,
the majority of institutional bond investors will require some form of enhancement for investments with
sub-commercial returns, taking into account the risks associated with a developing country setting. This
means that the financing structure must incorporate public grant funding and cater sufficiently to risks.

A true breakthrough in bond-based forest finance, will depend on the identification and successful
design of concrete and bankable solutions that integrate international support into bond structures to
achieve both scale and efficiency. The ultimate aim of such bond structures would be to provide
governments and the private sector with access to lower-cost capital than they currently obtain from
capital markets. This in turn will enable the expansion of credit for forest investments that deliver against
NDC targets, while leveraging available international support such as through REDD+, climate finance or
development assistance – achieving more investment and greater GHG reductions per dollar granted. An
analysis of how this might be achieved is the focus of a complementary report on this topic.
