                                            Overview
Growth in China continued to slow in 2014, reflecting policy steps to put economic growth on a more
sustainable footing. Policy efforts to tighten credit growth, reduce excess capacity, internalize the cost
of industrial pollution, and harden budget constraints of local governments accelerated in 2014. While
reducing short-term growth, these measures will generate a much needed realignment of growth in the
medium term.
Targeted support measures and the recovery of external demand have limited the growth slowdown,
but pressures from the weak housing market remain a significant drag on domestic economic activity.
The real estate sector, an important engine of growth of recent years, continues to adjust to policies to
tighten credit and reduce supply mismatches. At the same time the government has sufficient policy
buffers to contain a disorderly adjustment in the housing market. Additional steps to loosen credit
constraints for homebuyers could be introduced if needed.
Largely due to weaker-than-expected domestic economic activity this year, the growth forecast for 2014
has been revised downward to 7.4 percent, still meeting the government’s indicative growth target of
about 7.5 percent. For 2015–16 average growth is expected to ease to slightly above 7 percent as policy
efforts to place the economy on a more sustainable growth path are likely to intensify. But engineering
this gradual slowdown is a key challenge. Especially important will be policies that facilitate the
movement of resources from sectors with excess capacity, notably measures to gradually remove state
guarantees and allow inefficient firms, including state-owned enterprises, to fail. This will require a
careful balancing between enhancing market discipline and avoiding disruptions to the labor market.
Over time, the role of administrative credit allocation needs to be gradually replaced with a market-
based mechanism.
The government’s indicative growth number for 2015 will signal the priority that the authorities put on
growth and reforms. The current emphasis on meeting short-term growth targets will make it more
challenging to implement the policies necessary to shift growth to a more sustainable medium-term
path. Specifically, a focus on meeting an ambitious growth target would require more expansionary
macroeconomic policies. In an uncertain global economic environment, China’s sizable policy buffers
could be reserved to maintain overall macroeconomic stability in case of unexpected domestic or
external economic shocks.
China’s key medium-term policy challenge remains implementing reforms that support China’s next
transformation toward more efficient, equitable, and sustainable growth. Progress has been made in
2014. A comprehensive reform plan was introduced to put China’s public finances on a more stable
footing. Revisions in the budget law provide far greater transparency and accountability for local
government debt management. Reform plans were announced to make gradual adjustments to the
hukou system to integrate migrants into urban life. Land reforms are likely to have the largest growth
impact, but they are also the most complex.
Implementing reforms can accelerate China’s economic growth potential, but it will not reverse a
moderation of growth over the next decade. Without policy action, the slowdown in China’s potential
growth in the medium term could be more severe.

                                    Recent Economic Developments
Growth continued to slow reflecting renewed policy efforts to rebalance the economy
Growth in China continued to slow in 2014 reflecting policy steps to make economic growth more
sustainable. Policy efforts to tighten credit growth, reduce excess capacity, internalize the cost of
industrial pollution, and harden budget constraints of local governments intensified in 2014. While
reducing short-term growth, these steps will generate a much needed realignment of growth in the
medium term. Targeted support measures and the recovery of external demand have helped stabilize
growth along this transition, but pressures from the weak housing market remain a significant drag on
growth.
Targeted stimulus measures have limited the growth slowdown and allowed structural adjustments
to continue. In the first three quarters economic activity expanded 7.4 percent, within the
government’s indicative growth target of about 7.5 percent for the year. Policy measures and favorable
external conditions enabled growth to stabilize in the second quarter, but momentum has again started
slipping: growth in the third quarter decelerated to 7.3 percent (year on year) or 1.9 percent (quarter on
quarter) from 7.5 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively, in the second quarter. Weaknesses in the real
estate market kept gross capital formation softening, which contributed only 2.1 percentage points in
the third quarter against 4.1 percentage points in the second (figure 1.1). Net exports rose in line with
external demand, but private consumption growth remained weak across a broad range of consumer
goods, including durables. Industrial activity slowed, particularly in heavy industry, mining, and power
generation, reflecting both measures to reduce overinvestment and energy intensity and the impact of
the real estate slowdown.

The real estate sector, an important engine of growth of recent years, is undergoing adjustments as
policies to tighten credit and reduce supply mismatches continue. Weakness in the property market is
broad based—residential, commercial, and office sectors have experienced sharp declines in sales
volumes. Residential real estate, the largest and most important part, is particularly weak—79 out of all

100 surveyed cities reported month-on-month price declines in September, with the largest declines in
third-tier cities, which generally have the weakest residential housing conditions (figure 1.2). While the
adjustment in prices in the first-tier cities1 appears the largest, on average prices there remain high at
about RMB 28,000 per square meter versus only about RMB 10,000 in second-tier2 and RMB 7,000 in
third-tier cities. There are early signs that the inventory-to-sales ratio is stabilizing in recent month, but
excess inventory remains high.

On the supply side, weak domestic demand and policy tightening in sectors with high energy intensity
continue to weigh on industrial activity. Industrial production growth maintained its moderation to 8.0
percent (year on year) in the third quarter from 8.9 percent the previous quarter. Export-oriented
manufacturing, particularly light manufacturing, remained robust, but growth in value added in mining
and in production of energy, electricity, and heat kept decelerating in the third quarter, to 4.8 percent
and 1.4 percent (year on year) (figure 1.3). In manufacturing, where value added rose by 9.0 percent in
the third quarter, production of rail transport equipment registered the highest gain—14.1 percent
(year on year).

Services remained upbeat as the structure of economic growth continued to evolve from an industrial
to a service base. In the first three quarters of 2014 almost half of GDP growth has come from the
services sector. Its contribution to growth was 3.6 percentage points of GDP, that of industry 3.3 (of
which manufacturing 2.7). Value added growth in transport sector has continued to increase in the first
three quarters increasing by 7.0 percent (year on year).
Activity in construction remains robust as new investments in social housing and infrastructure have
offset the impact of ongoing adjustments in real estate. Policy steps introduced earlier this year to
accelerate shanty town redevelopment and social housing program (including targeted funding from the
policy banks) has boosted construction activity. In the first three quarters of this year, value-added
growth in construction sector decelerated only modestly to 9.0 percent from 9.2 in the first half of the
year; that of real estate decelerated from 2.5 to 2.3. In addition, fairly robust infrastructure construction
has provided an additional buffer for the construction industry.
On the demand side, domestic rebalancing from reliance on investment continues. The contribution of
gross capital formation to GDP growth decelerated to about 2.1 percentage points in the third quarter,
approximately half of that in the previous quarter. China’s headline measure of investment, fixed asset
investment (FAI)—a broad measure that also includes land sales and purchases of used capital—grew
13.4 percent in the third quarter, down from 17.2 percent in the previous quarter. Investment in
manufacturing facilities, which accounted for a third of FAI in the last three years, continues to
decelerate gradually in recent quarters (figure 1.4), slowed by overcapacity in the steel, cement, ferrous
metals, and plate glass industries. Real estate investment, which accounted for a quarter of FAI in the
previous three years3, grew at its slowest pace since 2009, dragged down by declines in housing prices.
Infrastructure investment growth also decelerated to 17.7 percent (year on year) from 24.0 percent the
previous quarter (see figure 1.4).

 An input-output table for 2010 suggests that the construction industry accounts for about half of all gross capital formation,
equivalent to 24 percent of GDP.

Consumption growth remained weak as adjustments in real estate have undermined consumer
confidence. The Westpac-MNI China Consumer Sentiment Index has fallen by 7 percent this year as
households become increasingly concerned about future expectations for the economic growth. The
contribution of consumption to GDP growth in the second quarter was the lowest in five years (at 2.4
percentage points, or about a third of total growth), and in the third quarter it remained weak at 2.9
percentage points of GDP. Year-on-year real retail sales growth continued to decelerate from 10.8
percent in the first quarter to 10.6 percent in the third quarter. The weakness affected a broad range of
consumer goods, including food, garments, footwear, household electric appliances, and durable goods.

The credit impulse continues to fade as administrative regulations rein in credit
growth
Monetary policy stays accommodative, but the credit impulse is fading. Broad money (M2) growth is
decelerating as credit growth moderates, despite targeted measures to ease liquidity conditions for
small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), affordable housing and agriculture (figure 1.5). M2 growth
decelerated to 11.6 percent (year on year) in the third quarter, after a temporary hike to 14.7 percent in
the second quarter. The growth of aggregate financing (stock)—a broad measure of credit—decelerated
from 19.4 percent (year on year) in the third quarter of 2013 to 14.6 percent in the same period this
year, driven by moderating growth of credit products linked to China’s shadow banking sector, notably
trust loans. The authorities have continued to limit off-balance credit. In the third quarter, nonbank
credit growth decelerated to 19.9 percent (year on year) from a staggering 37.8 percent in the same
quarter of 2013. Nevertheless, the credit stock as a share of GDP continues to increase, but a weakening
of the credit impulse remains a drag on investment growth, which continues to decelerate (see figure
1.5).

Despite policy efforts to redirect credit, some sectors are still credit constrained. Although the central
bank is urging banks to adjust their lending practices and to give more support to SMEs, labor-intensive
industries, and first-time mortgage applicants, and to strictly control credit to sectors that suffer from
overindebtedness and excess capacity, progress is slow. According to the most recent China Household
Finance Survey by Southwest University of Finance and Economics, among the micro and small
enterprises that demonstrated effective demands for credit, only 46.2 percent had access to bank loans
in 2013. In June the People’s Bank of China lowered required reserve requirements by 0.5 percentage
points for select commercial banks that have allocated a certain percentage of credit to rural and micro
and small enterprises. Moreover, in July the calculation method of the loan-to-deposit ratio for
commercial banks was adjusted to promote more support for the economy, specifically credit to rural
and small and micro enterprises. Lately, policy steps have also been taken to ease credit constraints for
residential mortgage applicants and select real estate developers.
Interbank rates are stable with the central bank providing sufficient liquidity, but medium- and long
term market rates are high. The central bank addressed anxieties in the interbank market by injecting
liquidity and communicating its policy intentions. In the first three quarters of 2014, the interbank rates
(seven-day Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate) averaged about 3.6 percent. However, long-term interest
rates have continued to remain high, with yields on three-year corporate bonds (AA) averaging about
5.9 percent in the third quarter (figure 1.6). Moreover, a yield curve of corporate bonds has become
steeper, indicating declining short-term interest rates but higher longer term rates in the third quarter
of 2014 relative to the previous year (see figure 1.6).

Despite continuing increases in the monetary base, inflationary pressures remained quiescent,
reflecting weak domestic demand conditions. In the first nine months of the year, inflation as
measured by the consumer price index decelerated to 2.1 percent from 2.5 percent in the same period
of 2013. In September inflation slowed to 1.6 percent, the lowest since January 2010. Similarly, food
price inflation in the first nine months declined to 3.3 percent from 4.4 percent in the same period last
year. However, nonfood inflation averaged at 1.6 percent (year on year) in the same period in both 2013
and 2014. Producer price index deflation was 1.8 percent (year on year) in September, slightly weaker
than the average of 1.6 percent for the first nine months of 2014. This index has been negative for 31
consecutive months, suggesting that the industrial sector continues to face deflationary pressures due
to weak demand and excess supply. Most of these pressures stem from heavy industry, which continues
to experience the strongest deflationary pressures.

Fiscal policy remains accommodative but the stance tightens as revenue growth
moderates
China’s overall fiscal position is strong, but a slowdown in real estate translated into slower revenue
growth, particularly in the third quarter. In the first three quarters of 2014, total public finance budget
revenues increased 8.1 percent (year on year) while in the third quarter the revenue growth weakened
to 6.5 percent, against an annual increase of 7.9 percent planned in the budget law. As equivalent
expenditures increased 13.2 percent (versus 8.2 percent in the budget law), the annual fiscal deficit
stood at 2.4 percent of GDP at the third quarter of 2014, up from 2.1 percent in 2013.
The widening of the public finance budget deficit reflected moderating revenues and robust
expenditure growth. Collection of indirect consumption taxes—value-added tax (VAT) and consumption
tax—weakened and direct income tax revenues—corporate and personal income taxes—decelerated in
the third quarter after a modest pickup in the second. Recently introduced policy initiatives to reduce
the tax burden on SMEs have also lowered fiscal revenues. After three straight quarters of expenditure
increases (especially on economic affairs), growth moderated in the third quarter (figure 1.7).

A large share of government spending supports capital expenditures in transport, housing, and other
economic activities, as gaps in providing core public services remain wide. While the size of
government expenditures (public finance budget, government fund budget, and social security budget)
remains similar to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average, the
composition of expenditures differs substantially (table 1.1). First, spending on general public services is
under half the OECD average. It is declining due to continuing efforts to reduce wasteful public outlays:
in the first half of 2014 it accounted for only 2.4 percent of GDP, down from 3.0 percent in 2013.
Second, despite gradual increases, expenditures on social services (health, education, and social
protection) are far lower than in the OECD countries. Third, outlays on economic affairs, housing, and
community amenities are about three times as high as the OECD average.

cities, third-tier cities have seen the largest declines in such revenues, with a fall of about 27 percent
(year on year) in the first three quarters of 2014. Kunming saw a staggering 72 percent drop over that
period. In first-tier cities the decline averaged a modest 5.7 percent, though Shanghai saw a drop of 36
percent. A review of the 40 largest cities suggests that a decline in land lease revenues tends to be
larger in municipalities that are financially weaker with smaller public budget revenues as a share of
GDP (figure 1.8).

Managing local government debt remains a challenge. Still, the growth of debt among nine provincial
and nine city-level governments across China is slowing: according to the National Audit Office, their
debt grew 3.8 percent from end-June 2013 to end-March 2014, or 7 percentage points lower than in the
first half of 2013. At the same time a significant amount of debt continues to be rolled over. In recent
months the risk premium of local government financing vehicle (LGFV) issued corporate bonds has
declined (figure 1.9), partly reflecting expectations that public finance reforms will make local
government debt on a more stable (see section 2 for discussion on recently approved policy steps).
In May 2014 the Ministry of Finance started a pilot program relaxing rules for 10 local governments to
issue their own municipal bonds. The program aims to lower the financing cost of debt, limit the
operations of off-budget financing vehicles, and reduce reliance on shadow banking for funding. Beijing,
for example, issued RMB 10.5 billion fixed rate municipal bonds at 4.00 percent (5 years), 4.18 percent
(7 years) and 4.24 percent (10 years) in August, much less than local government loans secured in the
past through financing vehicles. Even so, issuing municipal bonds (directly or by the Ministry of Finance
on behalf of municipalities) raised RMB 400 billion in 2014, significantly less than the estimated funding
gap of local governments.
Issuance of corporate bonds by LGFVs to fund municipal investments remains high. In the first nine
months of 2014, LGFVs issued corporate bonds totaling more than a trillion RMB. But recent growth-
supporting measures to increase infrastructure expenditures, especially in the transport sector, have
relied on more formal debt instruments, including credit support of China’s policy banks. Subsequently,
growth of FAI in infrastructure is no longer strongly correlated with an increase in net debt position of
LGFVs (figure 1.9).

Despite decelerating growth, the labor market is strong
A dynamic labor market is supporting overall growth in jobs and incomes. In the first eight months of
2014, urban employment increased by 9.7 million, on track to exceed this year’s government’s
indicative target of 10 million new urban jobs. Services are absorbing workers as the structural
transformation of the economy continues. Also, recently introduced measures to ease company
registration procedures by streamlining the administrative procedures have contributed to a more
dynamic labor market. Data from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce show that about
2.65 million new companies were registered in the first nine months of 2014, up 52.4 percent from the
same period last year. The reported unemployment rate is stable.
Some categories of worker, and some regions, are feeling pressures from decelerating growth. A large
share of migrant workers is employed in construction, particularly in central and western provinces
where the slowdown is the largest (figure 1.10). At the same time the share of migrant workers
employed in services, a sector which is growing robustly, is declining. And lacking formal social safety
nets, migrants are of the most vulnerable to change. A recent migrant survey by the National Bureau of
Statistics showed that only about 2 percent of migrant workers in construction have formal
unemployment insurance.

Moderating economic growth has slowed the growth of urban consumption. Growth of incomes and
consumption in rural areas continues to grow faster than in urban areas in recent years, reducing the
urban-rural income gap. Urban and rural real disposable income growth continued to remain robust in
the second and third quarters (figure 1.11). But urban real consumption growth continued to decelerate
in the first three quarters.

A favorable external environment has provided a buffer
In the second and third quarters the economy benefited from a favorable external environment, as
global demand showed signs of recovery. Output growth and import demand in the United States
firmed in the second and third quarters. China’s merchandise trade surplus rose to USD 128 billion in
the third quarter. Exports of goods grew 13.0 percent (year on year) in the quarter, and imports of
goods 2.8 percent. But due to weak exports in the first quarter, year-to-date growth in merchandise

exports is only 4.9 percent. And while the goods trade balance stayed positive in the second quarter, the
services balance deteriorated further to a deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP.
China’s external position improved, reflecting buoyant exports and weak imports. The current account
surplus jumped 10 times from USD 7.0 billion to USD 72.2 billion between the first and second quarters.
For the first half of 2014, the current account surplus amounted to was 0.9 percent of GDP (figure 1.12).

Imports continued to remain weak. In the first nine months, growth of merchandise imports
decelerated to 2.6 percent (year on year) from 6.8 percent in the same period of 2013 (figure 1.13). The
weak performance of imports reflected the slowdown in industrial activity, weak domestic demand and
declining commodity prices. Metal imports declined over the past few months in both value and volume
terms. Growing concern over a slowdown in the Euro Area and emerging economies, a strong US dollar,
a well-supplied oil market and good agricultural crop prospects have contributed to a weakening of
many commodity prices since the summer. The World Bank’s energy price index declined by about six
percent during the third quarter after being broadly stable in the first half of the year.

The exchange rate reversed its slide and continued to appreciate in the third quarter. The RMB is the
only major emerging market currency that has appreciated in the last few quarters; others declined in
expectation of normalizing monetary policy in the United States. A widening of the currency’s trading
band earlier this year has reversed some of the net capital flows in second quarter (figure 1.14).

                                        Economic Prospects
China’s transition to more sustainable levels of growth will continue
In China growth will gradually moderate to 7.4 percent in 2014 and 7.1 percent in 2016, reflecting
intensified policy efforts to address financial vulnerabilities and structural constraints and to make
growth more sustainable (table 2.1). In the short term, recent infrastructure and social housing
initiatives by the central government, targeted monetary support measures, and positive contribution
from net exports will partly offset some of the real estate slowdown, enabling the authorities to attain
the indicative growth target. Over time, reforms and a gradual withdrawal of stimulus will reduce
overinvestment and related imbalances. In particular, efforts to contain local government debt, within a
framework where local government spending mandates are better aligned with their revenues, will
rationalize local infrastructure investment. Similarly, measures to curb the growth in shadow-banking
credit will curb excessive risk taking, including in the industrial and property sectors, and gradually
contain credit expansion bringing it to a more sustainable level.
The global economic recovery, which is underway, remains weak and fragile, with many downside
risks present. Global growth has been revised downwards and is now expected at 2.6 percent in 2014,
only marginally up from 2.4 percent in 2013. In the United States, the recovery is proceeding broadly as
foreseen, however, in other high-income economies, particularly in the Euro Area, growth has
stagnated. Despite the setbacks observed this year, activity is expected to strengthen in 2015–16 led by
the United States, which will lift trading partner exports. Stabilizing and slowly expanding activity in
other high-income countries, should add some modest momentum. However, the projected pick-up in
global trade growth remains below historical averages. In addition, there are significant downside risks
to the global outlook. In particular, stagnation in the Euro Area could prove to be secular, accompanied
by very low inflation or deflation and trigger weaker than expected global recovery. Increased
geopolitical tensions can also negatively affect global recovery.
External financial conditions are expected to tighten; an abrupt rise in global interest rates cannot be
ruled out. The baseline scenario is associated with an orderly normalization of monetary policy in the
United States, and gradual tightening of global financial conditions. However, the tightening of global
financial conditions could be sharp, causing financial market volatility. Overall, the normalization
process will be complex, because monetary policy in high-income economies has remained
extraordinarily expansionary over an unusually extended period. The unwinding of large central bank
interventions, in an environment of uncertainty about future policy, could be accompanied by abrupt
market reactions, increased volatility, and an overshooting of interest rates. Abrupt changes in market
expectations could also lead to a sharper than expected reduction in capital inflows, increasing volatility
in China’s capital account. While China’s reliance on external financing is low, rising interest rates could
increase debt service costs for some corporates. China’s external debt represents less than 6 percent of
total debt; however, in dollar terms, it is significant–about USD 1 trillion in mid-2014.

Progress in rebalancing the sources of growth in domestic demand in 2015 will remain gradual.
Aggregate consumption is expected to contribute 4.2 percentage points of GDP. Investment growth will
continue to decelerate due to credit tightening and ongoing adjustments in the property sector. Excess
inventory is likely to further slow investment in the real estate sector in the next few quarters.
Accelerated rail and social housing development will partly offset a decline in manufacturing and real
estate investment. Gross capital formation is expected to contribute 2.8 percentage points of GDP. Net
exports are set to increase gradually and contribute 0.2 percentage points of GDP. Inflation will stay
contained, expected to be 3.0 percent in 2015. The labor market is set to remain robust; the key
challenge is to maintain healthy wage growth, especially in the nontradable sector.
On the supply side, sectors with excess capacity will continue to experience headwinds as credit
conditions tighten further and environmental costs of pollution become internalized. Economic
growth will continue to evolve from an industrial to a services base. Manufacturing will be increasingly
affected by measures targeting sectors with excess capacity, high energy demand, and high pollution.
The implementation of China’s revised Environmental Protection Law will formally being in 2015. The
revisions include provisions increasing penalties for violating Environmental regulations, expanding the
scope of projects subjected to environmental impact assessment requirements and streamlining the
process of bring public interest lawsuits related to environmental degradation.

There are downside and upside risks to the 2015 projection. First, a failure to strengthen the
vulnerabilities in the financial sector could leave the economy increasingly saddled with inefficient firms,
bad loans and weaker financial institutions. This could reduce economic activity by undermining
productivity growth and increasing capital misallocation. Second, the housing sector might not bottom
out, instead continuing to decelerate, further undermining consumer confidence and economic activity.
On the upside, there is a possibility that external recovery might be more rapid than previously
expected, boosting China’s export growth.

Key short-term policy challenge: strengthening market discipline in the financial
sector while avoiding disruptions to the labor market
The key policy challenge is strengthening market discipline in the financial sector. This will require
implementing policies that facilitate reallocating resources from the sectors that have excess capacity to
those with high growth potential. Examples of such policy steps include gradually removing state
guarantees and allowing inefficient firms, including in particular state-owned enterprises to fail. In some
cases this will require a careful balancing between enhancing market discipline and avoiding disruptions
to the labor market. In the long run, the role of ad hoc administrative measures will be gradually
replaced by a market-based mechanism where interest rates clear the credit market and allocate
capital.
The government’s indicative growth number for 2015 will signal the priority that the authorities put
on growth and reforms. The current emphasis on meeting growth targets could narrow policy options
to implement reforms. In particular, a prevalent concern is that a policy focused on meeting an
ambitious growth target, similar to one for set for 2014, would require macroeconomic policies to
remain oriented to support domestic demand rather than on reforms required for more sustainable
development. While the government still has enough room for accommodative policies, such a move
would perpetuate China’s traditional growth model that relies on government-led investment fueled by
credit expansion. In an increasingly uncertain economic environment China’s sizable policy buffers could
be reserved to maintain overall macroeconomic stability in case of unexpected domestic or external
economic shock.
While strengthening market discipline in the financial sector, the authorities appear to have the
necessary buffers to prevent a disorderly debt unwinding. At 55.5 percent of GDP, total public debt is
moderate. This provides enough fiscal space to employ additional stimulus if growth slows sharply.
Institutional buffers, too, are strong. Public debt is mainly held domestically by a small group of
institutions and the financial system is still largely state owned. Financial repression restricts savings
instruments outside the banking system (especially once real estate investment loses attractiveness),
and capital controls on portfolio investment and bank lending prevent sharp capital outflows. Finally,
China has sizable reserve buffers.
But a failure to strengthen the vulnerabilities in the financial sector could increase the risk of reduced
economic activity arising from increased capital misallocation and weakened financial system. A
practice of extending credit lines to roll-over maturing credit to inefficient firms or sectors not only
weakens financial institutions but also undermines productivity. Even with sufficient policy buffers in
such a scenario it would be difficult to avoid a long period of slow growth.
Housing will continue its structural adjustment. In recent months housing starts have picked up, but
housing construction activity remains weak. Excess inventory will depress housing prices over the next
few quarters. The policy response is constrained because some of the adjustment is structural rather
than temporary. Over recent years market distortions have contributed to supply mismatches and a

rapid increase in housing prices (box 2.1). A more stable housing market will require that these market
distortions be resolved.
Box 2.1 How market distortions contributed in three ways to China’s housing problems
First, distortions in land policies contributed to excessive increases in land prices. Because all local
governments are the owners of urban land in their jurisdiction, they have strong incentives to supply
cheap land for industrial use to generate economic growth. But because many local governments follow
the same approach, cheap industrial land is not a comparative advantage. Instead, not only has excess
industrial land fueled inefficient growth of urban boundaries and industrial developments zones, but it
also has contributed to record prices for residential and commercial land, which remains tightly
controlled.
Second, an interest rate cap on saving deposits has made housing an alternate means to store wealth.
This has misallocated capital and excessively increased residential housing prices, particularly in first-tier
cities, such that real estate prices have risen much faster than incomes, undermining housing
affordability and feeding into many local housing bubbles (box figure 1).
Box figure 1 Affordability of housing declined in cities where household incomes were higher, and recent
adjustments in real estate prices did not affect cities where housing is least affordable

Third, local government incentives to boost economic development, in addition to more traditional
responsibilities of managing municipal services, have contributed to misallocated housing supply.
Housing demand is highly correlated with increased employment. But in places with weak employment
growth, local government incentives to boost growth have led to excessive reliance on land conversion
to finance investment-led growth and to provide incentives to real estate developers, with much more
housing built where population growth was not very strong. Indeed, the last five years have seen a
negative relationship between growth in fixed asset real estate investments and population growth (box
figure 2).

The government has taken steps to help contain a disorderly adjustment in the housing market. A
social housing initiative will offer a supply response for much needed social housing units. Credit
constraints for homebuyers have also been loosened. In late September the authorities cut mortgage
rates and down-payment levels for some home buyers for the first time since the 2008 global financial
crisis. Accompanying the relaxation of lending rules were additional steps to increase financing for real
estate developers.

Key medium-term policy challenge: implementing reforms to cement China’s next
transformation toward more efficient, equitable, and sustainable growth
China’s growth slowdown is not temporary, but structural; therefore, structural reforms are needed
to maintain reasonably high rates of growth. First, the productivity gains from the structural
transformation of the labor market, the demographic dividend, and capital accumulation are set to
decline gradually, consistent with the moderation in growth in other rapidly developing economies.
Second, the global environment has changed, and exports can no longer drive economic growth:
domestic demand has to become the driver of growth. Third, China’s rapid economic growth ,
unprecedented in its scale, has done severe damage to environmental, with both domestic and global
implications.
So, China’s next economic transformation toward more efficient, equitable, and sustainable growth
will depend on how successful structural reforms in land, labor, and capital markets are. The plenum
in November 2013 set ambitious goals to change the role of the government by giving market forces a
decisive role in allocating factors of production, particularly land and capital, and getting out of
providing goods that the private market is better at providing. Subsequently, the Ministry of Land and
Resources has published the Regulation on Economical and Intensive Utilization of Land, addressing the
issue of excessive land conversion. A pilot program to attract private investment for and improve the
corporate governance six large state-owned enterprises was announced in August, paving the way for
other state enterprises to establish “mixed ownership” entities in future. In 2014 reform plans were
outlined to make adjustments to the hukou system to integrate migrants into urban life and to overhaul
the public finance system by addressing distorted incentives of local governments.

Economic Update—October 2014

Steps have been taken to put China’ public finances on a more stable footing. On June 30, 2014,
China’s leaders endorsed broad reforms to the nation’s fiscal and tax system (see section 3). The reform
focuses on three areas: strengthening budget management processes, advancing tax reforms, and
improving intergovernmental relations. The objective of tax reform is to optimize the tax structure by
changing the excise tax system to promote energy savings and emission reductions, continue to replace
the business tax with the VAT, and broaden the tax base of local governments by advancing legislation
on the real estate tax. The authorities have also set out a near-term 2016 deadline for completing
substantial reforms to help complete the longer term reform agenda by 2020.
Revisions to China’s budget law, effective January 2015, are ambitious step in a comprehensive fiscal
policy reform. The revisions provide a framework for far greater transparency and accountability for
local government debt management. The amendments to the budget law will help the local government
reduce the transaction costs and financing costs of debt by issuing bonds rather than establishing off-
budget financing vehicles to finance infrastructure projects.
In early October the State Council announced a set of new rules regulating local government debt to
comply with the amended budget law. Specifically, the central government made it clear that it will not
bail out the local governments in financial distress, effectively banning local government borrowing
through LGFVs. The no-bailout rule will be strengthened by the establishment of assessment
accountability mechanisms where the government debt will be taken as one of the hard measures in
evaluating the government performance and local government officials will be held responsible and
penalized for over-borrowing, illegal borrowing, illegal usage of debt financing, malicious evasion of
debts. As a transitional arrangement, local governments need to identify whether the existing LGFV
debt belongs to government debt or the corporate debt of state enterprises, and include the former
part in their budget.
Fully implementing the amendments will take time, however. At the start of this transition, market-
based instruments, such as municipal bonds, alone will be able to absorb a fraction of existing
outstanding local government debt. More comprehensive steps, including transitional arrangements,
will be needed to address the outstanding stock of local government debt (including guarantees and
contingent liabilities), estimated at about RMB 17.9 trillion or (31.5 percent of GDP in 2014). While a
recent audit by the National Audit Office sheds some light on the composition of local government debt
(box 2.2), the lack of timely and comprehensive data on such debt clouds the transparency of local debt
management. A large part of debt cannot, it seems, be immediately converted toward market-based
instruments (such as municipal bonds) due to weak underlying quality of assets backing these
instruments.
Box 2.2 Structure of local government debt
There are 154,000 borrowers in government organizations and state-owned enterprises using more than 30
financing tools, according to a recently released provincial-level local government audit conducted by the National
Audit Office. It reveals two main patterns.
First, traditional bank or trust loans are associated with financially stable localities (box figure 1). This is expected,
as financially stronger municipalities are viewed as more creditworthy by market participants. At the same time
financially weaker municipalities are more likely to register debt directly with local government, as market
participants are likely to discount the implicit guarantee issued to a special financing vehicle created by these
weaker municipalities.

Second, the use of debt differs widely among municipalities. Poorer municipalities use debt to finance economic
activity directly, such as capital investments, while richer municipalities use debt as leverage to finance
investments for land conversion (such as compensation to farmers and infrastructure for rezoning). Both of these
practices affect residential housing markets: the former leads to excess supply in areas with weak economic
activity, the latter makes local governments vulnerable to downward adjustments in land prices (box figure 2).

Closely related financial sector reforms are progressing more gradually. Authorities have announced
policy commitments to fully liberalize interest rates by 2016. Some steps have already been taken. In
March 2014 the ceiling on deposit rates for small deposits in foreign currencies was removed in the pilot
Shanghai Free Trade Area. Qualified private investors are allowed to set up financial institutions such as
small or medium-size banks, conditioned on greater supervision. The pilot work has been launched, and
the first group of five pilot banks was publicly announced in March 2014. A deposit insurance system is
being developed. Delays in implementing financial sector reforms could perpetuate capital misallocation
and undermine the health of the banking system.
The urban-rural hukou system will be unified gradually. In July 2014 China’s State Council released
details on proposed reforms of China’s hukou system of household registration. The government aims
for a total of 100 million new urban hukous to be issued by 2020, a modest number, given about 250
million migrants currently dwelling in cities. In addition, initially the government will fully relax residency

restrictions for smaller cities and towns (with populations under 500,000), but not initially the larger
cities. Requirement for hukou registration will be regulated in large cities with populations of 1 million–
5 million. In these cities the relaxation of hukou registration will be set taking into account the capacity
of the cities to provide adequate public services for new residents. Migrants to large megacities—with
populations of more than 5 million—will have to qualify under a points system that considers individual
factors, including job profile. Hukou reform has encountered significant resistance from local
government leaders who are mostly unwilling to take on the additional public service burdens. And for
smaller cities to benefit from removing the residency restrictions will require narrowing the gap of
public service provision with the larger cities (box 2.3).
Box 2.3. Attracting new residents to China’s small cities will require narrowing the social
infrastructure gap
Despite tight control over population flows through the hukou system, China’s megacities in the coastal region have
attracted the most migrants and experienced disproportionately rapid population growth since 2000 (box figure 1).
Using the methodology of Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (2013), it is estimated that differences in productivity accounts
for more than half of the city-size distribution and internal migration. City-specific amenities that directly improve
welfare also play an important role, accounting for around a third of the actual size distribution.

Differences in social infrastructures such as education and health care are also driving internal migration. Schools and
hospitals contribute to human capital development, which leads to better income prospects. Cities that provide great
access to these public amenities tend to attract more migrants. Staggering differences in education investment and
health care coverage contribute to the agglomeration pattern of migration (box figure 2). Specifically, Shanghai and
Beijing spend 150–200 percent more on education per capita than most cities in China. For health care the
discrepancy of doctors per capita between leading and lagging regions widened between 2005 and 2011. Increasing
the public budget for education and health care and, more importantly, improving the cost effectiveness of these
social infrastructure investments should be on the forefront of local governments’ policy agenda.

Given the persistent gap in productivity and social infrastructure across regions, removing hukou restrictions under
the status quo is likely to reinforce the current agglomeration patterns of urbanization and increase regional
economic inequality. Lower-tier cities need to provide attractive income opportunities (adjusted for living cost)
and growth potential to induce a net migrant inflow. Policies to facilitate technology diffusion and to address
social infrastructure discrepancy will boost the economic dynamism in small and medium-size cities. These policies
should be adopted to complement hukou reform to generate balanced regional economic growth.

Land reforms are likely to have the largest growth impact. Land is of central importance to China’s
economic growth and social stability, but local implementation of land policies has led to unintended
consequences widely viewed as unsustainable (Urban China (World Bank and DRC, 2014)). Rigid land
policies have effectively tied half the population to rural areas that produce only 10 percent of GDP.
Rural land is held in small parcels, making it difficult to assemble economically sized farms, increase
agricultural productivity, and raise rural incomes.4 The 2008 global economic crisis and the subsequent
accommodative fiscal policy stance have had a dramatic effect China’s land-based economic growth
model through accelerated land taking and conversion, bringing the inefficiencies of current land tenure
arrangements and the need for reform into even clearer focus.
Reforms to land, public finance, and the hukou system require a carefully coordinated approach.
Reforms need to recalibrate the use of land, improve land governance, and reduce the government’s
dependence on revenue from land conversions and land leases. They could facilitate the transition from
land asset sales to a modern tax system aligned better with China’s new economic structure. They could
also deepen land markets, clarify rural citizens in their property rights and land assets at home, and
boost their opportunities and entitlements for integrating into cities. Thus to increase the efficiency of
land use, it is necessary to ensure the security of agricultural land tenure, including introducing the
transferability of land rights and reforming land acquisition and compensation practices. This action
includes rolling out the recent policy decision to grant indefinite land use rights to farmers, to expand
land registration, and to strengthen rural land markets.

  Despite massive off-farm migration, rural population growth has meant that cultivated land per agricultural laborer has
remained fairly constant, increasing only from 0.35 hectares in 1978 to 0.41 in 2008. Average Chinese farm holdings are well
under 1 hectare, far lower than the global average; the average farm in the United States is 300 times bigger than in China.

Economic Update—October 2014

Implementing such a coordinated reform plan can accelerate China’s economic growth potential, but
it will not reverse a moderation of growth over the next decade. Recent calculations made for the
Urban China study (World Bank and DRC, 2014) indicate that these “second generation” reforms are
likely to have a smaller impact on growth than the “first generation” reforms implemented over the last
few decades. Such a reform scenario could increase China’s potential growth about 0.8 percentage
point in the first year and a cumulative 3.5 percentage points over five years. Without policy action, the
slowdown in China’s potential growth in the medium term could be more severe. In such a scenario
economic activity could start to stagnate as resource misallocation, particularly in the financial sector,
would continue to reduce productivity of firms, strength of financial institutions and confidence of
consumers.

Background
The revenue and expenditure growth in China over the past 20 years has been admirable and has
contributed to important accomplishments. Over 500 million people have been lifted out of poverty, the
urban infrastructure has developed quickly, and social services have improved significantly. But the
rapidly growing economy that has made all of this possible has also hidden some important deficiencies
in the system of public financing. China has outgrown its public finance system. The regime of taxes,
public expenditures and central-local fiscal relations is no longer compatible with the government’s
expanded responsibilities to its citizens and—more important—cannot efficiently support the new
economic order that the government seeks to create.
China is now facing two major transitions—continuing urbanization and slower GDP growth—as well as
the need to address a backlog of important public servicing needs. Each of these will require changes to
the public finance system. Managing the government sector during these transitions, especially the
finances of subnational governments, presents major public policy challenges. The government will
need to decide how much it will let fiscal policy be driven by incremental fixes, or whether it heads off
the problems with major structural reforms. The recently announced new directions for fiscal reform
suggest that the latter path has been chosen.

New Reforms
On June 30th of 2014 China’s top leaders endorsed a program of reform to the nation’s tax system,
budgeting practices and center-local fiscal relations. While the detail of the fiscal reform plan is not yet
proposed, the broad proposals are impressive and ambitious. The objectives for fiscal and tax reforms
in the Third Plenum decisions are:
“Public finance is the foundation and a critical pillar for state governance. A scientifically designed fiscal
and tax regime is the institution that guarantees resource allocation optimization, market unification,
social equality, and long-lasting security and peace for a nation.”
China has set a timetable to build such a modern fiscal system. The Minister of Finance has said that the
major reform tasks concerning the fiscal and tax system will be completed by 2016, and a modern fiscal
system will be fully developed by 2020. This will not be minor amendments to current policies; but
rather will involve systemic restructuring and institutional innovation. He said the years 2014 and 2015
will be vital in pushing forward the reforms.
The Minister of Finance Lou Jiwei explained the blueprint in drawing a comparison between the 1994
reforms and the new plan. He pointed out that the former straightened out the revenue relationship
between the state and enterprises, and between central and local governments, while the current

reforms will redefine the roles and functions of central and local governments, enhance overall state
governance, and improve bureaucratic efficiency. In other words, the current fiscal and tax reforms are
as much about political economy as they are about economics. Minister Lou explained that reforms will
be achieved by fulfilling three objectives: Improving the budget management system; improving the tax
system; and building a system that matches an appropriate allocation of governmental functions and
spending responsibilities.
Improving the budget management system
China's top legislature on August 31th of 2014 adopted a revision to the Budget Law which clears
ambiguity and closes loopholes in managing the trillions of yuan involved in fiscal revenue and spending.
This is the first time the Budget Law has been revised since it took effect in 1995. As the law is closely
interrelated with China's ongoing fiscal reform, it took an unusually long time to revise it—seven years
to draft a bill for the first reading in 2011 and four readings to get it passed. Members of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) adopted the bill through a vote at the bi-monthly
legislative session, saying that the revision has responded to needed improvements in the budgeting
system.
The old Budget Law was adopted when China was more strongly influenced by planned economy
concepts and was at an early stage of applying budget management techniques. It had only a very
general definition of what the government budget covered, leaving a great deal of room for
interpretation by governments. The revised law, on the other hand, defines the government budget as
being made up of four parts: public finance budget, government fund budget, SOE operation budget and
Social Security budget.
The State Council’s decision on deepening the reform of budget management system on September 26
of 2014 (State Council, 2014/45) listed the main tasks of the reform.
(1) Improve the government budget system by requiring that all government revenues and
    expenditures are included, and by making the budget more transparent. The transparency of the
    government budget will be improved by making public all revenues and expenditures (by both the
    central and local governments). In fact, the revised law asks government financial departments to
    publish their budgets and final account reports within 20 days after they are adopted by the
    legislature. The disclosure and transparency of the budget will allow the public to be more aware of
    government policies and spending.
(2) Build a system based on a medium term fiscal plans. The government will shift from the current
    “balanced budget” to an expenditure and policy-oriented budget. Another change will be the
    building of a budget balancing system which will extend beyond one year so that budget deficits can
    be made up over the following years (or surpluses carried forward). In particular, the fiscal
    department at all levels of government will work together with line agencies to establish the mid-
    term fiscal plan which covers 3 years.
(3) Eliminate preferential tax policies. In the past, such policies have had a negative impact on state tax
    collections as well as on fair competition in the market. Regional tax incentives that are proven to
    have positive effects will be applied nationwide. In the future, all preferential tax policies will be
    enacted through a unified system based on specialized tax laws and regulations. China will also
    improve the management of tax collections. This means that the amount of tax revenue collected
    by local governments will be based on tax laws and best administrative practice, rather than on the
    current system of fiscal target setting.

(4) Strengthen the management of carry-over funds and arrears. The new budget control system will
    improve the fiscal expenditure structure and sever the connection between regional GDP and the
    expenditures of local governments. The previous connection (mainly based on derivation revenue
    sharing and expenditure mandates) has contributed to rigid and inefficient government behavior.
    The government plans to regulate and reduce the number of mandates. Such mechanically
    budgeted items now account for nearly half of total fiscal expenditures and have reduced the fiscal
    resources that could otherwise be spent in more needed areas. Further, China will improve the
    intergovernmental transfer system by enhancing the clarity of the process and by cleaning up the
    messy “special transfer payment” program. Particularly, the share of general (unconditional)
    transfers will be targeted to rise to over 60 percent of total transfers. Meanwhile, China will build
    and implement a clean-up mechanism for carry-over funds and arrears. Another goal is to improve
    the management of government purchasing.
(5) Strengthen budget execution. Measures to improve the performance of fiscal expenditures include
    hardening the budget constraint, normalizing the treasury system, improving the budget
    performance management mechanism, and building an accrual-based and comprehensive
    government fiscal reporting system.
(6) Formalize the subnational government debt management. China will build a formal subnational
    borrowing system. The central government will control the ceiling for borrowing and limit the
    borrowing channel to bonds of provincial governments. Meanwhile, the central government will
    establish the risk warning and solvency system for subnational debt. More importantly, China will
    establish and enforce the accountability mechanisms. The level of government debt will be taken as
    one of the hard measures in evaluating the performance and local government officials. More
    detail on strengthening the subnational debt management is provided in The State Council 2014
    Directive 43. One of the most controversial issues is local government bonds. The old version of the
    law banned local governments from issuing bonds, but in practice some local governments used
    “back door” approaches to raise funds, mostly to finance infrastructure. The use of this approach
    was mostly unsupervised. To tackle this situation, the revision limits the power to sell bonds to
    provincial-level governments, and imposes some strict conditions. It not only limits the amount of
    bonds but also regulates their issuance and their use. Under the new version, provincial
    governments are allowed to issue bonds within a quota set by the State Council, China's cabinet,
    and approved by the NPC or its standing committee. Money raised by the bonds can only be used
    for public infrastructure services, and not for government operations. The debts must be included in
    the provincial budget and supervised by provincial people's congresses. The central government will
    assess the risk implied for each issue. If the risk is too great, it has promised warnings, a fast
    response and punishment for those responsible. The revised law has helped clarify several
    important principles on how to manage local debt, and how to set rules and divide liabilities. Local
    government financing vehicles (local governments’ financing platforms, LGFVs in short) will no
    longer play their previous role of financing infrastructure for subnational governments. Previous
    projects financed through LGFVs should be restructured with three different reform channels. The
    LGFVs operating in competitive markets should become market entities and the local government
    should not have any responsibility for their debts. The LGFVs with stable revenues, involved in
    public service projects, are candidates for a Public Private Partnerships approach and the
    responsibilities of government should be clarified. Those LGFVs engaged in public service projects,
    but not having a stable revenue stream, should be financed directly by subnational governments.
    Some of these proposals by Ministry of Finance are under discussion.

(7) Improve fiscal discipline. Proposed measures include strengthening the audit function, promoting
    transparency, and decreasing the discretionary power of government. The key will be that all fiscal
    activities should be governed by laws and monitored by the people. In particular, officials and
    activities that violate the fiscal disciplines should be punished.
Improving the tax system
Reforms in the tax system will put an emphasis on strengthening the role of the market in resource
allocation. The country is planning to lock in six tax categories as major reform targets: Value-added tax
(VAT), excise tax, resources tax, environmental protection tax, property tax and individual income tax.
(1) Government will continue with a scheme to replace turnover tax with VAT in more sectors including
    services, construction, real estate and finance. According to Minister Lou, it is expected that the
    turnover tax will be eliminated by 2015. China has been pushing for VAT reform by replacing the
    turnover tax since the beginning of 2012 in a bid to push forward structural tax reform and boost
    the growth potential of the service industries. The reform started with transportation and some
    modern service sectors, and expanded to railway transportation, postal services and the telecom
    industry.
(2) The next step in the reforms of the excise tax system will be initiated by adjusting its scope, tax rate,
    tax-collection, and the revenue sharing scheme. The reforms will make the excise tax more
    functional with respect to adjusting the tax treatment of high energy-consumption, high pollution
    products and certain luxury goods.
(3) China is speeding up its resource tax reforms in the coal sector and plans to levy a resources tax on
    coal based on sales value instead of production volume. It also proposes to scrap arbitrary levies on
    coal miners starting from December 1 of 2014. The tax rates will be decided by provincial
    governments within a range of 2 and 10 percent with central authorities’ approval. The central
    government also ordered local governments to cancel a series of administrative charges on coal
    miners. Currently, coal firms need to pay both taxes and various charges. The reform aims to cut
    charges and reduce the overall burden for coal enterprises. Resource tax will expand to the
    ecological system, including rivers, forests, grasslands, sea coasts and lake shores.
(4) The current administrative charge on pollution will be upgraded to an environmental protection tax,
    in order to boost environmental and ecological protection through taxation.
(5) China will accelerate legislation of a property tax. Currently, the property tax is being piloted in the
    cities of Shanghai and Chongqing.
(6) China will reform the individual income tax, with an emphasis on addressing income distribution
    issues.
Building a system that matches an appropriate allocation of governmental functions and spending
responsibilities
The rationale behind this principle is to explicitly carve out the allocation of functions between the
central and subnational governments. This will improve clarity in the system and move the responsibility
of functions to governments with the best comparative advantages in delivering the function.
Expenditure responsibility for defense, foreign affairs, national security, and market rules and
management should be the function of the central government. Part of social security, and the
construction and maintenance of projects with cross-regional benefits should be the shared functions of
the central and subnational governments. The provision of regional public services should be a local
government responsibility. Any financing shortfalls for delivering assigned responsibilities can be

covered by intergovernmental transfers. Meanwhile, in general, the current revenue assignment
structure should remain stable and should improve the revenue assignment between the central and
local government.

Conclusions
China is to be applauded for moving in the direction of fiscal reform, and by elevating the reform
discussion to such a high level. Clearly, one goal is to formalize and legalize fiscal practices. The
approach is pro-active and ambitious, and the objective seems to be moving toward a comprehensive
reform to respond to changes in the economy. The general direction of the reform includes the major
elements of the fiscal system. Though the detail of the package is not yet completed, the stated
intentions seem to hold great promise for addressing the major problems that lie ahead.
