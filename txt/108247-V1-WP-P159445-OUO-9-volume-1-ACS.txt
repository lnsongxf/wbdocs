Introduction
While hydrologic modelling of the Ganges Basin has been undertaken using the SWAT model as part
of the World Bank lead Ganges Strategic Basin Assessment (SBA) and subsequent work on the Gangs
River Basin Management Plan undertaken by the consortium of IITs for the Ministry of Environment,
Forest and Climate Change, there remain a considerable gap in making this spatial and temporal
information available at a spatial and temporal scale conducive to general as well as specific
consumption at various levels

Objective
Therefore, the main objective of this project is to construct and visualize water balance for the
Ganga basin at different temporal and spatial scales.

Scope of Work
The main job of the consultant therefore is to use data and outputs from the previous SWAT
modelling exercise to construct water balance for the Ganga basin at different spatial and temporal
scales to cater to the requirements of a large cross-section of stakeholders. The following broad
categorisation has been envisaged to take care of this requirement:

   1. Spatial Scale: The requirement for spatial scale and extent may vary considerably. Some
      people might be interested in knowing the water balance at the basin and sub-basin scale
      while the others might be interested in knwoing the water availability with respect to the
      administrative boundries of country, state or distict. Thus it has been decided to construct
      water balance for the following spatial units to cater to different requirements:
          a. the entire Ganges Basin upstream of Farakka
          b. the Indian portion of the basin upstream of Farakka
          c. the Nepalese portion of the basin
          d. the Chinese portion of the basin
          e. each of the Indian states of the basin
          f. each of the districts (as per 2011 census) of Indian states of the basin (analysis at
               this spatial scale is restricted to water balance components expressed in terms of
               equivalent depth of water in mm over the total district area).
   2. Temporal Scale: Because of the temporal variability it is required that character of the basin
      and its other spatial units is captured to depict such variability. Therefore it has been
      decided to construct and present water balance for the above defined spatial units and for
      the following temporal levels:
          a. an average year
          b. an average month
   3. Water Balance Components: Some of the major components of the water balance that are
      prominent for a comprehensive understanding of the various sub-areas of the basin are
      tracked. These are:
          a. Inflows to rivers of major tributaries
          b. Outflows from rivers of major tributaries
          c. Losses in river systems (Evapotranspiration, ground water recharge and conveyance
               loss),

F I N A L R E P O R T [GANGA BASIN FLOW REGIME AND WATER BALANCE]


           d. Water Use:
                    i. sectoral disaggregation of the water use (domestic, Industrial and
                       agriculture)
                   ii. major crop wise water use.
    4. Water Quality: Model outputs for select water quality parameters are tracked for
           a. Sediment transport
           b. BOD.
    5. Indications of relative level of uncertainty: The modelling outputs have been obtained by
       making various assumptions under the non-availability of desired data, which has caused
       uncertainties in the outputs obtained. Therefore it is important to convey the associated
       level of uncertainty and what data are required to reduce this uncertainty. Thus attempt
       shall be made to:
           a. Define the extent of uncertainty wherever possible quantitatively (or qualitatively)
           b. List the additional data that would be required to reduce the uncertainty.


Methodology
The information and the analysis provided here is the outcome of a detailed modeling exercise
carried out using the SWAT hydrological model under the World Bank lead Ganges Strategic Basin
Assessment (SBA) study and some of the subsequent works on the hydrologic modelling of the
Ganges Basin undertaken using the SWAT model.

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is a distributed parameter, continuous scale
model that operates on a daily time-step although sub-daily model run is possible with Green and
Ampt infiltration method. It divides the basin into a number of sub-basins based on topography.
Each sub-basin is further divided into Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs), which are a unique
combination of soil, landuse, and land management. The HRU is the smallest landscape component
of SWAT, for computing the hydrologic processes including canopy interception of precipitation,
infiltration, surface runoff, evapotranspiration, subsurface flow, soil moisture redistribution, and
percolation to deep aquifer. The hydrological processes are divided into two phases: the land phase,
where the model determines the upland loadings of flow, sediment, nutrients, and pesticides from
each HRU, and then the loadings are area-weighted to sub-basin level; and the channel/floodplain
phase, where the model routes the upland loadings from each sub-basin through the
channel/stream network. The model also simulates water and pollutant routing through
impoundments such as ponds, wetlands, and reservoirs. SWAT also simulates pollutant loading from
point sources such as discharge from industries, wastewater treatment plants, and in-stream
transformations of nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, carbonaceous biological oxygen
demand. The rainfall records from the nearest rain gauge station will be assigned for each sub-basin.
Tools have been developed to interpolate the rainfall amount and derive spatially variable rainfall
inputs for the basin/sub-basin. A model provides a very comprehensive outputs for the land phase
and the channel phase as well as at elaborate spatial and temporal scales.

The report utilizes such range of outputs obtained from the SWAT model for reorganising the
information to be presented in different forms and levels of abstraction:

Definitions of some of the key entities
A brief description of the important entities of the water balance is given below for bringing in clarity
to the various forms of analysis made.

    •       Water yield (mm) - WYLD: The net amount of water that leaves the subbasin and contributes
            to stream flow in the reach during the time step. (WYLD = SURQ + LATQ + GWQ – TLOSS –
            pond abstractions)
    •       Direct Surface runoff (mm) - SURQ: Surface runoff contribution to stream flow during time
            step that contributes directly without going through the soil
    •       Lateral flow (mm) - LATQ: Lateral flow contribution to stream flow during the time step that
            enters the soil and then move laterally
    •       Base flow (mm) - GWQ: Groundwater contribution to stream flow that is composed of the
            water from the shallow aquifer that joins the river reach during the time step
    •       Actual evapotranspiration (mm) - ET: Actual evapotranspiration from the subbasin during
            the time step
    •       Percolation (mm) - PERC: Water that percolates past the root zone during the time step.
            There is potentially a lag between the time the water leaves the bottom of the root zone and
            reaches the shallow aquifer. Ground water Recharge = PERC-GWQ
    •       Sediment yield (tons/ha) - SYLD: Sediment from the subbasin that is transported into the
            river reach during the time step
    •       Stream In-Flow (m3/s) - FLOW_IN: Average daily stream flow into reach/stream (subbasin
            outlets) during the time step
    •       Stream Out-Flow(m3/s) - FLOW_OUT: Average daily stream flow out of reach (subbasin
            outlets) during the time step
    •       Biochemical oxygen demand-in (kg O2) - CBOD_IN: Carbonaceous biochemical oxygen
            demand of material transported into reach during the time step
    •       Biochemical oxygen demand-out (kg O2) - CBOD_OUT: Carbonaceous biochemical oxygen
            demand of material transported out of reach during the time step.

Spatial entities that have been defined for the study include:

    •       the entire Ganges Basin upstream of Farakka
    •       the Indian portion of the basin upstream of Farakka
    •       the Nepalese portion of the basin
    •       the Chinese portion of the basin
    •       each of the Indian States in the basin.

Temporal Scale include:

Besides assessing the spatial variability of the water resource in the Ganges basin it is equally
important to ascertain the temporal variability in each of these spatial units identified above. On the
temporal scale, the following information has been found to be useful to be generated.

    •       at annual and calendar month level for
                o long term annual average (long term basin average)

Scenarios for flow regime change analysis
One of the major issues that is of utmost concern is the ever deteriorating hydrological regime of the
river basins because of the over abstraction of groundwater, creation of excessive storages and the
diversions and Ganges is no different. Any effort to restore the hydrological status of a basin
requires the information on the basin that prevailed before the water resources development, which
is usually not available. However, generation of such information is possible only through
hydrological simulation and the same has been adopted. The following two scenarios thus have been
constructed to represent two distinct flow regimes, representing i) pre-water resources
development regime and ii) present flow regime.

Scenario A: Pre-development flow in the absence of water resources infrastructure including water
diversions but reflecting catchment hydrology corresponding to the current landuse.

Scenario B: Current regime, representing existing major water resources infrastructure, current
management/operation practices, existing crop water demand through irrigation. Current crop
management practices differentiating irrigation from Surface and Ground water have been used.
Point source input has been taken using average BOD and the average sewage generation per capita
and obtaining total load based on subbasin population.

Basin Level Spatial Entities at which Outputs are Consolidated
Flow outputs (Inflow and outflow) in BCM (Billion Cubic Metre) are given, at major subbasins as
depicted in Figure 1. Information has been generated for various water balance components such as
Water Yield in mm depth, Evapotranspiration in mm depth, and Sediment Yield in Tons and BOD in
ppm within these spatial has been aggregated and analysed.

The first level of analysis has been done using the natural boundaries as per the basic philosophy of
hydrology. For the purpose 26 automatically delineated sub-basins as given in Table 2 have been
used. The analysis has been performed using the SWAT hydrological model output for 31 years (1975
to 2005) of simulation using landuse, soil characteristics, terrain and daily meteorological data of the
basin. The entities used in this analysis are:

      •        average annual stream flow volumes (BCM) at inlet (if not a head water sub-basin) and
               outlet of each of the sub-basin,
      •        average annual equivalent depths in mm of some of the major water balance components
               for each sub-basin
      •        average annual sediment load simulated at inlet (if not a head water sub-basin) and outlet of
               each of the sub-basin.


Stream Flow for Major Ganga Tributaries for Scenario A and B
Pre-development flow (Scenario A) and Post-development flow (Scenario B) series have been
generated for major tributaries of the Ganga river by using the SWAT hydrological modeling.
Strategic locations on the major tributary basins as well as the locations on the main Ganga used for

The pre-development flow series have been obtained by performing the simulation after assuming
that no storage or diversion projects are in place. However agricultural activity is in place but only
rainfed. It is further assumed that the land use during the pre-development situation is the same as
the post-development stage. In fact for both the scenarios the same period of 31 years have been
used thus the difference is supposed to reflect only the impact on account of anthropogenic
activities. The average annual flow in BCM for the major sub-basins of the Ganga basin are shown in
Table 3 for both Scenarios A and B.

* India at Farakka
+ Scenario A: Pre-development flow in the absence of water resources infrastructure and water diversions but
reflecting catchment hydrology corresponding to the current landuse

++ Scenario B: Current conditions: Existing major water resources infrastructures, current
management/operation practices, existing crop water demand with irrigation wherever applicable.



It may be observed from Table 3 that the average annual yield of the Ganga Basin up to Farakka
under the Scenario A was about 566 BCM. If the yield of Damodar and Lower Ganga (66 BCM) is
added then the total yield is about 632 BCM. This yield is reduced to 310 BCM and 339 BCM
respectively under the Scenario B. This implies that on the average there has been a reduction of
about of 256 BCM of water in Ganga Basin up to Farakka and about 37 BCM of water in the Lower
Ganga on account of storages, and a range of utilisations such as irrigation, industrial and domestic.

Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the graphical representation of the average annual stream flow entering
and leaving each of the identified sub-basins under Scenario A and B respectively. The flow that was
generated by the sub-basin under the pre-development situation can be obtained by taking the
difference between the outflow and inflow from Scenario A. The impact of water resources
development for various purposes including the irrigation (being the major utilisation) from surface
and ground water sources has been reflected for each sub basin in Scenario B of Figure 4 and Figure
5.

Another view has been created to depict the reduction by showing the proportion of flow remaining (Scenario B) in comparison to that under Scenario A by
using a schematic of the Ganga Basin (Figure 7). The sub basin shown in ‘red’ i.e., Sind is the one that has experienced maximum reduction to the tune of

reduction of 7% (0.93 as the ratio of B/A Scenario).

Figure 8: Monsoon (JJAS) Stream flow (BCM) - Major Tributaries of Ganga - Scenario B and Ratio of Scenario B to Scenario A
The impact of the development has not been evenly distributed over the year as well as over the space of the basin. Figure 8 depicts the change in
Monsoon (JJAS) flow. It may be observed that the reduction in flow in comparison to the Scenario A is variable over the different sub-basins of Ganga. The
reduction in the sub-basins joining Ganga river from South have higher reduction (maximum being Sind with 75% reduction) in comparison to those joining

Ganga river from North side (with maximum reduction of 40% for Upper Yamuna). However, the situation is drastically different during the Non-monsoon
(OND) period. There is a very small fraction of flow left during the non-monsoon period specially in the sub-basins joining Ganga river from southern side as
shown in Figure 9. Reduction is also considerable even in the flows of the sub-basins joing Ganga River from the northern side ranging from 44% to 94%.

Monthly Stream Flow in BCM/month - Scenario A - Major sub basins Level
Analysis has also been performed in the similar manner at the monthly level so as to ascertain the
resource availability and its variability at the monthly level using the simulation outputs of 31 years.
Impact of the water resources development has been depicted by incorporating all the major water
resources projects in the hydrological simulation and depicting the same on average monthly basis
under the Scenario B. Details of these outputs have been provided in Annexure I.

It may be observed from the Table 4 that for the sub basins having contribution from snow and glacial melt there is surplus storage in the water balance
which in all probability is contributed by the melt. The other obvious inference that can be drawn is that invariably in all the sub basins there has been some
level of reduction in the water yield on account of the water resources development. The storage that has been depicted under the Scenario B can be
higher than the storage created since the simultaneous use of the storage can lead to the additional entrapment beyond the capacity. An increase in
evapotranspiration in the Scenario B is also evident which is on account of the irrigation deployed in the sub basins.

Spatial variation of the annual water balance components for Scenario A and Scenario B for sub basins of Ganga is shown in Figure 14.

Monthly Water Balance mm/month - Scenario A and Scenario B
Average long term monthly water balance components namely water yield and evapotranspiration
in mm/month have been made available for sub basins of Ganga for Scenario A and Scenario B at
Annexure I.


Flow Duration Curve (FDC) at Major sub basins Level
Assessment of dependability of flows in time is essential for planning and development of water
resources projects of various kind. The dependability of the water yield of various sub basins of
Ganga has been analyzed with respect to three levels of 50, 75 and 90% dependability for Scenarios
A and B. The Flow Duration Curves for Scenarios A and B for every sub basin of Ganga have been
provided in Figure 11.

The extent of change in flow at a particular point on a drainage system is not only influenced by the
storages or utilization in the sub basin in question but also due to the interventions in the sub basin
up-stream.

Sediment Flow at Major sub basins Level
One of the important outputs available from SWAT simulation is sediment load that gets generated
from land mass and subsequently flow through various drainage networks. This is an important
output from the view point of the impacts of water resources development on sediment transport in
the sub basins of Ganga. Average annual sediment flow in million metric tons per year has been
reported for various sub basins of Ganga for scenario A and scenario B.

Annual Sediment Flow for Sub basins of Ganga for Scenarios A and B
Average annual sediment load at inflow point (in case of intervening sub basins) and flow point for
each of the sub basins of Ganga are given in Table 5.

Figure 12 and Figure 13 show the graphical representation of the sediment load at inflow and
outflow points for sub basins of Ganga for Scenario A and Scenario B respectively. The SWAT model
performs the sediment erosion and transport routing on landmass as well as through river channel
systems to arrive at the sediment flow at a specific location. One can observe the reductions of
sediment load in many of the sub basins on account of water resources development through
creation of storages as well as diversions.

Spatial depiction of annual sediment load (MT/year) for tributaries of sub basins of Ganga is shown in Figure 14 for Scenario B. Reduction of sediment load
on account of water resources development has been depicted using the ratio of sediment flow of Scenario B to Scenario A. The lower this ratio, the higher
is the entrapment of sediment in the sub basin

Monthly Sediment Flow in MT/month - Scenario A - Major sub basins level
The temporal variation of sediment transport in the sub basins of Ganga has been provided for
Scenarios A and B in Annexure I as average monthly sediment inflow and outflow for sub basins of
Ganga.


CBOD at Major sub basins Level
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is a measure of the dissolved oxygen consumed by
microorganisms during the oxidation of reduced substances in waters and wastes. Typical sources of
BOD are readily biodegradable organic carbon (carbonaceous, CBOD) and ammonia (nitrogenous,
NBOD). These compounds are common constituents or metabolic by-products of plant and animal
wastes and human activities (domestic and industrial wastewaters). The increased organic loading
stimulated microbial decomposition that utilized dissolved oxygen (DO) in the surface water. Greater
the BOD, more rapid will be oxygen depletion resulting in less oxygen available to aquatic life.

Average CBOD in ppm has been simulated by the SWAT model for sub basins of Ganga for scenario
B. Permissible Permissible limit of Biochemical Oxygen Demand 5 days at 20oC is 3mg/l or less 1.

Irrigation Applied for Major crops at Major sub basins Level
There has been considerable change within the agricultural area in the Ganga basin that is having
significant impact on the hydrological regime of the Ganga basin. Secondary data on cropping
patterns and the irrigation sources has been analysed for 42 years (1966 – 2007) and trend analysis
has been performed to detect change in crop and the source of irrigation.

Trend in change of cropped area for major crops of rice, wheat, sugarcane, maize, millets and pulses.
Results of the trend analysis are presented in Figure 16 and it show that there is a significant
reducing trend in the area under sugarcane, maize millets and pulses though spread over various sub
basins of Ganga basin. However there is a significant positive trend in the areas under rice, wheat
and pulses crops. Similar analysis has been performed on the trend in the total area irrigated under
rice and wheatand also in the trend in the source of irrigation. There is a positive trend in the total
area under irrigation in the Ganga basin as shown in Figure 16. It can also be observed that the area
under surface irrigation is reducing and the area with grounwater as the source of irrigation is
increasing. There is positive trend in irrigated area under wheat and rice for majority of the sub
basins but for a few areas which show negative trend. However the crop intensity has increased in
majority of the sub basins of Ganga.

Analysis has also been made on the average seasonal irrigation water used for crops in various sub
basins of Ganga and the same has been shown in Figure 17 for Kharif and Rabi seasons. It may be
observed that the extent of irrigation in Rabi season (non-monsoon season) is almost double of the
irrigation requirement of the Kharif being the monsoon period season. This is one of the reason for
deterioration of the hydrological health of the Ganga basin that has been assessed in the next
section.

River Health Assessment
Flow Health, developed by the International Water Centre in 2009-2012 for the Australia China
Environment Development Program (ACEDP) was used for assessing the River health and
environmental flow in China (Gippel et al, 2012 2). It is an application to assist in the design and
management of river flow regimes thereby providing a “flow health score” assigned for the river
based on the magnitude and frequency of the flows.

Flow health was used for analysis of river health in different rivers of China by a project undertaken
by International water centre. The indicators identified to assess the river flow regime are shown in
Figure 18. The flow regime was analyzed and the parametric variations contributing to the Flow
health score formulation was analyzed in the study. (Zhang Yuan, 2007)

river flows from reference and to design a monthly environmental flow regime. Technical Manual
and User Guide, Version 2.0.

The major inputs required for the Flow health tool is the monthly or daily flow hydrograph (observed
or simulated) continuously available for a period of time. The flow health score is derived from nine
different hydrological sub indicators: High Flow (HF), Low Flow (LF), Highest Monthly (HM), Lowest
Monthly (LM), Persistently Higher (PH), Persistently Lower (PL), Persistently Very Low (PVL),
Seasonality Flow Shift (SFS) and Flood Flow Interval (FFI) (Gippel et al, 2012). These nine indicators

are closely related to the basic flow components of a natural flow regime (Figure 19). The Flow
Health Index combines the scores of the nine sub-indicators.

Flow Health assist in the assessment, design and management of river flow regimes. Its main
purpose is to provide a score for hydrology in river health assessments, but it can also be used as a
tool to assist environmental flow assessment.

Flow Health has four main functions(Gippel et al, 2012).:

    •        To provide an annual score for the hydrology indicator in river health assessment
    •        To recommend a minimum monthly environmental flow regime
    •        To test the hydrological health of any monthly environmental flow regime
    •        To generate a synthetic monthly flow time series based on the designed environmental flow
             regime

For the major tributaries of the Ganga River, flow health analysis has been carried out to provide an
annual score for the hydrology indicator in river health assessment.

The assessment of flow health has been carried out by considering natural low-flow and natural
high-flow periods based on the flows from Scenario A (Reference period). The percentile ranking of
different flow metrics has been obtained by comparing the Scenario B flow with the reference
period to arrive at non-dimensional scoring system of different flow indices.

Ecosystem Significance of Flow health parameters
  •        Highest Monthly Flow (HMF)
               o Magnitude of flood flows which are critical for inundating wetlands, cuing fish
                   spawning behaviour, facilitating fish migration and mobilising sediment for creation
                   of physical habitat.
  •        Lowest Monthly Flow (LMF)
               o Magnitude of the lowest flow of the year, when minimum flows are required for
                   survival
               o HMF and LMF are not determined for the high flow and low flow seasons
                   respectively, but for the entire year.
  •        Highest and Lowest flow Volume (HF& LF)
               o Total seasonal volume will reflect the prevailing natural hydrological conditions (in
                   particular, highlighting dry years) and also indicate any major reductions in total flow
                   volume (and hence gross habitat area availability) due to flow regulation
               o Significant regulation impacts would tend to be characterised by a sustained
                   reduction in HFV, perhaps also with a sustained reduction in LFV.
  •        Persistently Higher flow (PHF)
               o Intended to relate to the situation of flows being artificially regulated at significantly
                   higher than reference magnitude for long periods through the low flow period.
               o This can reduce light penetration to the bed, and hence reduce primary production
                   of benthic algae
               o Persistently elevated low flows might also mean that invertebrates are not
                   seasonally stressed, which could be a natural disturbance process that plays a role in
                   maintaining diversity
               o Higher than normal flows in the low flow period can also stress riparian vegetation
                   by waterlogging root zones, or preventing recruitment in exposed soils.
  •        Persistently Lower flow (PLF)
               o Intended to relate to the situation of flows, either in the low or high flow season,
                   being depressed for long periods.
               o This indicator would usually indicate persistently depressed low flow season flows,
                   which would have implications for gross habitat area availability for fish and
                   macroinvertebrates.
               o This flow condition would potentially allow colonisation of the stream bed by
                   invasive vegetation, or accumulation of fine sediments that settle out during periods
                   of low flow. In a river with a high level of flow diversion, a high proportion of the
                   year could have markedly depressed flows, which could impact the entire life cycles
                   of many aquatic organisms.
  •        Persistently very Low ( PVL):
               o Relates to the situation of flows being artificially regulated at very low levels for long
                   periods through the low flow period.
               o The consequences of this drying or near-drying of the channel can be critical for all
                   organisms in the stream.

                 o  Very low flows are often associated with the loss of riffle habitats, crowding in pools
                    and degraded water quality, such as temperature extremes and increased risk of
                    hypoxia and high salinity.
    •        Seasonal flow shift (SFS) :
                 o relates to the situation of the seasonal pattern of flows being reversed, or partly
                    reversed, due to storage of flows in the natural high flow season, and release of
                    flows for downstream supply in the natural low flow season.
                 o The consequences of this can be disruption of the natural timing of flow pulses and
                    baseflows that stimulate the behaviour of aquatic organisms whose life cycle has
                    adapted to a particular seasonal pattern of flow.
