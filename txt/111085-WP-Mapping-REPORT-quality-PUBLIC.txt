Snapshot of Mining History in South Africa
Mining in South Africa has shaped the country culturally,
economically and politically. It directly contributed to the
establishment of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange
in the late 19th century, and today it still accounts for
a third of its market capitalisation (Source: Mining IQ
Mining Intelligence Database).


The history of mining in South Africa goes back as far as
the Dutch (Simon van der Stel, 1685) after the arrival in
the Cape. The pictures in Figure 1 and figure 3 reveals
some of the black, Chinese and white mine labourers in
a gold mine in South Africa from the early 1900’s; and
underground rock drillers in one of the highest exposure
to silica dust and risk of silicosis


By 1904, after the mining shutdown due to the Anglo
Boer War, the first 10,000 contracted Chinese workers
arrived to help rebuild the industry, and ensure low
labour prices. Whilst the Chinese were repatriated
                                                               Figure 1 - Mine Labourers Early 1900’s
by 1910, the demand for labour quickly brought large

countries to the mines. They were treated as migrant
workers and placed in cramped mining accommodation.




The White Death
Silicosis on the Witwatersrand Gold Mines 1886 – 1910 by Elaine
Katz (1994), provides a historical account of the extent of silicosis
that ravaged the lungs of the early (white) miners. Katz notes in
the introduction to this seminal history of the early years of mining
in South Africa: “Although a great deal has been written about the
development of the Witwatersrand gold mining industry, only a tiny
slice has been devoted to its medical and health past….posterity has
been extraordinarily slow in acknowledging the devastation wrought
by the ‘white death’, or censuring those who did nothing to stop it”.


The first miners were predominantly foreign migrant workers from
England who returned home when ill. Eighty-five percent (85%) of
the white miners in the early years were British born and fifty-eight
percent (58%) of these men were from Cornwall. A full third from
the district of Redruth, Cornwall. Katz records that “Redruth was the
only foreign mining centre which compiled official silicosis mortality
statistics for the returned Witwatersrand rock drillers, who were
buried in the ‘rapidly filling graveyards’ of Cornwall”.

With the epidemiology of silicosis being more closely tracked by
doctors in Cornwall it was possible to conclude “between 1892 and
1910 almost an entire generation of professional miners from abroad         Figure 2 - The 'White' Death

died from an accelerated form of silicosis”. The fate of black South
African migrant mineworkers has, close to a hundred years later, yet
to be fully recorded. Decades upon decades have passed without              homes in the labour-sending areas of the country, being counted in any

TB in the mines has been a challenge in the
sub-region for over 100 years. Although there
have been efforts at addressing it over the
years, none of these initiatives sufficiently
addressed the problem. A key constraint has
been that none of these efforts considered
the multi-sector and regional dynamics of the
challenge.


The Ministers of Health from Lesotho,
Mozambique, South Africa and Swaziland
region requested support from the World Bank
and other international development agencies
(DFID, Stop TB Partnership, PEPFAR, IOM,
etc.) to coordinate a regional effort in addressing
the TB epidemic in the mining sector and its
impact in the region. An important component
of this regional approach to TB management
is the Service Delivery Framework aimed at
reaching current mineworkers, ex-mineworkers            Figure 6 - Detailed map of mapped area

The fundamental challenge is that there is no single reliable source of
                                                                                  also loaded in the spatial database. District maps were generated for the
readily available, consolidated and adequate information currently.
                                                                                  requested areas, and the maps can be further used in planning.
Hence the need had been identified to embark on the Regional TB
Service Framework whose first phase is to map current mineworkers and
ex-mineworkers who are working or have worked in South African mines

The objective is therefore to generate accurate, detailed, and up-to-             within the region and can be used to improve access to services for
date information on the demographic characteristics of current and ex-            mineworkers, ex-mineworkers, mining communities, and labour-sending

Background
The World Bank, at the request of the governments of Lesotho, South
Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique, is convening a regional approach
to addressing the TB challenge. An important component of this
regional approach to TB management is the frequent screening and
treatment of both current mineworkers and ex-mineworkers. Such
a targeted approach requires information on where current and ex-
mineworkers are, and what TB screening and treatment facilities are
available to them. This information is currently inadequate.



Mineworker touch-points and
risk of spreading TB
                                                                              Figure 8 - The Spread of TB

mineworker it can have indirect touch points to around twenty thousand
people. It is estimated that one infected mineworker has the potential to
infect family members back home; these could be four children who in
turn are exposing about two hundred and fifty school friends; and the wife
could also possibly infect twenty other community friends. Considering
that there are approximately five hundred thousand current mineworkers
and about two million living ex-mineworkers, the potential touch points at
risk could rapidly escalate to enormous proportions.

Figure 10 show that in reality, this is already happening. The World Bank
statistics on the national TB incidence rate for the major labour sending
countries are still climbing. With a TB rate of 1,000 per 100,000 for South
Africa, this means around 550,000 people have TB in South Africa. The
estimated rate for mineworkers and ex-mineworkers is considered to be
more than 2,500 per 100,000, giving a speculative 62,500 mineworkers
and ex-mineworkers with active TB. If mining was the only active source
of TB, then the current effective multiplier would be around eight times      Figure 9 - The Explosion of TB

South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland are among the top 10 High TB
Burden countries globally as shown in Figure 10. It is worthwhile to
note that our neighbours Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe all have a
downward trend suggesting that their handling of the disease is more
effective than our own. Australia, in the 1940’s, implemented stringent
dust standards and have a very low incidence rate of TB.


Purpose
The purpose of the mapping exercise is to provide valuable information
on the location of mineworkers, ex-mineworkers, their families, mines,
mining communities and health facilities in Lesotho, South Africa and
Swaziland. It is further understood that further phases, will establish
proper screening and integrated, harmonized surveillance systems, that
will establish ongoing organization and control over TB screening and
treatment for mineworkers and ex-mineworkers, and their families in the

 Notes:
 1. The DMR data does not show address information for the mineworkers. This data is for December 2013 and is reported to DMR monthly.
 2. The mine list provided also shows Commodities, Mining Operation Type, and the mined farms and mining statistics classified by province and
 commodity groups.
 3. No addresses at the Mineworker record level. 100,000 beneficiaries records with incomplete addresses extrapolated to cover further family
 members
 4. The mining locations does not reflect the mining operations and farms where Lonmin operate
 5. A very small percentage of the records reflect district data, and then it mostly reflects Rustenburg.
 6. Exxaro does not use a labour sending area approach, and recruit locally and mineworkers stay around the mines. No address data that could
 confirm this
 7. The data reflects how many people were employed by Anglogold over time, but does not show how that is relevant to the current position and
 the mapping study.
 8. 305 registered mining companies who has insurance with Rand Mutual, and cover for 388,490 employees. It shows that classification around
 the mining operation type, such as underground, deep underground are important for health and safety consideration.
 9. Just country of origin was listed, and the employees are just the one from neighbouring countries. No district info provided,

Mineworker Classification
The project focused on mapping mineworkers and ex-mineworkers.
To properly do this a good understanding of the 2 classifications were
required. Figure 15 illustrates how mineworkers flow into the group of
mineworkers as new entrants, in a closed loop system, with just one
outflow. The only outflow from the system is when the mineworker
becomes deceased. The classification is built to address the issue that
a mineworker can still become sick from Silicosis and Tuberculosis long
after leaving the workplace where the condition has been contracted.
Leaving the industry to work in another industry, go farming, etc. does not
remove a mineworker from the grouping. Silicosis can take effect for up
to 20 years after being contracted, and TB for up to 15 years.


Another important consideration is the status of migrant worker or not.
Typically it is assumed that migrant workers coming from outside South
African borders to work in South African mines would return, after their      Figure 15 - The Flow of Employment

Ever since the late 1800’s, mining activity in South Africa has
been a major player in terms of revenue and employment. The
mining activity can be measured in production and sales, both
local usage and international sales, and also reserves that
could still be mined. For our purposes we selected to illustrate
3 elements of significance. Firstly we looked at the employment
data because the focus of the project is an understanding of
the distribution of mineworkers, ex-mineworkers and their
families. We therefore collected data on the distribution as at
end of 2013, and we also included some data on the trend of
the mineworker population. There have been some significant
shifts in these employment numbers over time, and it requires
an understanding of the employment differences in the various
mining commodities to appreciate the trends in the employment
numbers. We only recorded employment trends as reflected in
DMR data from 1991 till 2013.


There is a general perception that Gold and Diamond mining
is the major player in South Africa. Whilst these commodities
founded the industry and were the cornerstone for many years,                                             Figure 35 - Commodity/Workforce Distribution

It is important to note that DMR             Figure 37 - Mineworkers per Commodity (in1000’s)
reporting does not require actually          ©URSA
stipulating who works underground and
who does not, etc. The best position
that can be glanced from this data
is that gold mining mostly involves
underground mining, vs. iron that does
not. If relevant to NTP intervention
planning this should be considered with
this in mind.


Note: The DMR data reports some
mines with more than one category,
and the mineworkers reported therefore
cannot be differentiated. This also
leads to numbers that at first glance are
doubtful. To get a better understanding
of this, a separate table with mines and
their classification has been included,
especially where the mine does not
conform to conventional wisdom in
terms of primary type.
                                                                                     Figure 38 - Mines and Mineworkers Distribution by Mine Size

conditions, etc. and would therefore probably need more focused interventions.


In Figure 38 an analysis is done to show how the mine size and number of mines per size correlates. The mines shown here reflects that a very large
portion of the registered mines, 761 out of 1720, reported 0 mineworkers or did not report at all. This means that less than 65% (941) of the registered
mines employ all the mineworkers accounted for.
For further analysis we considered the following sizing spread, including only mines that actually reported one or more mineworkers, and using the
number of mineworkers as the sizing factor.


Considering just the mines with mineworkers, it should further be noted that a further 696 (72.6%) mines can be considered as very small in terms of
mineworkers, employing less than 100 mineworkers each, for a total of 12,295 (2.5%) mineworkers. The number of small mines makes for a further
16.8% of the mines and bringing the total of mineworkers in these first 2 categories to nearly 90% of mines, but with just 14% of mineworkers. The
medium to very large mines therefore account for just 10% of the mines, but for 86% of the mineworkers.




Gold
South Africa’s gold mining industry has been the mainstay for many years. Over the last 20 years however, due to various factors, the production and
employment in this sector has been reduced drastically, from around 450,000 out of a total of 700,000 mineworkers (around 64% in 1995) to as low
as 124,000 in 2013 or just 26% of the total mineworkers.

By the end of 2013 there were only 41 mines reporting employees to DMR. A year before it was around 53 mines in 2012. South Africa still holds
around 12% of the world’s reserves of gold. Despite this decline, the industry is still quite big and is earning substantial income for South Africa. The
restructuring and decline does however create issue for the NTP and should be recognised as a potential issue of responsibility. A recent outcry was
heard when talks of Anglogold Ashanti doing a sales of its local mines became known.


The underground numbers listed shows that most of the mining operation is done in underground mines.


The mini mine belt maps shown in the infographic indicates where mining activity for this commodity is mostly taking place. In each case a shading
color is assigned to a range and generally a darker color indicates a higher density (range) than a lighter color. In all the density maps, a white color
indicates not reported, or 0 mineworkers reported within that specific area.

The platinum group of metals consists of Platinum, Palladium and Rhodium. This set of metals is the new mainstay within the South African Mining
Industry. The bulk of the demand for these materials comes from the vehicle industry for auto catalysts. Car exhaust standards drive the demand. A
secondary market is from jewellery.

This commodity group employs the most mineworkers in South Africa, and the mineworkers are mostly underground workers. The peak of employment
was reached around 2008, and has maintained that level of employment for the last 6 years. Production is slightly down, mostly due to the major
labour unrest of the last few years in this sector.


The 52 mines that were mapped in this commodity group shows that nearly all activity takes place in the Northern part of South Africa. The mines in
this industry typically employ a large workforce per mine.


This sector employs around 137,000 employees via normal recruitment practices, and a further 54,000 as contractors. Female employees make for
around 10% of the total employees.


South Africa’s reserves in these commodities far outstrip all other countries. The demand for the commodity drives the higher prices, also due to unrest
and uncertainty in supply, mostly connected to labour unrest.

Coal
South Africa has a strong coal mining industry with demand driven from local energy demands and international sales. South Africa’s energy generation
is mostly coal based, and the new power stations coming on board over the next couple of years will drive this demand even higher.

As a producer, the coal industry pips PGM and Gold. However, export sales are lower since the local demand takes nearly 50% of the production.


The coal industry is somewhat more mechanised and opencast but still has a large underground contingent. Distribution of the coal production is
mostly in the eastern and northern regions of South Africa.


Coal, together with Gold and PGM, employs around 80% of the total mineworker population. The trend for employment and production is upward
since the early 2000’s.




                                                                                                                                         43

Iron
Iron is part of the ferrous group of metals, which also include Chrome, Manganese and Vanadium. Altogether South Africa is a major player in these
metals. Steel production drives the use of these metals, and is believed to continue driving the demand, with China a major consumer of this. As an
Iron reserve, South Africa is very small, holding less than 1%, putting it 12th. However, as an exporter, South Africa ranks 3rd in the world (7th as a
producer). Generally the mining is not underground, and the mines are not very large in terms of mineworkers employed, with an average of around
1600 mineworkers per mine. These mines are characterised by large mechanical equipment, and opencast mining. Interesting is the nearly equal split
between employees and contractors active.



Chromium
Chromium, Chrome Ore, or Chromite are used primarily in ferrochrome production, making iron products into steel, stainless steel, etc. South Africa
holds 74% of the 12 billion tons of reserve. Output has risen over the last few years. The steady rise in this mining activity is also reflected in the
mineworkers employed, and the more than 70% of the activity is at underground mines.

Sand, Clay & Stone
Sand Clay and Stone is a very large group of commodities and mines (516 reported mineworkers) that on average employ very few mineworkers per
mine. The distribution of the mining operations is very dispersed across the country. This area is very mechanised, using machinery that causes a lot
of dust. Hence the silicosis threat is rather large, albeit that the mineworkers in each are rather small.


Every operation that wants to take sand, stone, clay from the earth for commercial purposes, need to register their operation with DMR as a mine.
Stone such as gravel, of any size, and building materials are generally classified under this group.

Diamond

Diamond is arguably the first commodity that started the rush of mineworkers to South Africa. Compared to Gold, PGM and Coal, the Diamond
industry employs very few mineworkers. It should also be noted that the DMR lists a very large number of active and operating diamond mines, but
very few of these have a significant number of mineworkers. Diamonds are mined underground, on the surface, opencast and even at sea.
The diamond pricing Table 12 paints a very interesting picture of diamond quality. Lesotho diamonds are rare, the production small, and fetch very
high prices compared to the rest. South Africa weighs in at second place with quality in this list, with Congo DRC coming in with a very low price per
carat compared to the rest. Lesotho diamond fetch more than 100 times the Congo diamond price.

Manganese
This commodity seems to attract and use a higher than average percentage of contract works, being the only commodity group where the contractors
exceed the employed mineworkers. South Africa accounts for 75% of the world reserves, and the production is growing at around 8.7 percent
annually. Some new mines have been commissioned in this area, which will further accelerate the production, and simultaneously the employment.
Generally not large employers per mine, it is underground and as this sector grows, it can be expected that the employment will also grow.


Most of the mining is located in the Northern Cape and some very small numbers elsewhere.

TEBA is a recruiting agency, recruiting specifically for the mines. They
also provide further services to the mines related to the employees. It is
rather troublesome to get to grips with the position that the mines do not
get a complete record of the mineworker, even if they are the employer.
Some mine HR department stipulated that they do not have the “home”
address for the employee, i.e. his address where he is actually from. The
mines seem to be actually handing the function to TEBA. However, it is
not clear if they do this for all mineworkers, employees and contractors.
TEBA clearly indicate they do not supply any contractors, and they do not
employ mineworkers and supply as a labour broker.

This position is rather conflicting as the mineworker data ownership and
access should be made available along with the mineworker that gets
employed at the mine. It seems that this fragmented position would be a
stumbling block for any future integrated framework.



Commodity Based Analysis
Implementing a better understanding of the remaining commodities,
especially since gold mine employment is rapidly reducing, could be
very useful. Not only does it put some perspective on the mineworker
numbers, it also bring an understanding to the future of the numbers.
Certain commodities are rapidly growing. Previously it was considered
that all mineworkers are the same, exposed to the same conditions,
come from the same origins, and gold mining is the bad guy in term of
TB. This mapping of data clearly brings a more objective perspective.
Commodities like Chromium and Manganese are the new kids in terms
of growth. A strong focus should be on ensuring that whilst this is growing
and profitable proper practices are implemented from early on.

                           Annexure B - Provincial Maps
The provincial maps on the following pages shows mineworker distribution in terms of employees, contractors, and also the relative density within the
province. The maps also show where the farms within the health districts are located.

In the attached data tables the following meaning should be given to the columns


Code and Name for the District
Code and Name for the Sub District


DMR: This columns shows the total mineworkers as reported to DMR, that through the mapping, including the statistical spread over farms mined
by a mine, that through the mine farm position aggregated the mineworkers into this sub-district. This therefore represents where the mineworkers
themselves mostly are


Exxaro, Harmony, Sibanye and Lonmin: This includes mineworkers (employees and contractors) as well as ex-mineworkers reported by the four
companies for which addresses could be mapped to sub-districts after data clean up. As such it is not a record of how many people are present within
an area, but it is a sample which can indicate where the families of the mineworkers and ex-mineworkers should be.


Beneficiaries. This data was reported by Sibanye and represent a sampling of 100,000 beneficiaries with addresses and this reflects relatively where
family members should be mostly.


The maps provided in each case shows the density of where mineworkers are mostly working, including pie chart of the relative mix in terms of
employee and contractor. This is done using the DMR data supplied. The color ranges is absolute in terms of numbers vs similar sub-districts also
in other provinces.




The second map shows the beneficiaries per sub district. This data is percentage distribution within the province, across the sub-districts. This is a
first position about where families mostly are.


The third map shows the mineworkers per labour sending area, or where the mineworkers are from. The percentage shown is percentage distribution
within the province, across the sub-districts. This gives an alternate or confirming view about where the families of mineworkers and ex-mineworkers
are, including where the ex-mineworkers themselves also mostly are.

The fourth map shows the farms within the province that have been listed as being mined. It should be noted that not the whole are shown is a mine, it
is a farm on which a mine are being operated. Secondly, the ranges shown gives an indication on which farms the mineworkers mostly are. However,
this has been statistically modified with a strategy to allocate equal distributions of mineworkers for a mine across all the farms included in its mining.
This also includes all mining types and activity.


The additional table shown gives information about the commodities being mined in the province.

        Inaccurate data causes various problems, not least, of which are rework, data cleanup, and cause for doubt in results. When there is
        reason to doubt the accuracy of data, it is wise if possible to rather address the data concern. However, when there is a huge bulk of data
        it could be impractical to perform a clean up or rework of the data.

        Incomplete data impose a limit to what can be achieved with the data. Incomplete can be in terms of the population, in which case esti-

        completely unknown, This cannot be fixed by estimation alone, at least a sample of representative data is required.

        In order to effectively manage TB for the mining community and to reduce the spread thereof, some key elements may need to be cap-

        would be helpful to very helpful to guide NTP planning and interventions

                                                  should be corrected.

                                                  interventions would want to understand
                                                  the impact of the intervention and be able
                                                  to measure back to a baseline

                                                  reported, indicates this could be as low as

                                                  This could lead to a significantly higher

1.4.3   Commercial trends                         The various commodities have signifi-          The economic indicators give an indication of the
                                                  cantly different trends. Gold is reducing      sector’s growth and strength, and should be consid-

                                                  with PGM as a foreign exchange earner.
2       Communication
2.1     Standard Concepts                         Concepts such as mineworker, employee,         A glossary of terms should be established and
                                                  contractor, and TB Incidence rate were         maintained for these terms.
                                                  found to be used inconsistently.
2.2     Economic Impact vs. Health Impact         It is generally understood that TB requires    Build consistent communication and spread the
                                                  health funding and compensation. There is      message. It touches everyone.
                                                  a basic understanding that mines loose in
                                                  production. Very little recognition is given
                                                  to notion that a person’s economic contri-

                                                  big dataset, but at the same time not a
                                                  complete picture.                              3. Improve the scope of the data

                                                  The issue was escalated to URSA and
                                                  WB. Alternate requests to mines indicated
                                                  that they do not obtain all the data from

                                                  the data. A NDA was provided and signed
                                                  between URSA and a mine. This could
                                                  delay the task, as legal departments need
                                                  to get involved.
