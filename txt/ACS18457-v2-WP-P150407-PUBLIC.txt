VOLUME II: DETAILED ANALYSIS OF OECUSSE
Volume II presents a detailed chapter on each of the five areas assessed in depth for this report, and
summarized in Volume I, chapters 1 and 2. Chapter 3 details Oecusse’s living standards across a range of
metrics. In Chapter 4 full analysis is provided on Oecusse’s agricultural situation today and its prospect for
the future. This also includes estimates, costings, and project plans for the OADP. Chapter 5 details
challenges of overland transport between Oecusse and Dili and the need for a land corridor. Finally, Chapter
6 provides detailed analysis of Oecusse’s migration and remittances flows. A separate background report is
available on tourism that seeks to place Oecusse’s prospects for tourism development in the broader context
of Timor-Leste’s tourism and the lessons of tourism in post-conflict societies from around the world.

CHAPTER 3: Living standards
3.1 Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to compare living standards in Oecusse with its immediate neighbors in order
to identify areas of particular advantage or disadvantage. One comparator is the Indonesian province of Nusa
Tenggara Timur (NTT), located in the eastern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands. Another comparator is the
nation of Timor-Leste as a whole. The analysis considers the following dimensions of wellbeing: (i)
population; (ii) education; (iii) employment; (iv) housing; (v) wealth; (vi) agriculture; (vii) health; (viii) crime
and safety; (ix) social networks; and (x) facilities and social security.

The data used in the report comes from the following sources: (i) 2012 Timor-Leste Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (2012 HIES)42 (ii) 2010 Census in Indonesia (SUSENAS); (iii) PNDS-REP43 quantitative
baseline data; and (iv) PNDS-REP qualitative baseline data focusing on the village of Abani, located at the
most southern border of Oecusse district with Indonesian West Timor.

The rest of this chapter summarizes the key findings of the comparative analysis in Section 2, before
providing more detail for each dimension of wellbeing in Section 3.

3.2 Key findings
The analysis confirms that Oecusse is a lagging region in a lagging country, with particular disadvantages in
education attainment, access to infrastructure and sanitation, and the share of population in the working age.
However, there are more people employed in Oecusse, there is better access to healthcare, and there is
stronger social cohesion than in the rest of the country.
        Oecusse has a younger population compared to the rest of Timor-Leste and NTT, but has a smaller
         working population aged between 15-49 years.



42  The 2011-12 Timor-Leste Household income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) was designed to be representative at the national
  level as well as in the district of Oecusse.
43 The PNDS-REP survey of living standards conducted by the Ministry of State Administration with World Bank support in 2014. It

  was a baseline survey to allow an assessment of the impact of PNDS, a community driven development program based on block
  grants and facilitated community participation.




                                                               1
       Though a higher proportion of respondents report receiving no education in NTT, the rate of
        literacy is significantly higher in the NTT compared to Oecusse and Timor-Leste proper.
       Oecusse is a predominantly agriculture-based economy with over five times the share of people in
        Oecusse owning or leasing land for agriculture use as in the whole country.
       Oecusse has a higher employment rate than the rest of the country and the NTT.
       Construction materials for roofs and walls of houses are more temporary and unstable, made of palm
        leaves, rather than brick and/or iron which is more prevalent in the NTT.
       Access to electricity is very limited in Oecusse compared to NTT, with a majority of households
        dependent on kerosene for lighting.
       A greater proportion of households still openly defecate in Oecusse, compared to Timor-Leste
        proper and NTT. A significantly larger proportion of households in NTT have a toilet with a septic
        tank than Oecusse.
       Ownership of most durable goods excluding televisions is very limited in Oecusse compared to the
        country and NTT.
       Households in Oecusse are more positive about household and general community economic
        situation compared to Timor-Leste proper.
       Households in Oecusse have better access to healthcare than the rest of the country, and even NTT.
        Clinics are the most commonly used facility, and all households have sought medical attention when
        a household member is seriously unwell.
       Crime levels are lower in Oecusse, though the frequency of conflict is higher than Timor-Leste
        proper.
       Greater trust and willingness to help neighbors exists in Oecusse compared to Timor-Leste proper.
       Higher participation in social groups and events such as religious and traditional festivals in Oecusse
        compared to Timor-Leste proper.
       Higher percentage of households satisfied with education and school facilities in Oecusse than
        Timor-Leste proper.
       Overwhelming dissatisfaction with the quality of roads in Oecusse, more than Timor-Leste proper.

3.3 Analysis of specific dimensions of wellbeing
Where survey data exists, comparisons are made with both NTT and Timor-Leste proper. References are also
made to Ambani, a suku in the west of Oecusse that was visited as part of the PNDS-REP qualitative survey.

 Error! Reference source not found. displays the composition of the male and female population in three
 different age groups, young (0-14 years), working age (15-49 years), and old (50+). It is interesting to note
 that while the ratio between the genders is close to equal in all regions, in Oecusse, the proportion of
 females aged 15-49 years (44%), is significantly higher than males in the same age group (38%). This
 divergence is not observed at the national level.

 Figure 3.3 shows that although women in Oecusse start having children slightly earlier than the
 national average, they on average give birth to fewer children than at the national level.

reporting no education in Oecusse is nil, for both males and females, it is a significant 31% for males and
33% for females in the NTT, as displayed in Figure 3.5. Nationally in Timor-Leste, 0% of the population
report having received no education. However, more than half of the population in Oecusse (54.5%), while
almost one-third (29%) of Timor-Leste national did not state their level of education. While primary
education amongst males and females is fairly similar in Oecusse compared to the rest of the country,
secondary and university education is significantly lower. Only 15% of males and 9% of females have
completed secondary education in Oecusse; and 3% of males and nil females have earned a university degree.
Nationally, 37% of males and 22% of females have completed their secondary degree, while 9% of males and
6% of females have earned a university degree.

3.3.4 Housing

Materials used to construct houses in Oecusse are of a more temporary and less stable nature. Figure
3.10 shows that a majority of roofs are built from palm leaves (52%) in Oecusse, compared to Timor-Leste
nationally (14%), and the NTT (2%). Furthermore, only 41% of the population in Oecusse have roofs made
of corrugated iron and zinc, compared to the NTT which reports a significant 78% of households with iron
roofs. In Abani, most houses were constructed using locally sourced material such as bamboo, wood, and
grass. These materials are unstable and impermanent, making houses more vulnerable to harsh climatic
conditions. Timor-Leste nationally reports 67% of households with an iron roof, which is still significantly
higher than in Oecusse. Similarly, Figure 3.11 displays the various construction materials used to build the
walls of houses which include concrete or brick, wood, bamboo, corrugated iron, clay, palm trunk, rock or
other materials. While 34% of Timor-Leste and 33% of the NTT have walls made of concrete or brick, only

23% of houses in Oecusse have brick or concrete walls. A significant percentage of houses in Oecusse have
palm trunk walls (66%), compared to the national average of 14%. Nil houses in the NTT report having walls
made from palm trunk.

Almost three-fourths (72%) of the population of Oecusse are still dependent on kerosene as a source of light,
as shown in Figure 3.12. In comparison, only 47% of Timor-Leste nationally use kerosene as a light source,
and an even smaller percentage—36%--continue to use kerosene in the NTT. Conversely, 63% of the NTT
use electricity, while only one-fourth of Oecusse have electricity in their homes. This is still much lower than
the national average of 42%. In Abani, electricity only reaches the town center, but only for 6 hours during
the night. When the qualitative research was being conducted in Abani in June 2014, there were ongoing
government projects to expand the existing coverage of electricity to other parts of the suku, beyond the
town center. Additionally, many who live further away from the town center in Abani use solar panels
donated by the government.

The majority of households in Oecusse, source water from a pipe (41%) and closed wells (21%),
whereas the large part of NTT’s water is sourced from protected springs (29%), as seen in Figure
3.13. Closed wells are also a primary water source in the NTT (21%). Additional water sources used in
Oecusse and in Timor-Leste are unprotected wells and public taps.

The majority of Timor-Leste (43%), including Oecusse (42%), and the NTT (45%) use pit holes as
their primary source of sanitation, as shown in Figure 3.14. A significantly larger proportion of
households have a toilet with a septic tank in the NTT (33%) than in Oecusse (11%). Nationally, 15%
of households in Timor-Leste have access to a toilet with a septic tank. Prevalence of using a bush as a toilet
is higher in Oecusse (29%) than in all of Timor-Leste (23%), or the NTT (21%). In Abani, a majority of the
community practiced open defecation.

3.3.5 Wealth

Ownership of durable goods such as bicycles, motorcycles, boats, televisions, air conditioners,
refrigerators, motorboats and cars were all lower in Oecusse compared to Timor-Leste nationally,
and also to the NTT as shown in Figure 3.15. Particularly striking are the differences in ownership of
motorcycles, owned by 6% of the population in Oecusse, 13% nationally in Timor-Leste, and a significantly

 displays the difficulty households have in satisfying daily food needs and in procuring fuel for cooking. While
a greater percentage of households in Oecusse stated that they always had difficulties in procuring food (5%)
and fuel (21%) compared to the national average of 2% and 8% respectively, a higher percentage of
households in Oecusse also stated the converse. 52% of households in Oecusse stated that they never
had difficulties in satisfying food needs compared to the national average of 42% , which can be
attributed to the significantly larger population (54.5%) engaged in agriculture in Oecusse compared the rest
of the country (45.5%.)

As mentioned earlier in the employment section, Oecusse is a predominantly agriculture based economy. 91%
of the population in Oecusse either own or lease land for agriculture, while nationally in Timor-Leste
only 16% of the population own or lease land specifically for agricultural purposes. Figure 3.18 displays
the prevalence of different crops in Oecusse and nationally in Timor-Leste. In all cases, apart from coffee, a
larger percentage of households in Oecusse grow each crop in the figure below than the national average.
Similarly, livestock is owned more predominantly in Oecusse, than nationally in Timor-Leste, apart from
horses, as shown in Figure 3.19.

3.3.7 Health

Households in Oecusse appear to be receiving adequate healthcare services compared to the rest of
the country and the NTT. Only 0.4% of households reported a member seriously ill in the last 12 months
in Oecusse, while 4% of households reported the same nationwide in Timor-Leste. The graph below shows
the percentage of households that sought medical attention when a member had a serious illness in Oecusse,
Timor national, and the NTT. 100% of households in Oecusse sought medical attention when a member had
a serious illness, compared to 88% nationally and 62% in the NTT.

Furthermore, 66% of households in Oecusse never had difficulty satisfying healthcare needs, compared to
44% nationally, as shown in the figure below. Only 16% in Oecusse had difficulty satisfying healthcare needs
sometimes, compared to the national average of 22%. 1% in Oecusse always had difficulty satisfying
healthcare needs, while 9% had nationally had the difficulty doing the same. In Abani, the suku had two
health clinics located in Haemnanu and Passabe, and a maternity clinic in Passabe staffed by nurses, doctors,
and midwives. Many interviewees had visited these facilities when they were in need of healthcare treatment.

While 95% of households in Timor-Leste experienced no crime in the past year, 99% of households
in Oecusse stated the same for the past year (Figure 3.22). Additionally, 68% of households in Oecusse

While households in Oecusse experience lower levels of crime than the rest of the country, conflict
and strife appear to be an ongoing problem compared to the rest of the country
(Figure 3.24). 74% of households in Oecusse feel that conflict occurs “sometimes” in their aldeia, as
opposed to 53% nationally, as shown in the figure below. Clearly, households in Oecusse are prone to a
higher level of conflict than the rest of the country as 24% of households stated that conflict never occurred
in their aldeia, compared to 44% nationwide. Only 69% of households in Oecusse felt that the level of
conflict had decreased in the past year, compared to 80% overall in Timor-Leste. 26% of households in
Oecusse felt that the level of conflict had remained static in the past year, while only 14% felt the same
nationwide.

3.3.9 Social Networks

The most popular modes of communication with family and friends in Oecusse are house visits (86%) and
the telephone (13%). Nationally, a greater proportion of the population use the telephone (17%)
comparatively to households in Oecusse (Figure 3.26).

Participation in communal events, such as construction projects, traditional and religious festivals
have a higher attendance rate in Oecusse than in the rest of the country. Figure 3.27 shows that 26% of
households in Oecusse always participate in social groups and events, and only 6% never participate in such
events. Nationwide, 20% always participate in social groups and events, and 8% never participate. However,
as Figure 3.28 shows, a significantly larger proportion of households in Oecusse (60%) state never
sharing food with family or friends, compared to 35% nationally in Timor-Leste.

Figure 3.29 displays the extent of participation by the community in paid and unpaid community construction
projects. While 34% of the sample in Oecusse felt that everyone participated in voluntary community
construction projects, only 24% felt the same nationwide. When asked the same question about paid
construction work, only 34% of the population in Oecusse felt that all households would participate,
compared to the nationwide average of 43.5%, perhaps indicating a difference between communal
goodwill in the participation of an unpaid project versus paid labor , especially when a significant
percentage of the population in Oecusse are already engaged in agricultural employment. In Abani, voluntary
participation in community projects was very prevalent.

 Certain groups have a greater presence and particiation in Oecusse than in the rest of the country
 (Figure 3.31), particularly savings groups (41% Oecusse; 7% nationally); traditional groups (53%
 Oecusse; 43% nationally); and water committees (44% Oecusse; 12% nationally). Higher
 participation in social groups and events, festivals, and voluntary construction projects indicates a
 greater degree of communal goodwill in Oecusse, fortified by the trust and willigness to help
 neighbours that was discusssed in the previous section. In Abani, community driven village groups are
 very prevalent. Villagers organize themselves into small and big village groups specializing in farming,
 cooking, sewing traditional cloding, and providing financial services through credit coopreatives locally know
 as UBSP (Joint Loan and Deposit Group). Most of these groups are sub-groups of larger umbrella
 organizations called Forum. Other groups are more independent and have a smaller number of memebrs.
 Many of the villagers identify thesmlves according to their particpation in these groups and some are
 members of multiple groups.

3.3.10 Facilities and Social Security

While usage of facilities such as secondary schools, bus stops, police stations, clinics and
agricultural extension services are fairly low in Oecusse compared to rest of the country, the one
exception are clinics, used by 85% of the population in Oecusse and 57% nationwide, as displayed in
Figure 3.32. This reinforces the finding in the Health section above that households in Oecusse had a
significantly greater proportion that sought medical help when a member contracted a serious illness
compared to the rest of the country or the NTT, and had little difficulties satisfying healthcare needs.

Oecusse households are more satisfied with drinking water facilities than nationally, but less
satisfied with the state of roads and bridges and the quality of schools (Figure 3.33). While a greater
proportion of households in Oecusse are unsatisfied with the quality of schools and educational facilities
(43%) compared to Timor-Leste nationally (40%), a greater percentage of households are also satisfied with
the quality of schools in Oecusse (31%) when compared to the entire country (27%) Interestingly, a higher
percentage of households are also satisfied with the drinking water facilities in Oecusse (25%) compared to
the country (19.5%), and are less dissatisfied (52%) than Timor-Leste nationally (62%). As mentioned in the
previous section, the prevalence and participation in water committees by households in Oecusse may
attribute to the higher satisfaction with drinking water facilities in Oecusse. Abani had many USAID financed

water tanks and canalization systems installed in various points in the suku. These tanks were located near the
roadside and were located strategically close to households. However, a community member responsible for
water maintenance in Abani mentioned that during the dry season water from these tanks diminished, and the
community had to source water from rivers and springs. Finally, there is an overwhelming dissatisfaction
with the state of roads and bridges in Oecusse (95%), compared to the rest of the country (85%).

3.3.11 Government Spending

Comparing available data on Timor-Leste’s Government spending by District, from 2013 to 2015, Oecusse
ranks 4th out of 13 between the districts that were the most benefited in terms of total resources received
from the Central Government in for of public spending. The ranking is the same when spending per resident
in each district is considered. It is important to highlight though that data on most Government spending is
not disaggregated by districts.

However, looking at the sectors of spending that more directly impact local population’s well-being, such as
health and education, Oecusse is between the districts that have been the most neglected. Considering
spending accumulated over 2013-2015, it ranked 10th out of 13 for per capita spending both on health and on
education. It also ranks poorly in per capita spending on social security, at 10th out of 12.

Spending in infrastructure, however, has been higher in Oecusse than in most district, considering spending
per inhabitant, accumulated over 2013-2015. It ranks 6th in the District Development programs (PDD,
PDID), which finances the development of small scale infrastructure according to the needs of local
communities (e.g. roads, education facilities, health facilities, water supply and sanitation and irrigation
systems). Projects under these programs are tendered to Timorese owned construction companies only.
Under the Infrastructure Fund, Oecusse is between the districts that were most directly benefited, ranking
3rd, due to spending on the Oecusse Region Development Program in 2014, when it was formalized as the
Special Social Economic Market Zone.

CHAPTER 4: Agriculture
4.1 Introduction
This chapter provides a detailed review of the state of the agriculture sector in Oecusse today and its
potential, based on a proposed Oecusse Agriculture Development Plan (OADP).

The first part of the chapter reviews Oecusse’s agriculture endowments in terms of natural and human
resources, as the initial conditions for an analysis of Oecusse’s potential.

The second part describes the OADP and its expected impact in terms of increasing sustainable farm
incomes, and agriculture’s contribution to economic growth while at the same time protecting Oecusse’s
fragile environment.

This analysis is based on costs of production and value chain analyses under three scenarios, including the
current situation, and two potential scenarios with improved technology and new crop and livestock
production interventions:

      (i)      Oecusse’s agriculture today (the current situation [CS]). Variables include crop and livestock
               production levels, farm incomes, costs of production, and international competitiveness;
      (ii)     Oecusse’s medium term agriculture future (the potential situation [PS]) - Oecusse’s agriculture
               potential for existing agriculture products with the application of currently proven technical
               interventions which have worked in other parts of Timor-Leste (mainly improved crop yields and
               heavier livestock at the point of sale). Variables include crop and livestock production levels, farm
               incomes, costs of production, and international competitiveness; and
      (iii)    Oecusse’s long term potential - considers what the sector might look like in (say) 20 years’ time if it
               receives its proportionate additional share of resources (which are currently allocated for overall Zone
               development) for implementation of an OADP which is based on existing and new agriculture
               products44 - the latter being perennial cash crops and high-value timber - and the application of
               improved production technology for all products.

4.2 Natural and Human Resources
Agriculture production in Oecusse is determined by the availability and quality of the following nine
key resources:

     (i)      areas of land (ha) which are suitable (in a sustainable way) for various types of agricultural
              production, such as irrigated cropping, rain fed farming, livestock grazing, commercial tree crop
              farming, farm forestry, etc.;
     (ii)     water resources - natural rainfall (and rainfall patterns), and supplies and reliability of irrigation
              water;
     (iii)    areas of natural forests which might be sustainably harvested, and/or re-planted;

44Based on the number of people likely to be involved, keeping in mind that the majority of people in Oecusse are currently
 subsistence farmers.




                                                            25
     (iv)   numbers of farming households (and family members) who supply most (if not all) farm labor;
     (v)    livestock populations from which surplus animals can be sold;
     (vi)   public sector resources in the form of; (a) agriculture extension services, (b) production inputs such
            as fertilizer and mechanization services, and (c) buildings and other facilities;
     (vii) connectivity between rural households; and the main towns, markets and ports - road access and
            communications;
     (viii) level of support from civil society - national and international NGOs, and the Church; and
     (ix) The level of social cohesion amongst members of rural communities.

Oecusse is generally not well-endowed with natural resources when compared with other parts of
Timor-Leste, although the Tono and the Natuka irrigation schemes are exceptions. Oecusse has
poor and infertile soils, low rainfall and a long dry season, large areas of steep land, limited aquifers, and a
natural resource base which is shaped by hundreds of years of over-exploitation and abuse by invaders and
the indigenous population. In addition, farmer’s knowledge of improved agriculture production practices is
very limited; and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF)45 is unable to support farmers with
effective extension services due to inadequate operating budget, and limited staff skills and experience.

Other Districts in Timor-Leste are also constrained by a poor agriculture natural resource base, such as the
steep upland and mountain slopes in the center of the country, but Oecusse is particularly badly degraded
(Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.7) and experiences some of the lowest rainfalls in the whole country. In terms of
direct comparison, if Government was trying to decide where to expand Timor-Leste’s agriculture sector on a
commercial basis, it would be more logical to target the flat, and relatively fertile alluvial soils along the south
coast which experience much higher (and bi-modal) rainfall than most of Oecusse.

4.2.1 Land Resources

The current agriculture production systems in Oecusse, even on irrigated land, are not sustainable
for many reasons, including:

      (i)     failure to replace nutrients removed in agriculture produce - organic farming will not resolve this
              issue because there are too few ruminant livestock, and farm gardens are scattered and often far
              from villages;
      (ii)    uncontrolled grazing by ruminant livestock (mainly cattle and goats) which denudes native
              grasslands and destroys remnant forests;
      (iii)   annual burning of all vegetation on crop land to control weeds and to “create soil out of rocks46” -
              see Figure 4.1;
      (iv)    short swidden cycles (upland, rain fed cropping frequencies) as inherent soil fertility declines, and
              the population increases;
      (v)     cropping on steep and highly erodible hillsides with annual soil losses as high as 100Mt/ha47;
      (vi)    over- exploitation of native forests for fuel wood, with very little rehabilitation planting;


45 now referred to as the “Agriculture Administration “in Oecusse
46 Statement by a swidden farmer who was interviewed by the World Bank’s ZEESM team in November, 2014.
47 Source: DFAT’s Highland Agriculture and Social Development Project, Northern Thailand, Dr. Greg Wells pers. com. Research

  conducted by this project in the 1980s reported soil losses from swiddens of between 50 and 100 Mt/ha.




                                                            26
   (vii) increasingly variable rainfall patterns as El Niño and La Niña events become more frequent;
   (viii) over-cultivation of dry soils prior to planting in flatter areas which have access to mechanization
          services; and
   (ix) watershed degradation, and associated flooding and low basal stream flows for irrigation systems,
          due to catchment over-grazing and deforestation.

There are six basic land systems in Oecusse:
                                                      Figure 4.1: Burning to “Create Soil” in Oecusse
   (i)     irrigated land (mainly for paddy
           production) associated with the Tono
           and Natuka irrigation schemes - plus
           small areas of community irrigation
           schemes of less than 100 ha (see Table
           4.1);
   (ii)    rain fed maize production on alluvial
           flats along the north coast;
   (iii)   rain fed, swidden maize production on
           rolling inland hills;
   (iv)    over-grazed and denuded uplands
           which are exhausted and no longer
           suitable for rain fed agriculture;
   (v)     high and steep mountain areas with Source: Philip Young
           some remnant forests, but which are also grazed heavily and used as sources of fuel-wood; and
   (vi)    small areas of home gardens which grow mixed vegetables, and some fruit and other commercial
           trees.

Table 4.1 lists the estimated current land use in Oecusse, and with the associated photos, highlights that:

   (i)     thirty percent or 24,420 ha are classified as forest (Figure 4.2), of which 50% or 12,210 ha (15% of
           the total area) is degraded (Figure 4.3);
   (ii)    18,200 ha (29% of total area) are considered, by MAF, to be suitable for permanent arable irrigated
           or rain fed agriculture (Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5);
   (iii)   about 5,000 ha comprise towns and small villages, plus river beds and streams; and
   (iv)    the remainder (about 23,780 ha or 29%) is currently swidden farmland (Figure 4.6) and mixed free
           grazing on eroded hills and slopes (Figure 4.7).

There are nevertheless land use improvements and modified farming techniques and systems which
can be used in Oecusse which will increase agriculture production, for all land use systems. The
constraints imposed by the Zone’s small (in area), poor (low inherent fertility), and degraded (over-grazed and
over-burnt) natural resource base can be overcome by techniques to generate increased benefits from land,
the first of the natural and human resources listed above. These were factored into the farm production
modes when analyzing the two potential scenarios referred to above.

In addition there are small communal irrigation schemes scattered throughout the Zone, based on small
rivers, streams and springs. The current area irrigated is estimated to be about 2,140 ha 48, out of a MAF-
defined potential area of 5,700 ha. The irrigated areas in the four sub-districts are: (i) Pante Macassar - 1,578
ha (including most of the Tono Irrigation scheme); (ii) Nitibe - 317 ha; (iii) Oesilo - 161 ha; and (iv) Passabe -
84 ha. Another source of information on Oecusse’s irrigation resources is the recent ZEESM situation review
- Table 4.2 indicates a potential irrigated area of about 4,120 ha49.

The Tono scheme is being rehabilitated at a cost of about $10 million (funded by Government). This work is
not expected to increase the area irrigated. However, by providing increased water and more reliable supplies,
the refurbished scheme should impact on cropping intensities, crop diversification, and crop yields. The
Natuka scheme is functional but needs maintenance work on the intake system. Once these schemes are
functioning at design capacity it should be possible to substantially increase paddy production, provided: (i)
agronomic and farmer skills constraints are addressed; (ii) tube-wells and small pumps are used for
supplementary irrigation50; and (iii) there are markets for surplus products.

Bringing the remaining 1,980 ha of                Figure 4.8: Hydrograph for the Tono River
paddy land (4,120 ha less 2,140 ha)
into production could cost about
$12,000 per ha, which means that
production would be uneconomic51.
Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4.8
which is a hydrograph for the Tono
River developed in 2009, there may be
an insufficient basal stream flow for
second season cropping because the
water requirement is greater than the
discharge in the dry season. In this
event, the use of tube-wells and small
pumps will become even more critical
for the economic viability of river
based irrigation schemes. Water
deficiencies in the dry season are likely
to be even more severe now, because
the Tono watershed has been further               Source: Source: CWN’s 2009 Report on Irrigation Feasibility for MAF

4.2.3 Forest Resources

Oecusse’s forest resources are under severe stress, with 50% of the forested area degraded through
over-harvesting for timber and fuel wood (and little re-planting) and uncontrolled grazing by
ruminants - See Table 4.1. This resource has very limited remaining potential which might be expressed
through a managed forest harvesting program. As the OADP elaborates below, the only development option
for this class of natural resource is large-scale re-forestation using mixed hardwood timber and agro-forestry
species. This will require substantial private and public sector investment, and committed participation by
communal land owners.

4.2.4 Farming Households

Crops and Populations

MAF estimates that the total area cropped each year in Oecusse (irrigated and dryland mixed crops,
but excluding tree crops) is about 7,000 ha (2,140 ha of irrigation and 4,860 ha of rain fed crop). Table
4.4 lists the number of rural households who grow various crops and raise livestock in Oecusse, and shows
that most households grow a wide range of crops (e.g. 78% grow rice52 and 81% grow maize, the latter as a
risk management strategy). There are no figures on specific areas of different crops but a good “rule of
thumb” is that one family can only manage a maximum of about 0.7 ha of annual crop due to family labor

52   Note: this figure seems to be very high given that there are only about 2,000 ha of functional irrigation in Oecusse.

on crop areas, the remaining analyses are based on these figures.

Oecusse’s farmers are unlikely to perform better than other farmers in Timor-Leste (in terms of crop,
livestock and labor productivity, although it is difficult to compare the skills levels and agriculture
productivity of Oecusse’s farmers with other farming communities in Timor-Leste. However there are no
indications (in terms of crop yields, livestock productivity, sustainable land management, etc.) that Oecusse’s
farmers are any better than other rural communities in Timor-Leste. In other words, the Zone is not
“blessed” with a special group of progressive and innovative farmers. In fact the opposite is probably the case
– Oecusse’s farmers are conservative survivors in a harsh environment and therefore will need special
support if they are to change into “modern farmers”.

improved at the same rate as the rest of the
country.

Malnutrition in Oecusse is also severe by Source: Regional Profile of Poverty, TLSLS, 2007
national standards54, indicating the need for a strong focus in the OADP on human nutrition
thorough increased production of nutritious foods. In 2009, 68% of children in Oecusse were stunted,
ranked fourth worst in the country, whereas in 2013 58% of children were stunted, ranked third worst.
Oecusse ranks highest terms of children underweight - 63% in 2009 and 50% in 2013. And similarly, Oecusse
ranks highest in terms of wasted children - 27% in 2009 and 20% in 2013. Whilst there has been some
improvement in these figures over the past five years, it is the relativity of these figures which is of the most
concern for Oecusse.

4.2.5 Livestock Populations
Despite high livestock populations relative to other parts of the country, Oecusse has small livestock
populations in absolute terms, and the numbers of livestock per rural households are also low (Table
4.4). For example, there are only about 18,350 large ruminants (cattle and buffalo) which might produce a
turn-off of about 2,000 head for sale each year; and, on average households which have cattle and/or buffalo
only own three head per household. This low production base means that there is currently limited potential
for increased beef production in Oecusse. However, the OADP suggests options to overcome this limitation.

4.2.6 Public Sector Resources and Budgets

Extension Services
The Oecusse agriculture administration has sufficient staff, but inadequate budget to deliver
necessary services. The Agriculture Administration’s Oecusse office currently employs 117 permanent and
20 temporary public servants. The majority are not technically qualified; 89 staff (65%) are only secondary
school graduates. This level of staff resources is more than adequate to service about 10,000 rural households,
but as shown in Table 4.5, MAF’s 2014 budget for Oecusse (before the independent Zone was announced)
was only $363,000, with 72% allocated to wages - leaving only 28% or about $100,000 for sectoral
development work (about $10 per rural household). Admittedly this budget figure is for the “pre-ZEESM”
situation but it is a reflection of just how little public sector investment there currently is in Oecusse’s

operational budget is likely to be about $250,000 - or 2.5 % per annum of the investment cost ($10 million).

Production Inputs
The national agricultural budget is inadequate to honour the government’s commitment to free
production inputs, especially fertilizer, for all farmers in Timor-Leste. The Ministry’s annual operating
and salaries budget is about $27 million55. Government policy is to provide 100% subsidized fertilizer, which
at a cost of $450/Mt CIF means that the Agriculture Administration in Oecusse could only supply 56 Mt per
year if 25% of its annual goods and services budget is allocated to fertilizer. This would be sufficient for
about 280 ha at an application rate of 200 kg/ha, when there are about 7,000 ha of annual crop grown each
year in Oecusse. Donors (DFAT/ACIAR Seeds of Life (SoL)) have established a national seed system from
which MAF buys certified seed for subsidized distribution to farmers. This system extends to Oecusse. In
summary, Oecusse’s Agriculture Administration’s current budget situation only allows the Ministry to
purchase and distribute a very small fraction of the crop production inputs needed if the full demand was to
be met.

Buildings and Other Facilities

Administrative building and facilities are adequate. MAF recently (prior to the ZEESM announcement)
constructed a substantial office complex on the outskirts of Pante Macassar at a cost of nearly $1.0 million.
This is more than adequate as a base for sectoral development under ZEESM. In addition, there are unused
MAF-funded buildings, such as the large warehouse near Citrana and the livestock training centre near
Maquelab, which could be used as the basis for farmer and staff training under an expanded ZEESM-funded
OADP. These currently unused facilities (the latter two) were constructed using Referendum Budget funds
and would require refurbishment as the quality of original construction was poor - see

4.2.7 Connectivity

All farming operations in Oecusse are
severely constrained by poorly maintained
roads and bridges; plus the lack of a
commercial-scale port. The rural roads
focused DFAT/ILO sponsored Roads for
Development Program (R4D) was operational
in Oecusse but has been suspended since the
Special Zone was formally announced. It will
be important for the new ZEESM authority to
                                                               Source: Philip Young
re-start this essential connectivity program.                  Figure 4.11: Faulty Roof Beam in MAF Warehouse
Phone access in rural areas is reasonable, but
local markets are very basic.

4.2.8 Support from Civil Society

Oecusse’s rural communities are currently
receiving considerable support from
national and international NGOs, and
more broadly, the Church. This is a sound
base on which to build agriculture
development programs for isolated and poor
villages, as these NGOs and the Church have
established positions of trust. There are some
good examples of aldeias slowly changing their Source: Philip Young
resource use practices in Oecusse following prolonged receipt of support from civil society, and these are a
good start in terms of improved natural resource management practices.

4.2.9 Social Cohesion

Another positive characteristic of Oecusse’s rural communities is their very high level of social
cohesion, compared with some other districts in Timor-Leste. Much of this has been built with support
from World Neighbours (during the late 1990s) and other NGOs such as Oxfam which have dedicated local
staff who are trained in community facilitation and building social capital. Good examples are the savings and
loans funds which are now directly operated by recipient communities following initial support in the form of
Grameen Bank- type loans56.

Having assessed agriculture’s natural, human and physical resources in in Oecusse, the analysis
now turns to the first two of three value chain analyses, namely the current production situation,
without interventions, and the potential production situation, with better production practices for

existing crop and livestock products. Note that the third value chain analysis which focuses on the
OADP includes a range of cash and timber crops which are not included in the first two analyses

4.3 Existing Agriculture Production: What are the main products produced in
Oecusse and what are the production costs?
4.3.1 Introduction

This section outlines the current levels of agriculture production in Oecusse (for existing products) and
calculates corresponding production costs - the latter with the objective of determining: (i) if Oecusse’s
agriculture sector is currently competitive (the Current Situation) in terms of potentially exporting surplus
products; and (ii) if, improved production practices are introduced (the Potential Situation) would this make
the Zone internationally competitive? This section does not analyze the likely impact of an OADP on the
sector - this topic is covered in Section 4.6 of this chapter.

4.3.2 Crop Production

Farmers’ in Oecusse focus on a variety of subsistence crops rather than a few crops for commercial
sale. The two most important staple crops produced in Oecusse are maize and rice. However most rural
households typically grow multiple and mixed crops to meet their subsistent consumption requirements and
to manage climate risk. According to the 2010 Census (Table 4.4), the majority of households produce some
rice, maize, cassava, vegetables, fruit, and coconuts. This suggests that very few households concentrate on
any one product for commercial sale, and that transforming the sector into more commercial agriculture
(particularly for export) will require major changes in practices and attitudes by rural communities.

Current Maize Area and Production

Crop production and yield statistics in Oecusse are only available for maize and rice and show that
Oecusse is the sixth largest maize producer in Timor-Leste. Table 4.6 lists maize production (total Mt,
Mt/ha and Mt/hh) by district and shows that if Oecusse’s 2014 maize yield and production figures are
ignored57 then Oecusse ranks as the sixth largest maize producer in Timor-Leste - an average of 6,500 Mt per
year, 2.36 Mt/ha and 0.58 Mt/hh. Note that these production figures do not allow for 30% storage losses, or
the requirement for retained seed.

 There are major inconsistencies in Oecusse’s maize production and area figures. Table 4.7 lists
estimated maize production potential (ha), past cropped area (ha) and past cropped area (ha/hh) by District
for Timor-Leste. Using MAF’s figures for 2012-2014, it seems that Oecusse’s annual average maize
production area is only about 2,480 ha, at a very small average of 0.22 ha/hh. The latter figure seems to be
very low when most upland cropping families usually grow about 0.7 ha of maize garden per year.

Oecusse produces less food than it consumes but growing imports are difficult to estimate given
informal border trade. A reasonable estimate of annual total rice (not paddy) and maize production in
Oecusse (after allowing for storage losses and seed retention) is about 8,500 Mt, which is less than domestic

demand based on a population of 70,000 - estimated to be 14,700 Mt. This shortfall in staple food production
is met through rice imports (about 6,000 Mt of rice per year) and consumption of other staples such as
cassava and sweet potato. Note however, that attempting to balance the accounting staple food demand and
supply numbers in Oecusse is very difficult because of informal sales over the Indonesian border, and very
unreliable agriculture statistics on cropped areas and crop production. Therefore the only reasonable
conclusion is that staple and other food imports are used to balance demand and supply, and that as the
economy under ZEESM grows, it will be necessary to either grow or import more food, and more varied
food in response to the demand for more varied diets.

Potential Maize Production Area

A possible surplus of maize could be fed to non-ruminant livestock if Oecusse’s population switches
to consuming more rice. Oecusse’s potential maize production area is variously reported by MAF to be
between 19,435 ha (Figure 4.7) and 12,500 ha (Figure 4.1) and is another indication of how inconsistent base-
line data makes agriculture development planning in Timor-Leste so difficult and inaccurate. At present, only
13% of the theoretical maximum area of maize (19,435 ha) is being cropped, or 20% if the lower figure of
12,500 ha is used. This indicates considerable potential for expanded maize production. However a “note of
caution” is warranted as once the demand for maize as a staple food is met, incremental production will have
little marginal value as there is a strong trend (throughout Timor-Leste) for changed staple food consumption
patterns - with a switch from maize to rice as imported, cheap and sometimes subsidized supplies of the latter
increase. Under this scenario, “surplus” maize, which could not compete on international markets due to
uncompetitive freight rates (even with a new port in Oecusse - see Table 4.16) would have to be value-added
by feeding to non-ruminant livestock.

Potential Rice (Paddy) Production Area

Potential increased rice production depends on the possibility of supplementing river based
irrigation with tube wells and small pumps (TWSPs). This is because even after the Tono irrigation
scheme has been refurbished (worked commenced in 2015), there will be insufficient water for 100% second
cropping - see Figure 4.8. MAF’s estimates of the potential paddy production area in Oecusse also vary
considerably, from about 2,000 ha (current annual average area cropped in 2012-2014) to 5,700 ha (potential)
(MAF,




                                                     41
Table 4.9: Paddy Potential Production (ha), Cropped Area (ha) and Cropped Area (ha/hh) by District

) and 4,120 ha (ZEESM, Table 4.2). These estimates need to be considered in the context of declining basal
river flows due to land degradation and varying rainfall patterns, which mean that whilst suitable land
resources for paddy production may be available, associated and critical water resources may not be available,
at least in the longer-term. Until test drilling has been completed (with the objective of supplying irrigation
water from TWSPs for supplementary irrigation) it is impossible to estimate the potential area of irrigation in
Oecusse.

The above analyses suggest that there may be greater potential for increased maize, rather than paddy
production in Oecusse (in terms of area potential - a total of about 12,500 ha for maize compared with maybe
4,500 ha for paddy). However, market demand is a more important determining factor than simply the
potential land area. And it is important to note that these crops are not necessarily mutually exclusive as
maize can be grown successfully on land with access to supplementary irrigation water.

4.3.4 Livestock

Current Production

Oecusse has small populations of mixed livestock species which are kept for home consumption
(and asset accumulation) and social and religious purposes - see Table 4.4 for numbers. There are small
sales to Dili (mainly cattle) and in Pante Macassar, and some illegal sales to West Timor but the majority of
livestock products are consumed locally and not recorded as “official” sales. There are no official estimates of
livestock production in Oecusse (in terms of Mt of beef, pork and chicken meat, etc.) but it is possible to
calculate an approximate figure from first principles. Table 4.10 indicates that total annual meat production
in Oecusse (of all types) could be about 875 Mt, perhaps valued at about $7.0 million.

Livestock Potential

Livestock potential is less than commonly perceived because of low base levels of livestock numbers.
There is a common perception that Oecusse has great potential for increased cattle production, in part
because Oecusse has about 10% of Timor-Leste’s cattle herd. However, this base herd size is so small (only
18,350 cattle and buffalo) that even if productivity (turnoff percent) increased by 50% (from 15% to 22.5%)
total annual beef production would only be 363 Mt, an increase of just 121 Mt valued at less than $1.0


                                                      42
million. Furthermore, even if much-improved cattle production systems were introduced as part of an OADP
(see OADP Section 4.6 below), it would take at least 10 years for the base cattle and buffalo herd to double in
size. This initial analysis indicates that care needs to be taken when predicting how Oecusse’s livestock
industry might contribute to the Zone’s future economic growth. And these preliminary figures have not
factored in the need for improved and more diligent livestock quarantine services.

4.3.5 Forestry and Fisheries

Forestry

There is currently no commercial production of forestry products in Oecusse, but significant
potential exists. The Prince Albert Foundation operates a small nursery and the Agriculture Administration’s
Oecusse complex has non-functional seedling production shade-houses. Apart from NGO- and Church-
supported community operated nurseries, there is very little activity in this sub-sector. Historically,
sandalwood was produced in Oecusse and it was this product which first attracted the Portuguese. This
suggests that there may be potential to re-introduce sandalwood production in Oecusse. In addition,
experience in other districts, mainly from Portuguese supported programs61, indicates considerable potential
for high value hard-wood production in Oecusse, provided free-roaming livestock are controlled and farmers
are assisted with seedling production.

There is also considerable potential for various types of agro-forestry production systems using results
from ACIAR’s extensive work in West Timor and Eastern Indonesia. And Oecusse itself has developed a
Sesbania-based swidden cropping system which would be sustainable if residues were not burnt. Figure 4.13
shows a cleared and burnt area of Sesbania (fore-ground) and a remaining three-year old Sesbania “forest”
(background), plus a fence which has been constructed from Sesbania poles. This system warrants further
consideration as it could be an important part of an OADP. And as shown in Table 4.1, Oecusse has a large
area of land (33,800 ha) which is currently degraded and farmed in an unsustainable way, but some of which
could be restored through the introduction of agro-forestry production systems based on multi-purpose tree
legumes and more productive tethered ruminant livestock production.

Another important but non-quantified forest-based product in Oecusse is domestic fuel-wood - see
Figure 4.14. If there are 10,000 rural households in Oecusse and each burn 10 kg of wood per day62, this
means that the annual harvest of fuel wood is about 36,500 Mt. If valued at $0.50/kg this fuel has a financial
value of $18.25 million, far in excess of the value of livestock produced by indiscriminating grazing of the
same resource. A figure of this size indicates considerable potential for fuel-wood based agro-forestry
production systems.

Fisheries

There is limited traditional fishing for local consumption, and fisheries is beyond the scope of this
analysis. Fisheries is very small-scale partly because many people in Oecusse do not eat fish for traditional
reasons, and because the marine sector has not been scoped in terms of resources. Whether there is potential
for significant fishing operations in Oecusse’s waters and whether this would be culturally acceptable as a
source of employment, requires further analysis, as does quantification of sustainable marine fish resources.
Therefore the fisheries sector has been excluded from further analysis because so little is known about
sustainable marine resources, or the level of exploitation by neighboring countries.

4.3.6 Crop and Livestock Production Costs

This analysis of the current and potential costs of and benefits from crop and livestock production in
Oecusse considers financial and economic costs63. Financial costs are farmers’ direct cash costs and do
not include an allowance for the “cost” of family labor (but hired labor is costed). Economic costs are
expressed in terms of costs to the country, and include “over-head” or non-farm public sector costs which
are incurred in the form of extension services, etc.; plus the opportunity cost of family labor, the cost of
maintaining public sector assets such as irrigation schemes, and the opportunity cost of public sector funds
invested in irrigation infrastructure.

Tables are available on request to show how financial and economic production costs, product gross margins,
and returns to family labor, for Oecusse’s current main agriculture products (crops and lives tock species)
were calculated. The results are summarized below in




63Note: this analysis does not include the suggested OADP. It only focuses on current crop and livestock products and not those
 included in the OADP analysis in Section 4.6.

Table 4.11: Cost of Crop Production and Returns to Family Labor in Oecusse

 (for crop products) and Table 4.12 (for livestock products). These tables were prepared with the objective of
demonstrating how commodity costs of production could vary if currently available improved production
technologies were implemented, and also how families’ rural incomes might also vary. Note that these figures
are based on simple static models.

Table 4.11: Cost of Crop Production and Returns to Family Labor in Oecusse

 lists the following figures for irrigated paddy, rain fed maize, irrigated legumes, and irrigated vegetables: (i)
cost of farm inputs ($/ha); (ii) gross margins per ha ($/ha); (iii) gross margin per family labor day ($/day);
(iv) crop production (Mt); (v) crop production costs ($/Mt); (vi) incremental public sector economic costs
($/Mt); and (vii) total crop production costs ($/Mt) – in farm-gate financial and economic values64, for the
“Current Situation” and the “Potential Situation”. These figures should be considered as preliminary as those
products selected for inclusion in the OADP will be subjected to more rigorous Benefit/Cost Analyses, and
in various combinations to reflect mixed farming situations, rather than mono-cropping. In addition, the
importance of Oecusse’s agriculture sector as a major employer needs to be factored into any forward plans.

Table 4.11: Cost of Crop Production and Returns to Family Labor in Oecusse

 shows that for all main food crops (other than vegetables) the farm-gate economic cost of production would
decline under the OADP situation. For example, the cost of producing paddy would fall from $415/Mt to
$357/Mt, and the corresponding figures for maize would be $688/Mt to $442/Mt. The reason why the cost
of producing vegetables does not decline is the high labor inputs required for this crop - and the relatively low
labor productivity.

Livestock Production Costs

Table 4.12 lists the same cost of production figures for the main livestock products raised in Oecusse, and as
with food crops, the change in production costs under the “potential” situation varies, depending on the
opportunity cost of family labor and family labor productivity. For example, if improved production systems
are used, the farm-gate economic cost of producing beef would decline slightly (from $7,700/Mt to
$6,700/Mt), whereas the cost of producing chicken would increase from $4,800/Mt to $6,200/Mt.

Household Incomes and Poverty Reduction

An unpublished study that uses Oecusse’s Tono scheme as a case study shows that farmer incomes
can be trebled if known and proven improved production techniques and systems are used. In 2014
the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)65 commissioned a study on rural incomes
from Timor-Leste’s farms which use rice-based farming systems (RBFSs). The results were not published as
DFAT decided not to proceed with further investigation of possible support programs for this sub-sector.
However they are very relevant to Oecusse and ZEESM as the Tono River irrigation system was used as a
case study. Table 4.13 summarizes the results from this informative exercise and shows (for five different
models with varying combinations of different crop and livestock products) that:

      (i)     under the current situation (Model 1) farmers with access to irrigation are probably earning about
              $800 per year - a very small figure when family sizes are about five persons;
      (ii)    earnings per year per family could increase to about $1,630 (average for models 2 and 3 in Table
              4.13) assuming partial adoption of improved technologies - a doubling of net income; and
      (iii)   earnings per year per family could increase to about $3,020 (average for models 4 and 5 in Table
              4.13) assuming further adoption of improved technologies - more than a trebling of annual income
              through the adoption of known and proven agriculture production technologies.

The DFAT work did not design and analyze rain fed, upland cropping models based on maize production.
However given that rain fed yields are generally much less than irrigated yields, and scavenging livestock have
much less to eat on rain fed farms, it is not unreasonable to conclude that farm incomes from swidden-based
rain fed farms would be about 50% of the incomes reported for farms using RBFSs.

Note that the figures in Table 4.13 and Table 4.11 are not directly comparable as Table 4.11 is based on
simple 1 ha individual crop models, whereas Table 4.13 is based on various combinations of crop and
livestock models to form whole farm models.

Food Production and Nutrition

The study also showed that Oecusse farmers should be able to treble food production. The same
modelling referred to above was also used to estimate how food production (and the mix of foods - staples,
vegetables/legumes and livestock/fish) might change under the same scenarios. The results are show in Table
4.14 and in summary show that for RBFSs it should be possible for Oecusse’s rural households to increase
food production by more than three times, and at the same time to improve farm-level supplies of more
nutritious food. Note however the need to balance this possibility against limited domestic demand for food
in Oecusse and to avoid over-supply situations for commodities which cannot be exported - see later for
more on this important proviso.

Oecusse’s Competitiveness for Agriculture Products

None of Oecusse’s existing commodities can currently compete in the international export market.
Table 4.15 lists the cost of importing meat (beef, mutton, pork and chicken) and grain products (rice, maize
and legumes [soybean]) into Oecusse (import parity price). These are CIF Pante Macassar prices based on
current international FOB prices, plus the addition of estimated sea freight costs to determine approximate
CIF prices landed Oecusse.

Table 4.16 lists calculated export parity prices for the same products for two scenarios: (i) Current Situation;
and (ii) Potential Situation, with the latter based on assumed productivity increases following the application
of known technologies. These figures are summarized in Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16, and show that Oecusse
cannot compete on the international export market for any of the seven existing agriculture products which
were reviewed.




                                                         52
The simplest way to compare these figures is to consider the ratio of export to import prices (see
column 8 in red font, Table 4.16 - for the current situation). The only product currently grown in Oecusse
which is even marginally competitive is pork (ratio of 1.2:1). The equivalent ratios for all other products
currently grown in Oecusse are in excess of 2:1 or about equal to 2:1, and confirm that it is currently
impossible for Oecusse-grown agriculture products to compete on international markets.

Searching for Answers - Reduced Labor Costs and Increased Productivity

Cost of Labor

Even under the potential situation scenario (bottom half of Table 4.16) which assumes the
application of improved production technologies, it seems that Oecusse would not be a competitive
exporter of agriculture products, perhaps with the exception of soybean and maize (ratios of 1.5:1 and
1.3:1, respectively). However it is difficult to envisage a situation in which Oecusse could reduce the costs of
production for these two commodities by between 50% and 30%, respectively.

One of the main reasons for this lack of competitiveness is the high cost of hired labor, the labor
intensive nature of improved agriculture production systems, and the relatively high opportunity cost
of family labor. The estimated Oecusse economic export prices listed in Table 4.16 are based on a farm
family labor opportunity cost of $2.50 per day, and a hired labor cost of $5.00per day. If the opportunity cost
of family labor is increased to $5.00 per day (about the current unskilled daily wage rate) then Oecusse’s
economic export prices for its agriculture products increase considerably, and make the Zone’s agriculture
products even more uncompetitive on international markets. However, if this cost is reduced to about $1.50
per day (in line with potentially competing countries) Oecusse’s agriculture sector would be more competitive
- see Table 4.17 for details. However, this wage rate is well below half the legislated national minimum wage.

Productivity

Soybean and maize were selected for further tests of the productivity increases required for
international competitiveness. Another way to “test” the potential competitiveness of Oecusse’s
agriculture sector is to calculate the productivity increases required for competitiveness (at the current
US$2.50 daily opportunity cost of family labor) and to then ask the question, “given the current state of technology
adoption in the Zone, and given that improved production packages are available from other parts of Timor-Leste (and nearby
countries), is it a realistic to assume that Oecusse might become competitive if the Zone introduced and farmers adopted these
technical packages?”

The analysis completed to test this “hypothesis” for soybean and maize (the two products listed in Table 4.16
which might have some chance of becoming internationally competitive with the adoption of improved
technologies, and for which there are no health or quarantine issues, as is the case for livestock-based
products [e.g. pork]), is summarized in Table 4.18.

However even if price competitive, product volumes may not be large enough for export. Price
competitiveness is not the only criteria for export success - the other is export volumes and shipping
efficiency. This means that even if Oecusse’s export prices were competitive, it is doubtful if annual volumes
of surplus product would be sufficient to enable (say) 5,000 Mt ships to operate out of a new port at Pante
Macassar on (say) a monthly basis.



                                                             53
Considering the case of soybean - even if every ha of irrigated land in Oecusse (about 4,000 ha maximum
potential (Table 4.2) grew irrigated legumes, total annual production might be about 5,000 Mt66. If 50% is
exported, this represents half a ship load, per year. This means that the stated ZEESM objective of “filling
empty container ships leaving a new port in Pante Macassar with surplus products” needs to be revisited.

The same argument applies to the other “marginally” competitive crop product - maize. Current production
is about 5,600 Mt per annum for a demand of about 6,300 Mt (see Table 4.24). In 10 years’ time production
could be as high as 14,380 Mt for a demand (for human and livestock food) of about 11,530 Mt67. This
equates to a small surplus of about 2,850 Mt, or about half of one 5,000 Mt ship.

4.4 Constraints to Existing Production: What are the primary constraints to
expansion of agriculture production in Oecusse?
Section 4.2 discusses constraints to increasing agriculture production in Oecusse. These vary from product to
product. With a poor natural resource base being the over-riding issue, these constraints include: (i) poor and
limited land and water resources; (ii) denuded and over-grazed forest resources; (iii) small farming households
which face labor constraints; (iv) small livestock populations with low turn-off rates; (v) limited public sector
resources and budgets; and (vi) poor connectivity. These “negatives” are to some extent offset by good
support from civil society and strong social cohesion. This section, considers the cross-cutting issues which
are affecting all types of agriculture production in Oecusse.

4.4.1 Agriculture Scale and Aggregation Problems

With the exception of irrigated paddy, agriculture production in Oecusse is widely scattered across
diverse farming systems. This situation is not conducive to efficient collection and aggregation of
marketable surpluses, and results in high freight costs and transit losses. There is an argument in support of
some form of product zonation to address this constraint but poor and subsistence farmers are not attracted
to such “formal” industry structures - and these farmers address risk and adversity by growing a diverse range
of crop and livestock products. However MAF is currently trialing a “One-Village-One-Product” or Centur
Dezenvovimentu Communidade Agrikola (CDCA) project in 40 sucos. If results are promising then this
approach to agriculture production is an option worthy of consideration for Oecusse. In this event is would
be important to heed lessons and results from this national trial.

4.4.2 Access to Land for “Commercial” Agriculture

In the absence of a land law, commercial agriculture production risks remain high and a major
disincentive. All land in Oecusse is unofficially held by farmers under custodial laws and regulations. This
means that even if local communities are amenable to (say) commercial investment in long-term forestry,
there is no legal basis on which land can be leased or rented for this purpose. This situation is undoubtedly a
constraint to agriculture sector investment on broader and more commercial scales, and probably means that:
(i) at least in the short-term, investment will be based on small family-owned farms of about 1 ha; and (ii)
investors are likely to be local farming communities and their members. In other words, Oecusse is faced
with an inefficient and scattered agriculture development scenario for the time-being; unless an equitable
Oecusse-specific land law can be promulgated as part of the Zone’s special circumstances.

4.4.3 Skills and Techniques

The primary constraint to increased agriculture production is a lack of knowledge of modern
production techniques, and the technical capacity to use these techniques. The majority of farmers in
Oecusse use traditional farming techniques, hence there is considerable room for improvement in terms of
yields and product quality. In particular, slash and burn agriculture (swidden) is still the norm for non-
irrigated areas (Figure 4.5). This results in significant soil erosion and fertility decline. Selective use of
biological terracing and conservation agriculture techniques (as proven in the Raumoco watershed in Lautem,
and elsewhere by FAO) are examples of improved agriculture production techniques which would increase
productivity and protect Oecusse’s agriculture environment.



                                                       58
At present farmers in Oecusse rely on two main sources of improved production technology, from:
(i) the Agriculture Administration’s limited extension services; and (ii) NGOs and the Church - and
there is scope for a more commercial approach. The Agriculture Administration is not functioning well
(see Section 4.2.6) but it is unrealistic to assume that in the future (when ZEESM is being implemented) that
civil society might be responsible for this vital service. Therefore there is a need for ZEESM planners to
make a fundamental decision - should the Agriculture Administration be supported and resourced to the level
where it is capable of servicing Oecusse’s rural communities as mandated, or should Oecusse as a Special
Economic Zone experiment with new approach: a farmer-driven and farmer-paid extension service, and
production inputs supply system? This question will need to be resolved as the outcome will determine how
Oecusse’s agriculture sector is supported in the future68.

4.4.4 Availability of Quality Inputs

An existing donor program can help distribute higher quality and improved varieties of seed and
planting materials. Until recently a lack of access to high yielding crop varieties was a major constraint to
increased agriculture production in Oecusse. However SoL has established a national seed system which now
services the whole of Timor-Leste. Therefore there is no reason why Oecusse cannot access improved
varieties of all the main food crops (rice, maize, cassava, sweet potato and peanut). The Agriculture
Administration needs to organize the importation of seed and planting materials into Oecusse, and to then
distribute these improved varieties as soon as possible. In addition, SoL will assist Oecusse to overcome Rice
Tungro Bacilliform Virus (RTBV) which causes stunted growth in the preferred mamramo rice variety69, by
assisting with the importation of clean seed from Maliana in 2015.

Inorganic fertilizers are essential to boost production, although this will come at the cost of organic
accreditation. The main required input which is in very short supply, and which is not provided by the
Agriculture Administration, is inorganic fertilizer (N, P and K) for rice and maize production - the latter on
the more fertile alluvial plains. Crop yields in Oecusse will remain well below international levels unless
inorganic fertilizer is used on a commercial basis. The application of small tonnages (about 1 Mt/ha for
paddy) of compost will make very little difference. Large scale organic crop production is not economically
viable, simply because adequate supplies of organic fertilizer are not available. However if a “political”
decision is made to declare Oecusse an “Organic Zone”, such an outcome will condemn the Zone to low
crop production forever70.

4.4.5 On-farm Storage

An existing donor/MAF program to reduce post-harvest losses of maize can be expanded quickly. A
lack of effective grain storage options often results in significant losses, particularly for maize. An
International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) funded study completed by the University of Timor
Lorosae (UNTL) in 2013 and 2104 found that 30% of maize production is lost in storage due to weevils and


68  Note: the ODAP outlined in Section 4.6 assumes that agriculture extension services will be provided by a strengthened and
  resourced Oecusse Agriculture Administration.
69 Which sells for about $1,000/Mt (grain) in Pante Macassar.
70 Note: if the correct application of compost per ha (10 Mt/ha) was applied across all farming land in Oecusse, there would be an

  annual requirement for about 70,000 Mt of compost. And the use of animal manure in compost is impossible as ruminants are free-
  grazing. Therefore from an agronomic point of view it is not logical to consider declaring Oecusse as an “Organic Zone”.




                                                               59
rats71. IFAD has supported the provision of airtight 200 liter fuel drums to households in five targeted
districts in the east of the country and these reduce annual maize losses down to about 5%. To-date there are
very few of these drums in Oecusse but there is no reason why ZEESM could not fund an Oecusse-specific
Maize Storage Project. Ensuring that farmers can store produce, and therefore smooth-out consumption72,
would significantly improve the amount of food available for consumption and/or sale. In summary, use of
drums to store maize reduces the economic cost of producing maize grain from $688/Mt to $442/Mt.

4.4.6 Irrigation

The World Bank and Ministry of Finance recently undertook73 pre-refurbishment appraisal
evaluations of seven large irrigation schemes in Timor-Leste, including Tono in Oecusse. The
conclusions are shown in Table 4.19. In summary, Timor-Leste’s current irrigation strategy will not generate
acceptable returns on investment in the sub-sector. There is a belief in Timor-Leste that increased irrigation is
the key to producing rice at a competitive price and overcoming the need to import about 80,000 Mt of rice
per year. In theory, and if cropping intensities and yields were sufficiently high as a result of increased and
more reliable supplies of irrigation water, and there were good domestic markets for surplus paddy, this
would be the case. However, this is currently not the case in Timor-Leste and therefore investment in
irrigation rehabilitation is generating negative rates of return.

This result is because investment costs ($/ha rehabilitated) are very high by world standards and
marginal rates of return are low. The latter are due to low yields and cropping intensities, and low
farm-gate prices - the latter reflecting limited domestic markets. The current approach of focusing
exclusively on investments in irrigation hardware (river diversion weirs) and not on investments in
complementary software (farmer services, production inputs and market support) is considered to be
unsustainable. This approach will not result in the production of a sufficiently large volume of rice to justify
the large investments in physical infrastructure, nor will it result in reduced dependency on imported rice to
feed the nation.

The joint Infrastructure Public Expenditure Review report proposes an alternative hybrid irrigation
strategy which builds on past investments in physical infrastructure, and at the same time generates
high returns on marginal investment in tube-well irrigation systems, and in farmer support services
and market development programs. For this strategy to succeed, Government will need to be prepared to
redirect planned capital budgets for the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes to targeted increases in MAF and
Ministry of Commerce Industry and Environment (MCIE) budgets to enable increased expenditure on: (i)
two “software” packages - subsidized inputs and strengthened extension services; (ii) investment in TWSPs;
and (iii) development of domestic rice markets.

Implications for Oecusse

A policy change is required if the current rehabilitation of the Tono irrigation scheme in Oecusse is
to be economically viable. Tube wells and small pumps need to be tested to supply incremental irrigation
water when basal flows in the Tono River decline in the dry season - as shown in Figure 4.8.

Oecusse) both over-lie large aquifers (see Oecusse insert on the map). These areas are considered to have
good potential for TWSPs irrigation systems which have potential to complement Weir-Based River
Diversion (WBRD) irrigation systems.

The irrigation analysis referred to above concluded that TWSPs might complement WBRDs, and
that additional farmer support would further increase the impact of additional water. The Benefit to
Cost Ratio (BCR) from investing in irrigation infrastructure for a 1,000 ha scheme would improve from a low
0.24 to an reasonable 0.73 (at a 10% discount rate) under this scenario; and the returns from incremental
investment in TWSPs and “software packages” would be high (a BCR of 1.50). Figure 4.18 is a bar chart
which illustrates how these figures relate to one another. In other words, by building on the sunk costs of
WBRD irrigation systems, an investment in complementary TWSPs and software of approximately $12.3m
would generate benefits of $18.4m, implying a BCR of 1.5 for this additional and complementary investment.

Conclusions on Irrigation

ZEESM proponents will need to take these findings into account when planning agriculture investment
programs. The approach should be a “balanced one” in which any additional investment in irrigation
hardware (WBRD systems) is complemented with investment in all three essential “software” packages: (i)
TWSPs; (ii) market development and support; and (iii) provision of extension and production input
packages..

4.4.7 Roaming Livestock

Oecusse’s livestock need to be tethered as current free grazing causes major damage to all crops (and
regenerating forests, and planted seedlings) and is frequently cited as a significant problem by farmers.
Culturally, there is a view in Oecusse that fences and other barriers should not be required. Additionally,
existing efforts to construct fences around large gardens have resulted in accelerated deforestation. An
alternative approach therefore should be to shift towards zero-grazing systems in which cattle/buffalo and
goats/sheep are tethered and provided with basic shelter and water, and fed using cut-and-carry agro-forestry
fodder management systems. This would substantially reduce the need for fencing and reduce the damage
caused by free roaming ruminants.

Moving away from this practice will be challenging but there are some good examples in Oecusse and other
parts of Timor-Leste where small communities (with assistance from NGOs and donors) have promulgated
local tara bundu which govern where and how livestock can be grazed. Caritas has some good examples of this
management system in Oecusse, and another (larger) example can be found in seven sucos in the sub-district
of Raumoco in Lautem where all forms of livestock grazing have been banned74. The result has been a
substantial increase in crop and livestock production - the former because of reduced crop damage, and the
latter because under-nourished livestock are no longer required to use most of their daily energy intake for
mobility, meaning that productivity (weight gain, etc.) increases.

4.4.8 Lack of Reliable Planning Data

The Oecusse administration should consider strengthening the collection of agricultural statistics,
possibly with an agricultural census. Oecusse (and all of Timor-Leste) suffers from a lack of reliable
agriculture statistics and planning information. The foregoing comments on areas of agriculture potential for
Oecusse’ major crops are good examples. In the short-term, and until an agriculture census is conducted, little
can be done to counter this major issue, other than to work from first principles and base production
estimates on family labor profiles and the constraints associated with this resource which determine cropped
areas. Alternatively, and in the interest of an efficient ZEESM planning process for Oecusse’s agriculture
sector, it may be logical to conduct an Oecusse-specific agriculture census.

4.5 Factor Costs: How hard is it for Oecusse to be competitive?
Factor costs are a key determinant of the competitiveness of any region and the success of SEZs. In
South East Asia most prospective foreign investors have a number of different of locations to choose from.
Special Economic Zones are also increasingly common in many countries – there are over 3,000 SEZs

74   Assisted by SoL through DFAT.




                                                      64
worldwide – so whilst infrastructure and fiscal incentives can play a part, basic factor costs will always be a
key element of any investment decision.75 Timor-Leste as a whole has high factor costs relative to its
neighbors. As Table 4.21 indicates, Timor has higher labor, capital, transport, and power costs than Vietnam
and Indonesia.

The main factor costs for the agriculture sector are labor and inputs (seed and fertilizer) as land is
virtually free. In addition, rain and oxygen are free inputs for plant growth, and although the cash cost of
hired farm labor is high ($5.00 per day) the opportunity cost of family labor is quite low. This means that in
order to compete, farmers and possibly private sector investors will need to use “smarter” and more modern
farming systems and techniques, such as fertilizer micro-dosing and selection of higher-value products which
store well and can be exported in bulk.

Given the importance of agriculture for employment in Oecusse, further analysis of export
competitiveness is worthwhile. Even though the foregoing indicates that Oecusse’s current main
agriculture products are not internationally competitive, there are new crops worthy of consideration and
analysis, and which might be included in the OADP. One of the main reasons for this continued focus on
possible exports is that Oecusse’s agriculture sector is currently (and will be in the future) the main source of
employment for the majority of the population - irrespective of whether ZEESM is implemented or not.

The detailed crop and livestock production models underpinning this chapter’s analysis illustrate how
important rural employment is in Oecusse. For example, and as shown

Labor costs in particular are worth highlighting, given that Timor-Leste has very high labor costs
relative to competitors, underpinned by a high legislated minimum wage. The average wage in Timor-
Leste is $503 per month76. The minimum wage in Timor-Leste is set at $115 per month across the country.
Oecusse is therefore required to abide by the same minimum wage laws. Today some companies do not pay
this wage rate. However any major investor at the scale aimed for by ZEESM will be unable to avoid the law
in the same way. In short, all companies operating in Oecusse will have to pay at least $115 per month (13
times per year) and the competitive wage may be higher still. As of 2009 this minimum wage was 207% of
GDP77 per capita. This is far higher relative to GDP than in Indonesia, where the minimum wage for East
Java is 25% of GDP per capita; and in Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam where the minimum wage is
approximately 34% of GDP per capita for workers for which there is a set minimum wage. Today the
minimum wage in West-Timor, the most obvious direct competitor for investment, is approximately $98 per

The time to export for Timor-Leste is 28 days
compared with just 17 days in Indonesia and 21 days in Vietnam.79 This is for exports primarily from Dili.
Exporting from Oecusse directly is currently even more difficult, with the port unable to take large ships and
without international port status to allow direct exports.

High factor costs do not mean it is impossible to attract investors. However it does suggest two things.
Firstly, that economic development should focus on sectors where the use of the most expensive factors is
relatively low. For example, labor intensive manufacturing industries are unlikely to succeed with high labor
costs. Similarly industries with significant transportation of both inputs and outputs (such as garment
production) are unlikely to succeed. Instead, sectors which: (i) use locally available assets (such as agricultural
products or the natural beauty); (ii) produce light products for nearby markets; and (iii) require lower-intensity
labor use, are more likely to succeed. Secondly, that policies for the SEZ focus where possible on improving
factor costs – such as time and cost to export - without engaging in financially unsustainable subsidy regimes.

4.6 The potential of agriculture and how to capture it
4.6.1 Agriculture Potential

Estimating agricultural production potential in Oecusse is inherently challenging given the lack of available
data and information. However it is possible to come to some general conclusions using the land uses
detailed in Table 4.1. In summary, Oecusse has:

      (i)     24,420 ha classified as forests, of which half, or 12, 210 ha, are severely degraded and therefore
              represent a large-scale opportunity for communal and commercial re-forestation programs which
              would employ large numbers of rural people;

                                                                68
   (ii)   12,500 ha are “officially” suitable for maize production (with only about 2,500 ha currently being
          used (see Table 4.7) leaving an additional potential of 10,000 ha) - assumedly this is flat land with
          alluvial soils which the Agriculture Administration considers can be used for mechanized maize
          production (based on free cultivation services) and not the upland swidden areas covered below in
          (iv);
5,700 ha which are suitable for irrigated agriculture - with only 2,140 ha currently being used, (

Table 4.9: Paddy Potential Production (ha), Cropped Area (ha) and Cropped Area (ha/hh) by District

     (iii)   ) leaving an additional 3,560 ha available for development; and
     (iv)    33,780 ha of swidden farming and free grazing land area, which whilst by far the largest “potential
             agriculture development area” in Oecusse, is also fraught with difficulties and constraints because
             of entrenched destructive agriculture production practices and a severely degraded environment.
             Achieving fundamental changes in current land use practices on this class of land is difficult, and if
             successful, takes many years - up to a generation.

In addition, Oecusse has small livestock herds and flocks which could form the basis of a strengthened
livestock sector.

4.6.2 Strategic Approach to Agriculture Development

It is suggested that the Administration should fast-track key agriculture development initiatives, and
to not rely on an expanded “business as usual” approach to sectoral development. Oecusse’s
uniqueness in terms of its geographic location, history, and relative isolation in terms of its share of Timor-
Leste’s national development budget means that it lags behind the national average. In the past, reliance on
MAF’s extension services has achieved limited results, and donors (with the exception of some national
NGO’s) have tended to “ignore” the enclave, relative to their support for other districts.

This situation warrants a “smart and efficient” approach to agriculture development in Oecusse, based on the
following initiatives:

     (i)     A strong focus on rural poverty reduction and rural nutrition. This should be the core
             objective as poor and under-nourished farmers and their families are often not receptive targets for
             programs which promote economic development.
     (ii)    Leverage-in increased support from Timor-Leste’s agriculture sector donors. This should
             commence with the detailed OADP planning process referred to below, plus engagement with
             ongoing projects (such as TLMSP) which could respond quickly and efficiently in terms of
             supporting Oecusse’s farmers with maize storage drums. Other donor-funded projects which could
             be “fast-tracked” into Oecusse include the FAO- and USAID-funded Conservation Agriculture
             Project. The World Bank has a data base of all current and relevant projects in Timor-Leste and this
             could be used as a check-list to ensure that all potentially cooperative donors are actively engaged in
             the OADP planning process. In addition, the recently announced Global Agriculture Food Security
             Program (GAFSP) grant of $21 million (to be managed by MAF for agriculture development
             throughout Timor-Leste) is also an opportunity for the “fast-tracking” of proven development
             interventions into Oecusse80.
     (iii)   Input support: Ensure that all farmers have access to all, now readily available, improved food and
             cash crop cultivars - in this regard SoL has made commendable progress but it is likely that some of
             the poorer and more isolated farmers have not yet accessed this fundamental resource.
     (iv)    Build on current successes: Work “faster, smarter and better”, i.e. (i) build on Caritas’s
             communal approach to watershed management); (ii) introduce locally-proven technologies such as

 under preparation, funded by the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP).

            improved cattle feeding using multi-purpose legumes (as proven by ACIAR in West Timor and
            Eastern Indonesia); and (iii) be the first in Timor-Leste to test TWSPs for supplementary irrigation.
     (v) “Leapfrog in” new agriculture production systems and practices, such as the use of barbed
            wire for fencing using live posts, the use of smothering legumes for weed control in maize crops,
            and fertilizer micro-dosing for maize production. This is the same as “demonstrating that Oecusse
            can do it”.
     (vi) Foster a “rural communal learning culture” which is supported, as required, by OADP
            resources and budgets. This could involve a new and innovative approach to agriculture extension
            based on farmers’ demand, rather than an Agriculture Administration-determined, top down
            approach to planning and implementation. Many valuable lessons on how to design and implement
            such a program can be learned from Raumoco in Lautem; and from the now-completed “From
            Hunger to Health; Strengthening Community Capacity and Resilience for Food Security in Oecusse, Project, Timor-
            Leste” - funded by the EU81
     (vii) Prepare to build on possible synergies which might develop as ZEESM is implemented ,
            particularly in terms of supplying fresh vegetables and locally-produced livestock products. In
            addition, an expanding Pante Macassar work force (mainly immigrants) would require more rice as
            a staple, plus other, non-staple foods. These products, and additional fresh vegetables, can be
            grown on Oecusse’s irrigated land if irrigation systems are repaired and then operate more
            efficiently in terms of increased cropping intensity and yields. In the longer-term there may be some
            opportunities for the agriculture sector to supply food to an emerging mining industry, subject to
            further assessment of this sector.
     (viii) Current land use in Oecusse “mandates” that any future sectoral development strategy
            should include a strong element of forestry and agro-forestry, provided forest-based products
            are internationally competitive. Such a program would increase rural incomes and employ large
            numbers of rural people. This is because by far the largest area of “unused” land is presently
            classified as “swidden farming and free grazing”. This land is highly eroded and in some places,
            destroyed following generations of inappropriate land use practices. Change is essential if about
            42% of Oecusse’s total land mass is to “survive and be of use to future generations”.

            This represents an opportunity for “Oecusse to do something different”. To-date no district in
            Timor-Leste has decided to focus on forestry and/or agro-forestry, even though forest products have a strong
            comparative advantages (high value, storable, exportable, and can be value-added), large areas of land with a zero
            opportunity cost are available, and astutely planned reforestation programs can employ large numbers of rural people,
            including rural youth. Furthermore there are a number of perennial tree cash crops and timber species which have
            considerable potential to increase farm incomes and generate high returns to family labor inputs.

The challenge is to ensure that the right mix of agriculture products is selected for support under an
OADP, given the foregoing conclusion that none of the current products are competitive in
international export markets, and therefore cannot provide essential increases in rural household
incomes from export sales (with the possible exception of live cattle). Therefore there is a need to:

     (i)    focus on products which have good potential to create high levels of rural employment, plus
            if possible, the potential to contribute to improved human nutrition;
     (ii) focus on import replacement82 products - and rice is the obvious one, with the local mamramo
            variety selling for about $1,000/Mt in Pante Macassar;
     (iii) focus on products which are likely to increase in demand as ZEESM develops, and the
            domestic and migrant population grows - such as fresh meat, and fresh fruit and vegetables;
     (iv) select new products which are at least reasonably competitive internationally, and which are
            complementary in terms of environmental protection - such as a range of tree crops including
            timber and shorter-term tree cash crops;
     (v) be cautious of agro-processing: heed the above analyses in terms of potentially competitive
            export products - do not make the mistake of assuming that if processing facilities (such as an
            abattoir83) are constructed, raw product volumes will increase and therefore processing will be
            financially viable, particularly when unskilled labor rates are so high; noting that the exception could
            be value-added wood-based products;
     (vi) ensure that the wishes and aspirations of Oecusse’s rural communities, and of women’s
            groups, are factored into the OADP - this means that a planning process which is much longer
            than this ZEESM review will be required to ensure stakeholder engagement and commitment, plus
            gender equity;
     (vii) build on Oecusse’s reputation for cohesion and self-supporting rural communities, use the
            foundation laid by the “From Hunger to Health” Project, and rural communities’ experience with
            earning their livelihoods in a very difficult agriculture environment with poor natural resources, and
            which requires large commitments of family labor;
     (viii) decide how to deliver agriculture development support services (public or civil society role),
            and then ensure that such services are resourced adequately over the life of the OADP;
     (ix) identify how to target and train local farmers with the objective of improving their production
            skills for existing and new products, including an engagement policy which engenders communal
            cooperation and willingness, and women’s involvement, to participate in their OADP;
     (x) ensure that the local policy and regulatory environments (e.g. for live cattle exports) are in
            place and supported by government; this will require some revision and adjustment to current
            policies, and the promulgation of local regulations and guidelines;
     (xi) identify essential agriculture infrastructure, such as refurbished or up-graded irrigation systems
            with support from TWSPs, and access roads;
     (xii) identify other (non-agriculture) support required for the sector to grow and prosper, such as
            local ports, access roads to enable forest-based products to be moved efficiently, and possibly local
            wood processing plants ; and

83Assuming that 25% of the annual cattle turn-off of about 1,960 head are slaughtered (490 head) = 10 head per week = 2 head per
 day; means that an abattoir in Pante Macassar has no chance of being financially viable. Irrespective of where abattoirs are located
 there are some good “rules of thumb” which determine viability - the main one being reliable and regular throughputs of at least 10
 head per day for a $1.0 million investment (international standards). Note too that modern agro-processing requires technical
 engineers, food technicians, and moderately skilled workers.




                                                                72
     (xiii) cost the OADP, and then analyze the impact of individual product outcomes in terms of financial,
            economic and social (employment) impacts84.

It is important to note the point made in (vi) and (vii) above - communal engagement in the OADP planning
process. Past experience in Oecusse and in other parts of Timor-Leste (and in other parts of the developing
world) indicates that it is essential that targeted rural communities are engaged in the planning process.
Normally this process needs to be implemented over about 12 months, as reported by World Neighbours85. It
is apparent from field visits undertaken as part of this review, that Oecusse’s rural communities have not been
sufficiently engaged in the ZEESM (agriculture) planning process. And, at the time of preparing this report,
these communities had not been consulted about the possible content of an OADP. This means that there
will need to be further OADP planning missions in 2015 and 2016 if this vital step in development planning
is to be inclusive and therefore sustainable.

4.6.3 The Future for Oecusse’s Agriculture Sector

Agriculture should be at the heart of the “Social Market Economy” philosophy in ZEESMs. This is
because Oecusse’s agriculture sector could be: (i) the main employer of the Zone’s population for the
foreseeable future (irrespective of whether ZEESM proceeds or not); (ii) increasingly responsible for
producing sufficient healthy food to avoid the need to import; (iii) (continue to be) responsible for
environmental protection and improvement; and (iv) the foundation on which the majority of the population
experience increased incomes and improved livelihoods.

However Oecusse’s development rests on an agriculture sector with significant factor cost and
environmental challenges. Overcoming these constraints will require considerable support and persistence,
given the low base from which the sector is emerging, and the current degraded state of Oecusse’s agricultural
resources. In addition the ZEESM Administration will need to recognize that it is responsible for an
agriculture sector which is: (i) high cost (in terms of casual farm labor and the opportunity cost of farm family
labor); (ii) (currently) very unproductive; and (iii) in danger of causing irreparable environmental destruction if
changes to production systems are not made, and tree planting increased. This “triple negative” will be
difficult to deal with and address, and will require innovation and fast-tracking of improved production
techniques, plus a substantial increase in public expenditure for sector support.

The suggested OADP responds to these challenges. The remainder of this section:

     (i)   Outlines initial thoughts on the scope and scale of an OADP, with the objective of completing
           an initial analysis of how the Plan might impact on Oecusse’s rural sector - keeping in mind that the
           foregoing analyses on costs of production and competitiveness were based on “current” and
           “potential situations” with the objective of identifying potential export commodities. This showed
           that there are no “standout” commodities on which future development of Oecusse’s agriculture
           sector might depend, hence the need for an OADP.




84 To some extent this review has completed a pre-design appraisal of an OADP concept, but there is considerable and more detailed
  planning and analytical work required before the OADP is finalized, and presented for funding.

   (ii)    Outlines the OADP in terms of targeted agriculture products and the number of potential
           beneficiaries. The OADP is presented in the form of a program framework which could be
           expanded as the foundation of a detailed planning exercise referred to above;
   (iii)   presents initial OADP costings and implementation time-frames; and
   (iv)    summarizes initial estimates of possible social, financial and economic benefits from an
           OADP, noting that the suggested OADP composition in terms of priority products in based on: (a)
           import replacement, (b) staple and nutritious food for foreign workers, (c) improved nutrition for
           of Oecusse’s population, and (d) new perennial cash crop and tree crop products (timber) which
           have some comparative advantages, even in isolated Oecusse.

It should be noted that the OADP outlined below proposes Zone-wide support for agriculture development
that goes well beyond the 50 ha of agroforestry and limited operational budgets discussed in the current
ZEESM plans.

4.6.4 Possible OADP

A possible OADP is summarized in Table 4.22. The plan is conservative in that estimated increases
in cropped areas are less than those reported by MAF and the Agriculture Administration, in terms
of the sector’s “official” potential. This is because land ownership and distribution constraints within rural
communities are likely to limit expansion of farmed areas. Even if there were no constraints related to local
land ownership, growth of the Zone’s agriculture economy will continue to be constrained by a poor natural
resource base (with the exception of small areas of irrigation), and low rainfall and productivity. Similarly,
because the current rain fed, swidden maize farming system is unsustainable, it has been assumed that the
area farmed in this way would remain constant rather than grow. Domestic limitations and market sizes were
used to determine food and annual cash crop areas in the OADP. However there are no land management
constraints which might limit the areas planted to a range of tree and timber crops, or for more intensive
livestock raising.

The suggested OADP focuses on four core agriculture sub-sectors: (i) irrigated and rain fed crops;
(ii) perennial cash crops: (iii) commercial forestry; and (iv) livestock. This is a logical selection of target
products which reflects the foregoing analyses and the recommended strategic approach to sector
development. The OADP’s structure (in terms of priority products) reflects the need for Oecusse to produce
sufficient rice to avoid increasing imports, and to meet the demand for maize noting that maize is not a viable
export crop. The final structure and content of the OADP was “driven” by the staple food demand and
supply balances shown in Table 4.24. This shows that future demand for rice will be met (with a small
surplus) if the development plans in Table 4.22 are implemented over a 10-year period. There will also be a
small domestic surplus of maize, even taking into account increased demand for non-ruminant livestock
feeding.

Possible OADP Phasing

The phasing of a an OADP plan is summarized in Table 4.23, and is conservative given that it will
take some time to build and strengthen Oecusse’s Agriculture Administration’s extension services,
and to organize cooperative programs with Development Partners, and local and international
NGOs. Note that the suggested OADP is based on a “hybrid extension service” in which Oecusse’s Suco
Extension Officer (SEOs) work in partnership with NGO networks and communal groups. This approach


                                                      74
was selected because of the recommendation from staff engaged on the completed “From Hunger to Health;
Strengthening Community Capacity and Resilience for Food Security in Oecusse” Project. In fact one staff
member provided the World Bank team with the quotation below, which is good evidence that the “hybrid”
approach should be successful.

“ The wonderful achievements were obtained due to good coordination and support from the District Administrator (Sr. Jose Tan esib
Anunu), the District Development Officer (Sr. Domingos Maniquin), the MSS (Sr. Jimmy then continued by Sr. Gido), and the DHS
(Sr. Manuel da Cunha). From MAF, the support and cooperation in the field was mostly provided by SEOs and Sub-District
Extension Coordinators. There was mutual learning and support from Oxfam and Caritas Australia as well. The cooperation and
support from Suco Chiefs and local leaders was also great. In conclusion, the wonderful behaviour changes and achievements were due to
mutual learning and good cooperation amongst all stakeholders 86”.



Preliminary Costings and Time-frames

Implementation of an OADP would raise the level of investment in Oecusse’s agriculture sector
considerably over the next 10 years, and result in significant reallocation of resources, to four core
sub-sectors87. Table 4.26 summarizes the preliminary costs and timing for the OADP. In summary, the first
preliminary estimates indicate that the financial cost of an OADP would be about $47.5 million over a 10-
year implementation period, involving an increase, in relation to current operational costs, of about $43.5
million88. About 65% of the cost would be associated with structural improvements to Tono, improvements
in terms of TWSPs for Tono, and the “greenfields” development of an additional 1,000 ha of irrigated land.
Note that even though the foregoing analyses indicates that Oecusse cannot compete on international
markets for the export of rice (or maize) it is logical to focus on domestic production of import
replacements89 for these products - particularly rice (6,000 Mt of grain or 11,000 Mt of paddy, equivalent to
an additional 2,000 ha of irrigated land producing about 5 Mt paddy/ha from two crops per year). The
remaining $16.25 million has been allocated to the four core agriculture sub-sectors referred to above, plus
additional transport and operations costs.




86 Pak Wayan Tambun, pers. com.
87 In the context of overall investment planned by Government in ZEESM, the allocation of about $43.5 million to Oecusse’s
  agriculture sector is very small in comparison.
88 Including $10 million for the current upgrade of the Tomo irrigation scheme.
89 Import replacement does not suggest protection for domestic producers, but rather a focus on products with a significant domestic

  market and the prospect for greater efficiency in production.

4.6.7 Preliminary Analyses

Economic Analysis

Preliminary analysis suggests an OADP EIRR of 10%. Table 4.27 details an initial and approximate
Economic Analysis of the OADP. Note however that this plan has not been developed in cooperation with
the wide range of stakeholders who are interested in the development of Oecusse’s agriculture sector.
Therefore readers are reminded that this is a preliminary and indicative analysis which is almost certain to
change once more detailed and cooperative plans are developed.

Sensitivity Analyses

The OADP EIRRs are very sensitive to labor cost assumptions.            Table 4.25: Sensitivity Analyses
Results from sensitivity analyses of the impact on the estimated           Opp Cost of HH Labour, and
OADP’s EIRR are shown in Table 4.25, for four different labor cash         Cost of Hired Labour ($/day)
                                                                         $2.50    $5.00    $1.50    $4.15 a/
costs and family labor opportunity cost rates (from $1.50 to $5.00
                                                                                        EIRR
per day). Key conclusions are:                                           10%      3%       13%      6%
                                                                          a/minimum wage.
   (i)     if the $10 million to upgrade Tono is included as an
           OADP cost (as it should be) then the OADP would only be economically viable if labor costs
           (farm household and hired) were about $2.50 per day, or less;
   (ii)    if the cost of labor is the current minimum wage rate (about $4.15 per day) the OADP would be
           marginally viable; and
   (iii)   these results show just how sensitive agriculture development in Oecusse is to local labor costs.

Incremental Food Production

Rice production will increase about five times over ten years, to a limit determined by satiating
domestic, rather than export demand; and maize production will increase by 2.6 times over the same
period. Table 4.28 summarizes the estimated increase in food production in Oecusse under the OADP and
should be considered in conjunction with Table 4.24 which is a staple food supply budget. It is estimated that
rice (grain) production would increase by about 12,000 Mt per year (by year 10) and that maize production
would increase by about 8,780 Mt over the same time period. Note that these figures do not reflect Oecusse’s
maximum potential, but the limit imposed by the lack of international competitiveness in grain markets and
the size of Oecusse’s domestic markets. The OADP is therefore designed so that areas of paddy and maize
are limited to the area required to meet domestic demands.

Meat production is estimated to increase by about 22% over the 10-year period and this is one area
where the scale of development could be further increased when preparing the final plan , not only
because of growing domestic and international markets (for beef in West Timor) but also because of
Oecusse’s potential to grow more maize for livestock feeding. Note that the ODAP does not include any
increase in the maize production area, but does assume increased production from existing areas, and reduced
storage losses.

Beneficiary Households

The majority of households currently earning rural livelihoods in Oecusse (about 12,000) are
expected to benefit from various activities in the OADP, noting that some families will benefit from
increased production of more than one product. Table 4.22 lists the number of expected beneficiary
households if an OADP is implemented. In summary this is expected to be: (i) the current 4,000 households
with access to existing irrigated land, plus an additional 2,000 households who would benefit from access to
newly developed irrigation land; (ii) the current 4,000 households (not mutually exclusive from those listed in
(i)) who would benefit from improved vegetable production; (iii) the current 2,000 households who grow rain
fed maize on flat land; and (iv) the current 10,000 households who grow rain fed maize on swidden land.
Note that many of these households have been “double-counted” as most farming families in Oecusse grow a
wide range of crops on irrigated and rain fed land. In addition, about 5,000 households would benefit from
investment in forestry products, and 2,500 from investment in perennial cash crops. And about 3,625
households would participate in improved livestock production activities- see Table 4.23 for details.

Livelihoods Analysis

An important determinant of whether a program such as the suggested OADP produces sufficient benefits to
warrant investment is the impact on farmers’ incomes (financial returns) and the financial returns to family
labor invested in agricultural production. This is the contribution of the OADP to poverty alleviation. These
figures are determined by incremental crop and livestock production which is expected to be an outcome
from increased support to Oecusse’s farmers. The farm incomes (gross margins) and returns to family labor
figures are detailed in Table 4.11 and Table 4.12, and summarized in




                                                      84
Table 4.29: Financial Return for Farmers

.

Generally gross margins (financial returns) per cropped ha and per livestock production unit increase with
OADP funded support, but this is not always the case for returns to family labor. This is because the
“potential with OADP scenario” models require considerably more family labor than the “current situation”
models, and these additional inputs are not offset by sufficiently high increased crop yields or livestock
productivity. The conclusion from this analysis is that rural families’ standard of living from crop and
livestock production would improve under an OADP as farm incomes would increase.

Table 4.29: Financial Return for Farmers
 does not include farmer financial returns for perennial cash crops or forestry products. This is because
returns per family day are not relevant due to the time taken for these crops to mature and to come into
production. However another way to express financial returns from these longer-term crops is to include a
reasonable financial cost ($5.00 per day) for family labor in the calculation of Financial Internal Rates of
Return (FIRRs).

4.7 Conclusions
The analyses completed as part of this ZEESM review indicate that in the future the development of
Oecusse’s agriculture sector should focus on:

   (v)    growing sufficient staple and nutritious food for its indigenous population (and an expected
          increase in migrant workers) plus ensuring that the Zone is self-sufficient in rice by increasing rice
          production by about 12,000 Mt per year;
   (vi) increasing farm incomes from annual and perennial crops (food and cash) through the promotion
          of improved production and storage technologies, and a small increase in the area of irrigated land
          (1,000 ha);
   (vii) protecting remnant forests and restoring over-grazed and denuded hills (the latter through no
          expansion of swidden farming) by controlling free livestock grazing and introducing more intensive
          livestock production systems; and
   (viii) “being ambitious” - setting out to prove that Oecusse’s Government and its rural people have the
          determination to convert the Zone into a world-class and best-practice example of how to restore
          large areas of degraded land into productive (and financially and economically viable) farming
          systems based on: (a) perennial tree crops, (b) mixed hardwood species, and (c) agro-forestry
          species.

The starting point should be the detailed design and analysis of an OADP, ensuring that the participative
approach outlined above is followed carefully. This step in the overall development and implementation of
ZEESM needs to be completed as soon as possible, because (and as elaborated in other Parts of this report)
to-date Oecusse’s rural population has not been well-briefed on ZEEM’s plans or its implications for this
section of the community; and nor does there seem to be any direct investment planned for Oecusse’s
agriculture sector under ZEESM, with the exception of 50 ha of agro-forestry.

CHAPTER 5: Transport Corridor
5.1 Introduction
This chapter analyzes characteristics, in terms of procedures, time and cost, of transporting goods and people
overland between Dili and Oecusse and West Timor and Oecusse.

Oecusse is an isolated coastal enclave of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste surrounded by Indonesia
(West Timor in Nusa Tanagra Timor, or NTT Province). While there are limited ferry and air options that
require no border crossings, transporting people or cargo over land between Dili and Oecusse requires
crossing national borders twice each way. The most direct overland route assessed in this report involves first
leaving Timor-Leste at the Batu Gade border post and entering Indonesia. Then exiting Indonesia and
entering Timor-Leste through the Sakato crossing into Oecusse. This chapter also reviews which routes
between Oecusse and major trading posts are the most efficient, in terms of time and costs.

The report is based on the experience of a World Bank team that travelled over land from Dili to Oecusse,
complemented by a desk review and information gathered from interviews with the authorities, traders and
transport firms.

The rest of the chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the de jure and de facto border
crossing procedures for people and vehicles. Section 3 analyzes the transport time and costs for different
routes between Oecusse and trading posts. Section 4 provides recommendations. Annex 1 presents a
mapping of the processes for border crossing procedures, Annex 2 presents the timeline for travel between
Dili and Oecusse via Sakato, and Oecusse to Dili via Oesilo.

Box 5.1: Infrastructure at Timor-Leste's border posts

The border post infrastructure at Oecusse is generally good with the exception of the post at Oesilo.

General cargo arrives in Oecusse from West Timor principally through Oesilo and the new Integrated Border Post
(IBP) at Sakato. A small amount of trade also arrives by Passabe. Oesilo has increased in importance as an entry point
since the beginning of 2013.

At Oesilo the border post is primitive but the government intends to build a new post in 2015. The IBP at Sakato is
under-utilized, and is mainly used for transit goods from Dili.

On current plans, all border crossings will have internet by the end of 2015 under a contract with Timor Telecom.
Once connected the entire district Customs officers will have real time access to the Customs server anywhere in the
Country.

Management of the Oecusse posts has long been neglected, with poor record keeping on volumes and values of
goods imported, most likely leading to underreporting and poor duty collections. Recording of imports, and hence
duty collections is set to improve with the planned classification by APORTIL, the autonomous ports authority, of
Oecusse port as a full international port. This move also coincides with an initiative with the World Customs
Organisation to introduce a harmonized system for classification and valuation of goods in Timor-Leste as a whole.

5.2       Procedures and Practical Experience.
Overland travel between Oecusse and Dili is cumbersome. Established formal procedures are subject to
change and delays. Visa and permit processes for persons and vehicles must be initiated several days in
advance of travel, and are only valid for specific periods 2.1 Procedures for obtaining a visa

5.2.1 Visa procedure to visit Indonesia

Timor-Leste is one of many countries eligible for its citizens to obtain a visa on arrival when
entering Indonesian territory. However, this is only available at airports or seaports, not at land
borders. Thus, to cross the land border at Batu Gade, Passabe, Bobometo (Oesilo), Sakato and Citrana91, a
Timor-Leste passport holder needs to apply for a visa at the Indonesian Embassy in Dili or the Indonesian
Consulate office in Oecusse. When applying for a visa, an applicant needs to complete a form, fulfill the
following requirements and pay USD45 for a 30-day visa:

     Present a valid passport
     Enclose two photos
     Demonstrate ticket or any proof regarding means of transportation to the destination country
     Demonstrate sufficient funds for period of stay
     Demonstrate accommodation arrangements.

5.2.2 Visa procedure to visit Timor-Leste

Unlike Indonesia, Timor-Leste applies a visa on arrival policy at every frontier – not only sea and
airports – including land borders at Batu Gade, Oesilo, and Citrana. Generally, visitors from any
country can easily obtain a 30 day tourist and business visa on arrival by filling a simple form, paying USD30
in cash, and enclosing all document requirements.

5.2.3 Practical experience of obtaining a visa to Indonesia

Regular passport holders receive their visas on time, while diplomatic passport holders may
experience delays. For general passport holders, visas are normally issued in the required 3 days. For UN
passport (Laissez Passer) holders, it should take only one day to get a visa from Indonesian Embassy. In
practice it takes 3 days to get the visa.

The absence of a visa on arrival facility at Indonesian land borders provides room for negotiation
between people travelling without a visa and border officers. There is anecdotal evidence that when a
person has not applied for a visa prior to crossing the border, officers have opened the option of negotiation.
It is said to be common to get a clearance from Indonesia border officers, which may involve illegal fees.


91These are the five Timor-Leste border posts for crossings to Indonesia that connect Oecusse to the other part of Timor-Leste. The
 Indonesian posts at these locations are, respectively: Motaain, Haumeniana, Napan, and Haumusuc/Wini and Oepoli, respectively.
 There are also other Timor-Leste border posts for crossing to Indonesia in ‘mainland’ Timor -Leste, namely: Salele, Belulikleten,
 Tanubibi, and Meme.




                                                               91
5.2.4 Procedures for obtaining a vehicle permit

See Annex 1 for a diagram of the procedures

Before departure

A vehicle registered in Timor-Leste is allowed to enter into the Republic Indonesia after obtaining a
US$20 Certificate of Carrying Vehicle (SKMK), issued by the Indonesian Embassy or Consular
Office in Timor-Leste. This applies to all vehicles, both private and government/diplomatic/international
organization vehicles. The fee to obtain the SKMK is USD20 per car.

The procedure to get the SKMK certificate is as follows:

  I.    The applicant requests a domestic travel certificate to be issued by the National Directorate of Land
        Transport, Ministry of Transport and Communication of Timor-Leste, which under Timorese law
        gives permission for a vehicle to travel once to Oecusse through the territory of Indonesia. The
        document also serves as a replacement for the original Timorese Vehicle Registration Certificate
        which must be temporarily deposited at the Ministry of Transport and Communication for the
        duration of the trip to Oecusse.

 II.    After obtaining this certificate, the applicant needs to request the Certificate of Carrying Vehicle
        (SKMK) from the Indonesian Embassy or Consular Office. The application should contain:
        a. For government/diplomatic/international organizations: An application letter from the institution,
        b. For private vehicles: A statement that the vehicle will be returned back to Timor-Leste and not to be
            traded;
        c. A copy of Vehicle Registration Certificate (STNK);
        d. A certificate issued by National Directorate of Land Transport, Ministry of Transport
            Communication of Timor-Leste; and
        e. A copy of driving license and passport of the driver who will drive the vehicle.

At the borders

When crossing borders, the certificate (SKMK) must be presented to officers at both the Timor-
Leste and Indonesian borders. On the Timor-Leste side, both Customs and Traffic Post officers stamp
and sign the certificate. The document is then presented again to the officers in the Indonesian border for
signature. The Indonesian border officers issue two documents namely: (i) Document for an Incoming
Vehicle to the Territory of the Republic Indonesia, which is issued by Customs, and (ii) Report Certificate
which is issued by the National Police. The customs document serves as the Customs clearance document.
No official fees apply in order to obtain these document/certificate. However, this step does create an
opportunity for illicit payments.

In addition, since the final destination is Oecusse, there is also information in the Customs document that the
vehicle passing into Indonesian territory is doing so only for transit purposes.




                                                      92
Upon return to Timor-Leste

Once the vehicle has completed its roundtrip journey and returned to Timor-Leste, the stamped
certificate and documents received at the borders should be submitted to the Indonesian Embassy.
Only then can the owner take back the Vehicle Registration Certificate from the Ministry of Transport and
Communication of Timor-Leste, who has been keeping it. 92

5.2.5 Practical experience of vehicle crossing

Despite having the necessary documentation, clearance delays occurred at the Indonesian border
points. There are more agencies and hence clearances required at the Indonesian border points than on the
Timorese side. On the Indonesian side, clearance was required from four institutions, namely: customs,
military, immigration, and police. Moreover, at the police station in Wini there are two different police
officers, namely Brimob – a specific corp under the National Police of Republic of Indonesia, and the regular
police. At the Timor-Leste Border, the clearance process only involved Immigration, Police and the Customs.

Unofficial payments were solicited to accelerate the clearance process. An additional payment was
required to obtain the certificates from Indonesian Customs and Police at the Motaain Border. When the
customs office at the border issued the certificate for ‘Incoming Vehicle to Territory of the Republic
Indonesia’, the customs officers at the border asked ‘what we thought the cost was of typing and printing the
certificate’. The Police officer made the same request. A total of US$40 93was requested in ad hoc additional
payments at just one border point (Motaain). This is additional to the official US$20 per car paid in advance
per car at the Indonesian Embassy in advance of travel.

This experience of soliciting additional payments was validated by traders located in Atambua,
Indonesia. They reported that to deliver cargo to Oecusse, they have to make payments to officers at the
Indonesian border points, in addition to the regular cost components, such as tax and import duty. They
estimate the total costs for these components ranging from 1 million – 4 million rupiah (USD 77 –
USD300)94.

No customs inspection was undertaken at the crossings, possibly since the mission vehicles used for
this survey carry diplomatic license plates. The officers checked and recorded the vehicle certificate and
travel documents, without performing any inspection activities. The customs officer only asked verbally about
goods being transported inside the cars. A private car or truck containing goods is likely to face a fuller
inspection, which would imply longer time for crossing than the Bank team experienced.

In accordance with the 2004 Timor-Leste custom code (see Box 5.2) inspection was not performed
for transit goods. Interviews with customs officers at the Timor-Leste border point in Batu Gade suggest
that they do not normally perform inspections for any goods being taken out of Timor-Leste. Inspection may
take place at entry at the Indonesian border, subject to Indonesian customs rules and regulations. However,
Indonesian customs officers confirmed that inspection is not performed for transit cargo, i.e. cargo from Dili



92 As already explained in the section 6.2.4 point I
93 US$10 for the Police + US$10 for customs, per car, for two cars.
94 Traders were reluctant to reveal the share of this that was paid in additional requests at the border.




                                                                    93
to Oecusse which is certified in advance to cross the territory of the Republic of Indonesia95. The officer will
just check the list of the cargo as stated in the manifest document. Indonesian Customs officials may then
place a seal on the truck or offer escort services for security assurance. There is a fee for this escort service.

Despite the report from Indonesian officers that inspection does not take place, there are no binding
reciprocal agreements in place to enforce such practice.

1.     The internal transit regime allows that national goods be transported from one point to another within the
       national customs territory, crossing through a third country, without any alteration to its status.
2.     The external transit procedure shall allow the movement of foreign goods between two points of the national
       customs territory without such goods being subject to import duties and other charges or to commercial policy
       measures.
3.     Foreign goods moving between two customs warehouses or between customs, as well as goods intended for
       exportation, shall be liable to external transit procedure.
4.     In case the transportation of goods under the external transit procedure is made by sea, the vessel shall not
       suspend the navigation between the port of departure and the port of arrival.
5.     The customs authorities may set a mandatory itinerary in relation to land transports, as well as require the
       provision of a guarantee and set a time limit for the discharge of the transit procedure.
6.      Whenever they deem it necessary, customs authorities shall determine the permanent supervision of the goods
       to be transported under the present customs procedures.
7.     Goods circulating under a transit procedure shall be accompanied [by] the 1/3 copy of the Single Administrative
       Document.



5.2.6 A partial legal basis exists for a Transit Corridor solution
The Timor-Leste 2004 customs code (Decree law 11/2004, Article 112) provides a good basis for a
transit corridor between ‘mainland’ Timor-Leste and Oecusse, but is not yet formally reciprocal. A
formal transit corridor could reduce the time and procedures to move goods between Dili and Oecusse.
Timor-Leste’s 2004 customs code, article 112 has several provisions that facilitate the transit of goods
between Dili and Oecusse via land borders and oversea. For instance article 112: (i) exempts transit goods
from import duties upon reentry to Timor-Leste; (ii) exempts transit goods from inspection procedures upon
exit and reentry; and (iii) seeks to avoid the diversion of goods during transit either by land or sea. The team
could not verify the reciprocity within the Indonesian legal system. Thus, a formal agreement and a legal
recognition by the Timor-Leste and the Indonesian Governments may secure the lawful and timely transit of
goods from Dili to Oecusse, via land and sea borders. This would lower costs and create greater certainty for
traders. Strong enforcement procedures would prevent smuggling, e.g. of goods with high Indonesian excise
tax, such as alcohol.

5.2         Analysis of Time and Costs of Delivery based on Routes
In addition to Dili overland and oversea, there are a number of Indonesian overland sources of
goods to Oecusse, such as Kupang, Atambua, Kefamenahu and Wini. The following approaches to
sourcing were reported by Oecusse importers and Indonesian exporters (see Annex 3 for legal process):

i. Goods from Indonesia (Atambua, Kupang, Wini or Kefamenahu):
       The seller normally arranges the truck, cleared for export, and delivers the goods to the buyer’s
         premises.
       The buyer will then pay the transportation costs to the seller.
       The buyer will arrange the labor and pay the unloading costs from truck to the buyer’s premises.
ii. Goods from Dili by ferry
       The seller arranges the ferry from loading until the cargo is delivered to the destination port in
         Oecusse.
       The buyer will then pay the transportation costs to the seller.
       Transportation costs is normally calculated per unit of cargo (per sack or per box).
       The buyer will pick the cargo up in the port in Oecusse using his own truck.
iii. Goods from Dili by truck
       The seller arranges the truck to deliver the cargo to the buyer’s premises.
       The truck being used is normally an Indonesian registered truck which uses the empty backhaul96
         from Dili to Indonesia. The truck loaded with goods from Dili then travels through Oecusse on its
         way back to Indonesia. The truck is considered in transit when crossing the territory of Indonesia,
         and is hence subject to the lighter transit inspection procedures described above.

Table 5.1 below summarizes the time and costs of sourcing goods by various routes.

In terms of costs per km, it is clear that the lowest transportation cost is from Kupang, NTT as
source or origin of the goods. As the capital of NTT province, Kupang can be considered as the main
source of goods in East Timor, as it has ports and an airport. Kupang can also provide the full range of goods
needed for Ocusse including from fruits, vegetables, food products, electronics, spareparts, and construction
materials.

In terms of time to deliver the goods, Wini is the most efficient. Based on traders’ experience in
Oecusse, it only takes 1 to 2 days to receive the goods after ordering as Wini is closer to Oecusse – about 25
km distance to Pante Makassar. Although in terms of costs per-km this route has the highest costs, it is still a
better option to get the goods faster. Wini also a good source of goods as there is a port in Wini which could
also receive cargo from the other part of Indonesia.

No security issues claimed by traders in both Oecusse and Atambua. All interviewed traders confirmed
that there is no security issue during the delivery of goods to Oecusse, regardless of the source.

Oecusse’s traders consider Indonesian goods from Dili to be lower in price than sourcing directly
from Indonesia, as tax and transit advantages from Dili may offset the lower transport costs from


96   Given the lack of exports from Timor to Indonesia, nearly all trucks importing goods from Indonesia return empty.




                                                                   95
Indonesia. For example, comparing goods originating in Kupang and arriving directly in Oecusse, to goods
from Indonesia arriving via Dili, shows that the cost per km for goods from Dili is almost twice the cost of
those from Kupang. It takes on average 3 days to bring goods by land from Kupang, which is less than the 4
days is takes from Dili. However, traders in Oecusse (notably traders in construction materials) reported a
lower price of goods from Dili, than from any location in West Timor, NTT (Atambua, Kupang, etc.). Two
factors may help to explain this.

Dili based importers are sourcing goods directly from producers, avoiding 10% Indonesian VAT,
whereas Oecusse based importers are sourcing from Indonesian wholesalers. Goods imported from
Indonesia to Dili are more likely to be sourced directly from producers not from wholesalers. This saves both
on the wholesaler’s markup, and the 10% Indonesian value added tax, since Indonesian producers are exempt
from 10% value added tax when they export directly to Timor-Leste. On the other hand, goods from Kupang
for example, are coming from traders in Kupang – not the original Indonesian producers – and are therefore
subjected to 10% value added tax.

Furthermore, goods travelling through Indonesia from Dili face no disadvantage in terms of
export/import clearance costs, in relation to goods imported from Kupang. The cargo from Dili is
considered as transiting Indonesian territory, in Timor-Leste Customs Code No 11 of 200497.

Nevertheless, connectivity constraints may restrict the potential of Dili as a major source of goods
for Oecusse, especially as demand increases:

     Poor road infrastructure between Oecusse and the rest of Timor-Leste raises transport times.

     Limited capacity of the ferry to transport cargo, and a ferry schedule limited to two trips per week.
      Limited capacity of the ferry terminal to land cargo, no container infrastructure, as well as no
      international port status in Oecusse.

     There is a tonnage limitation for a vehicle travelling on Indonesian roads. The maximum weight of a
      vehicle and its cargo should not be more than 5 tons. In contrast, there is no such limitation for
      Indonesian registered vehicles to access the teritorry of Timor-Leste.

Furthermore, Oecusse transport businesses complain that unenforced regulations on Indonesian
vehicle weight and direct Indonesian sales to the Oecusse households, prevents them from growing.
Indonesian trucks travelling in Indonesia should weigh no more than 5 tons when loaded. However,
Indonesian agents are regularly sending 25 ton trucks into Oecusse, where no weight restrictions apply.
Furthermore, they are expanding sales directly to households in Oecusse. These sellers might hold an export
license from Indonesia, but they are not supposed to be retailers in Oecusse. This practice may undermine the
potential of Oecusse traders to develop as wholesalers, as well as a retailers.

5.3       Recommendations
      1. Strengthening the role of ports and sea transport to support the development of the Oecusse is
         important, as the Oecusse people could get better access for goods directly from Indonesia as the
         closest neighbor or from Dili. Any expansion should consider the predicted scale of long term trade,
         notably exports, beyond the current acceleration in construction:
              a. Build the infrastructure of ports in Oecusse which can provide services for larger vessels,
                  including container vessels, such as adequate berth area, depth of port, port cranes,
                  Container Yard, etc.
              b. Improve and upgrade the status of port in Oecusse to become an international port
              c. Increase number of ferries and vessels.
              d. Prepare adequate soft infrastructure to support flow of goods, including export, import and
                  transit.
      2. The Oecusse authority should assess the options for trade policy with a view to developing
         distribution services in Oecusse (wholesalers, retailers, etc) and the role of local players in the
         Oecusse.
         a. Prepare trade policy which could clearly define the role of trade agents, such as wholesaler, retailer,
         importer, exporter, etc. including the coverage of business for each trade agent.
         b. Enforce the policy and monitor the implementation.
      3. It is a challenge to develop the corridor which connects the eastern part of Timor-Leste (Dili, etc)
         and Oecusse over land, as it would cross the territory of Indonesia. Besides improving the
         infrastructure, it is essential to have a special agreement between the government of Timor-
         Leste/Oecusse and the government of Indonesia to have a better connectivity in the corridor.


                                                         97
        a.  As a first step, the Government of Timor-Leste should consider the prospect of expanding
            the provisions for transit traffic between Dili and Oecusse, currently captured in the 2004
            Customs Code, and engage with the Government of Indonesia to assess the possibility of
            mirroring this legislation and facilitating transit traffic.
       b. A study into the logistical and technological requirements of a transport corridor, could be
            undertaken.
4. Granting the newly expanded Mahata port International Port Status, and establishing strong port
   management may bring down import costs. International Port Status will allow contractors to source
   from a wider set of overseas suppliers, including Surabaya, enabling direct Indonesian exports into
   Oecusse and activating the advantage from the VAT exemption. It can also shorten travel time and
   avoid transaction costs at the Oesilo crossing. Shippers are said to already be willing to add Mahata
   to an existing Surubaya - Wini – Dili route. Establishing strong port management can ensure certain,
   and low release times, thereby reducing clearance costs.
5. Assess the costs and benefits of revising Decree-Law No. 19/2003 to include a waiver of relevant
   port fees relating to import of construction materials to Oecusse. Decree-Law No. 19/2003 of 13
   November 2003 currently regulates the port fees and charges that APORTIL (the Timor-Leste port
   Authority) levies.

CHAPTER 6: Migration
6.1 Introduction
As an enclave region, Oecusse’s migration dynamics98 are quite unique when compared to other
municipalities in Timor-Leste. The first purpose of this report is to highlight the key features of Oecusse’s
current migration dynamics in relation to internal (i.e. within Timor-Leste) and international migration.
Shaping these dynamics are a variety of legal and local specificities relating to the status of Oecusse and its
proximity to Indonesia. We will also examine the available data on remittances to Oecusse and the impact
these funds are having on families and local development. The report will then provide a brief overview of
the plans for the Special Social Economic Market Zone of Oecusse (ZEESM). Based on this evidence plus
what is known about migration dynamics in Oecusse and Timor-Leste more generally, this report will provide
three potential migration scenarios relating to the development of Oecusse through the implementation of
the ZEESM – the ‘best case’ scenario, the ‘worst case’ scenario and the ‘business as usual’ scenario. Taking
elements of each of these scenarios, the report will conclude by providing a snapshot of the likely migration
outcome of the development and implementation of the Oecusse ZEESM.

6.2 Current Migration Dynamics
6.2.1 Internal Migration

The most recent census99 indicates that internal migration both to and from Oecusse is very low. Oecusse has
a net internal migration rate of -5.85 (see Table 6.1) - the third lowest in the country after Aileu (-4.85) and
Liquiça (-5.06). The net migration rate describes the net effect of in-migration and out-migration on an area’s
population, expressed as an increase or decrease per 1,000 people in a given area (i.e. a municipality) in a
given year. This low number shows that there is relatively little migration to or from Oecusse; and a negative
figure indicates that more people are currently leaving Oecusse than arriving.100 A negative net migration rate
is not unusual in Timor-Leste – the only municipality currently showing a positive net migration rate is Dili
(37.27), indicating a strong trend in internal migration to the capital (see Figure 6.1). This trend is strongly
confirmed in the case of Oecusse, where 83.5% of all internal out-migration is to Dili. A total of 3,846
Oecusse natives live in Dili. The capital is also the main source of internal migrants moving to Oecusse,
making up 29.1% total flows to the enclave. Migration flows from Manufahi and Bobonaro are also at
significant levels totaling 12.6% and 9.4% respectively.

  Report on Migration and Urbanization, NSD and UNFPA, 2012
100 Oecusse’s out-migration rate is 7.26, whereas its in-migration rate is 1.4. Both figures are significantly lower than the national

  average out-migration and in-migration rates which are 13.69 and 7.25 respectively.

The first and most obvious reason for Oecusse’s low levels of both in - and out-migration is its geographical
separation from the other municipalities of Timor-Leste, which is further compounded by expensive and
erratic transportation between Oecusse and mainland Timor-Leste. Currently there are two ways to reach
mainland Timor-Leste from Oecusse – by sea or road. The ferry connecting Pante Makassar, the capital of
Oecusse, to Dili operates twice-weekly, takes thirteen hours to reach its destination and costs $40 one-way.
By road the journey to Dili can take 4-5 hours but requires all passengers to apply for a visa from the



                                                         100
Indonesian consulate in Pante Makassar at least three days in advance, at a cost of $50 per visa. The cost of
both methods is prohibitive to the majority of Oecusse residents.

Another potential barrier to internal migration to and from Oecusse is related to social and kinship linkages.
In Timor-Leste, migration is facilitated and to some extent driven by existing social networks, often
composed of familial and kinship relationships. Most internal migrants travelling to Dili from the
municipalities will already know or will find many members of their network within the city. Even if they do
not find members of their network, they will likely be able to integrate with another ethnic network which
share similar socio-linguistic traits, and who may be able to smooth their transition into urban living. This is
an option that is not so readily available for Oecusse residents who, despite being proud citizens of Timor-
Leste, nonetheless share strong socio-linguistic, cultural and economic links with the people of West
Timor.101

6.2.2 International migration

As an enclave region with close links to the people and economy of Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT), the
Indonesian region bordering Oecusse, it is perhaps unsurprising that international rather than internal
migration plays a more prominent role in Oecusse society. According to the most recent census, 1.5% or
approximately 960 Oecusse citizens are classified as living abroad. Oecusse is also host to an estimated 779
international migrants, a share of 4.83% of the total stock of international migrants in Timor-Leste. There is
no available data on the composition of Oecusse’s international migrant community; however 50% of all
international migrants in Timor-Leste are from Indonesia, around 10% are from China and 7% are from the
Philippines. This composition is likely replicated in Oecusse, with even more dominance of Indonesian
nationals.

Again, there is no specific data on destination countries for migrants from Oecusse; however datasets from
other countries indicate that major destination countries for people of Timorese origin102 include the U.K.
(14,000),103 Australia (10,750),104 and Portugal (1,776).105 International migration from Oecusse likely follows
these trends. Large-scale economic migration from Oecusse to Indonesia is not likely due to wage
differentials between Timor-Leste and Indonesia.

One factor encouraging small-scale, high frequency migration between Oecusse and NTT, however, is the
Border Crossing Pass system. This system was established in 2009 subsequent to an agreement between the


101 “Public sentiment in favour of some form of Special Status for Oecusse was initially expressed at community workshops
  held in each sub-district during May/June 2001 and subsequently at hearings of the Constitutional Commission in Oecusse. While
  people in Oecusse identify strongly with the nation of East Timor they also want to be free to exercise their traditional social
  and economic links with West Timor…The Constitution of the Democratic Republic of East Timor was adopted on 22 March 2002
  and recognizes the special status of Oecusse. Section 5.3- Decentralization ‘Oecusse Ambeno … shall enjoy special
  administrative and economic treatment.’ Section 71.2– Administrative Organization ‘Oecusse Ambeno shall be governed by a
  special administrative policy and economic regime.’” District Profile – Oecusse Enclave – Democratic Republic of East Timor,

  migration from Timor-Leste can only be found from countries that collect data on ‘Country of Origin’ as well as ‘Nationality’.

was to facilitate and regularize already well-
established irregular migration practices
practiced by communities on both sides of
the border in order to trade, conduct
customary practices and maintain kinship
and familial links. The agreement was also
designed to reduce the use of irregular
migration and smuggling routes known as
jalan tikus (‘mouse paths’). These jungle
footpaths crisscrossing the border, by-
passing official border posts, are used by
communities on both sides of the border for
family visits as well as to smuggle kerosene Source: NGO Belun’s Early Warning Response Mapping System,

6.2.3 Remittances

Remittances are becoming increasingly important for Timor-Leste109 - measured by the value of inward
remittances, labor is Timor-Leste’s second biggest export after coffee.110 Despite this, few studies have been
conducted on the pattern or usage of remittances in Timor-Leste, and these funds remain an untapped
resource in terms of community development. In a survey conducted for AusAid (now DFAT) on
remittances and microfinance in Timor-Leste in 2007, it was found that in terms of remittance behavior the

majority of households receiving remittances receive small but frequent amounts (see Table 6.2)111 In terms
of remittance usage and impact, the study states:

“It is clear that remittances have contributed to improved living standards and financial security for many households. Nearl y a
half of respondents reported spending more money on education as a result of receiving remittances, 29 per cent reported spending
more on food, 27 percent on housing improvements and 24 percent on clothing. Nearly a quarter reported increasing their monthly
savings allocations as a result of receiving remittances.”112

Despite these gains, many challenges remain in harnessing

An Oxfam food security baseline study also conducted in Source: Shuaib, Fikreth, ‘Timor-Leste Country

Oecusse practiced some form of income diversification.114 (eds.), Leveraging Remittances with Microfinance:

The same study also found however that “remittance was
                                                               2007
not common among households surveyed, with 7% (N=21)
reporting receiving remittances, mainly under USD50”.115 Compared with remittance behavior nationally, this
suggests that the vast majority of migrants from Oecusse are engaged in low-skill, low-wage labor migration
and are unable to remit large amounts.

6.3 Oecusse Special Social Economic Market Zone Migration Scenarios
Law no. 3/2014 passed on the 18th June 2014 legally established the Special Administrative Region of
Oecusse and Atauro, and the Special Zone of Social Market Economy therein. It is clear from this law and
from the plans that have been released that the ZEESM will include a significant upgrading of Oecusse’s
infrastructure, tourism sector and industrial activities. The authority of the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) has also been given vast powers to enact policies, regulations and executive orders in relation to the
administration of the region and in order to attract and facilitate investment.

Increased economic activity and opportunity will certainly provide an impetus for domestic and international
migration to the region at all stages of ZEESM implementation. However, from the publically available
documentation it is unclear how the government or SAR authority plans to manage such migration. In light
of this information vacuum, this report will now provide three possible migration scenarios in relation to the
implementation of the ZEESM in Oecusse.

6.3.1 Scenario 1 – Best case
       Central government and SAR authority clearly delineates respective powers in terms of migration
        management in Oecusse.
       SAR authority conducts a human resources review and projection establishing currently available
        human resources in Oecusse and predicted human resource needs in relation to implementation of
        the ZEESM.
       Central government or SAR authority conducts regular monitoring and analysis of Oecusse labor
        market.
       Based on this analysis the government or SAR authority establishes a clear immigration policy for
        Oecusse, facilitating the regular migration of skilled and semi-skilled migration as necessary and
        appropriate.
       Well-managed labor migration contributes to the development of Oecusse, the well-being and skills
        development of its residents and the protection of immigrants.
       Investments and improvements are made to basic services, particularly health and social security, to
        account for any increased burden as a result of migration to Oecusse. Companies involved in hiring
        migrant workers provide adequate insurance and measures to promote health and safety.

6.3.2 Scenario 2 – Worst case

      Central government and SAR authority fail to delineate respective responsibilities and powers in
       terms of migration management in Oecusse. SAR authority is forced to use unofficial channels to
       facilitate the required levels of migration leading to overall degradation of the established
       immigration system.
      No analysis of Oecusse’s human resources capacity or needs is conducted.
      No immigration policy is established for Oecusse. Regular labor migration to the enclave is not
       facilitated.
      There is large-scale irregular migration to Oecusse. Labor migrants work without the correct
       documentation and are subject to abuse and exploitation.
      Trafficking networks are established and thrive, trafficking women, men, girls and boys to Oecusse
       for the purpose of labor and sexual exploitation.
      Conflict erupts between locals and migrants (international and internal) as a result of tensions and
       resentments relating to local exclusion from the labor market, community disruption, cultural
       differences, and/or historical tensions (between Indonesians and Timorese and between eastern and
       western Timorese).
      No benefit of labor migration is accrued by Oecusse residents or migrants.
      No investments or improvements are made to basic services in Oecusse leads to overstretch and
       migrant exclusion.

6.3.3 Scenario 3 – Business as Usual

        Central government retains overall responsibility for migration management. SAR Authority
         facilitates the regularization of individual skilled and semi-skilled migrants with no significant impact
         on the integrity of the established immigration system.
        Data on Oecusse’s labor market dynamics remains under-utilized in the formulation of employment
         and immigration policies.
        Immigration policy, where apparent, remains ad hoc and on the basis of popularly-held beliefs rather
         than economic data and analysis.
        There will be medium-to-high levels of irregular migration to Oecusse, with associated levels of labor
         exploitation, particularly of migrants at the lower end of the skills spectrum.
        There will be some trafficking of men, women, girls and boys for the purpose of labor and sexual
         exploitation.
        There will be low-level tensions and resentments between local community and migrants,
         occasionally resulting in sporadic, localized outbursts (fights, xenophobia, intimidation etc.).
        There will be limited gains resulting from migration for migrants and host communities. Companies
         involved in construction will gain from labor exploitation of irregular migrant workers.
        Limited investment and improvement of basic services. Pressure on existing services will be
         somewhat relieved by provision of some services by employers, NGOs and/or private service
         providers.

6.4 Conclusions
From the analysis of migration to and from Oecusse as well as each of these possible scenarios, we can draw
some conclusions as to the likely impact of migration as a result of ZEESM development. Firstly, it is likely
that the central government will retain overall control of migration management, including to Oecusse.
However, SAR authority involvement obtaining correct documentation for specific groups of migrants may
confuse the overall chain of command in terms of immigration controls in Oecusse. Some data has been
collected on the Oecusse labor market; however this will likely be under-utilized in the development of
immigration policies. Given Oecusse’s relatively porous border controls and history of irregular migration
routes, we can expect to see relatively high-levels of irregular migration, fueled by a demand for skilled and
semi-skilled workers as a result of ZEESM development. Human trafficking is a phenomenon Timor-Leste is
still getting to grips with;116 therefore without additional measures there will likely be low-to-medium levels of
trafficking of men, women, boys and girls to Oecusse for the purpose of labor and sexual exploitation. Some
sporadic, localized inter-communal tensions should be expected by the SAR authority as a result of perceived
inequalities in treatment and pay between local and migrant workers. These tensions will likely be lessened
thanks to the close cultural links between residents of Oecusse and Indonesians; however there may be no
such mediating factor in relations between locals and migrants from other countries (e.g. Chinese and
Filipinos). Given the scale and sophistication of many of the projects planned as part of the ZEESM,
construction companies will rely heavily of the expertise of skilled and semi-skilled migrants. SAR officials
have stated that they will try and ensure a 3:1 Timorese-foreign worker ratio at construction sites; however it

remains to be seen how this will be monitored and enforced. Given the influx of migrant workers to Oecusse,
basic services will likely be strained. Representatives of the SAR authority stated that there were plans to build
a new clinic for migrant workers, but it is likely that local public hospitals and other services will be
nonetheless relied on especially in emergency situations.

Overall, the SAR authority must strike a careful balance between the need to complete the projects on time
and to an acceptable standard, with the expectations of local people in terms of employment and skills
development. The SAR authority should also not try to bypass existing immigration or border control
systems, but should instead use its influence to improve the transparency and efficiency of existing systems.
Finally, special efforts should also be made to prevent and combat human trafficking – a crime which not
only ruins the lives of the affected individuals, but has the potential to derail the entire ZEESM initiative.
