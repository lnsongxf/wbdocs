BUILDING CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT
THE
      Nagoya Protocol
                A REVIEW OF GEF SUPPORT
Preface
                              The entry into force of the Nagoya Protocol during the 12 th Conference of
                              the Parties to the CBD is a historical milestone that opens the doors for a
                              global commitment on accessing and sharing benefits arising out of the
                              utilization of genetic resources. The loss of biological resources and their
                              genetic makeup, along with the knowledge of Indigenous Peoples and Local
                              Communities (ILCs) on how to use many of these resources, are a significant
                              concern. The knowledge on the use of biological resources by ILCs has been
                              built up over generations, making it essential that we protect them. Failing to
Dr. Naoko Ishii               do so, will put these communities and the biological resources at risk. These
CEO and Chairperson           biological resources provide a wide range of products and services for human
Global Environment Facility   benefit including products such as medicines, cosmetics, and ingredients of
                              interest to the food and beverage industries. The genetic variability of plants,
                              animals and microbes may hold the key to many challenges ahead of us, and
                              we need to protect them for our own good as well as for the generations to
                              come. It is critical to unlock the potential benefits to be gained by accessing
                              genetic resources, making use of them, and sharing the benefits derived from
                              their utilization.

                              The GEF has supported ABS for more than a decade. As the financial
                              mechanism of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) the GEF has
                              assisted parties in building the capacities to comply with the third objective of
                              the Convention, “the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of
                              the utilization of genetic resources, including by appropriate access to genetic
                              resources and by appropriate transfer of relevant technologies, taking into
                              account all rights over those resources and to technologies, and by appropriate
                              funding”. GEF’s support began in 2002 following a request by the Conference
                              of the Parties to the CBD in its 6th meeting in The Hague. With the adoption
                              and entry into force of The “Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources
                              and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to
                              the Convention on Biological Diversity ”, the commitment to support parties to
                              comply with the legally binding protocol is stronger than ever. Indeed, in the
                              Biodiversity strategy for GEF-6 (2014-2018) there is a specific program to assist
                              countries to implement the Nagoya Protocol.

                              In this publication, you will find a summary of the work on ABS supported by the
                              GEF and some of the challenges and opportunities ahead of us. I invite parties
                              to the CBD to continue building capacities to comply with the Protocol and
                              make the most from the vast terrestrial and marine environments around the
                              world. The GEF Secretariat is ready to engage with countries and agencies to
                              make the most of this opportunity.

    SUMMARY

    The GEF has invested more than $ 60 million          fair and equitable sharing of benefits. With
    and leveraged $120 million in co-financing           the adoption of the Nagoya Protocol in 2010,
    in over 100 countries in support of the third        the GEF provided financial resources for the
    objective of the Convention on Biodiversity          ratification and implementation of the protocol

    The GEF started supporting capacity building         and research institutions. These groups are
    projects on Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS          searching for genetic resources of interest to

    the COP to provide financial resources to            crop-protection, manufacturing/textile ,
    assist Parties with the implementation of the        cosmetics and food-and-beverages. Terrestrial
    Bonn Guidelines, the voluntary provisions            and marine organisms are being used as
    that allowed countries to implement the              the source of genetic material and obtained
    provisions of the Convention on ABS. The GEF         in National or Regional Parks or through

    this strategy, the GEF supported a number            financial and technical assistance for the
    of national and regional projects to establish       ratification and implementation of the Nagoya
    measures that promote access and benefit-            Protocol and for pilot projects leading to
    sharing agreements that recognize the core           legally binding agreements between users and
    ABS principles of Prior Informed Consent             providers of genetic resources during its 6th

Following the requests by the COP to provide financial                                GEF supported capacity building of governments for
resources to assist Parties with the implementation of the                            meeting their obligations under Article 15 of the CBD, as
Bonn Guidelines on ABS, the GEF-3 Biodiversity Strategy                               well as building capacity within key stakeholder groups,

project in Panama will concentrate on the discovery of
nature-based products for the pharmaceutical and
agrochemical industries and promote the conservation
of genetic resources in the Protected Areas System of
Panama, with particular emphasis on Coiba National Park.
The project in Fiji will allow a joint venture to strengthen
bio-prospecting through state of the art technology, the
identification of highly active compounds of interest to
the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and
make ABS Agreements and Benefit Sharing operational
by linking bio-prospecting with marine conservation

                                       The Global Environment Facility is a partnership for international
                                       cooperation where 183 countries work together with international
                                       institutions, civil society organizations and the private sector, to
                                       address global environmental issues.

                                       Since 1991, the GEF has provided $12.5 billion in grants and
                                       leveraged $58 billion in co-financing for 3,690 projects in 165
                                       developing countries. For 23 years, developed and developing
                                       countries alike have provided these funds to support activities related
                                       to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land
                                       degradation, and chemicals and waste in the context of development
                                       projects and programs.

                                       Through its Small Grants Programme (SGP) the GEF has made more
                                       than 20,000 grants to civil society and community based organizations
                                       for a total of $1 billion.

                                       Among the major results of these investments, the GEF has set up
                                       protected areas around the world equal roughly to the area of Brazil;
                                       reduced carbon emissions by 2.3 billion tonnes; eliminated the use of
                                       ozone depleting substances in Central and Eastern Europe and
                                       Central Asia; transformed the management of 33 major river basins
                                       and one-third of the world’s large marine ecosystems; slowed the
                                       advance of desertification in Africa by improving agricultural
