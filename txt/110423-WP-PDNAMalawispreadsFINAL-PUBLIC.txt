   has been well documented. But few could have predicted what has befallen Malawi in the last two
   years. A once-in-500-years flood in 2015, which impacted more than 1.1 million people, has now
                                                                                                           The projections of the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee released in June 2016 are
   been followed by a devastating drought that is expected to leave at least 6.5 million people food

   The Government of Malawi (GoM) has taken immediate steps to provide emergency relief to millions
   of its citizens in collaboration with its domestic and international partners. And with an eye toward

                        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

                        Malawi’s Exposure and Vulnerability to Floods and Droughts
                        ••   Malawi is highly exposed to natural disasters, such as floods and droughts. Available records indicate
                             that in the last 100 years, the country has experienced about 20 droughts. In the last 36 years alone,
                             the country has experienced eight major droughts, affecting over 24 million people in total. The
                             impact, frequency and spread of drought in Malawi have intensified in the past four decades and are
                             likely to worsen with climate change, compounded by other factors, such as population growth and
                             environmental degradation. Droughts and dry spells in Malawi cause, on average, a 1 percent loss
                             of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually. Most drought episodes have occurred in El Niño years,
                             during which the country experiences rainfall deficits.

                        The Present Drought
                        ••   The 2015/2016 agricultural season was greatly affected by strong El Nino conditions and resulted
                             in erratic rains and prolonged dry spells across most parts of the country. In particular, the country
                             experienced a delayed start of the 2015-16 agricultural season by two to four weeks followed
                             by erratic and below average rains in November and December 2015. Prolonged dry spells have
                             resulted in severe crop failure, particularly in the Southern Region and parts of the Central Region.
                             The drought has been characterized as an agricultural drought, as in large parts of the country
                             precipitation commenced too late and was too erratic or occurred over a short period of time. In
                             response to the dry spells, the Government of Malawi declared a state of disaster in April 2016, and
                             a Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) was initiated in mid-May under the leadership of the
                             Government of Malawi, with the assistance of the World Bank and the United Nations (UN).

Humanitarian Consequences and Response                                                                            60 percent of the losses can be attributed to crops. The irrigation and water supply and sanitation
••   At least 6.5 million people (or 39 percent of the population) in Malawi’s 24 drought-affected districts      sectors are the second and third most affected, making up 8.7 and 5.4 percent of the total effects,
     will not be able to meet their food requirements during the 2016/17 consumption period, according            respectively. A summary of damages, losses and recovery needs across sectors is provided in the
     to the 2016 Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC) Report on food security. It is                  table and figures below.
     projected that in the first quarter of 2017, 28 percent of the population will not receive or have
     access to the minimum food and non-food requirements.

••   In the declaration of the‘state of national disaster’, President of Malawi made an appeal for humanitarian
     relief assistance from the international donor community, the UN, non-governmental organizations
     (NGOs), the private sector as well as individuals. The total amount of financial assistance mobilized
     to date by the government and international partners is USD 149.36 million and has covered the
     following areas in 24 districts: food security, agriculture, nutrition, protection and education. In
     response to the current situation and in preparation for the 2016/2017 lean season, the Department
     of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) has led the preparation of a Food Insecurity Response
     Plan (FIRP), on behalf of the government under the cluster system and in collaboration with key
     UN agencies. The main strategic objective of the FIRP is to provide immediate life-saving and life-
     sustaining assistance to the drought-affected population. The total required amount by the FIRP to
     cover all the 6.5 million affected people across the 24 districts has been estimated at USD 380.056
     million.


PDNA Objectives and Scope
••   The main objectives of the PDNA are to estimate the physical, socio-economic, and human impacts
     of the drought, develop sector recovery strategies and identify the corresponding recovery needs.
     These needs are based on a broad 6-pillared Drought Recovery Strategy that underpins and shapes
     all sector needs analyses. Sector needs have been further summarized, prioritized and sequenced
     in the form of a Drought Recovery Action Plan that provides a multi-sector framework of recovery
     interventions over the next three years. This Action Plan is a results framework for monitoring recovery
     in various sectors that will be further expanded into a programmatic monitoring and evaluation
     system during implementation.

••   The PDNA also analyzes the challenges faced and lessons learnt from the ongoing drought response
     and provides a recommendations for improved future drought resilience through a risk reduction
     strategy that builds upon existing instruments, institutional mechanisms, and provisions for risk
     reduction in the country.

••   The sectoral scope of the assessment includes: agriculture (rain-fed crops, livestock and fisheries);
     food security; water ( – including irrigated crops, water resources, and water supply and sanitation);
     health; nutrition; energy; environment; education; transport; social protection; industry and
     commerce; disaster risk reduction (DRR). An analysis of the overall human and social impact as well
     as the macroeconomic impact of the drought was also undertaken.

••   The geographical scope of assessment includes all 24 drought-affected districts in the Southern,
     Central and Northern Regions, while the temporal scope to assess damages and losses from the
     drought is from October 2015 to March 2016, with losses projected up to March 2017.


Summary of PDNA Results
••   With damages amounting to USD 36.6 million and losses (projected to March 2017) amounting to
     USD 329.4 million, the total effect of the drought is estimated at USD 365.9 million. The productive
     sectors account for 81 percent of the effects, while the social and physical sectors account for 10
     percent and 9 percent, respectively. The agriculture sector - including crops, livestock and fisheries
     - was the most affected, with damages and losses accounting for 70 percent of the total. Just over

••   Malawi could benefit from improved early warning, risk identification and risk assessment systems.
     Emergency preparedness also needs to be drastically strengthened and contingency plans need to
     be updated, reviewed, exercised and better aligned to the budget cycle.

••   Response capacity could benefit from more dedicated sources of domestic funding, better
     coordination and strengthened Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs). Disaster Recovery could be
     improved through a more systematic, multi-sectoral approach modelled on the recovery to the
     2015 floods. It is envisioned that the National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) can be a model
     for guiding future recovery efforts, including those related to the 2015-16 drought.

••   Based on past lessons learnt and on an analysis of the challenges of its DRR system highlighted
     by the recent drought, a four-pronged strategic approach to further strengthen the DRR system
     is recommended, including: (a) strengthening the early warning systems (EWSs) promote risk
     identification and assessments; (b) strengthening emergency preparedness, response and recovery
     consist of the following elements; (c) mainstreaming risk reduction, and; (d) strengthening
     institutional capacity.

••   The extensive history of work on risk management for drought and food security in Malawi,
     combined with work that has been done on flood risk management, create a strong foundation for
     moving forward with the design and implementation of a National Disaster Risk Financing Strategy.
     This will help improve the government’s ability to clarify and meet obligations arising from shocks
     while minimizing threats to development progress and fiscal stability.                                    1.

sea level. In this area the Zomba and Mulanje mountain peaks rise to respective heights of over 2,000
and 3,000 m. The country’s climate is sub-tropical, but the influence of its high elevation means that
temperatures are relatively cool. The warm-wet season stretches from November to April, during which
95 percent of the annual precipitation takes place. Average annual rainfall varies from 725 mm to 2,500
mm with Lilongwe having an average of 900 mm, Blantyre 1,127 mm, Mzuzu 1,289 mm and Zomba 1,433
mm. A cool, dry winter season is evident from May to August with mean temperatures varying between
17 and 27 degrees Celsius, and temperatures falling between 4 and 10 degrees Celsius. A hot, dry season
lasts from September to October with average temperatures varying between 25 and 37 degrees Celsius.

The climate in Malawi is largely decided by the oscillations of the Inter-Tropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ) and inter-annual variability is further influenced by the El Nino Southern Oscillation
(ENSO). Wet season rainfalls depend on the position of the ITCZ, which can vary in its timing and intensity
from year to year. Inter-annual variability in wet-season rainfall in Malawi is also strongly influenced by
the Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures, which can vary from one year to another due to variations
in patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation, such as the ENSO. The influence of the ENSO on the
climate of Malawi is difficult to predict as it is located between two regions of opposite response to the
El Niño phenomenon. Eastern equatorial Africa tends to receive above average rainfall during El Niño
conditions, whilst south-eastern Africa often experiences below average rainfall. The opposite response
pattern occurs during La Niña episodes. The response of the climate in these two regions and the extent
of the area affected vary with each El Niño or La Niña year.

hailstorms, strong winds and landslides, and also geo-hazards, notably earthquakes. Between
1979 and 2008, disasters have affected nearly 21.7 million people and have resulted in over 2,500

casualties. Malawi’s vulnerability to hydro-meteorological hazards is primarily linked to specific
geo-climatic factors: (i) the influence of the El Niño and La Niña phenomena on the country’s climate;
and (ii) the tropical cyclones developing in the Mozambique Channel resulting in highly erratic rainfall
patterns and unequal distribution of rainfall causing localized dry spells as well as floods. The intensity
and frequency of climate-related hazards in Malawi have been increasing in recent decades and factors         3.1	Overview

3.2	       Rainfall Analysis
Effective planting rains during the 2015-16 season were delayed, erratic, and below average.
Planting rains started around mid-December 2015 over most areas of Malawi. They were erratic in
distribution and amounts in most parts of the country. Figure 6 and Figure 7 describe the monthly
and decadal rainfall observed in 2015/2016 in comparison to the long-term average. They illustrate
the decadal rainfall starting in October 2015 to April 2016, illustrating the deficit of the 2015-16 rainfall
season.

From October 2015 to March 2016, Malawi received significantly below average rainfall in the
Southern and Central regions. During October to December 2015, 32.8 percent less than average
rainfall was reported across the affected districts, with 12 out of 18 districts reporting below average
rainfall. The situation worsened from January to March 2016, the most critical months for agricultural

                       UNDERTAKING THE PDNA –
                       APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY


                               The PDNA is a methodology for joint assessment and recovery planning assessing the
                       impact of a disaster and defining a strategy for recovery, including the estimation of the required
                       financial resources. The assessment evaluates the disaster effects, pulling together information on the
                       physical damages of the disaster and its socio-economic aspects (economic losses, changes in service
                       delivery and governance caused by the disasters, and increased risks and vulnerabilities) as well as the
                       overall impact the disaster has on the macro-economic and human development context of a country.
                       On the basis of this information, the PDNA determines the needs and recovery priorities in relation to the
                       disaster and produces a consolidated report that lends to a resilient recovery strategy.

                       The PDNA is a government-led and government-owned process. Technical support and facilitation
                       may be provided by the European Union (EU), World Bank and the UN based on the joint declaration of
                       2008 on post-crisis response8. The PDNA process involves the participation of the affected population,
                       local authorities, NGOs, donors, civil society and the private sector. Given the broad range of organizations,
                       individuals and communities that need to be involved, cooperation and coordination are essential for
                       achieving a participatory and comprehensive PDNA.

Data Collection and Validation: The key source of information for the estimation of damages and
needs were data provided by government sector focal points. Baseline and secondary data were
collected from the respective ministries and departments and the data on food-insecure populations
by MVAC. Data validation techniques included field visits to affected districts, interviews with relevant
stakeholders, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and desk reviews. This was followed by remote sensing
based validation of key impact data for crops, livestock, water resources, and environment (see Box 1).
Further validation of data was performed using process verification techniques and empirical plausibility
checks. Using such techniques, a drought reduction factor was applied to many of the sectors to ensure
that damages and losses captured by the PDNA were those attributable to the drought. For example,
in the crops sector, analysis from remote sensing data indicated that 62 percent of the maize loss in
2015/2016 could be attributed to the drought.

Alignment with Humanitarian Assessments and Sector Planning Documents: the PDNA
complements the national and international rapid humanitarian assessments, where the 2016/2017 FIRP
informed and reinforced the PDNA exercise. Sector teams (particularly food security, agriculture, health,
nutrition, water supply and sanitation, and education) liaised with counterparts working on the FIRP to
ensure that: (i) there are no overlaps between the FIRP and the PDNA; (ii) there are no gaps uncovered by
the FIRP and the PDNA; and (iii) there is strategic alignment between the FIRP and the PDNA.

The Government of Malawi provided existing documentation prepared by some ministries such as master
plans and investments plans. These documents were distributed to the corresponding sector teams to          5.

building-back-better concept in order to build resilience to future climate shocks. Priority for rehabilitation
and maintenance will be given to areas that are hard hit by the drought and which will require various
relief initiatives from the respective sectors, more especially for food and water supply.

The reconstruction interventions for the transport sector can be seen as medium to long-term
measures that provide the necessary infrastructure to allow for a timely and rapid delivery of relief
items in the event of future disasters. Short-term interventions for the transport sector might relate to
the provision of additional trucking capacity to deliver relief items on time to affected communities. All
transport sector interventions related to the construction of basic transport infrastructure should involve
high manual labor public work schemes to create additional employment opportunities for affected
communities. Those schemes can be integrated and coordinated with the safety net schemes like cash-
for-work programs.


5.11	Energy
The 2015-16 drought has affected electricity generation, as Malawi’s electricity is largely
generated by hydropower. The Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (ESCOM) Limited is the only
power utility company that is engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
in the country. The drought has led to a loss in: (i) revenues from electricity generation, (ii) fuel sales

                       MACROECONIMIC ANALYSIS

                               The drought hit Malawi at a time when the country’s economy was particularly vulnerable
                       due to the consecutive effects of the 2015 floods and 2015/2016 drought. The impact of the
                       drought is estimated at USD 295.2 million, which is equal to 5.6 percent of Malawi’s GDP. This
                       chapter describes the macroeconomic impact of the drought, specifically the effects on the GDP, the
                       inflation rate, and the external and fiscal positions. Part 1 gives a background on the overall economic
                       context of Malawi in recent years and part 2 describes the impact on the macroeconomic indicators. The
                       analysis focuses on the first and second stage effects of the disaster. In the first stage, only the isolated
                       effects of the disaster in terms of changes in economic flows are considered, assuming no recovery
                       and reconstruction interventions. In the second stage, the economic impact of recovery activities is
                       estimated.


                       6.1	    Economic Context
                       Malawi’s economy is largely agrarian, with the sector contributing about 30 percent to GDP,
                       making Malawi’s economy particularly vulnerable to climate shocks. While Malawi was on a strong
                       growth path in 2013 and 2014, the consecutive disasters in 2015 and 2016 substantially affected the
                       economy. Since 2010, the pattern of growth has been volatile. The economy experienced a slump in
                       2011-2012 mainly owing to fuel and exchange rate shortages. In 2013 and 2014 growth was strong at 6.3
                       and 6.2 percent respectively. This was premised on growth in agriculture, a good harvest arising from a
                       generally favorable weather pattern in the 2013/14 growing season, as well as the availability of foreign
                       exchange and fuel, which bolstered growth in the industry and service sectors.

                       Annual average inflation rates have hovered above 20 percent in recent years, reaching a peak
                       of 27.3 percent in 2013 and declining to 21.3 percent in 2015. The inflation rate shot up in 2012,

                       DROUGHT RECOVERY STRATEGY


                              The formulation of a recovery strategy should take into consideration that the drought
                       hit the country right around when it was on the heels of recovering from the impacts of the
                       devastating floods of 2015. The occurrence of these two events in such a short time span has further
                       undermined the coping capacity of the affected population and increased their vulnerability to future
                       shocks. The underlying principle of the PDNA is that the recovery interventions will complement and
                       build on existing strategies and programs in order to limit the duplication of efforts but rather create
                       synergies among the different ongoing interventions and relevant stakeholders in order to maximize
                       impact. Consistent with the above, the recovery interventions articulated in this PDNA are also fully
                       aligned with sector development and investments plans. In so doing, the PDNA Recovery Strategy
                       will concurrently provide guidance for the re-programming of existing initiatives to areas where the
                       strengthening of programs is required and identify “gap areas” not already being covered by current and
                       pipeline activities where the development of new interventions is necessary.

                       The Government of Malawi is adopting a risk-reduction and people-centered approach to
                       drought recovery with the vision of strengthening the resilience of the population and promoting
                       sustainable development. The goal of this Drought Recovery Strategy is not only to promote recovery
                       from the current drought but also to encourage the adoption of risk-reducing measures that mitigate
                       the impact of future drought events. This approach is in line with the Government’s Breaking the cycles
                       of food insecurity in Malawi for greater development impacts plan, which is currently being developed
                       under the leadership of DoDMA as the National Resilience Strategy for Malawi. In fact, the recovery
                       interventions identified by this PDNA are in full alignment with the plan’s overall objective to “help make
                       Malawi resilient to disasters and break the cycle of food insecurity”, and directly linked to the three broad
                       objectives of the plan to: (i) promote irrigation for food security and nutrition and drive export; (ii) reduce
                       the effects of floods and occurrence of drought; and (iii) enhance effective EWSs.

UN and that was launched on June 28, 2016. While the FIRP’s objective is to address the humanitarian
needs generated by the crisis and set the basis for recovery, the PDNA focuses more on those medium to              ••   Integrity, transparency, and accountability in the management of funds made available for
long-term measures that will ensure the full recovery of the affected population and support resilience                  recovery;
building. Such strategic alignment between the FIRP and PDNA ensures that there are no critical overlaps            ••   Promotion of coordination among all sectorial ministries and relevant partners involved in
between the two plans and that no gaps remain uncovered.                                                                 recovery.

The Government of Malawi and its partners recognize that the recovery has to be a multi-sectorial
and multi-pronged effort. Therefore, interventions will be planned and implemented simultaneously               8.2.1	 Increasing Productivity in Agriculture and Irrigation Development
in all those sectors and aspects of life that have been affected by the drought according to the level of
impact of the event. While the government will lead the recovery, this process will also be supported by
other stakeholders of Malawian society, including the private sector, NGOs, philanthropic organizations                                  FIGURE 18: STRATEGIC PILLARS OF DROUGHT RECOVERY
and international partners, including bilateral agencies and INGOs. The PDNA sectorial assessments
identify the recovery needs and strategy for each affected sector and provide the basis for developing
detailed recovery interventions. The overall recovery strategy is outlined in this chapter, including
guiding principles, key stakeholders, institutional framework, geographical coverage and timeline, sector
strategies, and next steps after the PDNA. Priorities in the interventions need to be established on the
basis of the resilience of the districts in terms of differences in poverty and vulnerability, in addition to
the degree of effects that they have suffered.


8.1	     Guiding Principles for Recovery
The recovery strategy will be guided by a number of principles aimed at improving the quality and
impact of recovery, emphasizing equity and inclusion, and promoting risk reduction. These guiding
principles are as follows:

    ••   Integration of DRR concerns in all sectorial recovery initiatives with the aim of building back
         better;

    ••   Implementation of the recovery interventions in a way that links them to both the

surveillance for better prevention and early mitigation of risk factors.


8.2.3	 Enhancing People’s Capacity to Withstand Risk and Building Resilience
The objective of social protection is to help households manage risks and cope with adverse events.
Social protection programs have been established in Malawi but they are still at an initial stage and
have limited coverage. Following the drought, Malawian households have been facing food and income
shocks resulting in a greater need for social protection. Excluding food support under the food security
sector, social protection interventions comprise the largest need (more than 20 percent) and span across
the social protection and agriculture sectors. The Drought Recovery Strategy seeks to promote the
adoption and expansion of social protection where it is absent or where coverage and levels of benefits
are low in terms of social assistance and work-related measures. The social protection interventions
proposed under the PDNA include: (i) social cash transfers (under social protection); (ii) public works
– cash-for-work programs (under social protection); and (iii) public works – input-for-assets programs
(under agriculture). While sustaining their recovery from the drought, these interventions are expected
to reduce the vulnerability of Malawians in the long term and strengthen their ability to withstand future
shocks.

                       9.1	       Mainstreaming and Adequate Resourcing of the DRR Agenda
                       DRR is a key cross-cutting theme for drought recovery across all sectors, but for it to be more
                       effectively and sustainably implemented in the medium to long term, it needs to be meaningfully
                       mainstreamed across broader sector policies and development planning. The upcoming drought
                       response provides an opportunity and potential impetus for such mainstreaming and implementation
                       of the DRR agenda, as it is already embedded in key strategies, policies and frameworks in Malawi such
                       as the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy 2011-2016 (MGDS II), the Disaster Preparedness and
                       Relief (DPR) Act of 1991 and the 2015 National Disaster Risk Management (NDRM) Policy.

                       Building the capacity of the national DRR system21 and providing it with the necessary financial
                       resources and implementation capacity will be critical towards the effective implementation of
                       Malawi’s overall DRR strategy, as well as the drought-focused risk reduction measures proposed
                       in this assessment. The institutional framework for DRR is comprised of the Secretary to the Vice
                       President and Commissioner for Disaster Management Affairs, the National Disaster Preparedness
                       and Relief Committee (NDPRC), Civil Protection Committees (CPCs) and DoDMA, which were created
                       through the DPR Act of 1991. Without commensurate financial and implementation resources, the
                       existing DRR-related institutional and policy frameworks will not be able to extend the support needed
                       to pull Malawi out of the vicious cycle of droughts and floods in the years to come.

                       10.
                       THE WAY FORWARD

                       10.1	 Key Stakeholders
                       The government has played a leading role in conducting the PDNA and will be leading the development
                       and implementation of the recovery interventions and facilitating the participation and coordination
                       of all other relevant national and international stakeholders. The government will also ensure the
                       management of the financial resources allocated to recovery and the monitoring of the outcomes of the
                       interventions. The government will be involved through its sector-line ministries at both the national
                       and district levels. District-level authorities will play a key role in the delivery of interventions at the
                       community level. Such a responsibility would entail local governments to augment their capacity to take
                       on additional roles. International partners present in Malawi will support the efforts of the government in
                       the implementation of the recovery process as per their respective sector-specific roles. The government
                       will ensure that these interventions are coordinated and that they align to existing government plans
                       and strategies and that they do not duplicate and/or overlap with existing strategies.


                       10.2	 Institutional Framework
                       The Government of Malawi will implement its drought recovery plan through relevant line departments,
                       with a designated lead coordination agency in charge of coordination. The DRR elements will be
                       coordinated by DODMA, as the Government of Malawi’s agency responsible for coordinating and
                       directing the implementation of DRM programs in the country.

                       A monitoring and evaluation system will be established while building capacity to carry out this task. Line
                       ministries will be implementing interventions in their own sectors and the MoFEPD will be managing
                       the resources mobilized for the recovery interventions.

10.3	 Geographical Coverage and Timeline
The recovery plan will be implemented in all 24 drought-affected districts and will be prioritized based
on impact proportionality and other criteria. In addition to these districts, certain components of the
recovery interventions will be implemented at the national level. The timeframe considers the period
that will be sufficient to complete the necessary short-term interventions in response to the current
drought and medium to long-term measures aimed at strengthening the resilience of the people to
future crisis with an overarching expected duration of three years.


10.4	 Next Steps in Follow-up to the PDNA
••   Programming Review: While the recovery interventions for each sector are articulated in the
     respective chapters, this PDNA recognizes that a more thorough analysis of existing interventions
     and programs in each of the assessed areas and of existing funding is required to avoid overlaps and
     the inefficient use of resources. Due to time limitations of this exercise, such an analysis could not
     be undertaken and it is recommended that the Government of Malawi leads this process upon the
     termination of the PDNA.

••   Coordination: Going forward towards drought recovery programming, it will be important to
     ensure the harmonization between agencies involved in needs planning and execution and the
     government, coordinating and prioritizing fund flows. There is a need to bridge efforts from relief
     and recovery, and DRR and the organizations working in this area.
                                                                                                              ANNEX I: DROUGHT
••   Prioritization: The PDNA also recognizes that the analysis provided will support and inform the
     discussion on resilience building that the government is currently leading by providing further focus
                                                                                                              RECOVERY ACTION PLAN
     on areas that need to be prioritized to ensure sustainable development and resilience building in
     the country.

                       Background
                       Malawi’s agriculture sector remains an important component of the country’s economy and is key
                       to several country development objectives including economic growth and poverty reduction;
                       contributing to food security by ensuring sufficient availability and reliable access to food for all. The
                       sector accounts for nearly 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), employs over 80 percent of
                       the country’s workforce, and provides over 80 percent of the country’s export earnings (GoM, Annual
                       Economic Report 2014).

                       The country’s agricultural sector is composed of two main sub-sectors namely the smallholder subsector
                       and the estate subsector which contribute 70 percent and 30 percent to national agriculture GDP
                       respectively (GoM 2011). The majority of smallholders in Malawi produce maize on a subsistence basis
                       on an average land holding size of around 0.5ha. The country’s high population density has placed
                       intense pressure on average farm-holdings for smallholders necessitating the importance of productivity.
                       Smallholder food crop production also includes cassava, sweet potato, groundnut, pigeon pea, and
                       a range of vegetable and condiment crops. The remaining 30 percent of farm operators are found in
                       the larger-scale, more commercially-oriented estate farm subsector, which contributes significantly to
                       agricultural growth, especially in terms of agricultural exports.

                       Despite the relevance of agriculture to Malawi’s economy, the agricultural sector faces other numerous
                       and important challenges that impede its transformation. Some of these challenges include:

                           i.	   Unavailability of breeding stock and limited regulatory animal health services;

                           ii.	 Over-dependence on rain-fed farming which leads to uncertainty in the face of climate change,
                                limited access to finance;

                       FOOD SECURITY


                       Background
                       Food insecurity in Malawi remains alarmingly high with 25 percent of the population being food insecure,
                       even in the absence of shocks. The cyclical lean season responses have grown to an average of over one
                       million people per year since 2012, reaching a high of 2.86 million, 18 percent of the population, in 2016.
                       Meanwhile, malnutrition remains at 42 percent, with stunting of children under 5 reaching 53 percent,
                       the 5th highest in the world. Child under-nutrition remains a key challenge according to the 2015 Cost of
                       Hunger report which indicates that 10 percent of GDP is lost due to stunting. Reducing the caseload of
                       food insecure Malawians, while creating more resilient food systems that are able to make food available,
                       accessible and safe for all people in a sustainable manner remains a major challenge in the country.

                       The agricultural sector in Malawi is characterized by low productivity, lack of predictability with high
                       risks of climactic and external shocks. This is particularly critical in a country where the 90 percent of
                       national food production and availability rely on a single rain-fed cropping season and most farmers are
                       small-holders practicing subsistence agriculture. Despite the investments in the sector, low productivity
                       remains constrained by limited access to improved inputs and by depletion of soil quality due lack of
                       crop rotation.

                       Maize is the main cereal produced in Malawi and also the main staple food of the country. Smallholder
                       farmers usually cultivate on less than 1 hectare of land, producing 60 percent food and 40 percent
                       cash crops. Other cereals such as millet, sorghum, and rice are also produced and consumed as well as
                       potatoes, beans and cassava, which is regarded as a staple food in most parts of the northern region.
                       However, despite many calls to food and agriculture diversification, maize remains Malawians’ main
                       consumption and production. Most of the maize produced in the country is for household consumption
                       and to meet subsistence needs. In fact, only about 15 percent of the maize that is produced in the
                       country is actually marketed. According to reports from the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water
                       Development (MoAIWD) the country has been able to produce the above-mentioned crops more than
                       their requirement in most years during the past ten years.

Challenges in the Sector
The main challenge in the sector is to ensure that food production is enhanced and that diversification
is adopted at household level. There have been many communication strategies to enhance food
diversion, but with little success as most people in Malawi still regard maize as their main food.

There is low agricultural productivity due to overreliance on rain fed production in the country. This
being the case, the drought has affected the food security status of the country. This requires resilience
building in the medium to long term to ensure food self-sufficiency. Additionally, low adoption levels of
improved agricultural technologies due to inaccessibility, unaffordability and high illiteracy levels among
the farming community.

Implementation Strategy
The Ministry of Agriculture will implement interventions in the food security sector. Communication
campaigns, data collection strengthening and EWS will be taken forward under the lead of the Ministry
of Agriculture, in close collaboration with sectorial ministries such as Health, Education, Environment
and the Department of Disaster Management (DoDMA).

Existing Sectoral Policies and Major Programs
There are no specific sectorial policies for Food Security given that this is a cross-cutting sector to
which agriculture, irrigation, nutrition, health and – to an extent – education policies and programmes
                                                                                                              IRRIGATION
contribute. Therefore, the reference for existing policies and major programmes is given under the
respective reports of these sectors.

                                                                                                                 and utilization of new and existing schemes. These interventions are worth MWKW 707,040,000 (USD
    iv.	 Loss of Inputs (seeds, fertilizer) and Labour Cost: Another loss which is anticipated, is the loss
         due to wilting and drying of crops before harvest as more farmers would want to utilize limited
         available water resources for irrigation in different reaches of the river system, thus depleting the
         water resources faster, leading to drying up of the rivers before harvesting. It is estimated that
         about MWK 103,180,000 will be the total loss and this translate to MWK 4,690,000 per district.

Rice is normally grown once in a normal irrigation year. The total physical area for irrigated rice is
approximately 4,236 ha. However, due to water shortage this growing season, most farmers will not
grow Rice due to its high water demand and length of maturity of about 4-6 months. Its estimated that
there will be a 50 percent reduction in area under irrigated Rice this growing season in the irrigation
schemes.

Due to reduction in total irrigated area for rice, the loss in monetary value is very huge. In a normal
year, revenue accrued from irrigated rice is about MWK 8,769,348,000. However, the projected revenue
from rice this year is MWK 3,545,014,208 representing a loss of MWK 5,224,333,792 (USD 7,463,334). This
represents a 59.5 percent loss in monetary value.

Key Objectives of Recovery and Resilience Building
The floods and subsequent drought that were experienced during the 2014/15 growing season had
a negative effect on the food security of the country due to reduced production by both rain-fed
and irrigated agriculture. The El Nino induced 2015-16 drought has since exacerbated the situation.
The Department of Irrigation is therefore intensifying promotion of dry season crop production under
conventional irrigation and residual moisture so as to reduce negative effects of the drought. The
irrigation sector is prone to disasters and resilience building in the sector is important. The objectives
of the recovery and resilience building in the sector are aimed at reducing the shocks and impacts that

Challenges in the Sector
The main challenges facing the irrigation sector are that; Irrigation development is capital intensive,
and has to compete with many other investment needs for the limited funding available; farmers have
very limited capacity to invest their own capital, or to borrow money for investment, and most of the
investment therefore needs to come from the private sector, GoM and its development partners; Lack

Implementation Strategy
The recovery interventions being proposed in the sector are aimed at providing immediate relief to
the affected communities by using irrigation as a mitigation measure, building resilience against future
disasters by using irrigation as a mitigation measure. Development will take oversight role at Ministry
level; the Department of Irrigation will be the technical lead and look at day to day implementation
and management of the activities. The Irrigation Services Divisions will provide technical backstopping
of the District Irrigation Offices that will be responsible for implementation of activities through the
District Councils. The communities will be responsible for implementation of activities, monitoring and
evaluation at the lower level. Collaboration with Non State Actors will be encouraged realizing that some
of them are already implementing some of the activities outlined in the strategy. A multi stakeholder
implementation steering committee therefore has to be established to harness the efforts of all the
stakeholders. Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development should chair this committee.
The sector recovery and reconstruction needs implementation action plan is presented in the Table 7
on the next page. It will also be important to coordinate with the agriculture cluster as irrigation related
issues including decisions on providing inputs for winter production, treadle pumps and maintenance
of schemes are also usually discussed under the agriculture cluster.

Malawi has a large network of surface water bodies covering 21 percent of the country’s 120,000 km2
area. About 94 percent of the land area in Malawi is part of the Zambezi River Basin which drains into
the Indian Ocean in Mozambique. The remaining 6 percent falls within the Congo and Rovuma Basins
or the small internal drainage basin of Lake Chilwa. The Zambezi River Basin is the second largest in the
SADC region; 8 percent of the basin is in Malawi. The most prominent water body is Lake Malawi which
is 567 km long and 28,900 km2 in area (of which 4,540 km2 is in Mozambique) making it the third largest
lake in Africa, and the 10th largest in the world. More than ten rivers drain into Lake Malawi from two of
the three riparian countries including Ruhuhu (Tanzania), Songwe (Tanzania and Malawi), N. Rukuru, N.
Rumphi, S. Rukuru, Dwangwa, Bua, Linthipe, and Livulezi.

Groundwater
Groundwater resources are widespread throughout the country. The total potential groundwater yield
is estimated at 1.4 km3/year (44 m3/s), based on an average recharge rate of 15mm/year; however, the
groundwater potential has not been comprehensively determined. The last significant hydro-geological
mapping was done in 1986, and even this was based on limited borehole information. Groundwater
abstraction is generally unregulated and uncontrolled. There are two areas within the Shire basin which
are vulnerable. The area around Blantyre, as a result of high population and growth rate, experiences poor
water quality and low recharge rates. Areas in the north western part of the basin (Water Resource Unit
1R), based on high population rate, poor water quality and low recharge rates. Other areas of interest are
east and north of Blantyre, which are recognized as highly vulnerable. Refer to the figure below showing
the ground water situation.

Campaigns for prioritization of critical water uses in 7 affected rivers: Major rivers have been affected
as a result of drought. Critical among them are Lilongwe which supplies water to Lilongwe water Board,
Mpira River, which is a source of water for Mpira Gravity Fed Water Supply Scheme. Shire River which is
a source of water for Blantyre water board and Hydropower generation by ESCOM, which is used for
irrigation. These rivers need to be regulated now by of prioritizing critical water uses such as domestic as
outlined in the Water Resources Policy of 2005. Campaigns need to be carried out to sensitize different
water uses on the importance of fair allocation of the water resources in these important rivers.

Setting up a drought monitoring system (low flow monitoring in 7 affected rivers): The system
for monitoring low flows need to be set in the selected affected rivers, this will aid in decision making in
proper allocation of the scarce resource by different uses.

Preparation of drought contingency plans for major rivers: There is a need to prepare drought
contingency plans for the major rivers in the country. Drought contingency planning, is a way to ensure
that critical water needs are met during a dry period, minimizing the economic, social, and environmental
impacts of a drought. Government in collaboration with water utilities should prepare for such occasions
by developing tactical plans, called drought contingency plans, to reduce peak demands and extend
water supplies during a drought.

Existing Sectoral Policies and Major Programs
Recent government interventions to improve the management of water resources include the following:            WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION
    i.	   Improved policy environment, through the adoption of a National Water Policy in 2005.

    ii.	 Improved legal and regulatory framework enshrined in the Water Resources Act (2013) to                Background

The public Works Programme reaches out to almost 15 percent of the country’s poor and vulnerable                           in this initiative and recent data from Dedza and Nkhatabay has shown that about 10 percent of SCT

•	 Increasing the Coverage under the Public Works programme
The other option that can be used to cushion households from the effect of drought is to increase the
size of the transfer under the Public Works Programme from the current MWK 600 (US0.8) per day to
MWK 840 (USD 1.20) per day.

Unified Social Registry
Unified Social Beneficiary, best referred to as Unified Beneficiary registry (UBR) will enable social protection
programmes to have a common database that would be used to identify beneficiaries. This would help
in harmonizing programs at national level, and help to achieve better targeting of intended households.
The development of such a database is currently underway with support from various partners.

Mobile payment on Social Cash Transfers
Mobile payment would support strengthening of cash delivery in a speedy, secure, transparent and
accountable manner. Pilot studies have been carried out in three districts to look at the effectiveness
of this payment method. The Government of Malawi is planning to scale up this mode of payment to
ensure timely payment of transfers.

Policy Recommendations
There are a number of policy recommendations that the government can consider to enhance the role
of Social Protection in responding to disasters. These policy options include:

    •	   Increasing the transfer amount under the Public Works Program
         Since the public works wage rate in Malawi is highly linked to the statutory minimum wage for
         unskilled workers, there is limited scope of quickly adjusting the public works wage rate in light
         of disasters. As such, the Public Works wages remain very low to offer any meaningful protection
                                                                                                                   HEALTH
         to people who have been affected by disaster. Government should consider pegging the PWP
         wage rate to a dollar equivalent (which was USD 1.20 during the design of MASAF 4) so that any
         losses in value for the Malawi Kwacha and immediately be compensated for by a wage increase.

    •	   Removing the 10% cap on the SCT beneficiaries                                                             Background

         needs. In districts that are already covered by social protection and even in districts that are
                                                                                                                   health with malaria prevalence reduced from 43 percent in 2010 to 33 percent in 201426. Average life

morbidity with in-patient case data as health districts combine the cases on the DHIS2 system even
if separate indicators exist on the standardized formats and system. Thus, an average percentage of
in-patient ratio was assumed for each disease after comparing a public and private hospital caseload
trend between October 2013 to March 2014 in Chiradzulu district. On average, the in-patient cases cost
30 times more than that of out-patient.

A second limitation was the underreporting due to the DHIS2 system crash in 2015, especially for
diarrhea. An alternative information system, LMIS, recorded an increase in diarrhea cases during the
period of the drought compared to the baseline data. Also, a lack of standardized definitions for the
indicators DHIS2 system was another limitation with the main data set as various districts reported to
have included pneumonia cases under the ARI indicator, while many did not.

A third limitation was that the immediate losses only captured the U5 children and not the over 5
population and other vulnerable groups, such as PLW, people living with chronic illnesses, such as HIV/
AIDS or TB, the elderly and disabled population, which would have increased the total immediate losses
significantly as treatment costs for the over 5 (O5) population is more costly.

Furthermore, as the full impact of the drought on the health sector had not manifest during the
assessment, the projection made over a nine month duration was another significant assumption.
Recovery needs were estimated at the district and regional level. Six districts with the highest losses were
prioritized (Chiradzulu, Rumphi, Salima, Lilongwe, Dedza, and Zomba). Recovery of the total losses during
the drought was included as short-term needs. However, a discount factor of 50 percent was applied
to the overall short-term needs (Jun 2016 to Mar 2017) as the Food Insecurity Response Plan (FIRP)
also included some of the same interventions in its plans. To calculate the additional resources required       30

                        NUTRITION


                        Background
                        Adequate nutrition is a prerequisite for human growth and development. It plays an important role in
                        one’s physical and intellectual development, and consequentially work productivity and higher earnings
                        to support macroeconomic and societal growth. Undernourishment can result in high national and
                        individual productivity loss. The 2015 cost of Hunger in Malawi Report states that Malawi loses 10 percent
                        of its GDP annually due to chronic malnutrition alone.

                        Drought aggravates food insecurity and increases malnutrition. Thus malnutrition, if not controlled
                        early-on is responsible for growth faltering, increased susceptibility to disease, increases the cost of
                        disease management, impairs mental development and significantly contributes to early childhood
                        death.

                        Furthermore, malnutrition affects the productivity of the people working in the agriculture and food
                        systems. It is through the acknowledgement of the importance of a multi-sector approach that the
                        government placed nutrition as a top priority in the ‘Malawi Growth and Development Strategy’. A multi-
                        sectoral platform was initiated by the Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS (DNHA) involving various
                        development partners, donors, international and local NGOs and CSOs.

                        Over the past two decades, Malawi has reported a decline in the rates of undernutrition, an indication
                        that the increased investments in nutrition are paying off. However, continued efforts are needed to
                        address the high rates of stunting to ensure a reduction to the national target of 27 percent.

                        Drought of 2015-16 has compounded the challenges already posed by the 2014-15 flooding, which
                        saw an increased case load of undernourished most vulnerable population, including children under
                        5 (U5) and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). Interventions put in place to mitigate the impact of
                        floods have minimized the impact of drought on the nutrition sector. However, gaps still exist and there

Methodology for Assessment of Sector
To estimate the total losses and recovery needs, pertinent secondary data was obtained from several
nutrition sector reports, including Malawi’s online CMAM database (80-96 percent completeness of
report), Malawi DHS, and Malawi MICS. Field visits were conducted for data validation and gathering
further primary data on the impact of the drought from 2015-2016 on the nutrition sector. For primary
data collection, teams visited Phalombe, Mulanje, and Mwanza in the Southern region. Telephonic
interviews were conducted for other affected regions, in the interest of time.

Data on prevalence of under-nutrition from 2000-2015 was gathered and compared using MDHS reports.
Data for the period October 2013 to March 2014 was considered as the baseline data since it was the
comparable period just before the 2014-2015 flooding. The assessment period of the drought took place
October 2015 to March 2016. The same months (October to March) were selected for the purpose of
accurate comparison of seasonality, which significantly affects trends of global acute malnutrition (GAM)
rates. The observed trends in Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM)
new admissions of children U5 from baseline were compared to the drought period for twenty-four
most affected districts.

One key weakness of the nutrition sector loss estimation was that the immediate losses only captured         * Livelihood Zone NOT surveyed in 2015

Some of the additional assumptions made in the overall calculations are as follows:
                                                                                                             33

Existing Sectoral Policies and Major Programs
Currently, the Department of Nutrition and HIV/AIDS (DNHA) provides oversight, strategic leadership,
policy direction, coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the national nutrition response. . The
Ministry of Health (MoH) provides leadership and technical direction in programming and delivery of
the curative and preventive nutrition interventions in partnership with stakeholders. The MoH is further
responsible for the delivery of quality and cost effective nutrition-specific and sensitive interventions.
These interventions are based on the National Health Policy, the EHP, the Health Sector Strategic
Plan, IYCF policy, SHN policy, food security policy and other relevant policies. They are implemented
by government and development partners across Malawi, with special focus on the worst-affected
districts. These interventions primarily focus on promotion of optimal maternal infant and young child
nutrition, prevention of micronutrient deficiencies, integrated management of acute malnutrition
(including CMAM and NCST), de-worming, prevention of diarrheal diseases and nutrition education.
More emphasis has been placed in drought prone areas that contribute to the high national averages
for stunting, wasting and underweight among children.

Coordination committees like the National nutrition committee also known as the scaling-up nutrition
(SUN) platform, National Nutrition Cluster, Targeted Nutrition Programs (TNP) committee and the
nutrition technical working group all which are led by the government provide policy guidance, technical
support and coordination of all nutrition activities in the country. A successful drought response will
have to include shared cost and responsibility of managing and improving child and maternal nutrition,
effective joint planning and coordination of nutrition development and emergency response programs,
agreed upon through nutrition forums with various development partners and stakeholders.

                        EDUCATION


                        Background
                        The Malawi Government adopted the Universal School Feeding Programme in all its public primary
                        schools as a panacea to improving enrolment, retention and performance for quality basic education in
                        Malawi. School Meals Programme is implemented using a number of models that elicit strong community
                        participation in the education sector. Despite such efforts to increase overall national enrollment ratio,
                        challenges in the sector have contributed to fluctuations in the net enrollment ratios over the years.

                        Education disruptions are regarded as a loss to the education sector as the school completion and
                        retention rates are adversely affected for the impact districts and national indicators. However, national
                        statistics does not capture the actual situation on the ground largely arising from learner mobility. There
                        is also poor capture of drought statistics at the subnational levels to enable amplification of the impact
                        of drought to the education subsector. Nevertheless, school specific discussions revealed massive
                        disruptions to teaching-learning processes further undermining the country efforts for equitable access
                        to quality education for all.

                        Methodology for Assessment of Sector
                        The PDNA for education sector targeted all the districts in Central and Southern Regions including
                        Mzimba and Rumphi districts in the North. A total of 28 education districts in all regions were affected
                        by the drought. Secondary data routinely collected through EMIS38 from 2012/13-2014/15 was used
                        as baseline. Data capture forms were electronically sent to all districts affected to collect 2015/2016
                        drought specific impact data. Site visits were made to selected districts for data validation and further
                        qualitative data collection.

result of low water Almost 100 percent schools with gardens, used for feeding programs, have experience
low to no production due to prolonged dry spells. Total damage due to drought in education sectors is
estimated at USD3.4 million

Loss Analysis
Most of the losses in the education sector due to drought, estimated at around USD 6.9 million, include
disruptions in the school feeding program, that have had strong impact on enrolments. There have been
increased enrollments in schools where meals are provided and drastic drop-outs in schools that are not
on school feeding. Students also reportedly are suffering from psychosocial issues due to reduced meal
frequency and quantity due to low production and escalated food prices (leading to lower calorie count
and nutrition) and reduced availability of water, leading to severe attention deficit.

technics are applied in order to build back better and smarter. In view of this, recommended crop varieties
suitable for specific weather and topographic conditions will be used as well as corresponding fertilizers,
pesticides and herbicides. This intervention would involve the scale up of the ongoing efforts under the
UN Joint Program on Girls Education; which provides grants to schools in four districts of the country.
Increasing productivity will also contribute to strengthen schools’ capacity to deal with influx of pupils
from neighboring schools that might not be able to offer meals during crises periods by increasing the
availability of food in schools.

•	 Restoration of meal consumption
School Meals Programme (SMP) efforts will be expanded to all schools in the drought affected districts
and also improved in schools under the program to ensure that recommended meal quantities of 100g
per learner per day are provided at the right frequency of 5 days per week instead of the current 3
days per week. This will enable learners regularly attend school and avoid migration from one school to
another for optimal utilization of the education inputs. This intervention will ensure equitable access to
education irrespective of drought effects.

Challenges in the Sector
    ••   Lack of reliable data as most indicators related to drought are not routinely collected at the
         national and district levels for evidence based programming.

    ••   Unavailability of safe water in schools due to the lowering of the water table poses a challenge
         especially for WASH related activities.

    ••   The low water table deprives soil of residual moisture thereby creating unfavorable conditions

    ••   Knowledge gap among school governance structures and community members with regards
         to dietary diversification. Locally available nutrient-rich foods and nutrient-preserving cooking
         methods are ignored.

Existing Sector Policies and Major Programs
The proposed recovery and reconstruction plans are in line with and build upon existing universal
and national educational policies. The Education sector is working towards achieving the Millennium
Development Goal 2, the National Education Sector plan, basic education policy, the National Education
Sector Implementation Plan II (2013/14 – 2017/18), The Readmission Policy 1993, the Gender Policy
2013, the national school health and nutrition strategic plan 2009-2018 and the National Youth Policy.

Sector Priorities
The priority of Education sector is to ensure learners access to education is not hindered due to natural
disasters, specifically drought. To achieve this objective, priority will be to restore the capacity of schools
to provide school meals since disruption in school feeding has been one of primary factors behind                 Background

Loss Analysis
Unlike the damages, most losses were incurred in the wildlife sector (USD 1.5 million) and currently
there are no losses in forest sector. The losses in wildlife sector were calculated based on human –
wildlife conflicts and loss of production of winter crops emanating wildlife including herbivores such

Land: The National Land Policy (2002), the Land Resource Management Policy and Strategy (2000)
provide for land use planning designating relevant land uses according to land characteristics. These
policies link with water policies through catchment conservation, which benefit agriculture in adjoining
land and promote fish conservation and fisheries management downstream.

Sector Priorities
The main sector priorities are aimed at protecting the environment and promote sustainable utilization
of natural resources while building resilience to the rural communities and ecosystems through
strengthening institutional capacity to manage the ecosystems, implementation of biodiversity
conservations programs. The biodiversity conservation programs will include translocation of the
animals, improvement of fire management in both wildlife and forest sectors. Development of integrated
national early warning systems and harmonization of conflicting sector policies. The achievement of the

                        INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE


                        Background
                        Industry and Commerce is not only the engine of growth in a country but also plays a key role in
                        contributing substantially to employment and ensuring access to services and goods. Medium and
                        large-scale enterprises provide access to formal sector employment opportunities, but a substantially
                        large number of jobs in Malawi are provided by micro and small enterprises which also con-stitute the
                        largest share of the whole sector, majority of which are informal. It is recognised that without trade in the
                        country, Malawi may not grow to its full potential and that industrialization and structural transformation
                        of the economy would not be there to create rapid long-term economic growth that is needed to raise
                        per capita income, create sufficient rural and urban jobs, and widen the tax base to finance Malawi’s
                        budgetary requirements. The sector currently constitutes 15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product
                        (GDP), while industry alone contributes 9 percent. According to the 2012 Fin scope report, there are
                        about 1 million MSMEs in the country, 42 percent in the Central region, 45 percent from the South and 13
                        percent in the northern region. The drought affected all the regions in the southern and central region,
                        and two districts (Rumphi & Mzimba) in the northern region. MSMEs in the affected areas constitute 93
                        percent of the total number of MSMEs in the country. 35 percent of the manufacturing sector of the
                        country is mainly agro-processing.

                        The trade sector also contributes towards raising the living standards of people by economically
                        empowering youths, women, and smallholder farmers, job seekers, micro and small businesses through
                        establishment of businesses and employment creation.

                        Focus of this analysis is mainly on agro processing industries, as they were the ones that were felt to be
                        more heavily impacted by the drought. The assessment covered all districts in the Southern and Central
                        regions and two districts (Rumphi and Mzimba) in the Northern region of the country (24 districts) where
                        drought was more prevalent during 2015-16. The analysis concentrated on a number of categories of
                        the agro processing sector namely: meat production; dairy products; flour production, tea production,

Implementation Strategy
Interventions for reconstruction of the transport sector can be seen as medium to long-term measures

trucking capacity to deliver relief items on time to affected communities. All transport sector interventions

                        RESILIENCE

                        Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is a crosscutting theme and, to be effective, it needs to be
                        mainstreamed across sector policies and development plans to ensure that risks are effectively
                        reduced and addressed. The national DRR system plays a key role in supporting all sectors to reduce
                        risks and in providing policy direction and coordination for Malawi’s overall DRR strategy. The capacity of
                        the national DRR institutional, policy and financial framework is essential to such support. This chapter
                        is dedicated to identifyng interventions required to strengthen the DRR system and its capacity to
                        contribute to building drought resilience.

                        DRR is embedded in key strategies, policies and frameworks in Malawi. The Malawi Growth and
                        Development Strategy 2011-2016 (MGDS II) is the overarching development agenda for the country.
                        “Disaster Risk Management” is sub-theme 2 under theme 3 ‘Social Support and Disaster Risk Management’
                        in MGDS II.

                        The Disaster Preparedness and Relief (DPR) Act of 1991 is the key legislation that provides guidance to
                        disaster management in Malawi and its institutional framework. The Secretary to the Vice President and
                        Commissioner for Disaster Management Affairs, the National Disaster Preparedness and Relief Committee
                        (NDPRC), Civil Protection Committees (CPC) and Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA)
                        were created through the Act.

Early Warning, Risk Identification and Risk Assessment
Malawi could benefit from improved early warning, risk identification and risk assessment                      Furthermore, the contingency plans are rarely tested and strengthened through execution of scheduled
systems. The drought forecasts released by the DCCMS triggered responses from various players,                 emergency simulations and drills. DRM structures such as the Civil Protection Committees exist at district,

                        ANNEX III – METHODOLOGY TO
                        CALCULATE IMPACT OF DROUGHT
                        ON GDP

                                In order to estimate the effect of drought on macroeconomic performance, Malawi’s National
                        Accounts, which measure overall economic production and growth as per United Nations standard
                        guidelines (SNA 2008), were used. The Malawi Government normally updates its national accounts in
                        February and September each year, following a business interviews survey. Thus, a forecast of annual
                        GDP and economic growth for 2016 was available in February 2015, as companies surveyed provided
                        their expectations of output for the following year. This 2016 forecast was used as a baseline for assessing
                        the losses on GDP, as it presented the expected 2016 performance prior to any knowledge of the disaster
                        occurring. A forecast for 2016 is also available from the September 2015 Survey, however, the February
                        2015 forecast was preferred. In the September 2015 forecast, El Niño was already on the horizon and
                        hence the 2016 forecast already included some of the effects of the expected drought.

                        The sectors that have experienced the greatest production disruptions and losses are agriculture;
                        manufacturing; electricity and water supply and wholesale and retail trade. The analysis focused on
                        the direct losses experienced by these sectors, as isolating the impact of indirect losses through lower
                        demand due to the lower purchasing power of consumers would be difficult to quantify. Given that most
                        losses are expected to be found in the agricultural sector, the assessment centred around sectors whose
                        performance largely depends on this primary sector. These include agro-processing and wholesale and
                        retail traders of agricultural products. In addition, the assessment focused on losses in the energy sector
                        as well as losses in the provision of losses by Water Boards and other sources, since drought directly
                        affects water levels and electricity is hydro-generated.

After receiving the nominal losses from all sectors, the ones relevant to GDP were selected and converted
to real values in order to assess the impact of the drought on real GDP. Emphasis on real GDP enabled
the assessment to isolate the real effects of the drought on the productive capacity of the economy,
exclusive of the distortion of prices.

The human cost of this disaster should not be underestimated. The PDNA has revealed that the drought
has also negatively affected the social sectors of the economy including health, education, nutrition
and food security. One of the limitations of the current approach was that it was difficult to incorporate
such losses from the social sectors in the GDP impact assessment as they cannot be directly translated
into losses in the productive economy. With reference to SNA 2008, public sector health and education
output is estimated using wages and salaries while the indicator for the private sector output is revenue.
In particular, production of the non-market sector (government and non-profit institutions servicing
households (NPISH)) is obtained by summing up values for production cost and wages/salaries using
the following equations:

    i.	 Output = wages/salaries + production cost, and
    ii.	 Value added = Output – production cost, hence
    iii.	 Value added = Wages/salaries

In Malawi, the health and education sectors are dominated by the public sector and NPISH and as such
the same methodology is applied to calculate the value-added of these sectors in GDP. In the drought
period it is assumed that there was no increase in wages/salaries for civil servants or NPISH workers and
hence it follows that value addition from these sectors was not affected, with reference to the equations
above. Nevertheless, there is recognition that losses in human development and human capital, if not
addressed immediately, would have a significant and negative impact in the long-run development of
the country.
