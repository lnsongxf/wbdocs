 CLOSING THE GAP
  Expanding access to
Myanmar      has an important opportunity to improve the health status and education outcomes of its people after
     social services
decades of underspending and institutional neglect in the social sectors. Low access to health, education and
social protection services has severely worsened human development outcomes, which ranked among the lowest
in the region. Since 2011, there has been a sea change in public policy with rapidly rising social spending to expand
access to services and protect families from poverty. The payoffs are immense – in Myanmar, an additional year of
schooling is estimated to be associated with 6.7 percent higher income (World Bank, 2014a), which will be com-
pounded with better health and social protection. Although significant progress has been made recently, immense
challenges and opportunities remain. Policies to close the gap in access to social services are fundamental to
inclusive growth in Myanmar.



 Context and opportunities for change

There are big opportunities to improve human
development outcomes in Myanmar, including by
addressing disparities across socio-economic
groups (figure 1). Only 29 percent of children from
households in the poorest quintile were enrolled in
secondary school, compared with 80 percent of those
from the richest quintile. Women in the poorest quintile
have the lowest percentage of births delivered by skilled
attendants, receiving post-natal care and practicing
exclusive breastfeeding of under 6-month olds.
Furthermore, 33 percent of children from households in
the poorest wealth quintile were underweight compared
with 14 percent of children from the richest quintile.

                                                            and to devise appropriate policy responses.

Recent shifts in the Union Budget have created an
opening to further reverse low public spending on
health and education and to reduce the financial
burden on households. In 2009, households bore
63 and 82 percent of total education and health costs
respectively through direct out-of-pocket payments,
one of the highest in the world. This either prevented
poor people from accessing healthcare because they
could not afford it, or led to further impoverishment as
they had to sell assets to access services. In a survey
in 2009, almost a third of respondents noted that out-
of-pocket costs were unaffordable.

The Union Budget can also help to significantly
improve the quality of education and health services.
Very basic school facilities have made learning condi-
tions difficult, as demonstrated by Early Grade Reading
Assessment (EGRA) results (figure 3). At the point of
health service delivery, quality is severely affected by
a shortage of critical inputs. A recent nationally-repre-
sentative survey of health facilities found that only 26
percent of them had essential medicines, 41 percent
basic amenities, and 57 percent the capacity to provide     There is also an opening to establish an effective

 Recent developments

Several reforms have been initiated to improve
service delivery, increase utilization and reduce
out-of-pocket spending in the health sector. These
include: the provision of free essential drugs at township
hospitals and below; and free services for pregnant
women and children under five. In addition, the Ministry
of Health implemented a pilot scheme to incentivize
poor women to seek antenatal visits, safe delivery, and
postnatal care by paying for transportation, food and
lodging.

In the education sector also, policies were adopted
to encourage children to attend school and reduce
dropout rates. Primary and secondary school fees
have been eliminated, free textbooks are now provided
to all students, and over 70,000 contracted teachers
have been recruited. In addition, since 2014 a stipends         policy
program for poor and vulnerable students has been
introduced (grades 5-11) in 8 townships across 4 States      changes are

These policies were implemented through a dra-              Fig 4: Government expenditure on health
matic increase in public spending. Health spending          and education (% of GDP)
has increased from 0.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to over
1 percent of GDP in 2014. This is equivalent to a nine
fold increase in nominal terms between 2009 and 2013.
Education spending has increased from 0.7 percent of
GDP in 2011 to an estimated 2 percent of GDP in 2014.
Furthermore, a promising reform of decentralization
has started, through facility grants provided directly to
schools, hospitals, and health centers that are at the
frontline of service delivery.

These policy changes are already delivering results.
Out-of-pocket spending as a share of total spending is
estimated to have dropped from 63 percent in 2010 to
30 percent in 2015 for education and from 82 percent to
54 percent for health over the same period. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that the stipends program so far
has encouraged parents to get more involved in their
children’s education, to improve attendance, and to
cover education costs such as stationary, uniforms,         Source: World Bank (1985), World Bank (1995)
