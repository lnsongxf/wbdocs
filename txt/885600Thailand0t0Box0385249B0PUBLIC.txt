I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Thailand
        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Thailand regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Thailand;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Thailand;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Thailand; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Thailand.
       Use data to help inform Thailand country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In March-May 2013, 315 stakeholders of the World Bank in Thailand were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the Office of the Prime Minister; the office of
a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency;
consultants/ contractors working on World Bank-supported projects/programs; project
management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials or
staff; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the
financial sector/private banks; civil society organizations; community-based organization; the
media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups, academia/research
institutes/think tanks; judiciary branches, and other organizations. A total of 110 stakeholders
participated in the survey (35% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires by post and returned them accordingly. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Thailand; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World
Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Thailand; and the Bank’s communication and information
sharing in Thailand.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Thailand: Respondents were asked to indicate what they thought were
   the top three most important development priorities in the country.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Thailand, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Thailand solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development
   partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
   productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in
   Thailand, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Thailand and the extent to which the
   Bank meets Thailand’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge work, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research efforts,
   and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge work/activities, including
   how significant of a contribution they makes to development results and the technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Thailand’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support, etc.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Thailand: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Thailand’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to information requests. They were also asked to indicate
   how often they access World Bank information online and how valuable they consider the
   information they receive from the Bank’s social media channels. Respondents also indicated
   the type of e-services they are currently subscribed to.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Thailand, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 136 respondents (29% response rate) who completed the survey
in FY 2007 and the 140 respondents who completed the survey in FY 2002. Notations and/or
charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

    the FY ’02 country survey (6.3).
         Respondents across all stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of
           familiarity with the Bank.

         It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
          significantly, strongly correlated with respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall
          effectiveness in Thailand, and were significantly, moderately correlated with their
          perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results and the Bank’s

    Respondents in this year’s country survey gave significantly lower ratings for the extent
      to which the Bank’s knowledge work and activities are useful in terms of the work you
      do compared to respondents in the FY’07 country survey (7.7) and in the FY’02 country
      survey (7.9). Respondents in this year’s country survey gave statistically similar ratings
      to the extent to which the Bank’s knowledge work and activities are adaptable to
      Thailand’s specific development challenges and country circumstances compared to
      respondents in the FY’07 country survey (6.7) and the FY’02 country survey (6.4).

        There were significant differences between stakeholder groups across all qualities of the
         World Bank’s knowledge and activities except two areas: being accessible and being a
         source of relevant information on global good practices. Across all other qualities,
         employees of the Office of the Prime Minister gave the highest ratings regarding these
         qualities of the Bank’s knowledge work and activities, whereas respondents from

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Thailand or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in Thailand, greater insight into how the Bank’s work
is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in Thailand. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in Thailand. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the
survey, please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer
a question, please leave it blank.
