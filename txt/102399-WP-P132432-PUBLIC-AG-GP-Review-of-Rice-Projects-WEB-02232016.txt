A Portfolio Review of World Bank Rice Projects: Fiscal Years 1984–2011                                                         vii
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Rice is the world’s most heavily consumed staple crop. Its production requires
enormous volumes of water and emits large quantities of atmospheric methane, a
greenhouse gas some many times more powerful than carbon dioxide—particularly
during a medium term period of about seven years. In a global context of growing
population, increasingly scarce water resources, and climate change, more produc-
tive, sustainable, and eﬃcient rice production warrants clear priority. The incidence
of droughts associated with climate change is projected to increase in rain-fed rice-
growing areas, and may very well extend further into water-scarce irrigated areas. A
variety of climate-smart practices and technologies are available that can move rice
production toward a triple-win scenario that entails increased productivity, enhanced
resilience, and improved greenhouse gas mitigation. These generally entail some com-
bination of lower inputs of water, inorganic fertilizer, and pesticides; improved soil and
water management; and the controlled use of organic fertilizers—all while increasing
yields. Adapted speciﬁcally to local conditions, this agro-ecological intensiﬁcation carries a
number of names, including the System of Rice Intensiﬁcation (SRI), the “1 Must and
5 Reductions” (1M+5R), Integrated Crop Management (ICM) in rice cultivation, and
the Sustainable System of Irrigated Agriculture (SSIA), among others.

Although this review of World Bank projects does not limit itself to those that incor-
porate these labels, it does focus on the application of sustainable principles in rice
production in 172 Bank projects that were approved between 1984 and 2011. These
had a total lending volume of $10.9 billion. Their development outcomes are gauged
based on the projects’ implementation completion reports, which also document les-
sons learned and results in greater detail.

The projects are grouped into dedicated rice projects, in which rice was the main focus
of the intervention, and nondedicated rice projects, in which rice-related activities were
not the primary concentration. Thirty-seven (22 percent) of the 172 projects were
dedicated rice projects, and the remaining 135 were classiﬁed as nondedicated. The
Africa Region had the largest number of rice-related projects with 78, followed by
42 in East Asia and the Paciﬁc, and 29 in South Asia. Rice projects in East Asia
and the Paciﬁc had the largest proportion of lending at 37 percent. Madagascar had

A PORTFOLIO REVIEW OF WORLD BANK
RICE PROJECTS: FISCAL YEARS 1984–2011

BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF WORK
Rice, wheat, and maize together supply more than 50 percent of all plant-derived calo-
ries consumed by the world’s population. Of these three, rice is by far the most impor-
tant food crop for people in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Asia produces
and consumes about 90 percent of the world’s rice. But rice is also a staple food in
Latin America and the Caribbean, and over the past 30 years demand for rice in
West Africa has grown at an annual rate of 6 percent, replacing traditional cereals
(Mohanty 2013).

The intensity and frequency of droughts are projected to increase with the eﬀects of
climate change, particularly in rain-fed areas and very likely in water-scarce irrigated
areas as well. By 2050, rice yields may experience losses of between 10 and 15 percent,
whereas rice commodity prices are likely to increase by a third. The production of rice
emits large quantities of methane, in addition to consuming large amounts of water.
More sustainable rice production can be achieved through better water, plant, soil, and
nutrient management. Those practices that are instrumental in achieving a triple win
in terms of productivity, resilience, and greenhouse gas mitigation are referred to here
as being “climate smart.” These represent a departure from conventional measures
to intensify rice production in that climate-smart practices pursue higher yields with
substantially lower inputs of seed, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. They also assign
considerable preference to organic over inorganic fertilizers, purposefully using inputs
such as crop residues and green manures as sources of rice crop nutrients.

METHODOLOGY
The report is based on a review of implementation completion reports (ICRs) of the
172 World Bank projects that included rice-related interventions that were approved
between 1984 and 2011.1 Implementation completion reports are the principal means

SUSTAINABLE RICE PRODUCTION
CONCEPTS USED IN THE PORTFOLIO
Several projects refer to speciﬁc sustainable rice management approaches, some of
which are listed and described in this appendix.

    » System of Rice Intensiﬁcation—the principles
    The System of Rice Intensiﬁcation is a set of management practices that was
    developed in 1960 in Madagascar. Adapted and applied to other crops, its prin-
    ciples today have spread to more than 50 countries. The principles of rice inten-
    siﬁcations systems promise climate cobeneﬁts and increased production with
    reduced input and water use, leading to higher farm incomes. SRI presented a
    paradigm shift from the thinking of the Green Revolution because it does not
    depend on genetic change or on added inputs. It started as a bottom-up technol-
    ogy and is more agro-ecology based instead of input dependent. SRI is based on
    the principle of developing healthy large and deep root systems that can better
    resist drought, waterlogging, and wind damage. It consists of six key elements to
    better manage inputs, utilize new ways to transplant seedlings, and manage water
    and fertilizer application. SRI plants develop stronger stalks and more tillers, with
    higher yields and even better ﬂavor qualities. SRI consists of six main elements:
    1. Seed nursery—seedlings are transplanted at a much younger age, typically
        8–12 days old
    2. Transplanting—single seedlings are planted, instead of planting a handful of
        seedlings in each hill
    3. Innovative transplanting—plants are spaced wider apart in a square pattern
        rather than in rows
    4. Intermittent water application to create wet and dry soil conditions, instead of
        continuous ﬂood irrigation
    5. Rotary weeding to control weeds and promote soil aeration
    6. Increased use of organic fertilizer to enhance soil fertility
