1                 Introduction



Motivation
Identification schemes are key enablers for more efficient and effective delivery of basic public services, such
as health, education, and social protection programs. The latter rely on knowledge of the population within
socioeconomic surveys to target the poor and establish eligibility for participation as beneficiaries. Without an
inclusive, robust and easy to integrate identification framework, programs risk missing important segments of the
population that need the assistance most—the poor and the vulnerable—and they often become susceptible to
leakages and fraud, which render them less accountable and effective. As a consequence, developing an identi-
fication system that scores well on fitness indicators and using it as a basis for administration of social protection
and other public service programs is a high priority for many developing nations.

The need in Côte d’Ivoire for such systems is concrete and immediate as the country, through World Bank sup-
port, is embarking on a project designed to lay the foundations and initiate implementation of a national social
safety net system for promoting poverty reduction. This project is financed by an IDA credit in the amount of USD
50 million and will be implemented over a five year period, from 2015–2020. It is intended to support the govern-
ment’s poverty reduction and growth objectives in line with its National Development Plan (NDP) for 2012–2015
and its new National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS), adopted May 2014. The project is entitled Productive
Social Safety Net Project, but we shall refer to it henceforth in this report simply as the WB Project.

For its function, the WB Project requires the creation of a unified administrative delivery system (e.g., identifi-
cation scheme with unique ID numbers and eligibility criteria and targeting methods) supported by a suitable
management information system (MIS). Today, Cote d’Ivoire does not have a system of noncontributory safety
net programs which routinely collects information on poor households in a single, unified household database,
targets interventions systematically in a clear and transparent manner using well-defined eligibility criteria, or
delivers income support or productive benefits to the extreme poor for supporting consumption and, in the long-
term, improving living conditions. Once the requisite systems are in place, in due course of the WB project, it is
expected that other programs, will rely on the resulting data and delivery instruments for their needs.



World Bank Mission
In order to address the question of what identification system and what identifiers could be used to support the
needs of the WB Project for managing the identity of beneficiaries, a short World Bank identity assessment




                                                                                                                    1
mission (5 days) took place May 25–29, in Abidjan. The terms of reference for the Mission contained three
objectives:

    1.	   Develop an overview of the state of the identity ecosystem in Côte d’Ivoire by applying the World Bank
          Identity Systems Assessment (ISA) tool.
    2.	   Develop an operational plan for identifying beneficiaries of the WB Project that could also lay the founda-
                                                                                                re.
          tion for a social register of utility to all programs in the social sector in the futu
    3.	   Provide guidance as to how the identity ecosystem in the country could potentially be harmonized to
          promote the emergence of robust identity practices that could serve the needs of all and not just the
          social sector.

While the Mission was primarily driven by immediate social protection needs, it took into account some longer
term issues. In other words it assessed also whether Côte d’Ivoire has a foundational identification system that
can empower people to exercise their rights, claim their benefits in an inclusive manner, and participate in the
economic growth brought about by the fruits of socioeconomic development.



High Level Findings
The Mission conducted dialogue with representatives of all the identity stakeholders in the country, both on the
supply as well as on the demand side (to a lesser extent). On the supply side, we note that the country has sev-
eral institutions that are mandated to deal with certain aspects of identification and that have developed what
could be termed identity assets. Those assets could be leveraged to provide some of the desired identification
capabilities. Nevertheless, the overall identification ecosystem remains non-robust, highly fragmented, and lacks
coverage of the population. It requires a series of coordinated measures and policy changes for reforming it to
meet the expected needs, as we present in this report. Equally important, our conclusions were that the cur-
rent WB Project cannot rely on any existing identification system because of low accessibility by the targeted
population. Instead the Project would have to develop its own functional enrollment, as it could not wait for the
emergence of the necessary foundational identity systems, as we explain in detail in this report. Luckily this can
be done in such a way as to allow the linkage of these identities with the foundational identity when its coverage
reaches the population concerned.

In general, while identity is a sensitive subject, the Mission was welcomed with enthusiasm and interest by all
parties and government agencies interviewed. There was openness, desire to collaborate with one another and
a recognition that the country is in need to reinforce its identification practices. Repeatedly we were told many
forums had been conducted to discuss the state of the identification schemes in the country, but that Côte d’Ivoire
lacked knowledge of the international experience in this area that would allow it to develop a unified national
identification strategy to address the shortcomings. As such the Mission was welcomed uniformly because of the
potential Technical Assistance that could be made available to the country as a consequence of this assessment.



Organization of the Report
The report is organized into the following sections:

    •	    Section II: Presents the approach and methodology of the evaluation used. It gives an overview of the
          Identification Systems Analysis (ISA).
    •	    Section III: Gives a detailed description of the Identity ecosystem in Côte d’Ivoire. It examines all the
          identification schemes that were considered of primary importance by the Mission and that were part




2
        of the interviews conducted. Where enough data was collected, the ISA analysis is performed and the
        color coded score is presented.
   •	   Section IV: Presents a series of recommendations to address the identification needs of the WB Proj-
        ect but also for improving the identification practices in the country in general. Those recommenda-
        tions are based on the extensive experience that the World Bank ISA team has had in the course of
        applying the tool in similar environments.

In addition to these primary sections, the report contains four Appendices:

   •	   Appendix 1: Presents the scoring methodology of ISA.
   •	   Appendix 2: Provides a brief history of identification regulations in Côte d’Ivoire. It is meant to give
        some legal context to the identification schemes currently in place.
   •	   Appendix 3: Discusses how the foundation of current identity schemes (national identity card and the

2                 Approach and Methodology



The Tool: Identification Systems Analysis (ISA)
When it comes to identification, countries almost never start from a ‘green-field’ situation; instead they begin with
assets that are currently in place which are then reinforced and harmonized to create a foundational identifica-
tion scheme where each individual is known in some register, attributed a unique identifying number (UIN), and
empowered to prove who they are officially through a credential in the form of an ID card or an online identity
verification service. Having identity credentials simplifies the interaction between the citizen and the state by
removing the burden of proof of identity each time individuals request services. It essentially creates a uniform
service delivery platform tied to a unique identifier (Unique ID) that will accompany each individual, in ideal cir-
cumstances from cradle to grave.

Given the importance of the Unique ID for program implementation, it is essential to have a complete under-
standing of the existing assets that can potentially be utilized in a harmonized identification framework in the
country. The World Bank has developed a tool called the Identification Systems Analysis (ISA) which responds
to this need and has been used already in several countries since it was created in 2014. Originally, the tool was
developed to help governments improve their ability to identify individuals and, in particular, potential and actual
beneficiaries of social protection, health, and other programs that require robust identification.

The tool is used to map relevant identification systems in the country with the objective of determining how to
harmonize and utilize them as part of a general-purpose identification scheme that can deliver to the needs of
diverse programs. The analysis focuses on issues of accessibility, robustness and integration (see What Matters
in Identity box) in addition to the legal framework. Accessibility or inclusiveness relates to the costs and barriers
that exist, especially for the poor, in obtaining proof of identity that can be used for various purposes including
participating in social programs. A robust form of identification is one that is difficult to falsify and that can be
used to verify transactions such as government to person payment (G2P). In addition, the ability to cross-check
and link different databases to make government more efficient while maintaining safeguards on privacy and
data access is a key functionality captured in the concept of integration. An appropriate legal framework and
safeguards for issues of privacy and personal data protection are also crucial to a well-functioning identification
system and are examined by the ISA tool.


   What Matters in Identity

   As discussed in detail in the What Matters section of the ISA tool (available from the World Bank), there are
   four elements that are critical for assessing the health of an identification scheme. These are

   Accessibility
   Evaluates the extent of coverage of the ID of the entire population, how accessible it is to the individual,
   how costly and what barriers may be encountered by any individual or groups. In this regard, the best ID
   system is one that is universally available to every individual at a negligible cost.

                                                                                                     (continued)



                                                                                                                   5
    Continued

    Robustness
    Assesses how resilient the system is to fraud (uniqueness of identity), duplication of credentials and secu-
    rity breaches; and whether the ID is a system within a framework of trust to verify or authenticate identity
    at the time of use.

    Integration
    Assesses the interoperability of the identity across multiple applications and the extensiveness of the links
    between identity registers.

    Legal Framework
    Evaluates how developed the country’s laws are regarding privacy, data protection and protection of indi-
    vidual rights. It also takes into account capacity of responsible organizations and compliance with pertinent
    international standards.

    In the evaluation, each factor is color coded according to the criteria shown in the reference matrix in
    Appendix 1.




Types of Identity Assets Covered by the ISA
In general there are three types of assets that are examined as part of the ISA process. These include:

    1.	   Population Points of Contact (PPOC): Permanent or mobile locations where the administration and
          the population interact. These are a prerequisite for enrollment of identity, so that high coverage can be
          achieved, but also for updates of vital information.
    2.	   Identity registers: Identity databases that contain core identifying data such as name, date of birth,
          place of birth, lineage, biometric data, etc. A country normally employs three types of foundational
          (general-purpose) registers in addition to multiple functional (program specific) registers as given in
          Table 1 (with the first three in the table foundational, and the last three functional).
    3.	   Authentication mechanisms: For an identity system to be relied upon for program service delivery,
          there needs to be mechanisms to ensure that the person identified is who he or she claims to be at the
          time of service delivery. This is often built in the form of something the person has (a secure ID card),
          something they know (a PIN or password) or something they are (biometric). It requires the presence of
          mechanisms at a point of service to perform authentication (e.g., point of service terminals with biometric
          verification such as fingerprint readers).

                                 (citizens, adults, children, resident foreigners, diaspora, and refugees) and
                                 their localization (address). There are many variants of the NPR depending
                                 on what information beyond the core identity data is included. Among the
                                 variants we recognize:
 National Population
 Register (NPR)                  •	   Household Register (HHR),
                                 •	   Family Register (FR).
                                 •	   Individual National Population Register (INPR).
                                 This is considered an administrative instrument, although often there are
                                 many laws that govern its composition and purpose.
                                 This is the register of people that hold a national identity card and that can
                                 assert their binding rights legally (e.g., adult citizens). They are often given
 National Identity Card
                                 a credential or a certificate, digital or otherwise, that allows them to transact

                                 and be recognized as a legal entity bestowed with rights and that can be
                                 subject to the full weight of the civil and criminal laws.
                                 These are often closely linked with the national identity card and are used

The Identity Stakeholders in the Country
There are several organizations that have over the years developed points of contacts with the population, built
registers and put in place identification systems. A list of entities that we consider as core stakeholders in the
identity ecosystem in the country is given in Table 2. Those entities were interviewed as part of this Mission, in
addition to others on the commercial and demand side.

The Challenge
Before describing in detail the identity ecosystem in the country, it is important to keep in mind that the exist-
ing identification systems in Côte d’Ivoire face fundamental structural challenges as a result of the deep and
prolonged periods of crisis that followed the military coup d’état in 1999, which saw the country divided in two
in 2002, and the crisis post the 2010 elections. In fact, the question of identification and identity was a source
of conflict. At the onset of the crisis, it was estimated that more than a quarter of the population lacked effective
proof of nationality and were not known in any official registers. This fueled conflict over the legitimacy of voting
rights of large segments of the population.

The tragic events that ensued made things worse for the already fragile identification ecosystem. It led to the
destruction of some identification records, massive internal and external displacement of the population fleeing
the conflict, weakening of civil registration institutions, and a profound negative impact on citizen engagement

10
and participation in state functions (such as birth registration), especially in rural areas (which represent nearly
half of the country). Today it is believed that 3 out of 10 births in rural areas still go undeclared (according to
UNICEF), and that over 750,000 people live in Côte d’Ivoire without a recognized nationality (according
to UNHCR).

It is therefore safe to say that the identity assets that can be found in Côte d’Ivoire today were developed over
the last 5–8 years.



The Identification Schemes
The current identity ecosystem in the country is far from ideal. At a macro level, Côte d’Ivoire does not have some
of the important registers (as listed in Table 1) that are necessary for development. For example the country does
not have a national population register (NPR), nor a household register or a social register (where the poor and
vulnerable and potential beneficiaries of social protection and safety net programs are listed).

In addition the registers that do exist suffer from some challenges, which as we explained above are the linger-
ing consequences of prolonged periods of conflict. Nevertheless, currently in circulation there are several iden-
tity documents that are used for identification, some of them are backed by registers (on paper) and some are
backed by electronic registers. In both cases the coverage is limited.

Next we give an overview of each along with our ISA assessment where applicable.


The civil register
     •	    Birth and death declarations in Côte d’Ivoire have been mandatory by law since 1964,2 however gener-
           ally speaking the population does not have the reflex to declare, so compliance has been less than ideal.
     •	    The institution tasked with civil registration (DGAT) lacks the capacity and the capillarity of the points
           of contact with the population. It only has 427 civil registration bureaus. This amounts to a coverage
           ratio of 60,000:1, which means each center serves a community of about 60,000 people. International
           experience shows that this is an unacceptable ratio. Compare that with 5000:1 in Rwanda, 15000:1
           in Morocco, and 8000:1 in Peru.


     Evidence of Weak Coverage from a Recent Campaign

     In a campaign that ended March 31, 2015, ONI promoted the adoption of the national identity card through
     mobile enrollment. The campaign ended up attracting 150,000 individuals. Within that population:

     35% were not known anywhere in any civil register;

     3% came from areas where the civil register was totally destroyed;

     43.5% had only a copy of their birth registration but no other supporting documentation to prove authentic-
     ity of their claimed identity; and

     18% only had the copy of their birth registration along with all the necessary supporting documentations
     required to prove they are who they claim to be.

     These statistics were also reported to the media in a recent press conference and can be retrieved in raw
     form at http://infosnews.net/?p=711.




 The civil registration is governed by law no 64-374 of 7 October 1964 which was modified by law 83-799 of 2 August 1983.
2




                                                                                                                            11
     •	    As a consequence, registration of new birth continues to be relatively low. It is our understanding that
           it is around 55% nationally (with 79% in urban and 41% in rural areas). This is according to UNICEF
           data, which was presented to the DGAT officials during the Mission and was not disputed. No specific
           data was discussed relative to death registration but it was agreed that it was significantly lower.
     •	    Data continues to be recorded manually on paper, which makes the register not portable.
     •	    Data is not centralized and aggregated, as it remains where it was recorded. Registration takes place
           in two copies, one stays in the local civil registration bureau and the other is given to the local court.


     Reconstituting the Civil Register

     As a result of conflict, bad conservation (paper based system in a highly humid and hot environment),
     heavy use, and fire, the Mission was told that a number of civil register volumes were destroyed. As part
     of the Peace Accord of Ouagadougou (see Appendix 3), the country made a certain commitment to recon-
     stitute the civil register. The plan was to resort to two approaches:

     1.	   In some places, where only one copy of the civil register volume was destroyed, the other copy typi-
           cally kept at the local court could be retrieved and used.
     2.	   If both copies were destroyed, the plan was to call upon the population to bring forth old copies of
           their registration act or birth certificates that they may have in their possession, which could be used
           to rebuild missing portions of the civil register.

     Both of these measures were used first in order to try to reconstitute the civil register. But when both
     measures failed, the last resort was to pass through the mobile courts, which were set up throughout the
     country, in order to issue court declarations (supplementary judgments) to replace birth certificates (i.e.
     substitute birth certificates issued per court judgment) for those who were never registered in the civil reg-
     istry or whose records were destroyed. This mechanism is considered a last resort for the last category
     because of the cost and effort involved. For example, the cost of substitute birth certificates was estimated
     to be as much as $15 per person and that in one campaign the process was used to create 700,000
     replacement certificates through mobile courts set up right after the Ouagadougou Accord. It is not clear
     how many registrations were affected through this mechanism but the net result is that about 40% of adults
     today (16 and over) do not exist in any volume of the civil register either because they were never regis-
     tered in the first place or their records were destroyed. This data comes from the 150,000 person sample
     that ONI had disclosed (see earlier box).



     •	    Prior to the 2010 elections, the country embarked on a project called MECCI (Modernisation de l’Etat
           Civil de Côte d’Ivoire) intended to migrate the civil register to electronic registration and to digitize
           the paper records. For all practical intents and purposes, the project was put on hold during the post-
           electoral conflict in 2011 and while it has not been officially terminated, it has not advanced in any of
           its objectives due to lack of resources, financial and capacity.
     •	    Currently there is no credible plan to migrate from paper to electronic form.
     •	    It is important to point out that ONI has a department called Le Département de l’Etat Civil et de
           l’Identification (DECI). It is not the body tasked with the actual registration, since that is kept with the
           municipal authorities working with DGAT. The DECI is supposed to be the organization that would
           develop a centralized register based on the decentralized paper registers scattered throughout the
           country. It is our understanding that DECI does not have the funds to affect this task.
     •	    No statistics seem to exist relative to the cumulative total number of birth registration records in the
           country or the total number of paper volumes of the civil register. We understood that DGAT was in
           the process of conducting a survey, as part of its efforts to assess the size of the task required in the
           reconstitution of the civil register. At best this is a work in progress with no available data to share yet.



12
   •	   The law for birth registration used to require registration within 2 weeks. That was deemed too short. It
        was later amended and now it stands at 3 months. But according to the DGAT officials we interviewed,
        the extension to 3 months has not made a significant difference in rate of declarations.
   •	   While the registration of birth is free if done within the legal delay period (3 months), getting a copy of
        the birth registration act requires an administrative stamp that costs 500 FCFA (about 80 US cents).
        This is insignificant compared to the cost required to get a court judgment in order to affect delayed
        registration and obtain a birth certificate.

Based on the fact pattern above we can provide the following for the three main ISA indicators (Table 3):


Table 3	       Performance of the civil register in the three main indicators of ISA (color coded from red
               with major concern, to orange, to yellow and finally green representing a system that
               meets or exceeds best practices in all aspects). As can be seen there are two areas of
               major concern and one area where integration is promising but there is still significant
               room for improvement.

   Indicator            Score                                    Main Justification
 Accessibility                          Contains significant gaps, not portable (requires people to go to the
                                        office where they were first registered which creates barriers to acces-
                                        sibility), overall relatively low registration rates, estimated 40% of adults
                                        are not anywhere in any register.
 Robustness                             Paper based, not a secure document, no authentication or verification
                                        mechanisms in operation. Too many manual steps with humans in the
                                        loop and no robust accountability which could make it susceptible to
                                        petty corruption.
 Integration                            Almost every application requires a copy of the birth registration act.
                                        Unfortunately since it does not have mechanisms for electronic verifica-
                                        tion, the integration is the old fashioned way, where an individual has to
                                        present their paper copy.


The certificate of nationality
   •	   This is an important judicial foundational document (Figure 1) without which, very little administrative
        files could be constituted. It is applied for at the Court of First Instance and is signed by a judge. It
        requires the submission of a copy of a birth registration act and the identity card or a copy of a birth
        registration act of the father and/or the mother.
   •	   The process costs 3150 FCFA in fees (2500 FCFA for printing, 500 FCFA for an administrative stamp,
        and 150 FCFA for an application form; this does not include the scribes that charge for their services).
        This is a significant cost for the poor, as it is equivalent to a full week (7 day) earnings of a poor person.
   •	   This is a paper document that is supposed to be secured through official stamps, seals and water-
        marks. The Mission was not able to assess the security features of the document.
   •	   No centralized database of these documents is kept. Each court keeps records of their own issued
        certificates. Hence there is no electronic register that can be used to verify information.

This document scores very similarly to that of the birth certificate and the civil register (Table 4). In fact it may be
worse in terms of accessibility since it is costly.

 Accessibility                       Costly, administratively difficult to get.
 Robustness                          Paper based, not a secure document, no authentication or verification
                                     mechanisms in operation. Too many manual steps with humans in the

 Integration                         No electronic register. The document is used as an alternative to birth

The National Identity Card (NIC) and the Attestation of Identity Document
     •	   The national identity card in Côte d’Ivoire (Figure 2) is the main form of identification relied upon by the
          population for their daily identification needs. It was put in place as part of the Ouagadougou Peace
          Accord (See Appendix 3). At the time a mass biometric enrollment of the population was conducted
          which resulted in about 6 million registered identities of adults of 16 years and older.
     •	   The production of the ID card was halted in 2010 and did not resume until July 2014. During this period
          ONI issued what is called Attestation of Identity Document, a simple letter on paper (see Figure 3),



14
Figure 2	 The National Identity Card in Côte d’Ivoire (front and back)




Figure 3	 The Attestation of Identity Document That Was Used during the Period Where the ID
          Card Production Was Halted




        which was used to address the identification needs in the interim. This document is still accepted as
        a base document in several programs (including that of the CNAM).
   •	   Since resumption of NIC production about a year ago, 380,000 cards were produced for people who
        had not had any before, and about 120,000 replacements for lost and damaged cards were issued.
   •	   Today the National Identity Card Register stands at 6.38 million unique records. But there is no guar-
        antee that all these individuals continue to be alive. It is natural to expect that over a period of 5 years
        a significant number of deaths have occurred.
   •	   The coverage of NIC is not high. Within the segment of the population entitled to have it (age 16 and
        older) the total potential target population, according to INS (Institut National de la Statistique) (which

                                                                                                                       15
          the Mission interviewed as well), is about 10 million living individuals. This means, at best, coverage
          of the NIC is about 64% today within its targeted segment and as a universal identifier (out of the total
          population of all age groups 22,671,331 according to INS 2014 census) it has a 28% coverage.
     •	   Cost of National ID card: Today NIC is not free, unlike before 2010. The card itself costs 5000 FCFA to
          the applicant. But that is not the entire cost. It is estimated that it takes 10,000–13,000 FCFA in out-of-
          pocket expenses to get it, counting the cost of obtaining the supporting documents and transportation.
          This is equivalent to about $17–$20, which is a huge barrier for poor people (equivalent of one month
          income for a poor person).
     •	   Information printed on front of the card includes: identity card number, name, family name, frontal
          photo, date of birth, place of birth, gender, height, date of issuance, date of last validity (10 year
          expiration).
     •	   Information printed on back of the card includes: residence address, profession, signature, name of
          father and mother and their dates of birth. Serial number of card stock.
     •	   Base breeder documents: There are two documents required to obtain a National Identity Card
          a.	   Copy of the birth registration act (or court judgment for those not registered) and
          b.	   The certificate of nationality.
     •	   While no official statistics were shared with the Mission, we were informed that the coverage is biased
          towards urban and that rural coverage is worse.
     •	   There are 150 enrollment centers around the country. In addition ONI has started conducting mobile
          enrollment campaigns to help increase uptake of the card.
     •	   Biometric enrollment: The enrollment process captures 10 fingerprints (done one at a time, and not
          using the 4-4-2 standard now commonly used internationally) and a face photograph. Uniqueness is
          assured through a biometric de-duplication process using a state of the art AFIS which is owned by
          ONI (supplied by Safran Morpho).
     •	   Security Features: The card is a contactless 8K smart card, on which two fingers are stored in memory
          along with other biographic information. The data is signed with a proprietary vendor provided encryp-
          tion mechanism (not a national certificate authority).
     •	   No electronic authentication has ever been done using this card, nor is there any web service run
          by ONI to allow others to authenticate the information online or the identity information by consulting
          directly the ONI database.
     •	   Fraud: While we believe the card is reasonably secure as a document there is an after market for lost
          and stolen cards. This is because there is no way to deactivate these cards. They remain in circulation
          and make their way to an illegal market. The seller simply finds a card with the closest facial resem-
          blance to a buyer.
     •	   Delay in issuance: Officially it takes 1 month from application to issuance. But in reality and according
          to the statistics of ONI the delay is between 2–3 months. It takes this long because the basic docu-
          ments used are checked manually against the records of the court and of the local civil registration
          bureau (a person is sent to consult the records).
     •	   Update of information: It is important to emphasize that the Register of the National Identity Card does
          not have mechanisms to allow people to update their information. In fact, there is no law that requires
          update of the information printed on the card. As a consequence residence, profession and name
          changes are not reflected on the card until it is reissued upon expiration and renewal. No cards have
          yet expired in the country (10 year validity).
     •	   The National Identity Card Number is 10 digits which codes for the center where it was applied for
          and is sequential beyond that. It does not contain any hash or control digits to protect against errors in

  Indicator           Score                                 Main Justification
 Accessibility                    Cost, complex base documentation. Low capillarity for enrollment centers.
                                  Result in low coverage (28% of total population and 64% of adults 16 years
                                  and older have it).
                                  Rural and poor significantly lower coverage.
 Robustness                       Enrollment is biometric-based.
                                  Validation of the base documents takes place manually against the court
                                  and civil register records to ensure that the documents are not falsified.
                                  Reasonable security features for the credential.
                                  No authentication of identity against the card.
 Integration                      Many interactions between the citizen and the government require the
                                  national identity card. It is also required for commercial transactions.
                                  Unfortunately there are no electronic services that access the identity card
                                  register. As a consequence integration is short from ideal.


        data entry or to check if a number is actually valid. In general the NIC number does not play the role
        of the Unique Identification Number (UIN) that could be used for all administrative purposes to identify
        individuals uniquely and provide holistic views of them by linking different government databases. This
        number, while printed on the face of the card, is ignored by the citizens and is not used as the unique
        identifier.
   •	   We should point out that the NIC is issued only to citizens. Resident aliens are issued a similar but
        distinct document by ONI. We understand that there have been about 500,000 resident cards issued
        thus far.

Based on the fact pattern above we can provide the following for the three main ISA indicators (Table 5).


The electoral register and voter identity cards
   •	   Côte d’Ivoire does not have a long history with computerized electoral registers. The first time it had
        one was in 2010 when a mass biometric enrollment for the national identity card was performed. Back
        then the register for the NIC and the electoral register were one and the same (except the electoral
        register only kept those 18 years and older).
   •	   While they started the same, currently they are becoming different and distinct. ONI has maintained its
        identity card register and has added to it another 500,000 entries (380,000 new ones). Those updates
        have not been communicated to CEI (the election commission). Nor is there any plan to do so.
   •	   Back in 2010, 5.7 million voter cards (Figure 4) were personalized and printed on cardboard paper.
        These cards were not intended to be used as general identification documents. They were required
        to be presented at the polling station where an elections officer verified that the photo along with the
        identity information matched what was printed on the local voter roster, before someone was allowed
        to proceed to cast their vote.
   •	   The country has gone through the process of updating its voter register in preparation for the Octo-
        ber 2015 elections. This raises an interesting development. From what we could ascertain the update




                                                                                                                   17

          process is independent of the updates to the National Identity Card Register kept by ONI. It means
          that for the first time there will be two different registers of significantly overlapping populations. We
          view the decoupling of the two registers as a lost opportunity for trying to reinforce and keep up to date
          a national register from which the voter lists could be derived.
     •	   In order to be added to the voter register a person needs to provide either the National Identity Card
          or their certificate of nationality.
     •	   Temporary enrollment centers are being set up in variety of places around the country to deal with the
          update exercise. As mentioned earlier there are no plans to communicate information back to ONI.
     •	   This identification system was not subjected to ISA since it is not considered an ID system used
          by the population, and the register will remain isolated and used for the purpose of the upcoming
          election only.

The identification system of the CNAM: Universal health coverage
     •	   In 2014, Côte d’Ivoire adopted an obligatory universal health coverage scheme which is intended to
          provide coverage of every single person in the country in the long term.
     •	   This is a contributory scheme, designed to be rolled out in phases. In the first phase the intent is to
          enroll the employees of the formal sector and their families, a population estimated at 4 million indi-
          viduals. The intent was to complete the enrollment of this phase by the end of 2015. Today only a
          few thousand people have enrolled as the reception of the system has been less than enthusiastic; it
          obliges people to make mandatory contributions to be part of this national health coverage plan. It is
          unlikely 4 million individuals would be enrolled by end of 2015.
     •	   The second phase was supposed to target the informal sector, while the third phase would attempt
          to cover the poor. For the latter category, the government is supposed to make contributions on their
          behalf. But this poses a fundamental problem since there is no register for the poor (social register)
          in existence today, so such phase of enrollment could not be started until there is a social register in
          existence.
     •	   Combining the three phases, the plan is to enroll 11 million people over the next 7 years.
     •	   The CNAM has already opened 54 enrollment centers throughout the country in order to capture
          identity data including biographic and biometric information filled in first by the applicant on a paper

        application form (Figure 6) and then entered electronically into the system by the operator along with
        biometric data.
   •	   The biometric data consists of 10 fingers, enrolled two at a time. A face portrait is also captured for
        printing on the card. The fingers are used to deduplicate using an AFIS.
   •	   Enrollment of children: The plan is to enroll the fingerprints starting at 12 years old. For children below
        12 they would be enrolled using the fingerprints of a parent or guardian. This enrollment would be
        repeated for each child. So for a parent with 5 children, their fingerprints would be enrolled 5 times.
   •	   What is significant about the CNAM ID system is that it is the only one in the country that will be obliga-
        tory and would include everyone (all age groups). All other systems are voluntary and cover only a
        segment of the population. This means, if this scheme succeeds, the country will have a National
        Population Register and a Family Register, something it does not possess today. But the current
        CNAM register is far from achieving that. It has to first be embraced by the population that is yet to
        show enthusiasm for the scheme.
   •	   Cost of participation is 1000 FCFA per month per person. So a family of 5 will pay 60,000 FCFA (about
        $100) per year on this baseline health scheme. Since coverage is limited to those who can afford it,
        they would also have to have supplementary insurance.
   •	   The identity system proposed is robust and innovative. The enrollment process is robust as it uses
        biometrics. The credential itself features a significant set of security features (Embossing, Guilloches,
        MicroText, Fluorescent UV ink). It also provides for a mechanism for authentication. While the card is

   •	   The scheme is supposed to attribute a social security number for life. This could be a candidate for the
        unique identifier that could be used for other administrative applications.

Based on the fact patterns examined, today we would give the CNAM the ISA scores shown in Table 6.

While the target performance in 7 years would be (assuming the accomplishment of all project objectives as
stated in the project award contract) as shown in Table 7.

In our opinion the CNAM represents a very promising foundational identity system with good to very good scores
in the ISA indicators in the long run. It can be improved even more if coverage of the population could be

     Indicator        Score                                  Main Justification
 Accessibility                     Would cover 11–12 million people in 7 years. That would represent 45% of
                                   the population.
 Robustness                        Very robust. Uses biometric enrollment and innovative methods of
                                   authentication.
 Integration                       More applications are supposed to integrate into the CNAM register and
                                   hence over time the integration score will improve, especially as the CNAM
                                   card becomes recognized as an alternative to the national identity card.


increased. This is a major challenge that would have to be overcome. Potentially the CNAM could become a
social security card upon which many other programs and applications would be based.


Other identification schemes
There are a few other identification systems in the country. These include the drivers’ licenses and the passport.
Both are run through a PPP with different commercial companies. They both represent robust identity systems as
they produce credentials up to international standards of security. We do not consider these schemes as viable
general purpose identification systems since they have very low coverage. To date only about 240,000 driver’s
licenses and about 600,000 passports were issued since 2008. Still these are interesting schemes to examine
since they show how Private-Public-Partnerships can work successfully in Côte d’Ivoire and in one case (the
driver’s license) they highlight an important innovation through the use of NFC for authentication of the card (see
section below).



Legal Framework
The identification systems and the institutions responsible for them in Côte d’Ivoire are subject to a significant
number of legal acts that define the obligations, administrative procedures and the mandates. These go back as
early as 1962. Appendix 2 gives a chronological listing of all the laws pertaining to identification up to the Peace
Accord (Appendix 3). High level review of these laws does not reveal anything unusual. For the most part the
legal framework has adhered to what is commonly found in Francophone countries.

There is however one exception that we view as very positive and that is the Law No. 2013-450 Relative to the
Protection of Personally Identifying Information, which was passed by the assembly on 19 June 2013 and was
signed into law by the president of the republic a few months later. This is the adaptation and codification of the
ECOWAS treaty of 2008 and the Supplementary Act of 2010 on privacy which commit member states to adopt
data protection laws and provide the broad framework for them. A detailed analysis of Law No 2013-450 is given
in Appendix 4.

As can be seen from Appendix 4, this is a highly developed law and represents a very positive step for the pro-
tection of individual rights against abuse of identification systems by anyone that has legal access to the data
contained in them.

The Mission was also pleased to see the level of commitment the country has to enforcing this law. The role of the
Data Protection Authority was entrusted in 2014 to the powerful telecommunication regulatory body (ARTCI) that
we believe has the competence, capacity and the political backing and will to bring forth effective enforcement
of this important legal framework.

We believe this type of legal structure is highly unusual in developing countries. To illustrate, we show the result
of our analysis of the legal framework in Africa in Table 8. Based on the analyzed fact pattern we give Côte
d’Ivoire the highest score (Green) in the legal framework which is applicable to all identity schemes.

4                 Analysis and Recommendations



Overall Assessment
Looking at all the detailed data concerning the available identity schemes currently in the country, as we have
summarized above within the ISA framework, we readily conclude that the identity ecosystem of Côte d’Ivoire
suffers from significant structural issues that make it difficult to find a single identifier that can be used to support
the identification needs for delivery of public services.

In fact the current Mission was motivated by the need to find an identifier that can be used for the WB Project
mentioned in the introduction. Based on our ISA assessment we can say that there is no such identifier in exis-
tence. In other words there is no identifier with high coverage of the poor and vulnerable population that is robust
and that is easy to integrate into the project. By and large the poor remain without any form of identification that
can be relied on.

As a consequence we recommend developing a custom, low cost functional scheme (social identification
scheme) to meet the needs of the WB Project. But, as we discuss further below, the proposed approach would
be designed to allow this social identifier to interoperate with broad foundational schemes when they arise in the
country (expansion of the ONI, the CNAM or an NPR initiative).

In this section we present a series of recommendations for opportunities to improve and reinforce the identity
ecosystem in general and to help meet the needs of the WB Project in particular.



Developing an Identification Scheme for the WB Project
Given that no appropriate identifier exists in the country, it is our recommendation to develop one specific to the
project. This can be done by following a 3-step process as follows:

   1.	   Survey: Perform house-to-house surveys to collect socioeconomic data in targeted regions using the
         appropriate socioeconomic questionnaire. Here it is highly recommended that the survey be run on tab-
         lets using open source software such as ODK (Open Data Kit), which has shown itself to be very effec-
         tive in similar environments (see Figure 8). The survey data is automatically consolidated using the ODK
         Server software (open source as well) whenever the tablets have Wi-Fi connectivity to synchronize with
         the server. Here there are two options, depending on whether the server is housed in the country (most
         probably for compliance with data privacy regulations) or on the cloud at Google (can be used during
         testing and customization of the questionnaire). In either case the software is free and the World Bank
         has technical expertise that could assist in making the right choice.
   2.	   PMT: Proxy Means Test algorithm could be run on the collected data once aggregated. Individuals that
         fall within the category of eligibility would be then subsequently invited to enroll their identity and enter
         the program as a beneficiary. It is important that the enrollment that includes biometrics be done after
         the PMT.



                                                                                                                      25
Figure 8	 Social Survey Conducted on Low Cost Tablets Using ODK Software in a Recent Survey
          in Djibouti




     3.	   Enrollment: At the stage of targeted enrollment, we recommend taking only two fingerprints (the two
           index fingers) and a face photo. This will be enough data for anyone above the age of 12. For anyone
           below 12, a portrait photo will be sufficient.

The biometric data specified above, is sufficient to achieve the following objectives:

     1.	   De-duplication of enrollment to achieve uniqueness and prevent leakage and fraud (not a big issue in this
           program and could be skipped, but will become important for the tasks described below).
     2.	   Respond to the authentication needs at the time of service delivery, if applicable, in order to know that the
           entitled person is who is receiving the benefits and to confirm that he or she has received them.
     3.	   Establish a potential link in the future between the identity as enrolled in the beneficiary database and
           the national identity scheme that could one day give robust identity to everyone in the country (here we
           imagine a link with CNAM, NIC or a future National Population Register). By having two fingerprints on
           file, it is easy to link the record down across databases using biometric matching (biometrics here play
           the role of what we call link tags).

This proposed functional enrollment is very cost effective and can be performed on a laptop or on a tablet
equipped with a fingerprint sensor. A unique number would be attributed to each beneficiary and can be printed
on a low cost ID card that can be used for identification of beneficiaries in certain cases where needed at the
time of service delivery. Of course it is important to also capture information about identity documents that the
individual may have, for example, reference to their identity card, or birth certificate or the CNAM card. While
such information is not required (since many may not have it), it is helpful to validate along with the biometrics
the links with the foundational identity systems in the country in the future.



Developing a Social Register
The outcome of the above activity is more general than just an identifier for the WB Project. In fact it leads to the
foundation of a Social Register (SR). In the context of the WB project this SR would be initially populated with

26
the results of the survey specific to the project, but there is no reason why this register could not house data from
other programs. During the Mission, several entities have expressed interest in having access to a social register
in order to improve their targeting. Among those that would be users of such a register outside the social protec-
tion and safety net programs are:

   1.	   The CNAM and the Ministry of Health: Because in later phases of the CNAM rollout, the notion of who is
         poor becomes very important since the obligatory universal health coverage scheme requires the gov-
         ernment to pay the subscription charges for those individuals. There is significant interest in collaborat-
         ing with the organization that would be responsible for putting in place a social register (presumably the
         Ministry of Employment, Social Affairs and Vocational Training ME-MEASFP).
   2.	   Ministry of Education: There is strong interest on the part of MoE because of current programs that target
         the poor. Those include the annual scholastic kits and the food programs. We understand those are on
         the order of tens of millions of dollars. The MoE has a clear need to determine who is entitled to be a
         beneficiary of these programs. The Social Register would be key to answering that question.
   3.	   Ministry of National Solidarity, of Women and Children: Once again several of their programs could ben-
         efit from having access to the Social Register in order to improve their targeting.

We believe the case for putting together the foundation of a Social Register and for populating it can be strongly
made in Côte d’Ivoire. World Bank analysis of the 2015 government budget shows that the country is spending
about 1716.4 billion FCFA (about $3 billion) on programs that are pro-poor. This will increase when the Universal
Health Coverage reaches the phase of enrolling that population. Without a robust Social Register in place, the
government pro-poor expenditure would be undermined by the lack of mechanisms for targeting.

The WB Project is the ideal opportunity to lay the foundation for the SR. From a technology point of view the
system needs a few components as described in the high level architecture shown in Figure 9. According to the
schematic, the Social Register would consist of two major components:

   1.	   Identity management (shaded orange): where enrollment, de-duplication and Unique Identity Number
         for the social sector is generated and attributed. This is a COTS or commercial-off-the-shelf type module
         and is independent of the details of the programs. This module would have been unnecessary had there
         been in place a robust identifier issued by another organization, upon which the SR could rely.
   2.	   Management Information System (MIS) (shaded gray): This system performs the identity management
         and makes potential beneficiaries lists available to various programs that need them. It can perform tasks
         such as updates, changes in status, complaints and data exchange with programs that require identifica-
         tion data of beneficiaries. A more detailed yet basic architecture for the MIS is given in Figure 10. One
         structure that we highly recommend using is a Data Management Web Services module, which serves
         as the portal through which access to the SR would be performed. This simplifies the design of the SR
         and shields it from having to know the details of the programs, present and in the future.

It is important to note that while the WB Project could be done on an excel spreadsheet without an MIS, that
approach would miss an opportunity to build something more lasting to support social protection programs. For
that reason we recommend the development of an extensible MIS that can support the needs of more than just
one limited program. Data about the poor is very valuable and needs to be housed, maintained and analyzed
within an appropriate information system.

As for the other component, the identity management system, given the small size of the population targeted by
the program, this should not be a major burden to the WB project. It should be possible to perform the enrollment
of the entire population of beneficiaries of the program (around 200,000) with a single laptop for the database and
for the ABIS (which is a COTS de-duplication engine that uses finger and face matching technology as opposed
to AFIS which uses only finger matching).

The MIS would contain all the standard functionalities of a management information system, such as role based
user management (controlling access to data to comply with data protection laws and data security requirement)


                                                                                                                  27

and reporting (for audit as well as for decision support). It would be web-based and accessible remotely via a
standard web browser from anywhere where connectivity permits access to the internet. It could be from any
point of contact with the population, such as a fixed community social program office, a cyber-community office,
a mobile enrollment and update kit, etc.

The MIS also would manage the invitation for enrollment. This module could be as simple as exporting to an
excel spreadsheet the list of individuals and their contact information that need to receive an invitation to enroll.
The method of invitation after that would be determined by how communication is done within the local com-
munities. In some cases it could be interfacing with a list service that sends text messages for those who have
registered a phone as their method of contact.



Populating the Social Register
The value of a Social Register increases significantly with the size of the population it covers. While the WB
Project could lay the foundation for a register and would seed it with a small population, in the long run there
needs to be other mechanisms in place to significantly increase its coverage. Estimates, shared with us by INS,
indicate that the Social Register in Côte d’Ivoire at this given time could potentially contain 4–5 million identities,
namely those considered poor today (earning less than 450 FCFA per day). Given the framework (technical and

operational) for a SR, which will be produced by the WB Project, there are two supplementary approaches to
grow the social database:

     1.	        Ensuring that all social programs use it and not just WB Project: This is the concept of the unified reg-
                ister, where all social programs pool data on their beneficiaries, and use a unique social number to
                identify them across programs. Data is kept up-to-date through beneficiary engagement within programs
                over time.
     2.	        Periodic social census: Where house-to-house surveys are conducted in targeted areas covering the
                bottom, for example 40%, of the population. These could be conducted with the engagement of INS as
                the methodology is very similar to the national census (conducted once every 10 years), but here the
                focus is not on aggregate data. Instead the objective is to identify individuals and attribute to them socio-
                economic scores in order to target them for social benefits. The experience in this area is extensive. For
                example Indonesia conducts a social survey once every three years, so does Rwanda (Ubudehe regis-
                ter), Colombia (SISBEN), Brazil (Cad Unico). Such surveys once every three years could be justified in
                places where billions are spent on poverty alleviating programs as they help make these programs more
                effective. This is the case for Côte d’Ivoire, hence it is pertinent to promote the development of a national
                policy for putting in place a Unified Social Register.




                                                                                                                                                            29
The international experience shows that a Social Register could be populated rather rapidly if there was a clear
incentive for the population to come and declare in order to be considered for eligibility of specific programs. For
example, in early 2014 Jordan put a fuel subsidy program in place (Fuel Subsidy Cash Compensation Scheme)
and invited the population to apply via the web. In a period of 3 months, 80% of households did apply by filling
online a detailed socioeconomic questionnaire. As a consequence the country now has a social register contain-
ing a wealth of socioeconomic data about its population that it uses for targeting for social protection programs
(even though the original program that incited people to participate is no longer in place because of a drop in
oil prices).

It is important to also emphasize that the Social Register is necessarily a household register because it is impor-
tant for social targeting to know who shares roof and table. The World Bank has significant experience around the
world in helping countries develop household registers that are used in support of social programs. That experi-
ence could be put to use in designing the approach and technical components that go into a social household
register.



Consider Using the Universal Health Coverage Program to Populate the SR
In the case of Côte d’Ivoire we see the Universal Health Coverage program of the CNAM as an ideal opportunity
to try to populate the SR. If the population believes they have a chance to have the government pay for their
coverage because of their status as poor, it is very likely that they will come forward and participate in the ques-
tionnaires of the Social Register.

In fact a development that we learned about at the Ministry of Telecommunication makes this even more feasible.
The ministry is in the process of putting together 5000 community cyber centers to help bring more people in the
country online. These centers could be ideal places to help people fill in the social surveys that enrich the Social
Register data without having to perform the house-to-house surveys. Ultimately a hybrid mechanism may be the
optimal choice. The design of such a strategy can only be done through a detailed study of the demographic fact
patterns in the country.



Consider Engaging with ONI and/or CNAM for Enrollment
While the proposed workflow will continue to be

Survey→PMT→Enroll,

how enrollment is done could be flexible. For the WB Project it can be proprietary to the project itself since it cov-
ers a very small population. However, for scalability it may make sense to adopt a process where the Survey in
the field is used to determine where there are gaps in the identity credentials (those who do not have an ID or a
CNAM card). The way this could work is to use the concept of Registrar, where an agent of the social protection
project could be trained by CNAM or ONI to perform the enrollment on their behalf, or could actually be accom-
panied within the context of campaigns by agents of ONI and CNAM in order to achieve two objectives.

     i.	    Enroll people for the social protection program (while at the same time);
     ii.	   Enroll them into a more foundational identity database such as ONI or CNAM.

Based on the interest we have seen, during the Mission, from ONI and CNAM in trying to increase their enroll-
ments, we believe engaging with these two organizations early on and making them stakeholders in the develop-
ment of the Social Register could be a very fruitful collaboration.

Modernizing the Civil Register: What Priorities?
The task of modernizing the civil register in Côte d’Ivoire is a monumental one given its current state. The list of
to-do is very long. This calls for establishing priorities as it would be unrealistic to embark on the full scope of the
project. Some of the actions that should be considered as priority include:

    i.	   Amend the civil registration law to include an electronic civil register. Current law covers only paper
          based registers. Without this step, the electronic civil register cannot gain its legal weight and all actions
          will remain administrative only.
   ii.	   Modernize the registration offices by giving them connectivity and computers that can run Civil Registra-
          tion and Vital Statistics (CRVS) software.
  iii.	   Develop a phased plan for digital transformation of the civil register which includes consolidation of the
          register centrally, electronic registration of new births, and a plan to digitize a portion of the historical
          paper based records focusing on the population segments underserved by other registers (notably the
          children). The DGAT and the Ministry of Interior recognize the need to digitize the historical civil register,
          but this is a time consuming and costly exercise. We are not convinced that it is the highest priority for
          the full register. What is more important is to ensure that as soon as possible all civil registration bureaus
          are modernized with electronic systems with CRVS software connected to a centralized database. At the
          limit, digitizing a smaller segment of the register could be included on the list of priorities. Full digitizing
          could wait and be done on a longer time scale and when capacity is available.
   iv.	   Launch a campaign to sensitize people to the importance of civil registration for children. The popula-
          tion does not seem to have the reflex of declaration of births. A fundamental shift in attitude has to occur
          before a viable civil registration system can be put in place. The passage to electronic registration could
          be the ideal opportunity.
   v.	 Empower health workers to perform the birth declarations more effectively. For example at the time of
       first vaccination, any child that does not have a birth certificate could be declared and registered through
       the system. Use of CRVS application on a mobile phone could be very helpful in that regard.

In addition it is important to invest in capacity and in training of the civil registration officers. During the Mission it
was clear that, in many places around the country, the officers are performing this task in addition to their other
daily responsibilities. It appears that they may not have been trained to deal with the challenges posed by the
stream of exceptional cases that present themselves and that challenge the civil register. A standard operating
procedure manual and a help desk available to registration officers seeking guidance may be essential in ensur-
ing consistency of the process, improving quality of declaration, and in simplifying the administrative steps for
the public. All will result in positive changes in the population attitude towards registration and their participation
in the process.



Leverage Mobile Innovations
During our Mission we saw two innovative applications where mobile technology was used to add robustness to
an identity scheme while reducing cost. These are:

   •	     Driver’s licenses: The Côte d’Ivoire driver’s license is actually not a smart card in the traditional sense
          (the previous generation in the middle of the 2000s was). It is a card that does not stock identity infor-
          mation inside a chip, except it has an NFC tag (very low cost) with a unique number. The code can be
          read by a standard mobile phone (Samsung, Apple, etc.) through the NFC interface, by simply tapping
          the card on the phone. An application available to police officers allows them to ping the central server
          using standard wireless networks. The purpose of this query is to check the validity of the card and
          the information printed on it. It is a mechanism of online authentication. The database has queries to
          see if the card number is valid and it retrieves the identity of the person affiliated with that card along
          with the driving privileges active. So even if the card is fake or altered, the central records cannot be


                                                                                                                        31
          faked and hence the card will fail to be authenticated. In this way, the country has managed to move
          away from expensive smart cards, thus lowering cost, but at the same time enhancing security since
          authentication against the unalterable central database is the highest form of authentication.
     •	   CNAM Card: Once again the card is NOT an electronic smart card. Instead it contains a mechanism
          that allows for verification of the identity of its holder. This is in the form of the Datamatrix 2D barcode
          which contains the mathematical templates for the two index fingers (see Figure 5, bottom). The 2D
          barcode is read through a standard camera on a mobile android device (see Figure 7) the templates
          encrypted in the 2D pattern are read, decrypted and then are matched against the live fingerprints
          presented on the sensor of the special mobile device. This provides for authentication in an offline
          modality. In other words it allows the authentication of identity without having to access the centralized
          database.

Both examples point to very interesting models of authentication, which will be required for service delivery in
some cases. We see the role of mobile to be critical in enrolling identity (use of mobile fingerprint equipped tab-
lets) as well as for authentication (through schemes like the two just discussed and that are already in use in Côte
d’Ivoire). Given the information infrastructure of the country, we expect that a mobile strategy for all identification
schemes to be more effective and should be seriously considered. This includes migrating civil registration pro-
cesses, ONI, CNAM and Social Register enrollments to mobile platforms.



Establishing the Unique Identity Number (UIN) and the National Population Register
It is clear that the identity landscape in the country is fragmented. Currently and under development, there are
multiple identification schemes covering different segments of the population without any one of them achieving
the privileged status of being a complete foundational system or a national population register. The CNAM sys-
tem has the ambition to cover every single person (children included), but even according to their optimistic plans
one can expect only 11 million people in 7 years in that database. The National Identity Card on the other hand
is not mandated to cover people younger than 16 years. Furthermore, we suspect some registers for school chil-
dren will emerge or are currently in place (the Mission was unable to verify because of limited time). Add to that
the driver’s licenses, the passports, the voter registers, the certificate of nationality, the birth certificate, and we
have a patchwork of identification schemes to cover the total population. We should point out that each scheme
attributes a number or an identifier to the enrolled individual.

This fragmentation in the identity landscape will continue as long as there is no robust and simple mechanism for
linking the same identities across the different repositories. The mechanism for doing so is known as the Unique
Identifying Number (UIN), which many countries around the world (even ones with robust identification systems)
are now resorting to in order to link identity across government databases. This is the mechanism which enables
the interoperability and portability of identity. It links disparate databases and hence unifies the interaction of the
individual across multiple agencies, thus presenting a unique and coherent view of the individual to the public
facing governmental agencies.

The objective of having a robust UIN is to improve the administrative efficiency and to eliminate leakages and
losses due to identity fraud that invariably results when the multitude of identity programs in operation do not dis-
pose of the means to cross-check and link identities. This is particularly true for social protection programs which
need to go beyond the individual and establish unique households which can be targeted for social assistance.
In addition the UIN is helpful in easing the burden of declaration of identity on people. For example in countries
like Belgium, with the UIN in place, an individual is not obliged to declare his or her information more than once
(for example change of address). Once declared, that information is propagated through the UIN to all agencies
that need it. Finally, the UIN is recognized as an important tool to accelerate the country’s entry into the era of
electronic service delivery, as one of the elements of a national electronic government strategy.

All of these factors were raised with high level representatives of the Ministry of Information Technology and Tele-
communication. The interest and agreement on the need to put in place a UIN suggests that there is consensus


32
in the country for the desire to have such a tool. The issue is really how to go about achieving it in a cost
effective way.

The proposal is one of federation of all the registers. Within this framework the identity exists within an ecosystem
with multiple points of entry. A point of entry is a database where the individual has been robustly enrolled. This
could be the Civil Register, the ONI database, the CNAM database, etc. In order to harmonize between them,
each database is required to attribute a UIN to each record. The UIN could be generated using a common logic
or it could be generated by a common engine kept by a number-generating service (housed at ONI or the Civil
Register). In the latter, it means that the different databases request numbers for each entry in their records. The
World Bank has experience with both mechanisms. Either way, the end result is:

    i.	   The attribution of a UIN to each record that exists in various attestation databases (batch attribution for
          existing records);
   ii.	   The attribution of such a number at birth for all new births;
  iii.	   The harmonization across the databases (linkage of identity);
   iv.	   The emergence of a national population register (the list of names and UINs).

For someone to enter the National Population Register they need to have been enrolled somewhere in some
database. These are the databases that attest for people’s existence and their uniqueness (through the use of
biometrics, or birth registration formalities, or administrative procedures).

There are several architectures for achieving this that could be elaborated if the country has an interest in pursu-
ing this development.



Paying Attention to Data Protection and Privacy
Developing identification schemes is a very sensitive subject. They involve the collection of and consolidation
of information that could be privacy invading, and in general they are susceptible to abuse since registers of
population that show where everyone in the country lives and who they live with could be used for control. As a
consequence they should only be done within well-defined and strong legal protection frameworks.

Practically speaking Côte d’Ivoire has already a law (Law No. 2013-450) that covers the protection of Person-
ally Identifying Information (PII). This was adopted late in 2013. The role of the data protection authority was
entrusted to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Côte d’Ivoire (ARTCI), which reports into the Minis-
try of the Post, Information Technology and Communication (MPTIC). While ARTCI has had about a year in this
new mission, they are already active in their role to try to enforce the law. In Appendix 4 we present a detailed
analysis of what the provisions of this law are and what they mean for identity projects. From an operational point
of view it requires that the project connect as soon as possible with ARTCI in order to register the intent to collect
PII, get their approval, and ensure their continued participation as the project expands through its various phases
of data collection. It requires the development of privacy, data access and retention policies. We refer the reader
to the Appendix for further details.

                  Brief Chronology of
                  Identification Regulations
                  in Côte d’Ivoire

 The identification of people living in Côte d’Ivoire has always been a major concern for all governments since
 independence even well before the Peace Accord. Over the years, Côte d’Ivoire has expressed its desire to man-
 age its population through various laws and structures for the implementation of projects for the identification of
 individuals. Here is a brief chronology of these laws leading up to the Peace Accord.

    •	   The first measure was the promulgation of Law No. 62-64 of 20 February 1962 on the establishment
         of the National Identity Card. On 13 June 1962, Circular No 1138 established an Identity Card for For-
         eigners, replacing the Identity Booklet for foreigners which was put in place by the Legislative Decree
         of 12 January 1932 concerning the conditions for admission and residence of French and other for-
         eign nationals in French West Africa (AOF).
    •	   On October 7, 1964, Law No 64-374 was passed relative to civil registration. It was modified by Law
         No 83-799 of 2 August 1983.
    •	   In 1990, Circular No 1138 of 13 June 1962 was replaced by Law No. 90-437 of 29 May 1990 on the
         entry and residence of foreigners in Côte d’Ivoire which provides in Article 6: “. . . any foreigner over
         16 years of age, if he stays in country and after the expiration of a period of three months since enter-
         ing the Ivorian territory, must have a residence permit.”
    •	   Decree No. 90-370 of 23 May 1990 amended the decree implementing Law No. 62-64 of 20 February
         1962 establishing the National Identity Card. The “Security Project (SP)” was created which included
         a computerized system of identification and control of national and foreign population by the produc-
         tion of highly secure identity documents. This structure began operations in October 1991 by issuing
         of residence cards.
    •	   In September 1993, the SP produced the first National Identity Cards (the green cards).
    •	   In 1998, Law No. 98-448 of August 4 on the identification of persons and residence of foreigners in
         Côte d’Ivoire was promulgated. The decree implementing this law allowed for the creation of the Cen-
         tral Identification Repository (CIS) and the production of the National Identity Card (for Ivorian) and
         Residence Card (for foreigners).
    •	   In 1999, Law No. 99-690 of December 14, amending the Law No. 98-448 of August 4, 1998, was
         enacted. The production of all identity documents was interrupted during the coup of 24 December
         1999.
    •	   In February 2000, the National Center for Secure Identification (CNIS) was created to replace the
         CIS. This structure did not produce identity cards, but established administrative certificates for Ivorian
         identity and issued residence permits to foreigners.
    •	   In 2001, the National Identification Office (ONI) was established by Decree No. 2001-103 of February
         15 as a successor of the National Center for Secure Identification (CNIS).
    •	   The objectives assigned to the ONI were: the implementation of the civil registration policy covering
         officers, civil officials and judicial authorities concerned with population identification, immigration and
         the emigration of residents of Côte d’Ivoire.




                                                                                                                        37
     •	   In 2002, Law No. 2002-03 of January 3 on the identification of persons and residence of foreigners in
          Côte d’Ivoire repealed Act No. 98-448 of 4 August 1998.
     •	   In 2004, Law No. 2002-03 of January 3, 2002, is amended by Law No. 2004-303 of 3 May 2004.
     •	   In 2005, Decision No. 2005-05/PR of 15 July 2005 defines the new framework for the identification of
          people and stay of foreigners in Côte d’Ivoire.
     •	   Ordinance No. 2007-06 of January 17, 2007, provided uniform conditions for obtaining the national
          identity card.
     •	   In 2007 the Peace Accord of Ouagadougou of March 4, 2007, calls for robust identification practices
          in support of lasting peace and bases the population register on the electoral register of 2000 as
          amended through a biometric census.

                   Identification Measures
                   Dictated by the Peace Accord
                   of Ouagadougou

 The need for more robust identification in Côte d’Ivoire was recognized as an important element for exiting the
 crisis and for achieving lasting peace by the Accord of Ouagadougou, signed March 4, 2007. The signatories
 to the Agreement recognized that the identification of Ivorian and foreign populations living in Côte d’Ivoire was
 a major concern. The absence of clear and coherent identification mechanisms, as well as the lack of unique
 administrative documents certifying the identity and nationality of individuals, were a source of conflict. The
 Agreement indicated that the problem of identity had to be addressed first before fair and open elections could
 be conducted in a manner acceptable to all parties. As a consequence they called for a set of specific measures.
 These included the following elements which formed the foundation for the identification practices in the country
 for many years post-crisis:

    1.	   The launch of mobile courts in order to issue court declarations (supplementary judgments) to replace
          birth certificates (i.e. substitute birth certificate issued per court judgment) for those who were never
          registered in the civil registry.
    2.	   The reconstitution, on a priority basis, of lost or destroyed birth records in some registration centers in
          parallel with the work on court declarations.
    3.	   Establishment of new identity credentials (national identity and resident cards).
    4.	   For the sake of accelerating the development of an identification system and given the prevailing status
          of administration in the country and the necessities subsequent to the crisis, the parties agreed to base
          the identity register on the electoral list of the year 2000.
    5.	   The conduct, by the Election Commission, of a census including the collection of biometric data from
          each Ivorian 18 years and older in order to update the 2000 electoral list. All those enrolled during the
          campaign were issued a receipt with a unique identifying number which was required for collecting the
          voter card and the new national identity card after personalization and production.
    6.	   After the validation process of the electoral list by the Election Commission, the register would be consid-
          ered as the common foundational database for the issuance of the new national identity and voter cards
          and for identification needs going forward.


    The National Enrollment Campaign

    •	    Mass population registration with biometrics began in August 2008 and continued until April 2009.
    •	    > 6000 mobile biometric registration kits capable of capturing 10 fingerprints (captured 1 finger at a
          time) and a face photograph in addition to biographic data were shared among 11,000 registration
          centers spread across the country and in consulates and embassies in 22 countries overseas.
    •	    The data was collected into 70 coordination centers before being sent to a central facility in Abidjan
          to be consolidated nationally.
                                                                                                      (continued)




                                                                                                                    39
     Continued

     •	    The records were de-duplicated using a state of the art Automated Fingerprint Identification System
           (AFIS) to establish their uniqueness.
     •	    At that time 11 million secure blank ID cards (featuring contactless smart chips) were produced;
           5.7 million were personalized (personalization took place in batch mode in France and the completed
           cards were delivered to Abidjan for distribution); 9 million voter cards were printed, and 5.7 Million
           were personalized (see figure below) in addition to 500,000 resident permits.
     •	    Enrollments continued for the national ID and included those 16 years and older. It is our understand-
           ing before the process was halted 6 million ID cards were issued.




In addition, the Peace Accord provided, at a high level, specifications for the national identity card. It required the
new cards to be tamper-proof, highly secure and including a UIN for each holder. It gave the responsibility for this
new document to the National Identification Office (ONI). It also called for the selection of a technical operator
that would help the government establish the desired robust national identification system.

Implementation of the required identity measures included:

     1.	   The partner that was selected, in November 2007, to carry out the tasks identified in the Peace Accord,
           was the French company Sagem (which is today called Safran Morpho). An operator with long experi-
           ence and expertise in mass population registration and identity management projects throughout the
           world, particularly in francophone countries in Africa.
     2.	   The company implemented a new system of national identification and elections as called for by the
           Ouagadougou Agreement. This included the mass biometric registration of the adult population, the
           creation of the national population database (covering adults only) and the production of personalized
           national identity cards, voters lists and voter cards that were used to identify voters in the 2010 elections.

The original contract value was estimated at nearly USD 300 million. In early 2015, Morpho received another
award of more than USD 40 million and was tasked with updating the electoral register and to operationalize it
for the October 2015 elections.

                    Law No. 2013-450 Relative
                    to the Protection of Personally
                    Identifying Information
 PII and the Challenge of Its Protection
 Côte d’Ivoire uses the same international definition for personally identifying information (PII). PII is information of
 any kind that can identify an individual, either directly or indirectly, fully or partially. This includes name, telephone
 number, address, email address, any identity numbers (ID cards, passports) or beneficiary numbers (social pro-
 grams), bank account information, biometric data and other information related to health, religion, or ideology.
 The definition is ever expanding and is subject to variations in interpretation and local nuances.

 PII is generated in the normal course of administrative or commercial transactions, where they are given volun-
 tarily upon request or retrieved without knowledge of the person concerned. The protection of this type of data
 is a challenge technologically as more aspects of human lives are conducted electronically. Information systems
 generate and consume PII which can accumulate in databases that can be analyzed and exploited without
 knowledge of the individual identified.

 This is of particular concern for electronic ID systems, which are the subject of our current report. Identity systems
 rely heavily on PII. During registration, enrollment data is collected, transmitted, stored and archived; but that is
 not all. Every time an identity is asserted by its bearer to an information system, it generates usage and transac-
 tion records which can accumulate in audit trail databases, controlled commercially or by government institutions.
 As a consequence massive amounts of PII data can become digitally available about people, their actions and
 their reputation, all linked through identity numbers and searchable through big data analytics engines.

 This situation could raise major concerns, the severity of which may depend on country, policy and laws, and
 regional differences. There are significant discussions around the world related to how to address this potential
 mega-data problem. There are two approaches that have to work together to achieve the objective. The first is
 technological, where Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET), distributed databases, and frameworks of trust that
 manage identity alongside with anonymity are deployed. As has been clear from the international experience
 thus far, technical measures are helpful in reducing the scale of the problem but are not sufficient. That is why
 countries are resorting to another approach to dealing with the problem and that is through establishing a pro-
 privacy legal framework, that defines what can and cannot be done with PII, empowers a Data Protection (DP)
 Authority to ensure compliance, and fixes sanctions for noncompliance. This is the subject of this short summary
 in this Appendix.



 The Situation in Côte d’Ivoire
 Cote d’Ivoire has adopted a significant legal framework for dealing with data protection. This includes the adop-
 tion of a text of law as well as the establishment of a DP authority to implement the law. In this appendix we give
 an overview of the law and the body that is tasked with implementing it. The role of Data Protection (DP) authority
 has been entrusted to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Côte d’Ivoire (ARTCI).

 This is a summary based on interviews of the ARTCI as well as supporting documents provided to the Mission.


                                                                                                                        41
Legal Framework for Protection of PII in Côte d’Ivoire
The National Assembly passed Act No. 2013-450 of 19 June 2013 on the protection of personal data. The act was
subsequently promulgated by the President of the Republic, published in the Official Journal August 8, 2013, and
entered into force on 13 August 2013. This law is intended to adapt to the national context of the ECOWAS law
on data protection. This is the so called ECOWAS Treaty of 2008, which commits all member countries to adopt
data protection laws. The treaty was expanded later in the so called Supplementary Act A (ECOWAS SA.1/01/10
of 16 February 2010). The Côte d’Ivoire law goes beyond what ECOWAS had established as the minimum in the
Supplementary Act; it incorporates some relevant provisions not covered by the ECOWAS text, but that are often
contained in other international legal instruments. It also goes further in its codification of the ECOWAS law and
it even details the sanctions for violations to make enforcement of the Act easier and more transparent.



Overall Assessment
We see the law of 19 June 2013 as an effective and a powerful tool for the protection of personal data of the
population. We applaud the country for having defined the period of compliance with all its provisions (six months
after entry into effect) and for putting in place an authority to regulate the collection of PII and to enforce the pro-
visions of the law. During our interviews, the intention of the ARTCI, its capacity and political will to enforce this
law were very apparent.



Legal Innovations
This law contains many innovations, not often seen in Africa. Among them we cite:

     1.	   The establishment of a comprehensive legal system for processing and circulation of PII that is uniform
           across all entities whether private, commercial, local or central government. The responsibility is placed
           on anyone that receives and processes PII irrespective of their context.
     2.	   The law prohibits the transfer of personal data to third countries that do not offer adequate protection.
     3.	   The recognition of the right to be forgotten, the right to personal data portability and the right to refuse
           personal profiling.


Scope of the Law
Law No. 2013-450 is applicable to a wide range of applications. It covers the collection, processing (automated
or otherwise), transmission, storage and use of personal data in the country by natural persons, the State, local
governments, and any legal entities. It contains provisions that cover the following matters:


Prior notification and authorization
This law imposes formalities prior to collection and processing of PII:

     •	    It identifies a key role, called the Data Controller (DC), which is a natural or legal person or entity,
           public or private, which alone or jointly with others, decides to collect and process personal data and
           determines the purpose.
     •	    The law requires that the processing of personal data be subject to prior reporting and authorization
           as appropriate. The filing of a declaration and submission of an application for authorization is made
           by the Data Controller or his legal representative.
     •	    Processing of data collected in strictly personal and private setting or where required by law are
           exempted from prior declaration formalities.

42
     •	   This is a significant provision which requires the questionnaire for the household survey that will be
          used during the World Bank Social Protection project to undergo review and prior approval.

Guiding principles for data collection
The law also provides a set of principles that govern data collection and processing. Many of those are in align-
ment with the OECD,3 for example:

     •	   Legitimacy: The treatment should be legitimate and fair.
     •	   Purpose and Notification: The principle of transparency creates an obligation on the part of the DC
          to provide clear disclosure and notice related to the PII and its collection and processing.
     •	   Consent: Prior consent of the person concerned is required. In addition consent of people whose
          details were collected before the publication of the law, must be requested again before using them
          after its entry is in force.
     •	   Collection Limitation: Data must be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and can-
          not be subjected later to further processing or use in a way incompatible with those purposes.
     •	   Data Aggregation: The collection, recording, processing, storage, transmission and linkage of files
          of personal data must be done in a lawful and fair manner. The linkage of files is allowed only if it
          achieves legal or statutory objectives of legitimate interest for the DC.
     •	   Proportionality: The data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive relative to the purposes for
          which it is collected and further processed.
     •	   Data Quality: Data collected must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
     •	   Security and Confidentiality: It must be kept confidential and protected.
     •	   Duration Limitation: The data should not be kept beyond the allowed retention period necessary for
          the purposes for which they were collected or processed.

Individual rights
Individuals subject to the data collection enjoy certain rights under the law. For example the right to information
and access to their file; the right to correct their data, including updating it; the right to erase data and the right
to be forgotten; the right to refuse being profiled; the right of portability and the copying of their personal data.


The obligations of the Data Controller
The law is clear about the responsibilities attributed to the DC. When using subcontractors, they need to meet
certain legal requirements to be deemed acceptable and they need to operate under the clear authority of the
controlling entity and its instructions. Even then the DC does not escape the weight of their responsibility. The DC
is also held responsible for the disposition of data beyond its retention period.


Sanctions
The law establishes a variety of sanctions that give it power over those who do not comply. The ARTCI after a
warning and unsuccessful notice, and after hearing the DC, may impose any of the following sanctions:

     •	   A temporary withdrawal of the authorization;
     •	   A permanent withdrawal of the authorization;
     •	   A financial penalty.

ARTCI could also bring lawsuits for criminal offenses against violators since there are provisions for criminal
penalties in the law. For example the law makes it a criminal offense to collect and process data revealing racial,
ethnic or regional affiliation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, sexual
orientation, genetic data, or data on the health condition of the person concerned, except when allowed by law.

Furthermore, it prohibits and makes it a criminal offense, for all direct marketing activities, through any medium,
that use the PII of an individual that has not given prior consent to be targeted.

Finally, anyone who interferes or hinders the action of the National Data Protection Authority can be subjected
to imprisonment.


The correspondent responsible for compliance
The law requires data controllers to designate a correspondent (e.g., privacy officer) which could be a natural
person or a legal entity, as a single point of contact to ensure compliance and accountability. Whether a natural
or legal person, the correspondent profile must meet certain eligibility conditions before deemed acceptable to
perform that role. In exercising this function, the correspondent is required to maintain a list of treatments per-
formed that are immediately available to anyone upon request: provides access to its data for auditing, ensures
compliance with the legislation, signals any violation to the data controller and notifies the ARTCI as required
(including reporting difficulties encountered in the course of performance of its mission).

The correspondent cannot be subject to any sanction by the data controller or employer due to the performance
of its mission. But its mission can be terminated for breach of its fiduciary responsibilities, or upon resignation,
death, bankruptcy, etc.


The National Data Protection Authority
As mentioned earlier, the mission of this authority in Côte d’Ivoire is carried out by the Regulatory Authority for
Telecommunications/ICT (ARTCI). In this capacity, ARTCI has three functions:

     1.	   Educating the population and data controllers about their rights and obligations;
     2.	   Receiving applications and issuing licenses for the processing of PII;
     3.	   Proactive monitoring of compliance with legal provisions of the Law, receiving redress requests and
           complaints, bringing lawsuits, and imposing penalties for noncompliance.

ARTCI has regulatory power whose extent and mode of exercise are specified in the text of the law. In the exer-
cise of their duties, the members of ARTCI do not receive instructions from any other authority. Each year, the
Authority presents to the President of the Republic a report detailing the performance of its mission.
