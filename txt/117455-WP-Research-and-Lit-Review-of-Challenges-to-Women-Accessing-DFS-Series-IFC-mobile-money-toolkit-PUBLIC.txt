        To reach scale and impact in their operations, mobile money operators cannot ignore women,
        who make up half of the potential customer base. However, penetration of services within this
        group remains low and there are many barriers that keep women from adopting and using these
        services, such as low levels of literacy and mobile phone ownership. Operators can use a number
        of tactics to overcome these gender-specific barriers, particularly changing their approaches to
        marketing and distribution. This includes product offerings tailored to the unique financial needs
        of women; updated marketing campaigns that women can relate to; and hiring quality female
        agents who help to build women’s confidence and trust in mobile money services and turn them
        into loyal customers. (GSMA 2014)

                        Global Banking Alliance for Women: Research
     The Global Banking Alliance for Women issued a report entitled ”How Banks can Profit from the Multi-
     Trillion Dollar Female Economy.” The GBA interviewed 30 CEOs/senior bankers from institutions that
     account for about 20 percent of global banking revenue. This report highlights four myths about women
     prevalent in the financial services industry:

     1. Men and women are the same. Evidence shows that women are more cautious, like to build long-term
        relationships, and take longer to make decisions.

     2. We just need to feminize the existing products. Research has shown that women place a value on the
        services linked to the product, for example, networking opportunities and education.

     3. There is no business case for female markets. Although women are still under-served, there is proof
        that women have lower churn rates (see Myth 1). Also, the trend is toward a lower non-performing
        loan rate among women. Additionally, because women are more risk averse, one bank has shown that
        the profit margin on small and medium enterprise (SME) loans to women is 15 percent.

     4. There is no data to build a business case. Though data are not always accurate or complete, there are
        pragmatic solutions to assess female clientele, for instance, client surveys, gender determination by
        name or ID type, relationship manager knowledge, and so on.

  In both Papua New Guinea and Samoa, there are limited economic opportunities for village women, as well
  as difficulties finding markets.

  “I sell in my locality because I do not have to pay
  fees. If I go to the market, then you have to pay
  a lot of fees.” (Higher Income, Women, Mobile,
  Kimbe, Papua New Guinea)

  In addition, women noted that there was a lack of business skills and in Samoa, a lack of an entrepreneurial
  culture.
  “They need to give loans to women so they can start             “There was a group from the Body Shop. Our
  businesses. They need training – how to make a                  center manager told us to select one person from

  A lack of business capital is equally restricting for women who wish to engage in economic activity.
    “Our problem is that there are lots of ways to                “For me as a mother, there are a whole lot of needs

  Fear of sorcery can impact economic activity.
  “My daughter’s husband was a rich man and he had
  a lot of assets, we were also prosperous because
  we had a store. They were jealous of us. I think
  that people used sanguma (like black magic) on
  us. They were both murdered by sorcery because
  of the jealousy. This has discouraged me and my
  husband from running a business again because
  we do not want jealousy to affect us that way. My

 Gender-based violence
 A study conducted in Papua New Guinea found that         “There are two aspects of Samoan living. I see
 67 percent of women interviewed had experienced          women that are not married and women that are
 domestic violence. Economic dependence on a              married. I receive a lot of money and I look at other
 male breadwinner makes it difficult for a woman          couples, they are always fighting over money. I am
 experiencing violence to report the abuse or             happy that I have ownership of my own money,

 conflict and domestic violence, exacerbated
 by alcohol abuse, can drive a need for secret
 savings –
   “Women who have drinking husbands do that.
   They come and beat up their wives for money.
   When you do something, you have to do it in
   secret. Papua New Guinean women are strong
   women. We are good at keeping secrets.
   Women go and do their marketing. That is
   theirs. She brings that income and she repays
   her loan. Her husband does not necessarily
   know how much she is making at the market.
   What she gets, it is hers, but when her husband
   asks, she will give it. She will not tell the whole
   amount.” (Higher Income, Women, Kimbe,
   (Papua New Guinea)

 The weak law and order environment further exacerbates the problem.
 “The laws against domestic violence are there, but
 the awareness is lacking. They do not know what
 they can do. They do not know who they see, or
 what they can do. I do a lot of counseling. She will
 be told that if the court charges me, I will kill you.
 You cannot win. I will give you an example of our
 daughter. She will come and escape and live with
 us for one year. Then they will get back in touch
 on the phone, and he will ask her back and then
 she will go back for 6 months. She will come back
 and she will get all bloody and crying. It is not all
 men here who do this, they are being demonized
 — though all men do this.” (Higher Income, Man,
 Kimbe, Papua New Guinea)

  Male entitlements and privileges over women and the impact of ‘bride price’ need to be considered.
  “The women have to ask for money, but (men) ask
  women about their earnings and some take the
  money. The men are the bosses. They decide on
  what is spent or not spent. Men are the head of
  the family and women follow this.” (Lower Income,
  Women, Moresby, Papua New Guinea)

  The customary bride price can be seen as a trigger
  to domestic violence as it provides men with a
  feeling of ‘ownership’, as well as placing a financial
  burden on families.

  “When you think about bride price, then everyone
  is contributing here and there. You may not have
  anything at home, but you have to give.” (Lower
  Income, Women, Branches, Boera, Papua New
  Guinea)

  Customary obligations to contribute to community, church and family greatly impact resource
  allocation and control. They also impact women who face pressure to contribute their income.  In many
  cases, men request or demand that they hand over their income.
  “Most of the time, I experience that every time you             “It is really hard because there is so many

 INFORMAL BANKING

 Q. What happens if you cannot repay? “Summons,
 from the court. Sometimes they may beat you up
 or threaten you or someone else.” (Higher Income
 Women, Kimbe, Papua New Guinea)

 The informal rotating savings and credit associations
 (locally called ‘sande groups’) are mainly used for
 consumption, not business purposes. These are
 considered high risk because they may break
 down due a group member defaulting.

  LITTLE EMPHASIS ON SAVINGS
                                                          Samoan financial institutions have an insufficient
                                                          emphasis on savings. Women mainly save at
                                                          home and in secret, although mostly savings are
                                                          small amounts for emergencies and less so for
                                                          business. This is often due to the many financial
                                                          pressures on any income earned.

                                                          “It is hard to save because when things happen in

Double Processing: Many new customers were not comfortable                              Only 27 percent of these
with only having SMS receipts. Illiteracy, full SMS mailboxes,                          women previously had
and technical unfamiliarity were the major challenges. AMRET                            bank accounts
decided to adopt both SMS and paper receipts until customers felt
comfortable. This helped customers feel safe as they transitioned
from their Cookie Jar savings to formal savings.

Branch Adaptations: AMRET opted for a decentralized approach,
whereby branches would manage the mobile tellers and own the customers. Branch manager roles were adapted
to being eco-system driven, rather than branch driven. This required a clear new vision for Branch Managers,
and a pilot program was undertaken to see how the changes worked.

Staged Approach: There are two phases to the AMRET MFS program. First, Mobile Tellers are brought into an
area to register and service customers. This phase builds the trust and creates the eco-system. Second, AMRET
will then work with customers to move to a self-serve model as comfort with technology increases.

The Service
As Ghana’s largest indigenous bank, Fidelity Bank has always
wanted Ghanaians to know that they can produce the same, if not
better, levels of products and services as any international bank. In
                                                                                KEY FIGURES
2013, Fidelity Bank piloted the Smart Account product and Agency
Banking service to set the pace for offering quality financial services
to Ghana’s unbanked and under-banked. Fidelity’s Smart Account                Converted 396 VSLA’s

In 2013, Fidelity Bank partnered with CARE, a leading humanitarian            Total Cumulative
organization funded by the United Nations Capital Development                 Deposit Gamered:

Adaptations and Innovations
•	 Reduced KYC - With approval from the Bank of Ghana, Fidelity            16 New Agents Opened
   Bank opened accounts with low KYC requirements. This meant              Due to CARE VSLAs
   that customers only needed one type of government-issued
   identification (ID). For the rural areas, this is predominately a voter
   ID or a National Health ID card. This ID is then photographed and
   uploaded so the opening of the account can be immediately undertaken by a Smart Friend (a roving Fidelity
   Bank representative).

•	 Triple PIN – CARE VSLAs include up to 25 people with an elected chairperson, secretary and treasurer who
   hold keys. Each group has a box that is locked with three locks that are opened by these keys. To replicate this
   level of security, Fidelity Bank has split the four-digit account PIN into two, giving two digits each to two
   persons selected by the group, with the card being domiciled with a third person.
