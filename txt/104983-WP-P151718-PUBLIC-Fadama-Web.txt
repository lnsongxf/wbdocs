Studies produced by the World Bank’s Nigeria Country Team. It was drafted under the supervision of Katherine Bain and Adetunji Oredipe.
The Delivery Case Studies series—part of the Doing Development Differently initiative—aims to generate knowledge on what works in
Nigeria and why. The authors are grateful to Indira Konjhodzic for comments and support on earlier drafts. They also acknowledge the

       Box 1:  Fadama’s Use of CDD Principles

       Fadama II and III applied CDD principles to transform how local rural communities secured sustainable income
       generation. The literature identifies as enabling conditions for CDD (annex B) the existence of strong political
       commitment at the top (ensuring that power shifts from top-down to bottom-up) and a well-designed
       decentralization process (across political, administrative, and fiscal dimensions). These conditions are supported
       by an empowered and active civil society, mechanisms for democratic accountability to citizens, free media, and
       relatively strong NGOs (Binswanger-Mkhize, de Regt, and Spector 2010; Mansuri and Rao 2013; Mukherji 2013). It could
       be argued that such conditions have been present, at different levels and with more or less intensity, throughout
       evolution of the Fadama series.

       By 2001, the World Bank had identified some key principles for supporting effective and sustainable CDD initiatives
       (Dongier et al. 2002; Wong 2012). These included (1) building participatory mechanisms for community control and
       stakeholder involvement; (2) investing in building the capacity of community-based organizations; (3) facilitating
       community access to information (to mitigate the risk of manipulation by external interested parties); (4) developing
       simple rules and strong incentives, supported by monitoring and evaluation; (5) maintaining flexibility in design;
       (6) ensuring social and gender inclusion; (7) designing for scaling up; and (8) investing in an exit strategy (Dongier
       et al. 2002).

       Fadama’s interpretation of participatory interventions deserves further analysis, which could contribute to the
       extensive literature on CDD effectiveness. For example, the principle of investing in capacity building of community-
       based organizations, together with the findings of Mansuri and Rao (2004, 2013) that induced participatory
       interventions work best when supported by a responsive state, show Fadama to be a midway or hybrid solution,
       with strong institutions at the central level replicating the structure in a uniform manner throughout the states
       while community-level entities (FUGs and FCAs) provide an autonomous space for deciding—with a constrained
       level of flexibility—the initiatives in which to invest. This hybrid solution includes the introduction of sustainable
       solutions at the community level, such as the Fadama Users’ Equity Fund (FUEF), while acknowledging the need for
       a permanent state role in co-financing this program because communities do not possess the financial capacity to
       fully self-sustain all aspects of the project. Local governments thus need to set aside and secure budget resources
       for recurrent spending activities such as infrastructure maintenance.

       The Fadama project series has tailored CDD principles on creating a decentralized participatory structure by
       establishing the FUGs and FCAs to improve social cohesion and develop social capital within communities. Mansuri
       and Rao (2013) confirm the need for serious and sustained engagement in building local capacity as a condition for
       creating social capital. Fadama’s FUGs and FCAs have managed at different community levels (within a village and in
       a cluster of villages, respectively) to improve the stock of social capital and foster more effective communication
       with local government.
