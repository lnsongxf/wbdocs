THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business

permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

       The promoters must open a bank account in the name of the company
       in formation and must transfer the amount of the share capital to this
       account before the passing of the deed of incorporation. For the
       purpose of the passing of the notarial deed, the bank will remit an
       escrow certificate (certificat de blocage) certifying that the funds

      A private limited liability company must be incorporated before a
      Luxembourg notary public. The Luxembourg notary draws up the deed
      of incorporation which includes the articles of association of the
      company. Model of articles of association may be found on Internet
      (the national Chamber of Commerce’s E-space Entreprises information                              EUR 1,000+ EUR 75

      * Apply for business license

      This license/permit is issued by the Ministry of Middle Classes for a
      commercial activity or by the Ministry of Economy for industrial
      activities upon request and on proof of knowledge of business
      management.

      To apply for a business license, promoters must submit the following
      documents:
      • Application form (completed and signed) for an establishment permit.
      • Tax stamp for EUR 24 EUR (This varies from EUR 24 to EUR 2,500,
      depending on the type of activity. 24 EUR refers to a sales/trade
      company). The amount can be transferred to the national Giro account
      (CCP) of the Registration and Domains Administration (Administration
      de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines): LU47 1111 0087 9262 0000, with
      the reference: “Office Fee for Establishment Permit [ENTER APPLICANT’S           15 days,

      center.
      • For non-residents and persons residing in Luxembourg for fewer than
      10 years, a recent notarized certificate of non-bankruptcy.
      • Articles of association (executed or draft) for a commercial company.
      • School certificates or professional diplomas (certified by the
      institution) required for the intended activity. Otherwise, proof of
      relevant professional experience such as an EU certificate or certificate
      of registration with a social security authority.
      • An affidavit on the exercise of any management posts previously held
      in Luxembourg, for verification of non-bankruptcy.
      • The applicant’s identity card (copy).
      • The applicant’s police record or affidavit. Note: This applies to non-
      residents and persons residing in Luxembourg for less than 10 years. In
      practice, the Ministry of the Economy and Foreign Trade tends however
      to request the provision of a police record or affidavit to every applicant
      although not required as such.

      The business permit application can be submitted before executing the
      notary deed because the Ministry of the Economy checks the draft
      articles of association—the company name, business purpose, and
      identity of directors and officers for compliance with the provisions of
      the applicable law. Generally, the business license/establishment permit
      application and notary deed processes start more or less at the same
      time and are pursued simultaneously. Although the company
      incorporation process requires a notary, the founder may directly
      register the company with different administrations and obtain
      identification numbers and the business license/establishment permit.

      Since October 2011, business license requests can be handed in online
      at www.guichet.lu. The required documents are the same ones. They all
      need to be transformed into a PDF and attached to the online form. In
      order to be able to deposit the business license online, the applicant is
      required to have a LUXTRUST certificate in order to sign the application
      form electronically.

        separated in Luxembourg (based on European law) and Creos does not
        act as a supplier. The customer therefore needs to sign a contract with a
        supplier of his choice on the market as soon as he has enough technical
   5    details of its consumption. If he does not do so before the final              3 calendar days        EUR 0

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

What are the details?
The indicators reported here are based on a set of

       Parties visit notary to draft and authenticate the sale agreement
       (Compromis de Vente)

       After signing a sale agreement ("compromis de vente") between each
       other, as per common practice, the parties will visit a civil law notary so
       he can draft and authenticate the notarial deed. The sale is complete
       between the parties, and ownership is acquired as of right by the buyer
       with respect to the seller, as soon as the property and the price have
       been agreed upon, although the property has not yet been delivered or
       the price paid (Article 1583 of the Civil Code). As a sale of real estate
       must be registered (which triggers the payment of registration taxes) and
       recorded in the mortgage registry in order to be enforceable vis-à-vis
       third parties and as only duly certified deeds may be entered in the
       register, the sale must be recorded in a notarial deed ("acte de vente").                    4 EUR stamp per

       Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg and the sale may be drawn up in front of
       anyone of them. This study assumes that parties would call on day one
       and receive an appointment for the same or following day.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
