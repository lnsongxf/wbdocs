This document, on the use of ICTs for Agriculture in Africa, is the summary
of the full sector study which was carried out by a team from Deloitte,
led by Omri Van Zyl and comprising Trish Alexander, Liezl De Graaf and
Kamal Mukherjee with assistance from Vikash Kumar. The full report is
available at www.eTransformAfrica.org. This document forms chapter two
of the publication edited by Enock Yonazi, Tim Kelly, Naomi Halewood

     ICTs for
   agriculture
     in Africa
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have
the potential to transform business and government in Africa,
driving entrepreneurship, innovation and economic growth.
A new flagship report – eTransform Africa – produced
by the World Bank and the African Development Bank,
with the support of the African Union, identifies best
practice in the use of ICTs in key sectors of the African
economy. Under the theme “Transformation-Ready”,
the growing contribution of ICTs to Agriculture, Climate
Change Adaptation, Education, Financial Services,
Government Services and Health is explored. In addition,
the report highlights the role of ICTs in enhancing African
regional trade and integration as well as the need to build
a competitive ICT industry to promote innovation, job
creation and the export potential of African companies.

    In identifying the ways in which ICT
    can help agriculture, it is useful to view
    the farming life cycle as a three-stage
    process (see Figure 1):
