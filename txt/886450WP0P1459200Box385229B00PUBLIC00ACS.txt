This report was prepared by a team led by Alexandria Valerio (World Bank) and
composed of Alicia Robb (Kauffman Foundation and University of California,
Berkeley) and Brent Parton (World Bank). Sebastian Monroy-Taborda (World
Bank) provided overall research support. The report summarizes the findings
from country case studies undertaken in three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa:
Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique. Fieldwork activities were coordinated by World
Bank task team leaders including Peter Darvas (Ghana), Helen Craig (Kenya),
and Ana Ruth Menezes (Mozambique). The research teams responsible for pre-
paring the case studies included Akua Ofori-Ampofo, Wilberforce Owusu-Ansah
(KNUST), and Kofi Poku in Ghana; Jutta Franz, Wairimu Kiambuthi, and David
Muthaka (Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis) in Kenya; and
Constantino Marrengula, Zeferino Martins, and Manolo Sanchez in Mozambique.
   Helpful peer review and general comments were provided on an early version
of the case studies by the following World Bank colleagues: Louise Fox, Margo
Hoftijzer, Mattias Lundberg, Maria Paulina Mogollon, and Michel Welmond. The
team expresses appreciation to all individuals who participated in one-on-one
interviews or focus groups in the cities of Malindi, Mombasa, and Nairobi in
Kenya; Accra and Kumasi in Ghana; and Manica, Maputo, and Nampula in
Mozambique; and Michael Freese (Professor, National University of Singapore)
and Bob Nelson (Professor Emeritus, College of Education, University of Illinois),
who generously shared their time and technical expertise with the team.
   The team is also thankful for the overall assistance received from Elise
Egoume-Bossogo, Lorelei Lacdao, and Marie Madeleine Ndaw. The written
pieces of this study were edited by Marc DeFrancis (DeFrancis Writing &
Editing).
   Finally, the team appreciates the leadership and technical support of Elizabeth
King (Sector Director, Human Development Network) and Harry Patrinos
(Sector Manager, Human Development Network) of the World Bank.
   The report received financial support from the Bank-Netherlands Partnership
Program with the World Bank.

Executive Summary




Relevance
Governments around the world have shown a growing interest in interventions
that promote entrepreneurial success, making significant investments in entre-
preneurial education and training (EET). This is happening not only in devel-
oped nations, but also across the developing world as well. Empirical research
has found positive correlations not only between entrepreneurial activity and
innovation, but also between entrepreneurship and job creation. Skilled entre-
preneurship offers potential rewards for individuals across the socioeconomic
spectrum, including vulnerable populations and workers in the informal sector
for whom it signifies potentially more stable income flows, increased profits, and
more secure employment.
   The question remains, however, whether entrepreneurial success can be
taught and, if so, what is the best way to teach it. Preliminary research has
reached mixed conclusions across a range of outcomes associated with EET pro-
grams. Furthermore, findings are mixed regarding the extent to which programs
are able support various individuals, from poor and vulnerable groups to edu-
cated aspiring entrepreneurs with significant work experience. Findings are fur-
ther complicated by the fact that training and education programs are delivered
in heterogeneous cultural and educational contexts. Yet, despite thin evidence,
and in particular a lack of information on outcomes and costs, the global EET
experiment continues.
   The effectiveness of EET may prove especially important to the three case
study countries examined in this study. Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique are all
experiencing sustained economic growth, increased foreign direct investment,
and diversification in their private sectors, and in all three countries the less-
capital-intensive service sector is becoming increasingly important. These facts,
combined with the presence of massive informal sectors of self-employed work-
ers, make these economies fertile ground for taking entrepreneurship to the next
level.
   Understanding what is and what is not working in the EET field also matters
from a policy standpoint. The business climate in all three countries continues to

     face severe barriers—from unfriendly regulatory burdens and limited financing
     to corruption and limited infrastructure. Thus, it remains critical to find out
     which failures in small business growth stem from these environmental pressures
     and which stem from a relative lack of basic business skills and entrepreneurial
     mind-set. To do so, a necessary first step is to understand the elements in EET
     programming.
        The findings of this study, which draw on both global and country-specific
     research, as well as on the experience of practicing entrepreneurs and students of
     entrepreneurship in the countries studied, help map out EET practices in these
     countries and, by extension, in Sub-Saharan Africa in a variety of contexts.


     The Knowledge Challenge, and What This Study Addresses
     The sheer heterogeneity of EET programs and the complexity involved in tying
     them to their variety of associated outcomes can muddle policymakers’ and
     practitioners’ picture of what is working. The challenge here is considerable.
        The body of research on effectiveness remains limited, and much of it is meth-
     odologically weak. While some research indicates that programs can improve
     knowledge, global EET research is unable to draw a direct causal link connecting
     the enhanced knowledge with the subsequent performance of enterprises. In the
     case countries, little follow-up research has been carried out to test the effective-
     ness of programs, including large-scale programs such as Kenya’s nationwide
     public school curriculum. Outside the case countries, a few studies have shown
     a significant positive relationship between business success and investment in
     human capital development, and specific EET programs have demonstrated
     great promise. However, much more fine-grained analysis needs to be done, par-
     ticularly with regard to the validity of EET as an antipoverty intervention as well
     as its direct connection to improving business performance in terms of enhanced
     profits and prospects for firm growth.
        The case studies summarized in this report are designed to inform a broader
     understanding of how EET programs are being designed in these countries,
     whom they are targeting, and what needs they have been established to help
     meet. The study also reviews the specific barriers to entrepreneurship that pre-
     vail in each country, based on interviews with practicing entrepreneurs, and
     examines the extent to which the programs are addressing those barriers.
        Consequently, the study is able to identify practical insights into current EET
     program design and implementation that are relevant to various target groups,
     intended outcomes, and social and economic contexts. While it cannot fill the
     serious knowledge gap in measurements of program effectiveness, it does supply
     stakeholder perspectives that often hint strongly at what works best. Overall, the
     study paints a comprehensive picture of both the context for entrepreneurship
     and the landscape of programs in the case countries, framing them within the
     economic, political, and cultural trends that are the dynamic environment within
     which they have originated and have been evolving. It also lines up these findings

against the knowledge we have of programs being implemented around the
world.


Key Findings
Key macroeconomic trends give reason for optimism about the trajectory of
private sector development, while steep and widespread barriers to entrepre-
neurship also remain. All three case countries have been on strong growth
trajectories, Ghana now ranking among the 10 fastest-growing economies in the
­
world. In each country, prospects for export-driven growth are significant and the
growing service sector makes up roughly 50 percent of GDP. However, barriers
abound. The labor market itself poses a problem, as all three countries suffer
from very high youth unemployment. That in turn helps fuel the growth of
necessity-driven entrepreneurship and, therefore, of the informal economy,
which in Kenya accounts for 86 percent of all new jobs. This last fact might also
signify an opportunity for EET, since it implies a vast population of enterprising
individuals who should have much to gain from formalizing their businesses.
   At the same time, both global monitoring studies and the entrepreneurs inter-
viewed for this study report that corruption, prohibitively high taxes, and bur-
densome regulatory regimes remain serious impediments to business ownership.
Crime and insecurity also remain a very large concern, especially for those in the
informal sector. In addition to those barriers, the two impediments mentioned
most often by entrepreneurs in the study are cultural disincentives, for example
discouragement by family and peers, and lack of access to finance.
   The EET landscape is populated by a variety of programs designed to reach a
variety of different populations, and their goals vary just as widely. EET programs
often emerge as responses to key contextual challenges, a striking example being
Mozambique’s national program that originally targeted demobilized soldiers
when its civil war ended. Other programs target secondary students, a prime
example being Kenya’s entrepreneurship curriculum, which has been main-
streamed in schools since the 1990s. Still other programs target higher education
students, sometimes as stand-alone degree programs and in many cases targeting
high-growth-potential candidates such as high-tech students. At another extreme
are a large number of programs that target the most vulnerable, such as rural
women or unemployed urban youth.
   With such diverse target audiences, these EET programs naturally vary in their
emphasis. In all three countries, programs targeting vulnerable potential entre-
preneurs often have poverty reduction as their goal rather than skill acquisition
per se. Those focused on youth often make job acquisition a priority. Secondary
school EET programs, by contrast, are more likely to devote energy to developing
a broad understanding of business principles.
   EET programs are insufficiently tailored to their participants’ backgrounds and
needs, and they suffer from lack of coordination and information sharing. Despite the
program diversity just described, too many EET programs fail to tailor their cur-
riculum and methods to their audience and its needs. The stakeholders

4	                                                                                Executive Summary


     interviewed suggested that many programs, especially large programs designed to
     address youth unemployment, mix large, heterogeneous groups of participants of
     varying ages, educational backgrounds, experience, and expectations, resulting in
     mismatches between content and needs. This finding suggests that the program
     landscape in the case countries may benefit from a more tiered understanding of
     how different types of EET programs can benefit various groups. For the broader
     interventions, an emphasis is needed on building foundational skills and mind-sets.
     For focused interventions, program objectives, for example whether a program is
     aiming to promote either necessity-driven or high-growth-potential practicing
     entrepreneurs, should drive program design. On a related note, there is a need for
     more dialogue among EET programs and operators, not only to avoid duplication
     and the inefficient use of resources, but also to promote cross-program learning
     regarding emerging practices.
        Stakeholders believe the development of business acumen and an e  ­ ntrepreneurial
     mind-set are keys to success, though few EET programs focus on these elements.
     Unanimously, the practicing and potential entrepreneurs interviewed men-
     tioned these skill areas as the most important determinants of success in busi-
     ness. Many also pointed to negative cultural biases, such as family pressure to
     avoid risk-taking, as barriers; they felt strongly that exposure to entrepreneurial
     thinking at an early age is key to overcoming them. In both Kenya and Ghana,
     most EET participants believe that their programs are good at teaching critical
     general business and financial skills but less effective in developing entrepre-
     neurial attitudes, problem solving skills, and soft skills generally.
        Stakeholders need greater exposure to the business community and access to
     finance, though few EET programs address these needs. EET stakeholders across the
     case countries indicate a desire for greater exposure to the business community
     and practicing entrepreneurs. Despite this desire, very few identified programs
     prioritize such exposure. Available evaluations of programs outside these coun-
     tries that combine grants with activities such as internships and mentoring
     services show that they do have more impact than simple training programs.
     ­
        Stakeholders also cited lack of access to finance as a major problem. Very few
     EET programs in the case countries provide wrap-around or follow-up services
     to help remedy this. Nevertheless, a notable trend is the involvement of business
     associations in providing training for practicing entrepreneurs in their fields;
     global research suggests that such programs result in improved access to loans for
     their participants, although whether this stems from the training itself or from
     affiliation with sponsoring banks remains unclear. The involvement of business
     associations, and other less direct forms of support for EET may be instructive
     for policymakers, particularly in the context of supporting potential high growth
     entrepreneurs.


     Going Forward
     These findings and the others in this study should be very useful in filling some
     of the critical knowledge gaps that have made it difficult to know what is being

not yet demonstrate conclusively—specific characteristics of EET programs that
contribute to the promotion of entrepreneurial attitudes, the attainment of

the findings in this report can inform EET policy and program dialogue at mul-

institutions must make with regard to EET programs, and more clearly indicate
in which direction further research in the EET realm is most needed.

Introduction




There is a growing interest in the role that entrepreneurship can play as a catalyst
to achieve a number of economic and social development objectives (Brock and
Evans 1989; Acs 1992; Carree and Thurik 2003; Volkmann 2009; Bandiera et al.
2012). Empirical studies find positive correlations between entrepreneurial
activity, innovation, and technological change (Acs and Varga 2005; Van Praag
and Versloot 2007). Furthermore, entrepreneurship is a critical driver of job
creation (Birch 1979), either through self-employment growth or as suppliers to
the corporate sectors (Fritsch 2004; Acs and Armington 2006; Schramm and
Litan 2009). In addition, entrepreneurship is often looked to as a mechanism for
achieving stable income flows and increased profits (Hermes and Lensink 2007;
Karlan and Valdivia 2011), particularly for SME owners, including workers in the
informal sector and vulnerable populations.
   Given the potential beneficial spillovers of entrepreneurship, governments
around the world have taken an interest in interventions that promote and facili-
tate entrepreneurial success through required support systems and the removal
of barriers to entrepreneurship (McKernan 2002; Paulson and Townsend 2004;
DeMel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2009). These promotion efforts include the
easing of business environment constraints, the enhancement of access to finance
and credit, and the provision of support to strengthen business practices and
enterprise management.


About Entrepreneurship Education and Training
One subset of the larger portfolio of entrepreneurial promotion programs con-
sists of entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship training (EET) pro-
grams. These are programs that seek to develop the attitudes, knowledge, and
skills associated with the practice of entrepreneurship. They are based on
research indicating that some entrepreneurial behaviors can be taught and
learned, starting in people’s youth and culminating in their young adult or adult
years or when they are potential or practicing entrepreneurs (Hegarty 2006;
Souitaris, Zerbinati, and Al-Laham 2007; Walter and Dohse 2009).

8	                                                                                       Introduction


         EET itself encompasses a heterogeneous array of programs, including formal
     academic education programs and stand-alone training programs. Both of the
     latter may aim to stimulate entrepreneurship as well as support individuals and
     enterprises already engaged in entrepreneurial activities. These interventions can
     target a range of individuals and have a variety of program objectives, from
     enhancing socio-emotional skills (such as locus of control and self-confidence)
     among secondary education students, to teaching business plan development to
     graduate students, to providing training in bookkeeping to subsistence farmers.
     The diversity of these interventions reflects the variety of those who can be con-
     sidered “entrepreneurs.”
         Despite global interest in EET, the body of available research remains limited,
     and what exists to date tends to be methodologically weak (Glaub and Frese
     2011). However, EET is a growing area of interest for a number of researchers,
     and a set of existing evaluations demonstrate mixed but promising results (van
     der Sluis, van Praag, and Vijverberg 2005; Lautenschläger and Haase 2011; Unger
     et al. 2011). Further complicating the picture of EET effectiveness is the fact that
     most EET evaluations examine a range of outcomes. For example, a recent meta-
     analysis by McKenzie and Woodruff (2012) demonstrates relatively modest
     impacts of training on the survivorship of existing firms, but few significant
     impacts on profits or sales. A meta-analysis by Cho and Honorati (2013) indi-
     cates that while programs can improve knowledge, this does not necessarily lead
     to related gains in performance and status outcomes.
         Several meta-analyses, however, give more weight to the promise of EET pro-
     grams to enhance trainees’ entrepreneurial capabilities (knowledge and skills) by
     shedding light on how these capabilities may ultimately contribute to better
     entrepreneurial performance. A meta-analysis by Unger and others (2011) finds
     a significant positive relationship between success (size, profitability, and growth)
     and the mere investment in human capital development. Furthermore, in that
     study the positive effects on success of the skills and knowledge resulting from
     those investments are even stronger than the investments alone and stronger still
     for knowledge and skills specifically related to entrepreneurship. Another meta-
     analysis, Martin, McNally, and Kay (2013) find significant relationships among
     EET, entrepreneurship-related human capital assets (entrepreneurial knowledge
     and skill, positive perception of entrepreneurship, and intentions to start a busi-
     ness), and entrepreneurship outcomes (nascent behaviors, start-up behaviors, and
     financial success). They further find differential effects between academic-
     focused and training-focused EET interventions, with stronger effects associated
     with the former type of EET.
         The sheer heterogeneity of EET programs and the complexity involved in
     tying them to their variety of associated outcomes can muddle policymakers’ and
     practitioners’ picture of what is working and what is not. Acknowledging the
     need for more evidence to rigorously link EET programs to desired outcomes
     around entrepreneurial activity or success, policymakers and practitioners will
     likely be interested in the experience of others in developing and implementing
     EET programs across a variety of contexts. In turn, focused, qualitative

investigations into EET programs may also bring critical insights to bear for the
design and implementation of future EET programs that aim at particular benefi-
ciaries, or to engender particular outcomes, or within particular contexts.


About the Case Studies
Complementing Global EET Research
This chapter summarizes the findings from three case studies that examine EET
programs across three Sub-Saharan African countries: Ghana, Kenya, and
Mozambique. The case studies are a follow-on research component of a broader
research effort on global EET programs, Entrepreneurship Education and Training
Programs Around the World: Dimensions for Success (Valerio, Parton, and Robb
2014). The research effort identifies and catalogs the range of EET program types
as well as the program dimensions that shape program outcomes, presents a
Conceptual Framework for EET, and presents an analysis of both EET research
and a global sample of program evaluations. Building on the observations of that
analysis, the present report describes a set of practical insights about EET pro-
gram design and implementation across target groups, intended outcomes, and
contexts.
   The importance of this topic is reflected within the World Bank’s Education
Sector Strategy 2020, “Learning for All: Investing in People’s Knowledge and
Skills to Promote Development” (World Bank 2011b) and responds directly to
Step Four of the Skills Toward Employment and Productivity Framework. With
regard to the broader employment picture in Sub-Saharan Africa, this work
complements the World Bank’s recent report on “Youth Employment in Sub-
Saharan Africa” (Filmer et al. 2014). Specifically, this study corresponds to the
goal of encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation (World Bank 2010a). It
aligns with the Bank’s Social Protection and Labor Strategy 2012–22, “Resilience,
Equity and Opportunity” (World Bank 2012b), and it complements a new multi-
sector work program being led by the Bank’s Social Protection Network
(HDNSP), “Supporting Self-Employment and Small-Scale Entrepreneurship:
Creating and Improving Alternatives to Wage Employment.” It builds upon the
existing multi-sector effort that examines the broader population of entrepre-
neurship promotion programs, including but not limited to EET, which is
financed by a Trust Fund from the Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program
(BNPP).

Objective of the Case Studies
The summary of the case studies presented here provide important information
to improve our understanding of EET in three Sub-Saharan African countries.
Each country has its unique challenges and opportunities, as well as unique cul-
tural contexts, relevant to EET. The primary objective of the studies is to comple-
ment the broader research effort by providing targeted, qualitative insights into
the landscape of EET programs in these countries. A key question each case
study seeks to answer is the extent to which the programs address the country’s

      relevant barriers to entrepreneurship. Each case study was thus designed to pro-
      vide a comprehensive picture of both the context for entrepreneurship and the
      landscape of programs in the country, in order to understand how these programs
      are structured, what they aim to achieve, and how they relate to one other as well
      as to other programs being implemented around the world. Further, each case
      study aims to capture the program insights local EET stakeholders have in order
      to better understand how programs are meeting—or can better meet—their
      needs.

      Producing the Case Studies
      Each case study was structured to illustrate the country’s entrepreneurial con-
      text, the landscape of EET programs and its relationship to the entrepreneurial
      context, and the perceptions and views of practicing and potential entrepreneurs
      as well as EET program managers. First, to sketch a picture of the entrepreneurial
      context, desk reviews of available country-level and global research were con-
      ducted, and these were subsequently supplemented with insights from inter-
      viewees and target groups.
          Methods used to identify programs in each country’s EET landscape includ-
      ed Internet searches, screening of information from reports and newspaper
      articles on business sector and entrepreneurship development, and interviews
      with stakeholders. Following the snowball principle, interviews with one identi-
      fied program led to further information on other programs. During initial
      identification, no specific filter was applied. Ultimately, teams identified 111
      EET programs in Kenya, 80 programs in Ghana, and 31 programs in
      Mozambique. The amount of information available for these programs varied
      significantly. Ultimately, these initial program lists were filtered based upon the
      amount of information that was available to inform the study. The filtered
      program landscapes include 42 EET programs in Ghana (listed in appendix A),
      42 programs in Kenya (listed in appendix B), and 27 programs in Mozambique
      (listed in appendix C).
          In terms of limitations, the strong reliance on information provided through
      the Internet during the initial scoping process posed some constraints in the
      comprehensiveness and accuracy of the initial information. It fostered some self-
      selection in the sense that programs without Internet presence tended to be
      excluded, though a few programs without Internet presence were included.
      Second, the scope of information provided was not uniform, and often it was
      limited in nature. In this regard, a major challenge for the study turned out to be
      the low level of monitoring and evaluation of EET programs, which limited the
      information available on outcomes.
          Finally, since each case study sought to distill lessons for bringing the EET
      programs closer to meeting the needs of existing, new, or would-be entrepre-
      neurs, it captured the insights of local EET stakeholders through a series of quali-
      tative surveys, interviews, and focus groups conducted by research teams in each
      country. The goal was to gain a better understanding of stakeholders’ views on
      these questions:

•	 How effective are existing EET programs in meeting the needs of local entrepre-

•	 What policies, programs, and practices are still needed?

This qualitative fieldwork focused on five target groups: program managers, suc-
cessful entrepreneurs, failed entrepreneurs, potential entrepreneurs in EET pro-
gramming, and practicing entrepreneurs in entrepreneurship training (ET) pro-
gramming. Individual interviews were conducted with program managers and
successful entrepreneurs, while focus group discussions were held with potential,
practicing, and failed/discouraged entrepreneurs. Interviewees were selected
with the goal of achieving broad coverage of both program types and industries.
The methodology used to collect data was standard for the three countries
(Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique) using the same instruments to conduct the
interviews and focus groups. The instruments were translated into Portuguese by
the Mozambican team, and some of the interviews and focus groups were con-
ducted in local languages in Ghana and Kenya as well.
   Field teams conducted between 7 and 10 qualitative interviews from each of
the 2 target groups (program managers and successful entrepreneurs) for a total
of 15 to 20 qualitative interviews. Qualitative interviews were semi-structured (or
focused) and included a series of open-ended questions based on specific topic
areas. The questions differed, depending on whether the person being interviewed
was a program manager/administrator or an entrepreneur as well as on the type
of participant the program targeted. Qualitative information was gathered on the
individual’s feelings, perceptions, and opinions. Field teams conducted 2 to 3 focus
groups for each target group with 5 to 7 participants in each group, for a total of
8 focus groups and 40 to 60 participants. Focus groups were also varied, including
various industry sectors, types of programs, and target populations. The focus
group and qualitative interview instruments can be found in appendixes D, E, F,
G, and H. Details on the focus groups and qualitative surveys for each country can
be found in appendixes I (Ghana), J (Kenya), and K (Mozambique).
   The majority of the fieldwork for the EET case studies was conducted between
February and May 2013. Focus groups and interviews were conducted in multiple
locations in Ghana (in the cities of Accra and Kumasi), Kenya (Malindi, Mombasa,
and Nairobi), and Mozambique (Manica, Maputo, and Nampula). With rare
exceptions, the EET programs identified have not been the subject of specific
reviews or evaluations that could give an independent assessment of their rele-
vance, effectiveness, and impact. Most do not have built-in monitoring and evalu-
ation systems that would make it possible to assess whether the results corre-
sponded to their stated objectives. Thus, the perceptions of program managers,
successful and failed entrepreneurs, and beneficiaries were the only sources of
data to assess the quality and effectiveness of the programs. Four different dimen-

      About the Report
      This report summarizes the key themes and findings from three in-depth case
      studies of EET programs in Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique. Each case study
      produced rich information on the programs’ context, the landscape of programs
      in each country, and the qualitative insights from local EET stakeholders. This
      report synthesizes information from across the case studies to analyze the extent
      to which these countries’ programs are meeting the needs of local entrepreneurs.
      It also introduces findings from global EET research to show how programs in
      the case-study countries relate to what is known about global practice in EET.
      From this synthesis, the report presents a set of key findings intended to illumi-
      nate how EET programs can be better aligned with local needs and promising
      EET practices globally.

      Structure
      The report is structured in six chapters and presents key insights from across the
      case studies along the way. Chapter 1 is the introduction chapter. Chapter 2
      introduces a common framework for EET, drawn from the complementary study,
      Entrepreneurship Education and Training Programs Around the World: Dimensions
      for Success (Valerio, Parton, and Robb 2014), in order to provide a common defi-
      nition and language for a discussion of the diverse universe of EET programs.
      Chapter 3 summarizes the economic, political, and cultural contexts as well as
      the entrepreneurial environments for EET programs across the case-study coun-
      tries, drawing upon both existing research and the insights of local EET stake-
      holders. Chapter 4 summarizes the landscape of programs identified by the case
      studies according to program type and explores connections with relevant find-
      ings from global EET research. Chapter 5 presents a set of key thematic findings
      from the qualitative fieldwork. Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of the
      cross-cutting findings from the case studies and insights into the implications for
      policymakers and program designers.

      Usefulness
      This report seeks to provide operational and technical lessons that can be used
      to inform the design and implementation of existing or new EET programs, both
      within the countries studied and beyond. The findings also help to fill a critical
      knowledge gap in the specific characteristics of EET programs that contribute to
      the promotion of entrepreneurial attitudes, the attainment of entrepreneurial
      skills, and the improvement of entrepreneurial outcomes. Finally, the findings in
      this report are intended to inform EET policy and program dialogue at multiple
      levels, guide investment decisions that policymakers and government institutions
      make with regard to EET programs, and further research in the EET realm.

Conceptual Framework for EET




Given the diversity of programs and the wide range of economic conditions
under which these programs operate, a framework is used that allows a more
structured and focused examination as to what kinds of entrepreneurial educa-
tion and training (EET) programs and what types of outcomes are relevant to
these countries. The framework described below was previously introduced in a
global study of entrepreneurship education and training programs (Valerio,
Parton, and Robb 2014).


Defining EET
A number of international, regional, national, and local actors are taking part in
the global experiment of EET. Today, EET is recognized as an established field of
study, growing in parallel with the interest of policymakers and students
(Mwasalwiba 2010). While a single, generally accepted definition remains elu-
sive, researchers are contributing to an evolving definition (Charney and Libecap
2000; Farstard 2002; Menzies 2003; Isaacs et al. 2007; Dickson, Solomon, and
Weaver 2008).Taken together, EET generally reflects both the activity of trans-
mitting specific mind-sets and skills associated with entrepreneurship; as well as
education and training programs that seek to engender various entrepreneurship
outcomes. As a working definition for this study, EET represents academic educa-
tion or formal training interventions that share the broad objective of providing indi-
viduals with the entrepreneurial mind-sets and skills to support participation and
performance in a range of entrepreneurial activities.


Types of EET Programs
EET programs can be classified under two related but distinct categories: educa-
tion programs and training programs. Broadly speaking, both aim to stimulate
entrepreneurship, but they are distinguished from one another by their variety
of program objectives or outcomes. While differing from program to program,
entrepreneurship education (EE) programs tend to focus on building knowledge

      and skills about or for the purpose of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship train-
      ing (ET) programs, by contrast, tend to focus on building knowledge and skills,
      explicitly in preparation for starting or operating an enterprise.
         Advancing the classification of EET, programs can also be distinguished by
      their target audiences (see figure 2.1). The academic nature of EE means these
      programs target two groups in particular: secondary education students and
      higher education students, the latter including both graduate and undergraduate
      students enrolled in formal degree-granting programs. By contrast, ET programs
      target a range of potential and practicing entrepreneurs who are not part of for-
      mal, degree-granting programs. Potential entrepreneurs targeted by ET programs
      can include, at one end of the range, vulnerable, unemployed, inactive individuals
      or necessity-driven potential entrepreneurs, and at the other end highly skilled,
      innovation-led, or opportunistic potential entrepreneurs. Likewise, the range of
      practicing entrepreneurs runs from individuals owning informal, micro- and
      small enterprises, all the way to high-growth-potential enterprise owners.


      The Dimensions of EET Programs
      Determining the outcomes of EET programs is a complex and multidimensional
      challenge, regardless of whom a program targets. The task is complicated in part
      because the intended outcomes of EET programs can vary substantially from
      program to program. Therefore, this study draws upon existing EET research to
      propose a way of conceptualizing both the results EET programs seek and the
      factors that can shape those outcomes.

    Outcomes for EET programs can be categorized into four domains. The first,
entrepreneurial mind-sets, refers to the socio-emotional skills and overall aware-
ness of entrepreneurship associated with entrepreneurial motivation and future
success as an entrepreneur (such as self-confidence, leadership, creativity, risk
propensity, motivation, resilience, and self-efficacy). The second, entrepreneurial
capabilities, refers to entrepreneurs’ competencies, knowledge, and technical
skills associated with their entrepreneurship (such as management skills, account-
ing, marketing, and technical knowledge). The third, entrepreneurial status, refers
to the temporal state of a program beneficiary as measured through entrepre-
neurial activities and beyond (such as by starting a business, becoming employed,
or achieving a higher income). Lastly, the fourth domain, entrepreneurial perfor-
mance, refers explicitly to how indicators of a venture’s performance have
changed as a result of an intervention (such as by gaining higher profits, increased
sales, greater employment of others, or higher survival rates).
    The Conceptual Framework also outlines three dimensions that available
research has shown to influence the range of EET outcomes (see figure 2.2):
(i) the context within which programs are implemented; (ii) the characteristics
of individual participants; and (iii) the functional characteristics of the programs
themselves.

•	 Program context: The Conceptual Framework accounts for a series of contex-
   tual influences shown to impact the likelihood of a program’s capacity to
   generate outcomes. These include the economic context, the political con-
   text, and the cultural context. Studies have looked at the series of economic,

16	                                                                     Conceptual Framework for EET


         political, and social factors that are likely to make individuals more successful
         at starting new ventures (Pittaway and Cope 2007). As a fundamental ex-
         ample, a market that possesses the unique contextual factors needed to foster
         entrepreneurship is more likely to have the factors that enable entrepreneur-
         ial activity than a market that lacks such contextual factors.
      •	 Participant characteristics: The Conceptual Framework also accounts for the
         moderating influence of what participants bring with them coming into a
         program. This includes each individual’s profile; basic demographic identifi-
         ers; personality or traits; education; interest and intentions; and behaviors
         while enrolled within a program (for example, attrition). These individual
         characteristics are a prominent subject in the EET literature, and certain per-
         sonality traits have been linked to positive entrepreneurial outcomes (Luthje
         and Franke 2003; Rauch and Frese, 2007). From an operational standpoint,
         EET programs themselves recognize the role of participant characteristics in
         moderating outcomes. This would explain why so many EET programs use a
         range of selection processes—screening candidates for various characteristics,
         including their educational background, their work experience, and even their
         personalities (using personality tests to screen for certain character traits).
         Furthermore, program outcomes can be shaped by dynamics associated with
         participant behavior, including the nature of participant uptake as well as at-
         trition within a particular program.
      •	 Program characteristics: The Conceptual Framework distinguishes among four
         major categories of program characteristics: program design; trainers and de-
         livery; content and curriculum; and wrap-around services. EET programs may
         range from full academic courses to short training courses. In turn, program
         characteristics are an important driver of EET, since they are the easiest to
         manipulate. The entrepreneurship program concept is broader than what can
         be conveyed by a single course or by the material taught in a classroom alone;
         instead, it comprises a whole portfolio of complementary activities (Souitaris,
         Zerbinati, and Al-Laham 2007). An appropriate design of this portfolio is
         important to a program’s ultimate outcomes. The portfolio can include the
         usual components related to classroom activities—such as trainers, curricu-
         lum, delivery format, and duration or intensity—as well as wrap-around ser-
         vices like mentoring, networking opportunities, guest speakers, and collabora-
         tion with other institutions.

Context for Entrepreneurship in
Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique




The Conceptual Framework described in the previous chapter highlights how a
series of contextual influences shape both opportunities and barriers for entre-
preneurs. It organizes these barriers along economic, political, and cultural lines
to bring clarity to the range of influences that can shape the environment for
potential and practicing entrepreneurs. It is within these environments that
entrepreneurial education and training (EET) programs function, and in some
cases programs are crafted to respond to them. To better understand the respec-
tive contexts that EET programs function within, this chapter provides an over-
view of the contextual factors that shape the entrepreneurial environment. For
each country, the chapter examines key economic, political, and cultural trends.
Where appropriate, this also includes information from a series of global entre-
preneurship research initiatives that seek to benchmark a country’s “friendliness”
to entrepreneurs. In addition, this chapter pulls in the perspectives of entrepre-
neurs from each country based on interviews conducted with them.
   Although this chapter describes how in each of the case countries, key mac-
roeconomic trends give reason for optimism about the trajectory of private sec-
tor development, entrepreneurs in each of the countries do face considerable
barriers. On the one hand, the challenging entrepreneurial environment can be
viewed as overwhelming the potential of EET programs to contribute to the
success of participants. But on the other hand, it appears that EET programs
were intentionally crafted to respond to some of the profound contextual chal-
lenges that these countries face, from high youth unemployment to high per-
centages employed informal sectors. Thus, in looking at these countries’ contexts,
the diverse landscape of EET programs can be viewed as both weathering and
responding to national challenges.


The Economic Context
The “economic context” represents the multiple economic variables that have
been found to correlate with entrepreneurship outcomes. In their study of youth

      employment in Sub-Saharan Africa, Filmer et al. (2014) indicate that two
      dimensions shape pathways to productive work: the human capital of the indi-
      vidual and the business environment in which the individual operates. In this
      sense, entrepreneurs’ ability to succeed based on their own skills and abilities is
      moderated by the economic context in which they operate. The World Bank’s
      2013 development report on jobs states, “Even potentially skilled entrepreneurs
      would have difficulty succeeding without access to basic infrastructure and
      financial resources. In their absence, managerial capacity alone may not be
      enough” (World Bank 2012d). Further, McKenzie and Woodruff (2012) suggest
      that spillovers (positive or negative) within the economic context from entrepre-
      neurship programs may correlate with entrepreneurship outcomes. Although
      EET programs often operate primarily within local contexts, national economic
      trends often shape the local conditions. Following are some of the key national
      trends discernible in the case-study countries.

      Prospects for export-driven growth are significant,
      and the service sectors are also large
      The Sub-Saharan African region experienced profound growth in recent decades,
      with gross domestic product (GDP) growing more than 4.5 percent a year on
      average between 2000 and 2012 and with strong prospects for sustained growth
      over the medium term. Further, in most of the countries in the region growth
      depends on the export of primary commodities (Filmer et al. 2014). The case
      countries align with these broader trends. Kenya is the largest economy in east
      and central Africa and the main hub for the region’s financial, communication,
      and transportation services. Its GDP growth averaged 3.7 percent between 2000
      and 2009 (World Bank 2010). Its growth contracted in 2012 (from 4.4 percent
      in 2011 to 4.3 percent), when its central bank increased interest rates in the fight
      against rising inflation and the Shilling depreciation (World Bank 2012a).
      However, Kenya’s growth in 2013 was 5 percent, with a strong economic outlook
      for 2014 (World Bank 2013c). Economic prospects are also positive as a result of
      the discovery of oil and gas reserves, which are expected to attract high inflows
      of foreign direct investments and income for the government. Services dominate
      the economy, accounting for over 50 percent of GDP, with agriculture account-
      ing for 25 percent of GDP and manufacturing (including manufacturing, mining,
      construction, energy, and water) accounting for around 20 percent. In terms of
      exports, agricultural commodities dominate; in declining order of volume the
      country exports tea, horticulture products, apparel and clothing accessories,
      unroasted coffee, tobacco and tobacco products, iron and steel, and animal and
      vegetable oils (Government of Kenya 2012).
         Ghana, with one of the highest GDPs per capita in Africa, is now one of the
      top 10 fastest-growing economies in the world and the fastest-growing economy
      in Africa. Driven in part by a diverse and rich natural resource base and an influx
      of foreign direct investment, Ghana experienced growth rates in the 4 to 15
      percent range for most of the last five years (GSS 2013). Ghana’s Statistical
      Service (GSS) reported a growth rate of 7.9 percent in 2012, down from 15

percent in 2011. However, rather than the fall being indicative of a sluggish or
stagnating economic performance, it was due to an inordinately high 2011 figure
from commercial oil production. According to the World Bank (2013b, 2),
Ghana’s growth will be driven by the petroleum sector. As in Kenya, in Ghana
agriculture accounts for roughly one-quarter of GDP, while the services sector
accounts for about 50 percent of GDP. The services sector has recently recorded
the highest growth, at 8.8 percent on average between 2009 and 2013, with five
activities in this sector recording growth rates above average: financial interme-
diation; information and communication; real estate, professional, administrative,
and support service activities; health and social work; and community, social, and
personal service activities (GSS 2013).
    For the last decade, Mozambique’s GDP growth averaged 8 percent between
1993 and 2010 according to the World Bank (2012f). Although it fell in 2009 to
6.3 percent, it has been estimated to have risen to 7.2 percent in 2012. In the
manufacturing sector, after a period of remarkable growth, the growth rate has
slowed, so that the sector’s share of GDP dropped from 16 percent in 2005 to
13.2 percent in 2010. Agriculture accounts for an estimated 31.5 percent of
GDP in Mozambique, with growth in the sector driven by the export-oriented
subsectors, such as the cotton and sugar industries, and the expansion of land use
(NKC Independent Economists 2012). The extractive industries now account
for 1.5 percent of total GDP and are poised to increase, in large part due to a
series of megaprojects and associated foreign direct investment (AIMO 2010).
Meanwhile, domestic small and medium enterprises and locally owned business
ventures lag behind and experience low labor productivity.
    Modern wage employment is nevertheless scarce.
    In Kenya, although wage employment has increased, the Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) estimates that only two out of five wage jobs are
modern jobs in the formal private sector (2.1 million in 2011). These jobs are
spread across sectors, with 800,000 in services, 350,000 in industry, 290,000 in
agriculture, and 680,000 in the public sector. Youth, defined in Kenya as between
the ages of 15 and 34,1 constitute two-thirds of the workforce (United Nations
Development Programme 2013); and while some 800,000 young Kenyans reach
working age each year only 50,000 new modern wage jobs each year are created
(World Bank 2012a). In Ghana, it is estimated that two-thirds of the population
is employed by the private sector, but less than 20 percent of these workers are
employed in the formal sector (Osei-Boateng and Ampratwum 2011). In
Mozambique, the formal sector employs 11.1 percent of the total labor force, 4.1
percent of which is in the public sector (Government of Mozambique 2006).
These figures are consistent with trends in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,
where it is estimated that about 16 percent of total employment represents for-
mal wage jobs (Filmer et al. 2014).
    Employment opportunities for young adults are scarce.
    The outlook for job opportunities for youth has been getting harder worldwide.
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO [2014]), the global
unemployment rate for youth rose from 11.6 percent in 2007 to 13.1 percent in

      2013. Kenyan census data indicate that unemployment is particularly high among
      youth; unemployment rates in the year 2009 were highest among those ages 15
      to 19 (24.3 percent), 20 to 24 (27.1 percent), and 25 to 29 (25.5 percent).
         Moreover, inactivity rates, which measure the share of the population who are
      neither studying nor working in any form, are substantially higher. For instance,
      the inactivity rates for the population between ages 15 and 24 in Sub-Saharan
      Africa have been constant between 2000 and 2010 at around 46 percent (ILO
      2013). For youths ages 20 to 24, the inactivity rate was calculated as 11.9
      ­
      percent, but this rises to 15.6 percent among urban youth.
         Similar problems exist in Ghana, where the soaring unemployment rate is
      considered a serious challenge. It has been reported that as many as 50 percent
      of graduates who leave Ghanaian universities and polytechnics will not find jobs
      for two years after their national service, and 20 percent will not find jobs for
      three years (Aryeetey 2001). The challenge lies not only in tackling the already
      sizable number of unemployed graduates, but also in absorbing the new entrants
      into the labor market. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Ghanaian economy
      therefore is the chronic joblessness of a vast proportion of the people. Similarly,
      in Mozambique the unemployment rate remains above 21 percent and is higher
      among young adults, including university graduates; it is estimated that about
      300,000 youths enter the labor market there each year (Government of
      Mozambique 2006). All of this is aligned with the World Bank’s report on youth
      employment in Sub-Saharan Africa, which finds that only around 16 percent of
      youth find jobs in wage or “formal” positions, whereas the vast majority of jobs
      are “either on family farms (62 percent) or in household enterprises (22 percent),
      which may be collectively described as informal sector” (Filmer et al. 2014, 4).
         The informal sector accounts for a large percentage of employment.
         In Kenya, the majority of new labor market entrants have to rely on work in
      the informal sector, which is essentially vulnerable employment. As of 2012,
      around 80 percent of all employment was in the informal sector, and 86 percent
      of all new jobs created in Kenya were informal-sector jobs (Government of
      Kenya 2012). As in Kenya, many of the employed in Ghana are self-employed
      workers who have established enterprises in the absence of formal employment
      opportunities; these enterprises constitute simple business activities with low
      entry barriers and low returns, including home-based enterprises, operating
      mainly in retailing or the production of food and drink (Altenburg 2009). In
      Mozambique, amid a total labor force of 10.1 million, it is estimated that 52.3
      percent are self-employed informal sector workers and that 11.5 percent are
      family workers without remuneration (Government of Mozambique 2006).


      The Political Context
      Beyond the fundamental stability of local political institutions, a number of
      political factors can shape the entrepreneurial environment. Political factors can
      manifest as specific policy actions that reduce bureaucratic barriers and corrup-
      tion, ensure fair practices, or provide grants and funding to support

entrepreneurial opportunities and promotion programs (Freedom House 2008;
Heritage Foundation 2008; World Bank 2012a, 2012b). Governments can also
promote entrepreneurship through an explicit entrepreneurship promotion
framework or strategy. Moreover, political contexts can be shaped by local actors,
including schools and various community-based organizations.
   Policies are in place to foster improvements in the business environment and
promote private sector development, but considerable barriers for entrepreneurs remain.
­
   Barriers include each country’s legal and regulatory frameworks and infra-
structure, while issues of corruption and insecurity, particularly in the informal
sector, and remain endemic. Interestingly, despite Ghana’s comparative political
stability and reputation for sound economic management in recent decades, in
interviews Ghanaian entrepreneurs expressed deep frustration with the govern-
ment’s support for local entrepreneurship.
   In Kenya, the past decade has been characterized by deliberate policies to
strengthen the private sector, agreed upon in the Economic Recovery Strategy for
Wealth and Employment Creation 2003–07 (ERS) and in Vision 2030, which
seeks to transform Kenya into a middle-income country by 2030 (Government
of Kenya 2008). The new constitution of 2010 is envisaged to further improve
the business climate through devolved policy and decision making, judicial
reforms, and empowerment of institutions to fight corruption and red tape.
Further, peaceful elections and a smooth transition of government appear to have
led to renewed confidence in the economy. Successful Kenyan entrepreneurs
indicated that they have witnessed notable improvements in the business climate
over the last 10 years, due to the government’s efforts focused on improving the
legal system, decreasing corruption and red tape, and promoting recognition of
the importance of the private sector and its contribution to the country’s devel-
opment. Nonetheless, entrepreneurs indicate that corruption, prohibitively high
taxes, and harassment by local government officers remain endemic. Further,
crime and insecurity remain a concern, most notably for entrepreneurs with
micro- and informal enterprises.
   In Ghana, a quarter-century of political stability and relatively sound economic
management has contributed to more than two decades of positive economic
growth. Over the past decade, Ghanaian policies have aimed at reinforcing stabil-
ity through support for sustained reductions in poverty levels and the shaping of
a competitive business environment. Nonetheless, the Ghanaian economy has yet
to achieve the desired structural transformation needed to move the country into
the state of a modern, industrialized, and prosperous economy. Moreover,
Ghanaian entrepreneurs did not describe a bright outlook for the business climate
for entrepreneurs. They felt strongly that the regulatory set-up there was not con-
ducive to the development of local entrepreneurship, with high interest rates, high
taxes, and government policies that favor foreign enterprises as opposed to local
entrepreneurs. They also felt the government was not doing enough to support
entrepreneurs by way of key infrastructure investments, such as roads, water
sources, and supply of electricity. Corruption and bureaucratic impediments to
registering and licensing a business were also cited as barriers.

         In Mozambique, the introduction of the Economic Rehabilitation Program
      (PRES) in 1987 constituted the first steps towards moving away from a centrally
      planned economy. In 1990, through a new constitution, the country introduced
      a multiparty democracy and recognized the role of market forces in efficiently
      allocating resources. While the Mozambican economy has made significant prog-
      ress in the last 10 years in its reported growth and its efforts on improving the
      investment climate, it still has a low ranking in international indicators of com-
      petitiveness and business environment. According to World Bank (2012f, 15) the
      issues are related to poor access to finance, perceived prevalence of corruption,
      inefficient government bureaucracy, inadequate infrastructure, and the education
      level of the workforce. Fragmentation in government policy and in the regulatory
      institutions for economic management contributes to delays and bureaucratic
      barriers. Further, corruption, crime, and insecurity remain considerable barriers
      for Mozambique’s entrepreneurs in the informal sector (ANEMM 2000; Lopes
      2006; AIMO 2010; Marrengula, Nhabinde, and Amosse 2012).


      The Cultural Context
      Cultural context refers to factors associated with local perceptions of entrepre-
      neurship as well as cultural attitudes toward failure, success, and the traditional
      roles of certain members of society. These cultural dynamics can either enable or
      constrain entrepreneurship in a society. Hofstede (1991) defines cultural values
      as broad tendencies to prefer specific behavioral patterns over others. Specific
      cultural dimensions (Rauch et al. 2000; Pinillos and Reyes 2011) and the pres-
      ence of entrepreneurial values within a society (Davidson and Wiklund 1997)
      have also been associated with different levels of entrepreneurial activity.
         Across the case countries, among the most frequently cited barriers to entrepre-
      neurs’ success were local attitudes toward entrepreneurship.
         Entrepreneurs believe there is a lack of wide acceptance of entrepreneurship
      as a respected career path. Potential Kenyan entrepreneurs described a pervasive
      fear of venturing into self-employment as a result of cultural attitudes toward
      familial financial obligations—whereby it becomes difficult to deny goods or
      credit to extended family members or relatives—and accompanying discourage-
      ment by peers and family members. The lack of family and peer support was also
      cited by potential and practicing entrepreneurs in Ghana and Mozambique.
         Entrepreneurs across the case countries also believe cultural factors can shape the
      performance of practicing entrepreneurs.
         Entrepreneurs in Kenya indicated that certain behavioral patterns (giving out
      goods for free, diverting business funds to nonbusiness purposes) are cultural and
      socioeconomic impediments to enterprise growth. In Ghana, entrepreneurs
      describe how a search for quick money, prejudice, a “pull him down” attitude, and
      superstition can all compromise many entrepreneurs’ willingness to persevere. In
      Mozambique, entrepreneurs also cite deep-rooted cultural values that thwart
      entrepreneurial success.

The Entrepreneurial Environment
There are a number of global research initiatives that aim to provide comprehen-
sive measures of countries’ business environments, some of which are specifically
focused on the conditions for entrepreneurship and the level of entrepreneurial
activity. While Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique are generally low performers
across these studies’ global samples, there are regional indicators suggesting that
these countries are stronger performers among their peers. In turn, many of these
regional rankings must be appreciated within the broader context of these coun-
tries’ level of development. Nonetheless, these research initiatives serve to pro-
vide indicators of broad areas and challenges within the business environment
with which these countries’ entrepreneurs must cope. Overall, while these rank-
ings indicate that life is not easy for entrepreneurs within the case countries, they
can inform the extent to which EET programs are meeting the needs of entre-
preneurs by helping them address the considerable challenges they face.

Ease of Doing Business
The first among these research initiatives is the World Bank’s Doing Business
project,2 which assesses regulations affecting domestic firms in 185 economies. It
ranks the economies in 10 areas of business regulation, including starting a busi-
ness, resolving insolvency, and trading across borders. Among the 50 economies
that have made the biggest improvements since 2005, the largest share—one
third—are in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the only countries in Africa to make
the top 50 are Mauritius and South Africa. Ghana ranks 64th, Kenya 121st, and
Mozambique 146th. The same three case countries rank 5th, 10th, and 20th,
respectively, among the 46 African countries examined, but there is variation in
where the case countries sit among various subfactors.
   Ghana, for example, ranks near the bottom (40th out of 46) in dealing with
construction permits, but it ranks 2nd in registering property. Kenya ranks 2nd
with respect to getting credit, but near the bottom (37th) in registering property.
Mozambique ties with Ghana for 5th place in investor protection, but ranks 40th
in access to electricity. In terms of starting a business, Mozambique ranks higher
than Ghana and Kenya—in 10th place, compared with 14th for Ghana and 23rd
for Kenya (See table 3.1).

Global Competitiveness Index
The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index ranks countries by
their competitiveness, as determined by a set of institutions, policies, and other
factors that affect countries’ levels of productivity.3 On average, Sub-Saharan
African economies trail the rest of the world in competitiveness, with the region
being home to 14 of the world’s 20 least competitive economies. Among the
three countries reviewed in this report, Ghana again ranks first, scoring in 103rd
place out of 144 countries. It is followed closely by Kenya (106th), and less
closely by Mozambique (138th). The most problematic factors for doing busi-
ness in Ghana, according to this index, are access to financing, corruption, tax
rates, and “poor work ethic in the national labor force.” For Kenya, the four most

problematic factors are corruption, inflation, tax rates, and crime/theft. The top
four problems in Mozambique are access to finance, corruption, inadequate sup-
ply of infrastructure, and inefficient government bureaucracy.

Global Entrepreneurship Development Index
The Global Entrepreneurship Development Index (GEDI) ranks 115 countries
according to a multidimensional entrepreneurship measure, and incorporates
both quality-related and quantitative differences.4 The index includes both indi-
vidual and institutional variables, allowing for inter-relatedness between all vari-
ables. While Mozambique is not yet included in the rankings, Ghana and Kenya
come out near the bottom, ranking 95th and 98th, respectively.

Global Entrepreneurship Monitor
The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) project provides an annual assess-
ment of the entrepreneurial activity, aspirations, and attitudes of individuals
across a wide range of countries.5 Unfortunately, only Ghana is included in the
current ranking. In comparison with other Sub-Saharan countries, Ghana ranks
higher for perceived opportunities and capabilities as well as for entrepreneurial
intentions and “high status to successful entrepreneurs,” but it ranks lower for
“fear of failure.” In addition, when the GEM examined entrepreneurial activity, it
found that when compared with other countries examined in Sub-Saharan
Africa, Ghana has relatively higher rates of new business ownership, early-stage
entrepreneurial activity, established business ownership, and improvement-driv-
en opportunity (as a percentage of total entrepreneurial activity). Ghana is on
par with the other countries in its rates of nascent entrepreneurship (15 percent)
and discontinuation of businesses (16 percent), and it ranks lower in rates of
necessity-driven entrepreneurship as a percentage of total entrepreneurial
activity.

Monitor Study
A 2012 study by the Monitor Group, funded by the Omidyar Network, exam-
ined the state of entrepreneurship in Africa, and included detailed surveys in
both Ghana and Kenya, as well as four other Sub-Saharan African countries
(Monitor Consulting Group 2012). These countries were then benchmarked
against global peers.6 The survey focused on four aspects of entrepreneurial envi-
ronments: (i) entrepreneurship assets (financing, skills, talent, infrastructure); (ii)
business assistance (government programs, incubation); (iii) policy accelerators
(legislation, administrative burdens); and (iv) motivations and mind-sets (legiti-
macy, attitudes, culture). Figure 3.1 provides a summary from the report, detail-
ing how Sub-Saharan African countries compared with their peers along these
four different dimensions.
   Interestingly, while Doing Business, Global Competitiveness Index, and the
GEDI all rank Ghana slightly above Kenya (and well above Kenya in Doing
Business), the country figures from the Monitor Group report suggest that
Ghana performs below peers, and below Sub-Saharan Africa more generally, in

accelerators, and entrepreneurial motivations/mind-set (see figure 3.2). Kenya by
contrast, performs well above the Sub-Saharan Africa average according to the
Monitor Group in almost all the indicators and generally performs on par or
above with all its peers (see figure 3.3).


Current Snapshot
While there is some cause for optimism, the challenges to achieving a vibrant
entrepreneurial economy in the region are enormous. And while EET program-
ming can only address a fraction of those challenges, more effective programming
has the potential to have a tangible impact in achieving that desired reality.
   Potential and practicing entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique have
reason for optimism with regard to the expansion of entrepreneurial opportunity.
   All three countries are experiencing periods of sustained economic growth,
and the diversifying private sector and the less-capital-intensive service sector in
particular are increasingly dominant contributors to each country’s economy. In
comparison to peers in Ghana and Mozambique, Kenyan entrepreneurs are the
most optimistic about their economic context. Relative to other countries in
Africa, all three countries ranked above average in terms of the ease of doing
business there. There seems to be growing recognition of the importance of cre-
ating an enabling entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially in Kenya and Ghana.

          However, each of the case countries faces considerable structural barriers to eco-
      nomic transformation, which fosters necessity-driven entrepreneurship and associated
      barriers to enterprise development.
          A relative lack of modern wage jobs and very high structural unemployment,
      particularly for youth, contribute to the large percentage of individuals employed
      in each country’s informal sector. For many, necessity-driven entrepreneurship in
      the informal sector is an option of last resort; for those with the potential to grow
      their enterprises, the lack of formalization fosters insecurity as well as legal and
      financial impediments to growth. The growing number of unemployed and
      underemployed college graduates is symptomatic of pervasive barriers to startup
      activities.
          Across the case countries, entrepreneurs cite considerable barriers to entrepreneur-
      ial success.
          Frequently mentioned barriers include corruption, bureaucratic red tape and,
      above all, lack of access to finance. While these are issues associated with entre-
      preneurial barriers across the globe, they are featured subjects across the interna-
      tional rankings featured in this chapter, and they are particularly pronounced in
      the case countries, given the prevalence of entrepreneurial activity taking place
      in the informal sector.
          Negative cultural perceptions of entrepreneurship persist.
          Entrepreneurs in the case countries mention a lack of successful role models
      and general negative cultural perceptions of entrepreneurship as a challenge.
      These attitudes may be in part shaped by the visible struggles that local necessi-
      ty-driven entrepreneurs face, particularly in comparison to those in wage
      employment, rather than to any endemic cultural distaste for the concept of
      entrepreneurship. However, the perceived inferiority of entrepreneurship as a
      career choice will hamper efforts to build a vibrant ecosystem that encourages
      entrepreneurial endeavors.
          EET alone will not be sufficient for addressing the factors that influence entrepre-
      neurs’ fates.
          Issues related to access to and the cost of financial capital, as well as integra-
      tion into markets through market information, regulatory regimes, and infra-
      structure constraints all have an impact on entrepreneurial outcomes. While such
      factors are beyond the scope of what any single EET program can address, EET
      programs would benefit from greater attention to the linkages between improve-
      ments in knowledge and skills and other enterprise development mechanisms,
      including access to funding and market intelligence.
          There is a notable gap between what the stakeholders’ needs and demands are and
      what the programs deliver.
          Among entrepreneurs in the case countries, the desire to complement knowl-
      edge and skill acquisition with additional supports is understandable. This may
      be reflected in the growing interest in the region in incubator and accelerator
      models and other more comprehensive programs that embed EET programming
      within a broader offering of support services for entrepreneurs, such as office
      facilities, Internet access, mentors, and financial capital.

Landscape of Programs




The previous chapter highlighted key trends that have shaped the entrepreneur-
ial environments in Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique and, in turn, the contexts
within which entrepreneurial education and training (EET) programs operate
and in some cases are designed to respond to. Against those backdrops, this chap-
ter summarizes the findings from scans of the landscape of EET programs in
these three case countries. Using the preceding framework for EET, findings from
the countries are organized by program type (entrepreneurship education and
training) and target group (secondary and higher education students as well as
potential and practicing entrepreneurs). The summaries highlight key program
characteristics and, where possible, include information on outcomes that pro-
grams aim to achieve. The programs that form the basis of the program land-
scapes are listed in appendix A (Ghana), appendix B (Kenya), and appendix C
(Mozambique).
    In addition, for each type of EET program, this chapter reflects on its find-
ings in relation to insights from the global scan of EET program evaluations
(Valerio, Parton, and Robb 2014). This comparison makes it possible to under-
stand the extent to which EET programs in the case countries are unique or
share similarities with other programs, based on available knowledge about
global practice in EET. Further, drawing upon interviews with local potential and
practicing entrepreneurs, this chapter offers a discussion of how the landscape of
EET programs relates to the specific challenges and opportunities of local
entrepreneurs.


Program Landscape Overview
The EET landscape draws upon a comparatively larger and more established set of
programs in Kenya as compared to Ghana and Mozambique.
    In Kenya and Ghana, 42 EET programs were identified, while 27 programs
were identified in Mozambique with sufficient information for the analysis.
However, these filtered programs were drawn from a field of a total of 111 iden-
tified programs in Kenya, as compared to 80 programs in Ghana and 31 in
Mozambique. Further, while a number of long-established programs were

      identified in Kenya, EET is a comparatively newer phenomenon in both Ghana
      and Mozambique. In Ghana, nearly half the programs mapped were five years
      old or younger, and in Mozambique EET programs did not emerge until after the
      civil war ended in 1992.
          Program landscapes suggest that EET is often designed to respond to key contextual
      challenges.
          In Kenya, among the many programs identified, nearly half are classified as
      entrepreneurship training programs targeting potential entrepreneurs. This
      reflects the imperative of employment creation in the Kenyan economy, where
      pervasive and growing youth unemployment is commonly perceived to be a
      major factor in the country’s security problems and political instability. This,
      coupled with the slow job growth of recent years, has motivated the government
      to invest in large-scale training programs aimed at supporting youth and the
      unemployed to venture into self-employment.
          In Ghana, which is also facing chronic joblessness among young adults and
      university graduates, one-third of programs target higher education students
      alone. Perhaps the most pronounced example of EET catering to a country’s
      context is the situation in Mozambique, where the first generation of EET pro-
      grams emerged in the early 1990s targeting demobilized soldiers in the wake of
      the Mozambican civil war. Seen as a potential catalyst to peace and stability
      through the support self-employment initiatives, the programs were later
      expanded to target vulnerable groups, in particular women, former refugees, and
      those severely affected by the war.
          Identified training programs frequently rely upon private and international
      support.
          Across the three case countries, private, nongovernmental organizations, and
      development partners provide substantive support for EET programs. In Kenya,
      private organizations dominate the EET landscape, both in implementation and in
      funding, and there is a high level of involvement of development partners in the
      field of business sector development. While the majority of programs are run and
      funded by nongovernmental organizations, some are supported by large private
      firms, both national (such as Safaricom and Chandaria) and international (such as
      Microsoft, Coca-Cola, and Samsung). In Ghana, a comparatively larger amount of
      EET programs are run by public entities, yet nearly all receive some donor support
      or nongovernmental organization funding of some kind. Development partners
      also became increasingly active in EET in Mozambique in the late 1990s through
      two key development institutions: the United Nations Development Programme’s
      (UNDPs) Enterprise Mozambique and the United Nations Industrial Development
      Organization (UNIDO) and All India Manufacturers’ Organization (AIMO)’s
      Industrial Development Advisory Centre (CADI).


      Entrepreneurship Education: Secondary Education Students
      Entrepreneurship education for secondary education students (EESE) refers to
      the building of capabilities, skills, and mind-sets about or for the purpose of

entrepreneurship and is aimed at expanding the potential pool of future entre-
preneurs. In Kenya, EESE is part of the curriculum in all educational streams and
levels, including technical and vocational education and training (TIVET),
although it is offered as an optional subject. EESE is also integrated in teacher
education programs at certificate and diploma levels—especially those programs
focused on commerce—and in certificate programs for social and community
development. While not compulsory within general secondary education, EESE
is offered within the TIVET system as a vocational subject aimed at imparting
knowledge about economics and the business sector, designed to be useful to
students planning a career in business later on or business studies in higher
education.
   EESE programs are largely implemented in Kenya following the Know About
Business (KAB) approach, a branded methodology developed and internationally
disseminated by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to build business
awareness among students. KAB is structured as a pre-start-up program, based
largely on hands-on, experiential learning (using role-playing games and simula-
tions, for example). While KAB is an international brand, its curriculum is peri-
odically revised (the latest revision known in Kenya is from 2010) and comprises
nine modules, including: What Is an Enterprise?; Who Are Entrepreneurs?; Finding
a Good Business Idea; and Developing and Operating a Business Plan.
   Similar to Kenya, in Mozambique EESE is also driven by the Ministry of
Education. However, it is a more recent development in Mozambique. During
the 2000s, in partnership with both the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO) and as part of the broader effort The Program to Reform
Technical and Vocational Education and Training (PIREP), Mozambique launched
two major EESE efforts as part of a broader strategy to combat youth
unemployment.

•	 The first effort was a set of curricular reforms aimed at developing life and en-
   trepreneurship skills among students and teachers at the lower and upper sec-
   ondary levels. In 2007, with financial and technical support from UNIDO, an
   entrepreneurship curriculum focused on promoting entrepreneurial awareness
   was implemented across 255 schools, serving around 240,000 students through-
   out the country and taught by 1,521 teachers. By far, this was and continues to
   be the largest entrepreneurship education (EE) program in the country.
•	 A second effort in Mozambique was the infusion of entrepreneurship con-
   cepts into the country’s technical and vocational education and training sys-
   tem. In 2006, under the PIREP program (with the support of the World Bank
   and a number of bilateral partners), curriculum reforms combined technical
   competencies with entrepreneurial skills. Within the broader PIREP curricu-
   lum, which aims to integrate education and work for credentials across a
   number of sectors (agriculture, industrial maintenance, hotel and tourism,
   administration and management, civil construction, and energy and mining),
   all students are required to study entrepreneurship modules regardless of
   their area of study.

      Similar to EESE in Kenya and Mozambique, in Ghana EESE targets students
      across a variety of secondary institutions, including general upper secondary
      schools, technical schools, and vocational schools. Programs in Ghana are typi-
      cally delivered using a lecture-based format, with curricula focused on building
      awareness of entrepreneurship. While most of these programs do not provide
      wrap-around services, a few programs feature mentorship and networking.
          Program Outcomes
          A review of EESE programs in the three case countries offered little informa-
      tion by way of program outcomes. Available figures largely pertained to program
      “inputs” or surveys of student opinions. In Mozambique, available information
      indicated that between 2009 and 2012, enrollment increased by 41 percent in
      vocational and technical schools after curricular reforms, which included manda-
      tory entrepreneurship modules. However, the increase cannot be attributed in a
      rigorous fashion to the inclusion of entrepreneurship in the curricula. In Ghana,
      EESE programs focus on outcomes related to participants’ interest in entrepre-
      neurship, but this is evaluated by seeking student opinions and satisfaction levels
      with the programs upon completion.
          In the absence of outcome reporting, information pertaining to programs’
      desired outcomes can be inferred by examining the objectives of EESE programs
      across the countries. A finding of particular interest is that while desired out-
      comes for EESE programs across the countries are concentrated in the entrepre-
      neurial mind-set domain, notable is the absence of socio-emotional skills. Rather,
      it appears that EESE programs across the three countries aim to primarily build
      students’ entrepreneurial awareness as well as their broader understanding of
      business principles and concepts.
          In Relation to Global Practice:

      •	 Little information on outcomes. The lack of information on outcomes for EESE
         programs across the case countries echoes the dearth of research on these
         programs across the region and globally. The lack of rigorous EESE evalua-
         tions is partly attributable to the difficulty of measuring these programs’ link-
         ages with explicit entrepreneurship outcomes such as enterprise formation or
         enhanced profits. Further, research acknowledges the practical constraints to
         interventions influencing secondary education students’ becoming self-em-
         ployed or launching entrepreneurial ventures. One evaluation of an EESE
         program in South Africa illustrates the challenges (South African Institute for
         Entrepreneurship, 2006). While the program reports promising results across
         a number of indicators, including students’ entrepreneurial knowledge, skills,
         and attitudes, the evaluations also found that extraneous factors (socioeco-
         nomic profile) were a powerful influence on student performance, in fact
         more influential than the teaching materials, and that entrepreneurial skill
         acquisition was not a neat, linear process, but proceeded haphazardly over a
         prolonged period of time.
      •	 Use of international curricula. As described from the program landscape in
         Kenya, several EESE programs around the globe borrow curricula from an

                Entrepreneurship Education and Training  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0278-2
Landscape of Programs	                                                                     35


   international brand or franchise—examples include Junior Achievement and
   the ILO’s Know About Business (KAB) program. From a program design
   standpoint, EESE programs can represent an intriguing blend of the global
   (international NGOs) and the local (individual schools). The Junior Achieve-
   ment Namibia program (Mahohoma and Muyambo 2008) reflects the ap-
   proach in Kenya to using an international curricular brand to scale entrepre-
   neurship across the country.
•	 Relying on local teachers for delivery. A trend across the three case countries
   was the integration of EESE within the secondary level curricula and deliv-
   ered during normal school hours. This places the delivery of curricula in the
   hands of local teachers. Several evaluations of EESE programs recognize the
   role the teacher can have in shaping a program’s outcome and thus pay atten-
   tion to the need for teachers trained in the specific pedagogies and content of
   EESE programs (Nakkula and others 2004; Bolstad 2006; Volkmann 2009).
   In Kenya, where entrepreneurship education has been a compulsory aspect of
   all levels of TVET since the 1990s, entrepreneurship education has been a
   part of all teachers’ training since 1993 (Farstard 2002). Yet, as discussed
   more fully next, one desired characteristic of EE teachers is actual entrepre-
   neurship experience, which has often not been the case in these three case-
   study countries.


Entrepreneurship Education: Higher Education Students
Entrepreneurship education programs in higher education (EEHE) target stu-
dents enrolled in undergraduate as well as graduate degree-granting programs.
Notably, while some these programs claim to prepare students for careers as
entrepreneurs, they also aim to prepare them for careers in entrepreneurship
promotion as “entrepreneurship facilitators.”
   In Kenya, universities are increasingly involved in entrepreneurship education.
Two public universities, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
and Kenyatta University, have integrated entrepreneurship concepts in most of
their academic programs. Kenyatta University and Mount Kenya University have
begun systematically training all faculty in all disciplines in entrepreneurship and
management. In addition to infusing entrepreneurship concepts across academic
programs, several universities offer full academic programs in entrepreneurship.
Within Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology is
regarded as a pioneer of entrepreneurship education at the higher education
level, being the first university in the region to offer a PhD program in entrepre-
neurship. Notably, universities in Kenya are increasingly linked to entrepreneur-
ship incubator programs, which offer a range of wrap-around services from
networking and mentorship connections to access to potential funding sources.
­
   Entrepreneurship education is increasingly prevalent in Mozambique’s higher
education institutions as well. Examples of EEHE programs are found at three
institutions, which combined enroll more than half of the country’s higher
education students: Instituto Superior de Ciências e Tecnologia de Mocambique

      (Institute of Science and Technology of Mozambique), Eduardo Mondlane
      University, and the Pedagogical University. The first of these hosts the Empresa
      Junior program, which includes workshops and a business plan competition to
      provide exposure to entrepreneurship among students. The Pedagogical
      University, in partnership with UNIDO, designed an entrepreneurship course to
      train teachers on entrepreneurship development in 2009; entrepreneurship there
      is both a discipline as well as a cross-cutting focus within the curriculum. At
      Eduardo Mondlane University students take a required entrepreneurship course
      regardless of their area of study. This last university has also opened an
      Entrepreneurship Higher Education School, which runs courses on business
      management and leadership.
          In Ghana, EEHE programs target students across postsecondary institutions,
      including polytechnics and universities. As in Kenya and Mozambique, here
      EEHE is offered both as a specialized degree program and as an area of curricular
      focus across programs and disciplines. Within private institutions, EEHE tends to
      take the form of specialized programs. As an example, the Entrepreneurship
      Training Institute in Accra offers both a full degree program as well as a post-
      graduate diploma in entrepreneurship. By contrast, in public institutions EEHE
      tends to come in the form of a one-semester core course for undergraduate stu-
      dents. Instructors for EEHE programs have varied backgrounds, ranging from
      professors and lecturers to consultants and entrepreneurs. Wrap-around services
      are limited though, and typically involve mentorship.
          Program Outcomes
          As is true for the landscape of EESE programs, for EEHE programs there is
      little information in the case countries on the associated outcomes. In
      Mozambique, schools did not conduct systematic follow-up on student o     ­ utcomes,
      and in Ghana, institutional outcomes for programs were limited to enrollment
      and degree completion. However, looking at the objectives of EEHE programs
      across the three case countries, it is clear that programs focus on building entre-
      preneurial capabilities—knowledge and skills associated with entrepreneur-
      ship—while little attention is given to how many students end up actually
      launching an enterprise.1 In Kenya, EEHE students indicated that they viewed
      the programs as valuable for building their management and business skills in
      order to be prepared for a career, but there are no systematic follow-ups to verify
      any positive impact from the programs.
          This finding about program objectives is line with what is known about the
      outcomes of EEHE programs globally. Most evaluations of EEHE programs are
      largely concerned with measuring the extent to which students were enhancing
      capabilities associated with entrepreneurial activity and success. This focus is also
      consistent with the profile of a target group that is still comparatively young,
      preparing to enter the world of work and, thus, preparing for entrepreneurship.
      Lending strength to the idea that these programs can ultimately contribute to
      entrepreneurial activity, Martin, McNally, and Kay (2013) find a relationship
      between entrepreneurship outcomes and academic-focused EET interventions,
      characteristic of EEHE. They find that that relationship is stronger for the

Landscape of Programs	                                                                     37


academic-focused EET interventions (r = 0.238) than it is for training-focused
EET interventions (r = 0.151), which are more likely to resemble Entrepreneurship
training (ET) program types. Their finding concerns the potential role of EEHE
programs in engendering outcomes that are related not only to mind-sets and
capabilities but also to entrepreneurial status (such as enterprise start-up) and
performance (such as enterprise survivability).2
   Further, available evaluations of EEHE programs in Sub-Saharan Africa have
also demonstrated promising results in building knowledge and skills, though
they show mixed results in contributing to future entrepreneurial activity. A
rigorous impact evaluation from Uganda provides the most compelling results.
The evaluation of the Skills Toward Employment and Productivity program
there, which is run at two Ugandan universities (Gielnik and others 2013), indi-
cated that the 12-month curriculum increased the likelihood of treated ­  students
starting a business as compared to the control group. The evaluation credited the
results to the program’s action-based training method,3 a learning-by-doing
approach that provided students with the skills and knowledge needed to start
businesses. (In addition, an evaluation of the EEHE program at the Auchi
Polytechnic School of Business in Nigeria also found promising results in terms
of developing students’ managerial skills as well as enhancing their desire to set
up small-scale businesses after graduation) (Idogho and Ainabor 2011).
   In Relation to Global Practice:

•	 A mix of degree programs and cross-cutting approaches to EEHE. The landscape
   of EEHE programs in Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique is a mix of stand-alone
   degree programs and entrepreneurship modules integrated across disciplines.
   Kenya shows signs of entrepreneurship education being integrated across pro-
   grams at universities, while in Ghana entrepreneurship education programs
   appear to be phenomena concentrated within private universities. In Mozam-
   bique, entrepreneurship education has a presence at the country’s largest
   higher education institutions. Looking at evaluations of EEHE programs glob-
   ally, a key issue of interest is the high level of self-selection these programs
   involve, with students already interested in entrepreneurships tending to take
   advantage of the course offerings. The program landscapes in Kenya and Mo-
   zambique, however, indicate that in some cases entrepreneurship is a required
   area of study, particularly for students in business and management programs.
•	 Focus on building skills and awareness. As with EEHE programs globally,
   EEHE programs in the case countries tend to have ties to general business
   education and management programs. As such, they are often taught by fac-
   ulty in these departments and focus on the business side of entrepreneurship,
   including management, marketing, and accounting. What information is avail-
   able on the outcomes of EEHE programs suggests that they tend to focus on
   developing business and management skills. Thus, what differentiates these
   programs from traditional business and management education is the focus
   they have on applying these skills in the context of creating new ventures,
   notably small businesses. To this end, EEHE programs serve to build ­  awareness

38	                                                                              Landscape of Programs


         of entrepreneurship principles, with some programs associating their success
         with enhancing students’ desirability to become entrepreneurs.
      •	 Use of simulation activities and learning by doing. A number of the evaluated
         EEHE programs place emphasis on the knowledge and skills required to de-
         velop a business plan as well as contribute to the strategic development of an
         enterprise. Evaluations from EEHE programs globally indicate that an encour-
         aging tactic for transmitting these capabilities is the use of simulation activities,
         such as setting up mock enterprises or business plan competitions. Such exer-
         cises can represent a learning-by-doing approach, which was supported by the
         findings of the Skills Toward Employment and Productivity evaluation in
         Uganda. In the case countries, there were some instances of programs using
         business plan competitions, for example the Empresa Junior program in Mo-
         zambique. However, it is also useful to examine these activities in terms of why
         young, potential entrepreneurs may find these programs useful. Focus groups
         of program participants in the case countries indicate that, particularly at the
         higher education level, programs are too theoretical and there is little exposure
         to entrepreneurship concepts in practice and entrepreneurs themselves. Glob-
         al EET research indicates that business plan competitions often feature such
         exposure through mentorship and coaching opportunities. Further, they may
         offer exposure to funders and potential sources of finance, the lack of access to
         which entrepreneurs across the case countries indicate is a key barrier.
      •	 Thematic ties to high-growth entrepreneurship. In global EET research the link-
         ages between EEHE and the establishment of high-growth enterprises re-
         mains tenuous, yet many EEHE programs appear to deliberately cultivate
         innovation-driven entrepreneurs and high-growth enterprises. While a similar
         theme was not apparent across EEHE programs within the case countries, in
         Kenya it is notable that universities are increasingly involved in developing
         entrepreneurship incubators, which globally tend to be selective and feature
         comprehensive wrap-around services to support high-growth entrepreneurs.


      Entrepreneurship Training: Potential Entrepreneurs
      Entrepreneurship training for potential entrepreneurs (ETPo) programs target a
      range of participants, who include vulnerable, unemployed, inactive individuals—­
      often necessity-driven potential entrepreneurs—in addition to innovation-led or
      opportunistic potential entrepreneurs. In Kenya, the majority of ETPo programs
      are both funded and implemented by private actors, which include local and
      international NGOs, as well as both domestic firms (Safaricom, Chandaria) and
      multinational firms (Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Samsung). Around half of identified
      ETPo programs in Kenya operate on a national scale, including around 10 percent
      that are associated with international programs, with the remainder being locally
      or regionally focused. Regardless, most programs have a strong presence in the
      capital city, Nairobi.
         A number of programs in Kenya target specifically marginalized populations,
      including women, rural populations, and unemployed youth, with the latter

group getting significant attention in recent years. A myriad of different programs
there aim to address youth unemployment through the promotion of entrepre-
neurship. These include publicly funded and run programs under the Ministry of
Youth Affairs and Sport (MOYAS), the Kenya Youth Enterprise Fund, and the
Yes Youth Can program; the last program has funding from USAID, is imple-
mented by Technoserve, and aims to reach half a million young people. While
those large-scale programs are national in scope, with branches or locations
throughout Kenya, there are other programs with a more localized focus, such as
the Kenya Youth Business Trust (KYBT) in Mombasa. There are also instances of
ETPo programs targeting youth specifically for careers in the information and
communication technology sector. While the last type focus largely on the devel-
opment of computer and media skills, they do include entrepreneurship training
as a component. Examples include the Samsung Real Dreams Program imple-
mented by the African Center for Women, Information and Communications
Technology (ACWICT), which targets young women from poor urban neighbor-
hoods and comprises information technology training alongside life-skills and
entrepreneurship training.
   Other ETPo programs in Kenya target high-growth potential entrepreneurs,
though these are comparatively fewer in number. They include business plan
competitions that provide training as a component of support, which may also
include access to funding, and they tend to be selective with regard to partici-
pants, looking to identify committed and potential entrepreneurs with promising
business ideas. Examples include the Enablis ILO Safaricom Foundation Business
Plan Competition, cosponsored by the ILO, the Safaricom Foundation, Inoorero
University, and Chase Bank; and the Jitihada Business PlanCompetition, funded
by the World Bank, which in 2012 alone received 3,493 applications from across
Kenya. While all applicants to the latter received one day of training, 800 were
selected to participate in the full five-day training.
   Given the diversity of target audiences for ETPo programs in Kenya, programs
exhibit a variety of delivery approaches. Nevertheless, Kenya offers particular
insight on large-scale ETPo programs, given the number of programs targeting
large populations of unemployed youth. For example, to cope with such large
numbers, the Yes Youth Can project uses a peer-peer learning approach. Across a
number of youth programs, trainers are recruited from the corps of youth and
development officers, professional development workers, and training consul-
tants. Trainers have usually undergone training-of-trainers programs, but typically
they have no business experience, while study visits and guest lectures from the
business community are rare. There are notable exceptions, such as KYBT
Mombasa, where the trainers come from the business community. Interactive
training and experiential hands-on training are common across such programs,
though not universal.
   A notable trend across the three case countries is the number of programs that
include wrap-around services or are linked to broader entrepreneurship promo-
tion efforts, such as microfinance lending. For example, in Kenya, MOYAS
provides a business awareness session to all those who qualify for loans through

      the Kenya Youth Enterprise Fund, which includes periodic sessions with motiva-
      tional speakers. Further, linkages are not always specific to entrepreneurship. In
      Mozambique, the International Relief and Development (IRD) program’s
      “Women First” combines entrepreneurship training for rural women who are
      potential entrepreneurs with health promotion and human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention.
         In contrast to the ETPo landscape in Kenya, which is comparatively domi-
      nated by privately driven initiatives, several prominent ETPo programs in
      Mozambique are driven by government ministries. These still target a diverse
      range of potential entrepreneurs. The ministry-driven nature of ETPo in
      Mozambique may be a legacy of EET’s role in the country’s postwar reconstruc-
      tion. Administered by the Ministry of Labor, the National Institute for
      Employment and Vocational Training was set up in the early 1990s to reintegrate
      demobilized fighters and refugees from the civil war. However, as happened in
      Kenya, this institute has since turned its attention to offering entrepreneurship
      training programs to unemployed youth, in this case through 13 training centers
      across Mozambique.
         Mozambique’s Ministry of Industry and Commerce also promotes entrepre-
      neurship through a number of activities that include the provision of training to
      potential entrepreneurs. In 2008, this ministry established the Small and Medium
      Enterprise Promotion Institute (IPEME), which runs short courses on starting
      new business and managing small and medium enterprises. Further, reflecting a
      growing interest in high-growth potential enterprises, the Ministry of Science and
      Technology runs a set of incubators and technology parks that aim to encourage
      innovation and high-growth potential entrepreneurship. The latter ministry also
      coordinates the STIFIMO program,4 launched in 2012 with support from
      Finland, which creates opportunities and supports young Mozambicans with
      information and communication technology expertise to create ­      business plans
      for start-up enterprises.
         In Ghana, a privately funded institute called the Meltwater Entrepreneurial
      School of Technology, also known as MEST, selects potential entrepreneurs from
      a pool of university graduates to participate in a two-year training program that
      includes business, computer programming, software development, product man-
      agement, finance, marketing, sales, and leadership. After completing the two-year
      intensive program, participants pitch a concept for a business and the winning
      teams receive seed funding and a place in the coworking space in an incubator
      (also with MEST) where they are paired with advisors and mentors, who provide
      guidance in their process of building their businesses.
         Program Outcomes
         Global EET research indicates that the majority of ETPo evaluations tend to
      examine the impact of ET on specific, often vulnerable groups of participants,
      including women, unemployed youth, and welfare recipients. In targeting these
      groups, evaluations pay particular attention to the extent to which these
      programs are able to impact their economic well-being. Looking across the land-
      ­
      scape of ETPo programs in the case countries, program objectives are also

indicative of a focus on the economic empowerment for marginalized groups.
While there is little direct information on the outcomes of identified ETPo pro-
grams in the case countries, due in large part to a lack of monitoring and evalua-
tion, available research on ETPo programs in Sub-Saharan Africa provides insight
into programs’ potential to deliver on objectives.
   In McKenzie and Woodruff’s (2012) review of ET programs in developing
countries, the authors indicate that some of the stronger effects relate to helping
potential owners launch new businesses more quickly. This study, however, finds
that at least among the more rigorously evaluated ETPo programs, few evalua-
tions look explicitly at rates of new business start-ups. Instead, as appears to have
been the approach with the McKenzie and Woodruff review, proxies for business
start-up, such as self-employment and increased business income, are more com-
mon in these evaluations. In terms of income generation for marginalized groups,
rigorously evaluated programs in Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrate promising
findings. The Economic Empowerment of Adolescent Girls and Young Women
program in Liberia evidenced gains in weekly income and savings among trainees
compared to a control group (World Bank 2012e). Furthermore, the WINGS
(Women’s Income Generating Support) program in Uganda, which targeted
poor and capital- and credit-constrained women, also found significant impacts
on income, as well as consumption, and savings (Blattman and others 2013).
However, there is little evidence to suggest that the training’s impacts on new
businesses were sustained over time.
   Another outcome of interest for ETPo programs in Sub-Saharan Africa is the
enhancement of business practices, with several program evaluations indicating
improved record keeping, formal registration, access to new loans, and a more
strategic orientation of the businesses concerned. For example, the Youth
Opportunities program in Uganda (Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez Forthcoming)
found improvements in business practices across two-year and four-year inter-
vals. While the promotion of high-growth entrepreneurship is a focus within
ETPo across the case countries, there is little available evidence demonstrating
ETPos’ contributions to the creation of high-revenue or high-employment firms
in the long run.
   In Relation to Global Practice:

•	 A means of poverty alleviation. The diversity of ETPo programs within and
   across the case countries echoes the diverse landscape of ETPo programs
   globally. In the case countries, ETPo programs also tend to target specific
   groups, often marginalized populations, another shared finding from global
   EET research. In these contexts, EET is viewed as a means to the end of
   immediate poverty alleviation, rather than as a means to the end of fostering
   ­
   entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. Further reinforcing this focus, several
   ETPo evaluations give attention to participants’ psychological and social well-
   being, such as participants’ self-confidence and teamwork. The focus on such
   indicators is a reminder that many ETPo program evaluations cover interven-
   tions aimed at improving the immediate, material well-being of vulnerable

         populations. Programs that seek to address the health issues and risks facing
         rural women, such as Women First (in Mozambique), echo this more expan-
         sive reach within EET programming.
      •	 Attention to unemployed youth. Across the case countries, a common focus is
         on the use of EET to respond to concerns raised by youth unemployment.
         Despite the prevalence of this focus, particularly among EET programs in the
         region, there is little available evidence globally that gives direct attention to
         the impact of EET on this target group. Aside from programs targeting EEHE
         students, few evaluations of ETPo have been conducted to support broader
         knowledge of how well these programs are responding to policymakers’
         ­
         perception of entrepreneurship as a means for combating persistent youth
         unemployment (Volkmann et al. 2009).
      •	 Embedded within broader entrepreneurship promotion efforts. According to avail-
         able ETPo evaluations, the training components that combine grants with ac-
         tivities such as internships and mentoring services have more impact than
         simple training programs. Both in the case countries and in the global sample,
         ETPo programs are frequently embedded within broader support programs
         that include wrap-around services, such as grants, conditional cash transfers,
         and follow-up sessions with trainers to provide further technical assistance in
         implementing new business practices. While this aligns with how these pro-
         grams often target marginalized populations (providing extra supports), it is a
         principle that also holds true for programs targeting high-growth potential
         entrepreneurs. In the case countries, there is a growing interest in incubator/
         accelerator models that offer such comprehensive support for potential entre-
         preneurs.


      Entrepreneurship Training: Practicing Entrepreneurs
      Entrepreneurship training for practicing entrepreneurs (ETPr) comprises
      ­
      programs that target a range of practicing entrepreneurs, including individuals
      running informal, micro- and small enterprises as well as high-growth potential
      enterprises. Given the nature of their target group, these programs are primarily
      concerned with how they can help entrepreneurs survive and succeed, regardless
      of their type of enterprise.
         In Kenya, a number of different service providers offer training for practicing
      entrepreneurs. These include the Ministry of Trade through the Kenya Institute
      of Business Training (KIBT), a comparatively established provider, as well as vari-
      ous business membership organizations (such as the Kenya Association of
      Women Business Owners (KAWBO) and the Young Entrepreneurs Association).
      The participation of associations in ETPr programs is a notable distinction within
      the program landscape in Kenya as compared to the other case countries. It
      should be noted, however, that in several cases such programs are cofunded by
      development partners.
         The landscape of programs in Kenya indicates that ETPr programs tend to be
      short, often lasting only one day, to cater to the time limitations that practicing

entrepreneurs face. Because training is short, it often focuses on specific topics
related to business management, such as human resource strategies and export
regulations, and it provides only limited wrap-around services. There are also
examples of longer programs, some of which support longer-term goals such as
market integration (such as the Entrepreneurship and Handicraft for Exports
program and the Supplier Diversifying Program implemented by KAWBO), as
well as micro- and informal enterprises. For example, the Street MBA program
requires 80 hours of training, covering management, marketing, accounting,
business ethics and business English modules, plus an additional 60 hours of
­
computer training.
   Furthermore, ETPr programs in Kenya are often tailored to supporting certain
groups of entrepreneurs. This includes programs that provide training for micro-
finance clients, programs focused on supporting entrepreneurs in specific sectors
such as agriculture and information and communication technology, and pro-
grams supporting proximate groups of entrepreneurs, such as those running
informal enterprises, a category known in Kenya as jua kali enterprises. As an
example of the latter, the Micro and Small Enterprise Training and Technology
Project (MSETTP) provided training to jua kali entrepreneurs, people who in
many cases are master craft workers in traditional craft occupations (such as
metalwork and woodwork), running established enterprises that are often orga-
nized in clusters and business associations. MSETTP provided training to 35,000
such proprietors between 1994 and 2002, to support the development of the
jua kali sector through a training voucher program that subsidized skills and
management training.
   In Ghana, there are additional examples of a similar focus in ETPr programs
on supporting clusters of entrepreneurs, with attention to entrepreneurs in the
informal sector, as in Kenya. One program, run by the Ghana National Association
of Garages, provided training to 1,000 metalwork craft workers operating micro-
enterprises in the Suame Magazine, an area located in the city of Kumasi.
Another program aimed at supporting better business practices to improve
record keeping and boost sales as well as profits. An additional program in Ghana,
operated by the Millennium Development Authority, provided training through
farm-based organizations and loose associations of farmers across the country; it
was organized to enhance business practice as a means of supporting better crop
yields and improving farmers’ access to finance.
   The landscape of ETPr programs in Mozambique reflects a focus on support-
ing the success and growth of enterprises through market integration. Through
the Institute for Export Promotion (IPEX), the Ministry of Industry and
Commerce runs a program for enterprises with export potential. The program,
based in Nampula, serves members of the local association of handicraft produc-
ers, offering training in business management, quality control, marketing, and
establishing linkages between buyers and sellers. Three other programs explicitly
target growth-potential entrepreneurs: the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID)-Technoserve and Holland SNV programs provide
management training, mentorship, counseling, and access to finance in order to

      support value-chain integration of entrepreneurs producing cashews, peanuts,
      pepper, and honey. The PACDE program, run by Mozambique’s Ministry of
      Industry and Commerce, offers competitive funding for entrepreneurs looking to
      invest in their business and their managerial skills. Started in 2011, PACDE orga-
      nizes training from private service providers and covers 50 percent of the cost,
      with the business covering the rest. Most participating entrepreneurs run small
      to medium-sized enterprises.
         Program Outcomes
         While the available information on the outcomes of ETPr programs identi-
      fied in Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique is limited, it is comparatively rich
      compared to other types of EET programs. Apparent from the program land-
      scape is the focus on enhancing participants’ entrepreneurial capabilities, often
      in the form of improving business practices. The evaluation of the Ghana
      National Association of Garages program (Mano et al. 2011) found that train-
      ing fostered the adoption of recommend practices, such as improved record
      keeping, in comparison to a control group. The evaluation further indicated
      that the use of better business practices improved enterprise performance out-
      comes for trainees, including growth in profits and survivability. Similar find-
      ings emerged from the evaluation of the MSETTP program in Kenya targeting
      jua kali entrepreneurs (World Bank 2005), which indicated that compared to
      a control group, the training contributed to improved profits and sales for, and
      investment in, a significant proportion of trainees. Two rigorous evaluations of
      programs in Sub-Saharan Africa also reflect these findings. These programs
      include Promotion of Rural Initiative and Development Enterprises Limited in
      Tanzania (Bjorvatn and Tungodden 2010), a program targeting small-scale
      microcredit entrepreneurs, whose evaluation found gains in business knowl-
      edge as measured by multiple-choice tests given to participants; and the
      Women’s Entrepreneurship Program (WEP) program in South Africa (Botha,
      Nieman, and van Vuuren 2006), which demonstrated statistically significant
      gains across several skill areas, including business knowledge and business skills.
         While these results are promising, global EET research is unable to draw a
      conclusive line connecting enhanced knowledge, skills and practices, and the
      subsequent performance of an enterprise. A systematic review of evaluations of
      business training programs by McKenzie and Woodruff (2012) indicates that
      while EET can have modest effects on entrepreneurs’ decision to implement
      better business practices, few EET studies find significant impacts on profits,
      sales, or enterprise survivability. A meta-analysis by Cho and Honorati (2013)
      produces similar findings, demonstrating that improved business practices
      within an enterprise do not necessarily coincide with improved business per-
      formance. A particular issue cited within the available evaluations of ETPr
      programs in the case countries is the extent to which improved business prac-
      tices, transmitted through training programs, are sustained once the training
      programs are complete. Perhaps tellingly, participants in the Growth Oriented
      Entrepreneurs program in Kenya indicated that while they considered the

training valuable, there was a common sense that the program would benefit
with more follow-up (ILO 2010).
   In Relation to Global Practice:

•	 The role of business associations. A notable trend across all three of the case
   countries is the involvement of business associations in the provision of train-
   ing for practicing entrepreneurs. This trend is less pronounced within the
   global landscape of EET programs, but it may be particularly relevant to the
   context of the case countries. In some cases, the role of business associations
   appears to facilitate more training that is short-term or just-in-time, valuable
   to busy practicing entrepreneurs, while still offering a degree of continuity as
   well as built-in opportunities for mentoring and networking, characteristics
   supported by global EET evidence as well as valued by entrepreneurs. Further,
   by nature of being associated with these associations, such programs tend to
   have a sectoral focus as well as a broad interest in sectoral development, in-
   cluding facilitating opportunities for integrating entrepreneurs into value
   chains and markets.
•	 The market for training programs. Across the case countries, there are also in-
   stances showing how ETPr programs relate to a market of training programs
   for practicing entrepreneurs. The market for EET is a relatively unexplored
   aspect of global EET research, yet examples of how these markets are culti-
   vated and function emerge from the case studies. The MSETTP program in
   Kenya, which provided vouchers for jua kali entrepreneurs to put toward
   training programs, mentioned specifically in the evaluation how the vouch-
   ers spurred growth in the training market. Further, the experience of the
   PACDE program in Mozambique, which provides competitive funding for
   training expenses, also mentions the availability of a market of fee-based
   training for recipients to choose from. The concept of a market for ETPr
   programs introduces a number of potential dynamics, including how partici-
   pant behavior and outcomes function given the self-selection factors as well
   as the idea of participants having “skin in the game.” What remains less clear,
   though, is the extent to which these markets may exist only as responses to
             ­unding from intermediaries (such as through vouchers or com-
   available f
   petitive grants) as well as how responsive programs offerings may be to the
   demands of participants.

Linkages with finance institutions. Insights from global EET research suggest that
participants in ETPr programs experience improved access to loans. However,
this may say more about the sponsors of this type of training—commercial banks
and microfinance institutions, for example—than it says about the quality and
content of the training itself. The findings from the program landscape echo this
trend, with training often made compulsory by microfinance institutions to
improve the financial and credit management skills of borrowers as a means of
increasing their chances of success. In the case countries, one sees instances of this

      within microfinance group lending schemes, such as the Faulu Microfinance
      Bank Limited and Yehu programs in Kenya. Within these programs, credit offi-
      cers provide the training as part of the routine coaching of credit groups and use
      outcome indicators that are intertwined with loan outcomes, such as repayment
      rates and business survival.

Findings from the Field




A key question that each case study sought to inform is how to design entrepre-
neurial education and training (EET) programs so they effectively address the
relevant barriers to entrepreneurship in a given country. To address this, a series
of interviews and focus groups was conducted in each case-study country with
five target groups: program managers, successful entrepreneurs, failed entrepre-
neurs, potential entrepreneurs in EET programming, and practicing e­ ntrepreneurs
in entrepreneurship training (ET) programming. A standard question methodol-
ogy was used for each of the three countries to gather information about inter-
viewees’ general perception of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, success factors for
and barriers to entrepreneurship, and what works and what does not work in
EET programming.


Overview of Qualitative Fieldwork
A number of insights of interest emerge from the qualitative fieldwork, only a
portion of which are highlighted in this report. It should be noted first, however,
that overall most respondents appreciated the value of EET, while there are some
specific areas where countries differ in their general perceptions. For example,
respondents in Kenya saw EET as useful in preparing people for a business career.
This perception is more pronounced in relation to actual business skills and
technical competencies, but is less clear in relation to business attitudes and
mind-sets. In Ghana, most participants felt that EET programs were successful
in providing critical general business skills (management, marketing, sales,
human resources) and financial skills (accounting, budgeting, capital structure),
but less so in terms of thinking and problem solving skills and soft skills (com-
munication, leadership, presentation, negotiation). A common perception in
Mozambique was that some courses were too basic or repetitive or did not take
into account the experience and knowledge of participants in selecting and
grouping them.
   Furthermore, as the framework for this paper acknowledges, EET programs
are heterogeneous. Therefore, it must be noted that in the qualitative fieldwork,


Entrepreneurship Education and Training  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0278-2	     47
48	                                                                             Findings from the Field


      there were in some cases discernable differences in the perceived value of pro-
      gram dimensions that more closely related to either entrepreneurship education
      (EE) or entrepreneurship training (ET). For example, the value that respondents
      placed on supporting the development of socio-emotional skills early on is an
      insight generally more relevant to EE programs than to ET. On the other hand,
      respondents’ belief in the value of specific wrap-around services to address busi-
      ness environment constraints, such as access to finance, is generally more relevant
      to an ET audience than to secondary education students. These distinctions can-
      not not be ignored, but neither should they obscure the commonalties or how
      the qualitative fieldwork contributed to a multistakeholder and comprehensive
      perspective of what is valued within EET in the region. The qualitative fieldwork
      found that while distinctions exist depending on respondents’ experience and
      respective target group, EET programs operate in the case countries as a diverse
      landscape, one that is by no means as ordered or as linear as any framework
      would suggest. This presented a unique opportunity to capture several cross-
      cutting ideas about the value of EET programs with applicability across a range
      of program types.
         Thus, with these varying viewpoints in mind across countries as well as types
      of EET programming, this chapter profiles the key areas of commonality that
      emerged, which form useful insights for informing EET program design. The
      chapter first summarizes some of these cross-cutting themes across the case
      countries based on what respondents found to be valuable in EET programs and
      what needs improvement. Where relevant, the chapter also introduces findings
      from global EET research (as captured in Component One of this study) to
      support the insights of interviewees and focus group participants.1 Lastly, this
      ­
      chapter offers a set of promising practices in EET that have emerged from both
      the field work and existing research covering EET programs in Sub-Saharan
      Africa. Taken together, this information seeks to provide guidance as to how EET
      programs in the case countries can be brought closer in line with the needs of
      participants (as articulated by respondents) and emergent promising practices
      emanating from EET research.


      Building Entrepreneurial Mind-Sets
      Unanimously, respondents mentioned business acumen and personal attitudes as
      the most important factors in determining success and failure in business, includ-
      ing commitment, passion, humility, perseverance, integrity, hardworking, disci-
      pline, patience and resilience, loyalty toward the business, belief in success, and
      vision. Important in this context, and mentioned in particular by successful
      entrepreneurs, were traits related to long-term commitment (such as patience,
      vision, and perseverance) that would help entrepreneurs to overcome unavoid-
      able problems and economic slumps.
         Respondents in Kenya placed a particular emphasis on the socio-emotional
      skills of entrepreneurs that enable them to navigate these challenging environ-
      ments. In Ghana, six successful entrepreneurs also emphasized the importance of

                Entrepreneurship Education and Training  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0278-2
Findings from the Field	                                                                   49


these mind-sets in their success. Only in Mozambique was the role of mind-sets
in entrepreneurial success comparatively downplayed. There, potential and
established entrepreneurs alike mentioned that management skills were of para-
mount importance if their businesses were to be successful. The young and
potential entrepreneurs with technical backgrounds connected these skills with
the ability to develop business plans and access finance. Nonetheless, they still
felt that most EET programs focused more on general business and financial skills
and less on socio-emotional skills such as critical thinking and problem solving.
   These sets of socio-emotional skills are one key component of the entrepre-
neurial mind-sets that EET programs globally aim to promote. Yet, generally,
respondents who were classified as successful entrepreneurs tended to share a
comparatively less positive perception of the effectiveness of existing EET pro-
grams, particularly in Kenya and Ghana. Notably, however, their critique seemed
less grounded in the potential of EET programs than in the significant challenge
posed by the negative entrepreneurial mind-sets perceived to be endemic to their
local communities. They felt that these negative mind-sets were so ingrained that
it was unlikely that EET programs, particularly short-term programs, would be
able to combat them. Respondents across countries and respondent groups did
believe in the importance of exposure to entrepreneurial thinking and behavior
at a very young age. Most of the successful entrepreneurs who were interviewed
highlighted how important the experiences of entrepreneurial parents were for
their own development and determination. In Kenya, it is commonly perceived
that this exposure tends to differ between the major ethnic groups.
   However, respondents who participated in EET programs indicated that EET
programs are falling short of meeting this need. In Kenya, most respondents
appreciated the value of EET in preparing people for a business career, but less
in so in relation to building attitudes and mind-sets. In Ghana, respondents felt
that EET programs were successful in providing critical general business skills
(management, marketing, sales, human resources) and financial skills (account-
ing, budgeting, capital structure) but less so in terms of thinking and problem
solving skills, and other socio-emotional skills (communication, leadership, pre-
sentation, negotiation). In Mozambique, EET participants also believed there was
a critical gap in building socio-emotional skills such as communication, leader-
ship, and negotiation, as well as in critical thinking, decision-making, problem-
solving, and creative thinking skills.
   Despite calls for a focus on building entrepreneurial mind-sets, particularly on
developing socio-emotional skills, within the landscape of programs in the case
countries one finds few examples of this in local EET programs. This contrasts
with trends observed in entrepreneurship education for secondary education
students (EESE) research, which reflect an interest in promoting the founda-
tional skills and knowledge associated with entrepreneurship. Programs in the
case countries did tend to focus on building entrepreneurial awareness early on,
a fact that is consistent with findings from EESE programs globally. However,
there is little mention in programs of building skills such as self-efficacy, need for
achievement, risk-taking, social orientation, persistence, creativity, and locus of

      control. Evaluations of EESE programs provide some preliminary support for the
      role of secondary schools as a means for ensuring that young people possess
      knowledge, capabilities, and attitudes associated with entrepreneurship (Isaacs et
      al. 2007); as such, education could serve as the foundation for a more focused
      entrepreneurial training at a later point in time (ILO 2011).
          The idea that EET should provide early exposure to entrepreneurship finds
      support in broader entrepreneurship research that examines how early exposure
      in their parents’ businesses influences both the likelihood of pursuing
      entrepreneurship as a career and the subsequent performance of the children’s
      ­
      entrepreneurial ventures (Fairlie and Robb 2007). In this sense, EET, particularly
      programs targeting secondary education students or younger, can play a role in
      ­
      exposing a broader swath of young people to both the option and the desirability
      of the option to pursue entrepreneurship at a later time. Among the case coun-
      tries as well as globally, Kenya provides an example of a country that has aimed
      to institutionalize EET by mainstreaming it into the public education system. In
      turn, Kenya offers a promising example of how exposure to entrepreneurship can
      be scaled. But it should be noted that there is less robust support for how the
      Kenya experience relates to the other desired element of entrepreneurship mind-
      sets: developing relevant socio-emotional skills.
          In Kenya, entrepreneurship is part of the formal curriculum in all educational
      streams and levels apart from formal primary education, including technical and
      vocational education and training (TIVET) and nonformal education. In the
      formal TIVET system, EET is compulsory and examinable. Most EE programs in
      Kenya are implemented following the Know About Business (KAB) approach, a
      branded methodology for entrepreneurship education aimed at creating business
      awareness among students, which was developed and internationally dissemi-
      nated by the International Labour Organization (ILO). It clearly targets potential
      business start-ups and could also be labeled a “pre-start-up” program. KAB can
      be considered a teaching methodology that is hands-on and experimental and
      concentrates on practice learning (including role games and simulations).
          Kenya was one of the first countries where KAB was tested on a large scale.
      The program is currently very widespread in postsecondary TIVET institutions
      under the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology (though not
      yet in Youth Polytechnics under MOYAS), as well as in secondary schools and
      higher education institutions. KAB is used in regular EE classes, but also in extra-
      curricular activities, such as Entrepreneurship Clubs. The latter are frequent in
      TIVET institutions. The KAB methodology has been introduced in many of the
      teacher training schemes in Kenya. According to the regional KAB coordinator,
      most instructors in TIVET institutions have been trained in the methodology,
      and KAB is integrated in the curricula of the technical training institutes. The
      curricula are supposed to be regularly reviewed and revised, but the government
      often lacks the funds to conduct the revisions. As of this writing, a considerable
      revision is due based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Education
      from January 2012.

   In spite of the scale, at this point there is little systematic knowledge about the
effectiveness of the programs in terms of increasing entrepreneurial mind-sets.
Since tracer studies are not systematically conducted in the educational or
TIVET system, there is no follow-up and no monitoring of KAB, or indeed of EE
in general, in Kenyan schools, apart from assessments of learning achievements as
part of the general school exams, and quality assurance activities of the Ministry
of Education. There is no formal network of KAB teachers or any other structure
that would accommodate systematic evaluation of implementation and imple-
mentation results and process learning.


Affording Exposure to the Business Community
A common theme emerging from the interviews and focus groups was an
expressed desire for more exposure to the business community within EET pro-
grams. EET program participants suggested that EET was most valuable when
led by instructors with business and entrepreneurial experience. In Kenya, this
issue was prominent within discussions about entrepreneurship education pro-
grams delivered within postsecondary schools, particularly in the TIVET system.
In Mozambique, focus groups and interviews suggested a lack of well-qualified
teachers, even though teachers had been specially trained to deliver programs at
secondary and vocational/technical schools (but were not experienced entrepre-
neurs themselves).
   Respondents suggested that while to some extent an instructor can offset a
lack of business experience with pedagogical skills, an instructor with business
experience would be more valuable, since content tends to be too theoretical and
academic in nature. Lending support to the idea of more exposure to the busi-
ness community within EET, global research supplies examples of programs with
promising results using a blend of instruction by teachers and local members of
the business community. For example, the BizWorld program in the Netherlands
(Huber, Sloof, and van Praag 2012) includes a local business person as a volunteer
instructor, while in the NFTE program in the United States (Nakkula et al. 2004)
local business people serve as volunteer mentors for students to complement a
curricula led by a teacher.
   Further, respondents indicated that mentorship and coaching is a valued wrap-
around service that could also afford exposure to the business community. Across
the case countries, interviewees and focus groups shared the importance of sys-
tematic mentorship arrangements to offer support and advice as well as stories
from real-world experience that help internalize the entrepreneurial mind-sets
and concepts. Groups of potential and practicing entrepreneurs emphasized that
supportive arrangements should be sufficiently long (and structured) to coach a
participant through a start-up phase. There are examples of programs within
EET research that echo this emphasis on mentorship and coaching as a wrap-
around service. This is evident particularly within the INJAZ (Junior Achievement
for Youth in Middle East) program, which targets upper secondary education

      students across the Middle East (Reimers, Dyer, and Ortega 2012), as well as the
      Endeavor program, which targets high-growth-potential entrepreneurs in South
      Africa (IFC Monitor 2006) and the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of
      Technology (MEST) program in Ghana, which supports postgraduate students
      though two years of additional education and then another 18 months of training
      and support through the start-up phase.
         There were few identifiable examples of programs within the case countries
      that offered the exposure to the business community that local EET participants
      as well as failed and successful entrepreneurs indicated they desired. In their
      view, this was an essential component of an effective program, but current
      examples were few and far between. Interestingly, this appears to be something
      valued not only within programs targeting secondary educations students but all
      the way up to practicing entrepreneurs. However, whether the benefit comes in
      the form of role-modeling to combat negative perceptions of entrepreneurship,
      or timely and personalized business advice, focus groups acknowledged the chal-
      lenge of organizing and sustaining such services and opportunities. From a
      program design standpoint, using instructors from the business community or
      ­
      creating mentorship opportunities may be difficult, impractical or expensive to
      organize, particularly on a large scale.
         If the value of exposure is in part grounded in creating a network to support
      potential and practicing entrepreneurs, an example from Kenya offers an inter-
      esting example of how this networking can be brought to scale. The Kuza
      Biashara program uses incentives that create value for established entrepreneurs
      to enter into a network that potential entrepreneurs can benefit from. A large-
      scale program to empower existing business owners, Kuza Biashara offers ET
      alongside a large number of services, including website production, general busi-
      ness consulting (phone hotline), mentorship, and networking. With a member-
      ship of 50,000 across the country, an important focus of the program lies in
      mentorship between established members and emerging entrepreneurs, includ-
      ing in-person events with members of the business community. To support bring-
      ing this network together, subscribing members of the Kuza Biashara program are
      offered a subsidized mobile phone subscription by Safaricom, the leading mobile
      phone company in Kenya.


      Tailored and Practice-Oriented Programs
      Related to the respondents’ sentiments regarding the need for more exposure to
      the business community within EET programs, there was a desire for more tai-
      lored and practice-oriented approaches to EET across the case countries.
      Concerning programs being more tailored, in all three countries it was noted that
      participants come into EET programs with different goals and aspirations. Thus,
      one valued factor is designing programs to meet the specific needs of targeted
      participants. Many felt that the programs didn’t adequately assess the needs of
      the potential participants of the program and then tailor the curriculum of the
      program appropriately.

Findings from the Field	                                                                   53


   For example, a common perception in Mozambique was that some courses
were too basic or repetitive or did not take into account the experience and
knowledge of participants in selecting and grouping them. Another important
issue, mentioned in relation to programs aiming to support unemployed youth,
was the challenge of targeting this heterogeneous group, for example the difficul-
ties that arise when combining trainees with significantly different educational
backgrounds or of different ages. A better targeting of programs, as well as more
homogeneous group composition, was generally perceived to be important to
ensure productive learning. A proper needs assessment of participants was
emphasized, particularly in training programs, where the selection of participants
should be made based on their level of experience, their knowledge and skills, or
the business sector they belong to, so that plenary and group discussions would be
productive and interesting to all. It was emphasized that focusing on a particular
business sector of potential or practicing entrepreneurs can render EET more
homogenous. In Kenya, there appears to be a particular focus on supporting entre-
preneurs in specific sectors, such as agriculture and information technology.
   Respondents across the case countries also favored EET that is practice ori-
ented. This includes experiential learning methods such as simulations, mock
businesses, role playing games, and business plan competitions, as well as field
trips to enterprises to see business practices first-hand in real-life conditions. EET
research tends to support such approaches, which use “learning by doing” meth-
ods (ILO 2011). One particularly promising example of this is the Student
Training for Promoting Entrepreneurship program in Uganda, which employed a
rigorously tested “action-oriented” approach (Gielnick et al. forthcoming). The
program targeted nonbusiness undergraduate students at two Ugandan universi-
ties and was taught on a weekly basis over 12 weeks. Student Training for
Promoting Entrepreneurship emphasized a range of socio-emotional skills such
as leadership, the psychology of planning, personal initiative, persuasion, and
negotiation. Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the program was the use
of action-oriented courses, in which training content focused on action principles
and learning-by-doing, providing positive as well as negative action feedback, and
matching training tasks and real-world experiences.
   The Student Training for Promoting Entrepreneurship evaluation investigated
how action-based entrepreneurship training transmitted its effects on entrepre-
neurial action and creating a start-up. As a randomized controlled field experi-
ment, Student Training for Promoting Entrepreneurship evaluated the effective-
ness of an action based entrepreneurship training program on entrepreneurial
self-efficacy, action knowledge, action planning, entrepreneurial goals, entrepre-
neurial action, business opportunity identification, and business ownership.
Among the findings, the evaluation found that action knowledge was a central
factor promoting the initiation and maintenance of entrepreneurial activity.
Compared to the control group, the training increased the likelihood of starting
a business by 50 percent, and compared to the initial status in the training group
the training increased the likelihood of starting a business by 219 percent. The

      training also had a positive and significant effect on entrepreneurial self-efficacy,
      action knowledge, action planning, and business opportunity identification.
         With regard to content, respondents supported a focus on the use of practical
      examples of entrepreneurs’ experience, and they emphasized the core impor-
      tance of business and management practices. Solid “hard-core business skills” (as
      one young potential entrepreneur put it) are considered indispensable for success
      in business, and there was an emergent consensus that training in business man-
      agement is a must in any entrepreneurship ET program. The call for more
      emphasis on this front may offer the most promise for EET to fill the needs of
      potential and practicing entrepreneurs, with several evaluations indicating that
      EET can support the acquisition and implementation of better business practices
      in the region and beyond.
         From a program design standpoint, the call for more tailored and practice-
      oriented EET in the case countries presents some challenges as well as oppor-
      tunities. Notably, some respondents appeared to tie the concept of tailored
      training to class size. Participants within the public MOYAS-organized ET
      courses in Kenya, which usually operates with group sizes of up to several
      hundred, claimed that the sheer size of the classes prevented the course from
      ­
      meeting the needs of participants, including learner-centered presentations,
      interactive learning, discussions, and even the asking of questions. This raises
      concern for any large-scale EET intervention targeting large and heterogeneous
      populations such as unemployed youth.
         Overall, these desires for EET programs appear to stem from the broader
      critique that EET tends to be too theoretical in the eyes of respondents in the
      case countries. One innovation from Kenya, however, may offer an example of a
      promising mix of the desired tailored and practical training. Traditional
      ­
      apprenticeship training in Kenya’s informal jua kali sector is a common pre-
      employment training scheme targeting youth from poor households, mainly
      those with low educational attainment. It is primarily a technical skills training
      scheme, but being attached for months or years (depending on the contract
      between the master and apprentice) the trainee would usually be exposed to the
      real business environment and eventually learn sufficient entrepreneurial and
      business skills to become a self-employed craftsperson. Building on this appren-
      ticeship model, the Private Sector Internship and Training Program under the
      World Bank-funded Kenya Youth Empowerment Program (KYEP) organizes
      three-month internships of unemployed youths in selected jua kali enterprises.
      The scheme involves financial support for both the master craftsperson and the
      apprentice. To make the master craftspersons “better employers,” the program
      has facilitated initial ET for the participating jua kali operators comprising entre-
      preneurship, production, marketing, human resource development, and couch-
      ing/training practice. This complementary ET for the trainers is provided in the
      evening hours and is free for master craftspersons.

 Comprehensive Approaches to Address Business Environment
­Constraints
As described in chapter 3, entrepreneurs in each of the case countries face con-
siderable constraints to success from the business environment. Reflecting this
reality, respondents indicated that EET alone is typically not sufficient for
addressing the many factors that influence entrepreneurs’ fates. Prevalent among
these constraints across the case countries are issues related to access to—and the
high cost of—financing, as well as integration into markets through market infor-
mation, regulatory regimes, and infrastructure constraints. While acknowledging
that such factors are beyond the scope of what any single EET program can
address, respondents indicated that EET programs would benefit from greater
attention to the linkages between improvements in knowledge and skills and
other enterprise development mechanisms, including access to funding and mar-
ket intelligence. As part of a more comprehensive and long-term approach to
EET, programs can focus on equipping participants with skills and knowledge to
navigate specific constraints as well as include complementary wrap-around
services.
   Across the case countries, respondents believed the provision of wrap-around
services by EET programs to be the exception rather than the rule. For example,
in Mozambique, only a handful of identified programs (Manica High Polytechnic
School, Mozlink linkages program, USAID-Technoserve, SNV, IPEX) have com-
prehensive wrap-around and advisory services to support potential or existing
entrepreneurs. The lack of these wrap-around services was a source of dissatisfac-
tion for the majority of those interviewed. In Kenya, comparatively more
programs were wrapped with some complementary services, and these were
­
generally seen as essential to program success. In view of the significance of the
capital needs of young entrepreneurs, credit provision or at least facilitation of
access to finance were among the most valued wrap-around services. When
attendance in an EET program was a compulsory precondition for access to
credit (for example, in the case of KYBT Mombasa), this was often the driving
force for youth to participate. Business plan competitions, connected with cash
prizes for the best business ideas, were considered an ideal mechanism to link
access to finance with innovative efforts, creating an incentive for EET program
participants to perform.
   While wrap-around services were perceived to be generally valuable by
respondents, global EET research indicates that, like EET programs themselves,
such services represent a heterogeneous category and have shown mixed results.
Within the body of research, it is challenging to parse out and isolate the relative
value of a specific wrap-around service. Further, these additional elements of
EET programs can be expensive components of programs. Nonetheless, among
entrepreneurs in the case countries, and beyond facing a number of constraints,
the desire to complement knowledge and skill acquisition with additional sup-
ports is understandable. This may be reflected in the growing interest in the
region in incubator models that embed EET programs within a broader offering

56	                                                                             Findings from the Field


      of support services for potential entrepreneurs, such as office facilities, Internet
      access, and meeting space. While not necessarily offering direct access to finance,
      incubator models serve a segment of entrepreneurs by offering a sense of
      ­
      legitimacy and formality to a business concept, which can better position it for
      funding and growth.
         In Ghana, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology, also known as
      MEST, is attached to the MEST incubator program to provide an ecosystem of
      training, investment, and mentoring for potential technology entrepreneurs. The
      program selects potential entrepreneurs from a pool of university graduates to
      receive comprehensive training in business, computer programming, software
      development, product management, finance, marketing, sales, and leadership.
      After completing the two-year intensive program, participants pitch a concept
      for a business, and the winning teams receive seed funding and a place in the
      coworking space in the MEST incubator for 18 months to pursue their idea.
      There they are paired with advisors and mentors, who provide feedback and
      guidance in the business building process. While this program is only in the fifth
      year of a 10-year pilot, early signals are positive. For example, GenKey, a leading
      Ghanaian provider of biometric ID management solutions, recently acquired
      ClaimSync, one of the firms in MEST’s incubator, which provides software that
      offers hospitals and insurers a next-generation platform for digitizing and
      processing medical records and claims.
      ­
         A number of business incubators are also active in Kenya, where they have
      emerged in two waves: more general programs emerged during the first half of
      the last decade, and sector-specific incubators have emerged more recently, tar-
      geting tech or mobile phone-based business ideas, the arts, or green/climate
      technologies. The business incubators in Kenya tend to target the segment of
      growth-oriented business start-ups, that is, innovating university graduates,
      dynamic technology developers, and others. However, some incubators target
      unemployed youth (for example, the Urban Entrepreneurship Program, Vijanana
      Biashara), offering access free of charge (such as through iHub). Only a few
      incubators offer more structured and systematic start-up support, although it
      appears that the number of initiatives that aim at venturing into more compre-
      hensive service packages is growing. Growth Africa, a front-runner in the incuba-
      tor landscape in Kenya, provides structured business training and facilitates
      venture capital alongside the more common incubator services.
         Nonetheless, while incubator models by nature tend to be selective and target
      the high growth potential segment of entrepreneurs, there are also examples of
      promising programs that use comprehensive approaches while targeting other
      types of entrepreneurs. Programs from Mozambique and Kenya demonstrate
      comprehensive approaches to helping practicing entrepreneurs develop market
      and supply chain linkages. The International Financial Corporation (IFC) is sup-
      porting a three-year program in Mozambique to help small and medium enter-
      prises (SMEs) tap into opportunities from the country’s influx of large, capital-
      intensive industrial projects. Mozlink II (Mozambique SME Linkage Development
      Program), which began in October 2006, builds the entrepreneurial and

                Entrepreneurship Education and Training  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0278-2
Findings from the Field	                                                                   57


managerial competencies, as well as technical capabilities, of practicing entrepre-
neurs to effectively integrate with the supply chain needs of industrial projects.
The Mozlink program covers different features of coaching/mentoring, work-
shop training, and business networking as well as other services. Since it started,
it has generated the following results: (i) 75 SMEs participated in the capacity
building training, which focuses on management and technical skills improve-
ment, including a wellness component that ensures that SMEs are aware of best
practices to reduce the risk that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis, and malaria pose to their
employees and surrounding communities; (ii) more than 3,000 employees were
impacted by the program; (iii) more than US$20 million in revenues to SMEs
were generated by Mozlink corporate partners to date; (iv) International Finance
Corporation (IFC)’s partnership with local banks leveraged access to finance for
SMEs; and (v) in 2007–08, new contracts to local SMEs by Mozlink corporate
partners grew by 40 percent. While not a rigorous program evaluation, these
early results look promising.
   Value chain development represents a similar promising approach and has
been employed among dairy SMEs in Kenya. Value chain development programs
aim to systematically address identified challenges and barriers in a defined value
chain, in most cases agricultural. These include barriers related to the legal and
regulatory environment, production techniques, market failures, marketing, and
access to finance. The Business Service Market Development Project (BSMDP)
program, implemented through and in partnership with a number of Kenyan
organizations, including SITE and TechnoServe, addressed value chain constraints
by offering training to milk traders and producers. Initial outcomes from the
program were promising, with the sector as a whole experiencing growth and
evidence of reinvestment in businesses and improved business practices (Baiya
and Kithinji 2010).

Key Findings and Conclusion




This report summarizes findings from the three country case studies concerning
the context within which entrepreneurship education and training (EET) pro-
grams function, the EET program landscapes, and the perspectives of local EET
stakeholders. This concluding chapter first describes the key, high-level findings
from across the case studies. It then describes a set of insights intended to inform
EET policy and program dialog at multiple levels, guide investment decisions
that policymakers and government institutions may make with regard to EET
programs, and suggest further research in the EET realm.


Summary of Key Findings
All three case countries exhibit diverse entrepreneurial landscapes
This fact reflects the heterogeneous landscape of EET programs globally. In each
country, there are examples of both entrepreneurship education and training
programs targeting a range of groups that include secondary education students,
higher education students, and potential and practicing entrepreneurs. Further,
entrepreneurship training programs target both necessity-driven as well as
high-growth potential entrepreneurs, although a comparatively larger number of
­
programs target the former. The EET landscapes in Kenya and Ghana were
found to be particularly wide and differentiated. EET was found to be a com-
paratively newer phenomenon in Ghana and Mozambique compared to Kenya.

Programs in case countries tend to rely upon private
and international support
Across the three case countries, private, nongovernmental organizations and
development partners provide substantive support for EET programs. In Kenya,
this trend was most pronounced, with private organizations dominating the EET
landscape. Both in terms of implementation and in funding, there is a high level
of involvement by development partners, nongovernmental organizations, and
multinational firms. A comparatively larger amount of identified programs in

      Ghana and Mozambique involve public entities, but even there most were found
      to receive some form of donor or nongovernmental organization support.

      There is little coordination across the EET efforts in the case countries
      The case studies indicate that EET programs in the case countries are fragment-
      ed, and there is little evidence of a specific strategy for entrepreneurship promo-
      tion at the regional or national level. Even in the context of Kenya, where EE has
      been notably integrated within the secondary and postsecondary education sys-
      tem, there is little connection or coordination between programs at these levels.
      Interviewees and focus group respondents indicated that there is a strong need
      to promote dialog among EET programs and operators, an issue that has been
      raised within global EET research as well.

      Program landscapes suggest that EET is designed to respond
      to key contextual challenges
      Global EET research indicates that programs seek to address a number of press-
      ing economic imperatives, ranging from employment creation to poverty reduc-
      tion and innovation. In the case countries, EET was found to be particularly
      concerned with employment creation, with each country facing considerably
      severe youth unemployment challenges. However, there is little information to
      support the role of EET programs in addressing this challenge through the cre-
      ation of either self-employment or the establishment of enterprises with growth
      and formal employment potential. There is also evidence that EET is viewed in
      the case countries as a means of addressing poverty within vulnerable popula-
      tions through income generation. In Mozambique, the emergence of EET pro-
      grams coincided with the country’s recovery from the civil war as a means of
      generating income for former combatants as well as refugee populations. There
      are additional examples of EET programs in Ghana and Kenya targeting the
      substantial sector of necessity-driven, often informal enterprises to support
      improved business practices. Global EET research indicates that programs have
      promise to support both income generation and improved business practice
      adoption in certain contexts.

      There is a space between what EET programs practice
      and what local EET stakeholders value
      Examining the identified EET programs and the insights of local EET stakehold-
      ers, including both successful and failed entrepreneurs and EET program partici-
      pants, one finds a notable gap between what the stakeholders demands and the
      programs deliver.

      •	 Building mind-sets. EET stakeholders indicate that amid negative cultural
         ­
         biases toward entrepreneurs and challenging entrepreneurship environments,
         there is a need to focus on building entrepreneurial awareness and
         socio-emotional skills to navigate this context. While identified EET programs
         ­

Key Findings and Conclusion	                                                               61


   did seek to build awareness of entrepreneurship as an option, little informa-
   tion was found about EET programs in case countries looking to develop so-
   cio-emotional skills associated with entrepreneurship, such as critical thinking
   and self-efficacy. This absence was most notable among programs targeting
   secondary and higher education students. Programs in case counties instead
   tend to focus on building business and management skills, entrepreneurial
   capabilities that, while valued, in the eyes of program participants are overly
   theoretical and academic in nature.
•	 Exposure to the business community. EET stakeholders across the case coun-
   tries indicated a desire for exposure to the business community and entrepre-
   neurs within EET programs. This exposure was desired across EET program
   characteristics, including in instructors (as primary instructors with experi-
   ence or as joint instructors), in program content and methods (such as guest
   lectures, site visits, narrative stories, and experiences of entrepreneurs), and
   within wrap-around services (as mentors or through networking opportuni-
   ties). Despite this desire, there are few identified programs that prioritize
   exposure to entrepreneurs or the business community. This, however, is a
   broader deficit cited within global EET research as well, and there are also
   examples across program types of promising programs that prioritize this
   ­exposure.
•	 Tailored and practice-oriented programs. Local EET stakeholders that partici-
    pated in EET programs suggested that many programs tended to mix large,
    heterogeneous groups of participants of varying ages and educational back-
    grounds. This critique was particularly prevalent among those participating in
    large-scale programs aimed to address youth unemployment. Respondents
    indicated that these programs were unable to address the varying needs of
    their participants and that programs should conduct needs assessments better
    to ascertain how best to serve various groups. This feedback was discouraging
    in light of the number of programs across the case countries that aim to com-
    bat youth unemployment. In terms of the content, participants felt that pro-
    grams were overly theoretical and that they would have benefited from more
    hands-on, practical training. Relatedly, among the programs receiving more
    positive feedback are those that are tailored to the needs of entrepreneurs in
    particular sectors. There are examples of several programs in the case coun-
    tries that are sponsored (at least in part) by business associations, and these
    seemed to be comparatively well received.
•	 Comprehensive approaches to address business environment constraints and pro-
    vide continued support. An analysis of the context in each of the case counties
    indicates that entrepreneurs in each country face a challenging business envi-
    ronment for starting and sustaining successful enterprises. The insights from
    local EET stakeholders tended to support this characterization of the environ-
    ment. In turn, stakeholders desired programs that could help overcome these
    barriers in a comprehensive way, in particular by providing avenues for
    accessing finance—one of the oft cited barriers—as well as access to markets.

        There are promising examples of programs in the case countries that offer
        relevant wrap-around services, and in some cases entrepreneurship training is
        a component of broader efforts aimed at value chain and market integration,
        or in the form of an incubator model. Another form of desired wrap-around
        services concerns connections with mentors, coaches, or (at a minimum) fol-
        low-up services to ensure that training can take hold. In addition, some pro-
        grams are directly sponsored by or required on the part of microfinance or
        commercial banking institutions. On the whole, however, respondents felt
        that more comprehensive efforts were needed to render EET more respon-
        sive to the complexity of local needs as opposed to short, often one-off train-
        ing programs.

      Information on the outcomes for identified programs in case
      countries is scarce
      A low level of monitoring and evaluation in the EET environment is prevalent in
      all three case study countries. Where evaluation occurs at all, it is considered suf-
      ficient to trace the performance of beneficiaries in a rather informal way, and
      more often than not written reports on the outcomes of the assessments are not
      available. Many of the programs in which rigorous evaluation is defined as a key
      component are still new and ongoing, so evaluations have still not been con-
      ducted or completed. Without systematic and available evaluations of existing
      programs, the case studies’ analysis of the programs and approaches relied mainly
      on the interviews that were conducted with program managers, beneficiaries and
      entrepreneurs. In turn, information on the outcomes for programs within the
      case countries was scarce and largely anecdotal, based on described program
      objectives. This scarcity, however, is not limited to the case countries; and has
      been found to be the norm across the global EET landscape.

      Information on the costs for identified programs in case
      countries is scarce
      Across the case countries, there is a paucity of information on the costs and
      financing of EET programs. This finding is consistent with the broader lack of
      information on costs and financing of EET programs in global EET research. In
      several cases, implementing organizations considered this information to be pro-
      prietary in nature. In some cases, particularly within EESE and EEHE programs,
      the costs of EET programs are a function of the institutions responsible for
      implementation as well as associated principles of cost recovery. In turn, there is
      little available insight into the cost-effectiveness, suggesting that policy makers
      and program designers alike should be wary of how expensive EET interventions
      can be, and the associated implications this has for both scale and relative poten-
      tial to offer robust wraparound services.

Implications for Program Design and Policy
In light of the aforementioned findings, the case studies do provide some les-
sons for bringing the EET programs closer to the needs of existing, new, or would-­
be-entrepreneurs both within the countries of inquiry as well as beyond.
Generally, for policymakers and program managers, there are two separate but
related questions:

•	 What can be done to strengthen broader interventions, targeting large seg-
   ments of the population?
•	 What can be done to strengthen focused interventions across the spectrum of
   targeted participants—from unemployed youth and marginalized women to
   highly educated high growth potential entrepreneurs?

Further, cutting across programs there is a need for improved monitoring and
evaluation to determine what works best in particular contexts.

For the broader interventions, an emphasis on building foundational
skills and mind-sets is needed
One finding that came up in various contexts across the case studies is the lack
of appropriate mechanisms to support entrepreneurship attitudes starting at an
early age. There is an apparent need to combat negative perceptions to establish
entrepreneurship as a respected (even attractive) career option. Mind-set chang-
es in the wider society are essential to fundamentally change attitudes toward
entrepreneurship among the people of each country, and this will require more
far-reaching interventions that go beyond individual EET programs. Such an
approach could provide exposure to positive role models of entrepreneurship
among a broader swath of the population, particularly in countries where entre-
preneurship is often associated with the struggles of the self-employed in the
informal sectors. Furthermore, a secondary-school entrepreneurship education
program’s objectives and outcomes may include the provision of socio-emotional
skills, described as critical by stakeholders, who see these skills as essential for
navigating challenging business environments over a lifetime. Among programs
targeting secondary education students, the context demands some government
role, at least within public institutions or institutions using national curricula.
The broader applicability of socio-emotional skills means such programs would
contribute toward a general public good and, therefore, may in turn justify some
form of government intervention and support.
   For focused interventions, greater clarity is needed regarding both target groups and
program objectives to foster more tailored programs.
   A key finding from the case studies is that programs often bring together large,
heterogeneous groups of individuals that render it challenging to meet partici-
pants’ diverse needs. Clarity about the specific target group, for example whether
a program is targeting necessity-driven or high-growth-potential practicing
entrepreneurs, and clarity about their associated characteristics (age, educational
­
background) should inform program design. This can help identify which

64	                                                                        Key Findings and Conclusion


      wrap-around services are most appropriate and desired, based on an assessment
      of the target group’s needs. It can also inform how best to blend content to
      achieve the right balance of business and management training with hands-on or
      sector-oriented knowledge. It can inform how programs are delivered, for exam-
      ple whether they are held close to where target groups are living and operating,
      and whether they are delivered by experienced trainers or teachers (ideally expe-
      rienced entrepreneurs) who speak the language of the beneficiaries. Further, it
      can inform the duration of training—with some programs, for example, needing
      to be adjusted to meet the time constraints of practicing entrepreneurs. Examples
      of this last type from the case countries are training programs run by business
      associations, providing short just-in-time training to entrepreneurs while also
      offering a sustainable support network. From a policy standpoint, however, it
      must be acknowledged that such tailored programs can be expensive, and the
      cost/benefit use of public resources should be considered in light of other, poten-
      tially more appropriate policy options to support particular groups of potential
      and practicing entrepreneurs in light of the desired policy objectives.
          For focused interventions, there is need for more, careful information as to how EET
      can best support high-growth potential entrepreneurs.
          In the case countries, the lack of modern wage jobs and high structural
      unemployment, particularly for youth, contribute to the large percentage of
      individuals employed in each countries informal sector. For many, necessity-
      driven entrepreneurship in the informal sector is an option of last resort; while
      at best, for those with potential to grow their enterprises, the lack of formaliza-
      tion fosters insecurity as well as legal and financial impediments to growth.
      Reflecting this challenge, relatively few programs in the case countries focus on
      supporting potential high growth entrepreneurs, despite the potential spill-
      overs for fostering wage employment. There are examples of incubator models
      in the case countries that target high-growth-potential individuals, but these
      programs are selective and relatively little is yet known about how their train-
      ing components contribute to their ­           participants’ subsequent decisions to
      launch enterprises and succeed as entrepreneurs. Further, such programs for
      high-growth potential entrepreneurs merit f          ­urther discussion about govern-
      ment involvement. While the objectives of these programs also tend to align
      with the interest of governments—including economic spillovers such as
      employment and innovation—these programs tend to target better educated
      and better-off individuals, groups for which there is limited rationale for gov-
      ernment support. Furthermore, the government role with these sorts of pro-
      grams is complicated by the perception of “picking winners” as well as practical
      limitations in identifying “the right” participants, roles that the market and
      investors are likely better equipped to fill. Thus, for programs targeting high-
      growth-potential entrepreneurs, the government’s role ought to be limited to
      creating the space for the financing, providing private entities to train, such as
      business associations, fostering a business environment that enables entrepre-
      neurial activity, including business registration, access to finance, and accom-
      modative tax policies.

   For all programs, more monitoring and evaluation of EET programs is needed to
inform what works across various contexts.
   The case studies indicate that to inform the effectiveness of EET interven-
tions, there is a clear need to design programs with specific measurable goals to
assess. Data need to be collected at baseline and in follow-ups. At a minimum,
there should be a control group and one or more treatment groups. Ideally, inter-
ventions would include randomized controlled trials in their designs so that
impacts could be measured. These steps would allow a more rigorous evaluation
of effectiveness and impact and should drive better investments and program
design going forward. While most EET programs attempt at least some rudimen-
tary program evaluation to assess learning and competencies acquired, postpro-
gram follow-up and rigorous evaluation methods are for the most part absent in
the overall program design in all three case study countries (and beyond). While
this lack of rigor in program evaluation is troubling, it also provides an opportu-
nity to create an agenda for best practices in program design and evaluation going
forward. Such information would offer program designers and policymakers an
opportunity to understand what choices are most common for particular target
groups, particular outcomes, and within particular contexts.
   Finally, the case studies produced a set of specific recommendations that flowed
specifically from the perspectives of local EET stakeholders. These recommendations
were directed at EET providers in the case countries:

•	 Conduct a thorough needs assessment during the selection of program par-
    ticipants and group participants according to their level of experience, their
    knowledge and skills, and the business sector they represent. Tailor the level
    of training and content based on the participants’ needs assessments and
    ­selection.
•	 Improve the quality of trainers in programs by selecting individuals with
    ­
    actual business and entrepreneurship experience and providing them with
    opportunities to take part in yearly training-of-trainers courses aimed at up-
    dating training methodology and technical content.
•	 Establish a dialog with other EET providers in your region to engage in stra-
   tegic collaboration regarding the provision of training and wrap-around
   ­services.
•	 Make the entrepreneurship education or training curriculum practical and
   experiential, involving local entrepreneurs and business owners as guest
   lecturers and mentors.
   ­
•	 Highlight and connect participants with successful entrepreneurs to serve as
   role models within all programs.


Conclusion
The case studies indicate that potential and practicing entrepreneurs in Ghana,
Kenya, and Mozambique have reason for optimism with regard to the expan-
sion of entrepreneurial opportunity. All three countries are experiencing

      periods of sustained economic growth, a diversifying private sector, and a less
      capital-intensive services sector becoming an increasingly dominant contribu-
      tor to each country’s economy. Nonetheless, entrepreneurs in the case coun-
      tries indicated that they face considerable barriers to success. Several of these
      cited barriers, including corruption, bureaucratic red-tape, and lack of access to
      finance, are beyond the scope of EET interventions, which aim to support
      entrepreneurship through the provision of knowledge and skills. In turn, the
      case studies indicate that EET is not viewed, nor should it be viewed, as a pana-
      cea to these challenges. However, the case studies indicate that insufficient
      knowledge and skills are a persistent barrier for potential and practicing entre-
      preneurs alike and that EET can be of value for entrepreneurs of all types in
      the near and medium term, particularly for strengthening business practices,
      integrating into new markets, and building networks. Further, over the long
      term, increasing awareness of entrepreneurship early on through the education
      system is viewed as a means of developing foundational, transferable socio-
      emotional skills, combating negative perceptions, and leveling the playing field
      by offering exposure to entrepreneurship as a means of economic mobility for
      those without it through parents and peers.
         The case studies summarized in this report are designed to inform a broader
      understanding of how EET programs are contributing to addressing entrepre-
      neurial barriers in three particular countries. This has enabled a unique contex-
      tualized look at EET that complements global research as well as individual
      evaluations at specific programs. The countries’ pressing economic imperatives,
      ranging from employment creation to poverty reduction and innovation, are
      national in scope, and EET programs, while rarely coordinated within a country,
      do operate within a national and regional context. Thus, looking at the EET
      landscape from this perspective can provide useful insights for policymakers and
      program designers alike. The findings from the case studies, which identify a
      range of EET programs within each of the case countries, also suggest that there
      is a need for more dialogue among EET programs and operators, not only to
      avoid duplication and the inefficient use of resources, but also to promote cross-
      program learning regarding emerging practices. Such information, through asso-
      ciated efforts to measure the outcomes of EET programs, will contribute to the
      growing national, regional, and global understanding of the value of EET in light
      of its promise to meet ambitious objectives.

Environmental Benefits Statement
The World Bank is committed to reducing its environmental footprint. In support
of this commitment, the Publishing and Knowledge Division leverages electronic
publishing options and print-on-demand technology, which is located in regional
hubs worldwide. Together, these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and
shipping distances decreased, resulting in reduced paper consumption, chemical
use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.
   The Publishing and Knowledge Division follows the recommended standards
for paper use set by the Green Press Initiative. Whenever possible, books are
printed on 50 percent to 100 percent postconsumer recycled paper, and at least
50 percent of the fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using
Totally Chlorine Free (TCF), Processed Chlorine Free (PCF), or Enhanced
Elemental Chlorine Free (EECF) processes.
   More information about the Bank’s environmental philosophy can be found
