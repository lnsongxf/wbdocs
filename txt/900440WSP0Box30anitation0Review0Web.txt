WSP’s Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is working with governments and the local private sector
to develop the knowledge needed to scale up rural sanitation for the poor. The programmatic
approach combines Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), behavior change communication,
and sanitation marketing to generate sanitation demand and build up the supply of sanitation
products and services at scale. In addition, WSP works with local and national governments
and the local private sector to strengthen the enabling environment—including institutional,
regulatory, ﬁnancial, service-delivery, and monitoring capacities—to achieve change that is
sustainable. Starting in India, Indonesia, and Tanzania in 2006, Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is
currently being implemented in more than a dozen countries. For more information, please visit

This Working Paper is one in a series of knowledge products designed to showcase project
ﬁndings, assessments, and lessons learned through WSP’s Scaling Up Rural Sanitation
initiatives. This paper is conceived as a work in progress to encourage the exchange of
ideas about development issues. For more information please email Kathryn O’Connell at

WSP is a multi-donor partnership created in 1978 and administered by the World Bank to support poor
people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSP’s donors
include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Luxembourg,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank.

   BOX 2: STUDY LIMITATIONS
        • Different survey methodologies and study instruments were used in the formative research studies, mak-
          ing comparison between countries more challenging.
        • Some research topics were explored in detail in some studies and not covered in others.
        • The deﬁnition of ownership of different latrine types varied by study. For example, in East Java, respon-
          dents were categorized as improved or unimproved latrine owners, sharers, or open defecators; whereas
          in Cambodia, respondents were classiﬁed by latrine ownership versus no ownership.
        • The review is based on summary reports, not the original data. Hence, ﬁndings have been ﬁltered and
          interpreted by the authors of the reports. In particular, qualitative research has been translated, which may
          have led to lost insight or bias.
        • Tables of frequencies or means were commonly presented in reports, but statistical comparisons between
          target groups were rarer.
        • Although many of the surveys used Likert scales to address attitudes toward different concepts, the data
          were not analyzed in a consistent manner, making interpretations more challenging.
        • Not all of the studies used the SaniFOAM framework as a means to structure the survey questionnaires or
          present ﬁndings. Some of the reports retroﬁtted results to the framework, given that the studies predated
          the SaniFOAM framework.

   BOX 3: PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES: WHAT DO HOUSEHOLDS CONSIDER AN IDEAL LATRINE?
   Attributes of an ideal latrine include:
       • durability
       • privacy
       • cleanliness and being easy to clean
       • convenience
       • affordability
       • ease of construction

   For example, “privacy” is cited as an ideal attribute by 46 percent of households in Bihar, 67 percent in Rajasthan,
   and 80 percent in Meghalaya. Cleanliness is cited as the most important attribute in Kenya.

   BOX 4: DO HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCURATE PRICE PERCEPTIONS OF LATRINES?
   The perception of the price of a latrine varies because open defecators have, in some cases, never owned, built,
   or even used a latrine, and owners of unimproved latrines have little experience with upgrading their facilities,
   although they might have looked at options for latrine upgrades. Notably, open defecators perceive latrines as
   much more expensive than do households that own latrines, but may own household items that cost as much as
   a latrine. For example, in Kenya, 90 percent of households own a radio, which costs approximately the same as
   building a latrine (WSP et al. 2013, 2).

   Generally, people are unaware of a range of affordable latrine options. Ensuring that households have accurate
   perceptions of costs associated with latrine purchases and upgrades may help to address the perceived afford-

   BOX 5: THE ROLE OF IMPORTANT FAMILY EVENTS AS A MEANS TO RAISE LATRINE PRIORITY
   Events such as a wedding, welcoming guests, and in-laws joining families may raise the priority of a home latrine
   above other demands on household resources. For example, in Bihar, latrine owners are more likely to agree that
   latrines are constructed when visiting children refuse to defecate in the open. Other events include sudden sick-
   ness, hosting an important social gathering, or an extended visit from a relative from the city or abroad. It may be
   that these events raise priority of latrines above other household demands and serve to promote a move up the
   sanitation ladder.

   BOX 6: EXAMPLES OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS INFLUENCING LATRINE OWNERSHIP AND
   OPEN DEFECATION

   Temporal and Seasonal Factors
   Open defecation may be more frequent during certain times of the year:
     • At night, in cases where latrines are located further from the household and security is a concern or to
        allow for more privacy.
     • During work or when travelling, when access to latrines is limited, and where paddy ﬁelds are noted as a
        place for open defecation.

   Open defecation or latrine acquisition may vary by season, as seen in these examples:
     • In Sub-Saharan Africa countries, open defecation is more commonly practiced during the rainy season,
        as latrines are cited as overfull, washed away, or collapsed. Heavy rains prevent latrines from being built,
        rebuilt, or repaired.
     • During the dry season in East Java, rivers dry up and no longer provide an option to allow feces to ﬂoat
        away, so alternatives to open defecation are sought.

   Land Access and Tenure
   Sufﬁcient access to land and space to build latrines is noted as an important driver. In situations where latrines
   are overfull or have collapsed, it is impracticable or impossible to construct another latrine given insufﬁcient land
   space. Some examples include:
       • In Meghalaya and East Java, 22 percent of open defecators report that they lack space to build a latrine.
       • In East Java, many report insufﬁcient land to make improvements, such as space for a septic tank.

   Not owning one’s house or land can also act as a disincentive to construct a latrine, as mentioned by open
   defecators:
      • Meghalaya (16 percent)
      • Bihar (15 percent)

   Soil Proﬁle
   Soil proﬁles, such as rocky or steep landscapes, pose a challenge to building latrines, as most commonly noted
   in East African countries and East Java. In some instances, water is too close to the surface, making it impossible
   to dig sufﬁciently deep pits. In cases where latrines have collapsed or are no longer functioning, households often
   report that they do not have the ability to rebuild latrines, due to ﬂooding of land and soil quality, as illustrated by
   this participant from an in-depth interview:

       In this center we have one problem. We cannot dig pits because of the rocks we have here. You can only dig
       up to four feet and then you reach the rocks. If you don’t plan properly here you cannot dig a pit of 25 feet.

        Access to Water Sources
        A sufﬁcient water supply for ﬂushing away waste and latrine cleaning is seen is an integral part of the latrine
        decision-making process, and will also inﬂuence the type of latrine built. Scarce water supply, along with the
        perception that latrines consume a lot of water, can pose a barrier to building a latrine and prevent usage. For
        example, in Rajasthan, one in four households cited lack of water as a reason for open defecation. In contrast,
        in some areas where water supply is not an issue, having a river or water stream nearby is seen as an easy and
        inexpensive means to dispose of waste, such as in East Java (upper photo) and Peru (lower photo). Photo credit:

     What Inﬂuences Open Defecation and Latrine Ownership in Rural Households?: Findings from a Global Review   Other Findings




        BOX 7: THE INFLUENCE OF SANCTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT, BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES, AND VALUES
        ON RURAL SANITATION BEHAVIORS
        Sanctions and Enforcement
        In certain situations, sanitation behaviors may be inﬂuenced by law enforcement and other regulations as men-
        tioned in Tanzania, and the three Indian states. For example,
            • In Tanzania, there is pressure from district ofﬁcials to replace latrines that are full.
            • In Meghalaya, one of the main reasons for building a latrine is stringent village rules.
            • In Bihar, latrine owners are more likely to agree that sanctions are in place and that there are rules and
               penalties to stop open defecation.

        Beliefs and Attitudes
        There exist a number of beliefs and attitudes toward open defecation that serve to deter the extent to which feces
        are perceived as harmful to the environment and the concept of human waste as a source of pollution, but only
        found as relevant in Bihar, East Java and Kenya. For example,
            • In Bihar, farmers believe that feces are beneﬁcial for farming, as it will increase fertility of the land and im-
               prove and increase crop production.
            • In East Java, respondents discuss how open defecation into a river is not harmful, given there is the belief
               that ﬁsh eat their waste or that feces can serve as fertilizer.

        These beliefs are more salient among open defecators, and may serve as psychological refuges that help to jus-
        tify their behavior.

        Values
        Only a few of the reports cite the importance of values: Peru, East Java, and Tanzania. In these countries, latrine
        ownership is associated with a number of positive family values: being clean, being health conscious, and being
        good parents and welcoming hosts. For example:
           • In Peru and East Java, having a sanitation facility at home represents modernity and progress.
           • In Tanzania, “modernity” is the most common reason for households to improve existing latrine.

    BOX 8: REGIONAL VARIATIONS REGARDING THE RELEVANCE OF DIFFERENT SANIFOAM FACTORS
   Drivers: Perceptions that latrines provide safety and security
   The concept of safety and security is both a motivator and a deterrent for improved sanitation, and there are dif-
   ferences between countries and regions in terms of where open-defecation behavior takes place and the type of
   latrine.

   For example, as a motivator for latrine acquisition:
      • There is fear of being dragged away by strong currents, especially for children, or that people can be bitten
         or attacked by wild animals. It is also perceived as dangerous when the ground is muddy.
      • A main reason for building a latrine is “improved security for women and children,” as mentioned by 69
         percent of latrine owners in Rajasthan, 63 percent in Bihar, and 50 percent in Meghalaya.

   For example, as a barrier to latrine acquisition and use:
      • In Kenya, households report that they are afraid to use the latrine because of the distance/proximity of the
         latrine to their house, and would rather use ﬂying toilets at nighttime. There is a fear that people will be
         bitten or attacked by wild animals.
      • Pit latrines are considered dangerous and in poor condition, especially after rains. Consequently, people
         report that they would prefer to defecate in the open rather than risk falling into a sinking hole or a latrine
         collapsing.

   The notion of latrines as being unsafe is in relation to pit latrines. A key trigger to upgrading latrines is around the
   notion that “improved latrines” are durable and safe. Improved safety is also described as one of the most com-
   mon reasons for improving an existing latrine. As such, the conﬂicting information regarding the role of safety in

   BOX 9: EXAMPLES OF PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FROM THE REVIEW
        • Open defecation is a common behavior and is sustained through local cultural norms. According to the
          SaniFOAM framework, it is a social norm that is traditional and practiced since childhood, and in some
          regions, such as in India and East Java, further fostered by designated sites allocated for open defecation.
          Although changing actual normal practice may be a long and slow process, a ﬁrst step may be changing
          perceived norms. For example, regularly portraying latrine usage in mass media, in TV ads, or on enter-
          tainment shows can create the impression of normality. Campaigns should endeavor to give high visibility
          to latrine usage as a social norm by creating the illusion that “everyone’s doing it,” complementing efforts
          through Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), and other triggering approaches.
        • There is a clear association between one’s position on the sanitation ladder and socioeconomic status.
          Wealthier people are more likely to own and use improved latrines. However, many believe that latrines are
          too expensive to purchase and install. Improving knowledge around the actual cost of latrines and com-
          paring the costs with other household items can serve to encourage latrine acquisition.
        • Similarly, messages around the affordability of latrines should be coupled with descriptions about positive
          latrine attributes that stress that improved latrines are safe, durable, and hygienic. This can also help to
          encourage use and acquisition.
        • Events such as a wedding or welcoming guests may raise the priority of a home latrine above other de-
          mands on household resources, and this can serve to promote latrine acquisition. As such, promoting
          latrine purchases or improvements prior to large annual holidays that involve visits from family members
          from other parts of the country, or other large social gatherings or ceremonies (such as religious festivals
          or weddings), may serve to promote latrine acquisition prior to these events. This could also be comple-
          mented with messaging that presents latrine-owning families as welcoming and good hosts.
        • Not owning one’s house or land can also act as a disincentive to construct a latrine. In areas where renting
          is more common, landlords may be considered as a target population for promoting latrines. Demand-
          creation strategies could stress the value that latrine ownership could add to their property.
        • Sociodemographic and other environmental characteristics, such as access to water, perceptions of soil
          quality, and seasonal and temporal factors, provide important contextual information for sanitation be-
          haviors. Changing physical factors on a large scale, such as the availability of water, requires long-term
          sustained investment, which is typically beyond the ability of a sanitation campaign to deliver. However,
          given variations between countries and regions, these factors should be noted as a means to help tailor
          and target behavior change interventions.
