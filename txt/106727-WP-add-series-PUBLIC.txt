Acknowledgments
The Community Slum Sanitation Practitioners’ Guide has evolved over the years, and has had the benefit of many contributors at
various stages.

Most importantly, the pioneers – the leaders and implementers of these innovative initiatives in different cities – who have been
extremely patient with repeated queries, and magnanimous with making time for discussions, and for making documents, photos,
and other resources available for this Guide.

These include but are not restricted to:

Ahmedabad: Bijal Bhatt (MHT, Ahmedabad); and officials from Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
Bhopal: Anup Sahai (Aarambh, Bhopal) and officials from Bhopal Municipal Corporation;
Kalyani/Kolkata: Shantanu Jha (Former Chairman, and officials from Kalyani Municipal Council); Kamal Kar (CLTS Foundation),
Shibani Goswami (KUSP, Kolkata);
Mumbai: Rajeev Jalota (AMC, MCGM), Jokin Arputhum, Sheela Patel, Celine D’Cruz and others (NSDF/SPARC, Mumbai), Anand
Jagtap (OSD, SSP, MCGM) and members and officials from Pratha and MCGM;
Pune; Pratima Joshi (Shelter Associates, Pune), and officials from Pune Municipal Corporation; and
Trichy: D. Damodaran and Geetha Jegan (Gramalaya, Trichy), and officials from Trichy City Corporation.

In addition, numerous other officers, community leaders and members of organizations, local bodies, and slum communities have
contributed to this Guide.

This work started with the support of the Cities Alliance under the guidance of Junaid Ahmad (World Bank, formerly WSP). Soma
Ghosh Moulik (World Bank, formerly WSP), Deepak Sanan (Additional Chief Secretary, Government of Himachal Pradesh, formerly
WSP) and Cathy Revels (formerly WSP and World Bank), in discussion with the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India
and selected NGO partners (especially Sheela Patel and Celine D’Cruz of SPARC), had provided the initial conceptualization and
direction to a note on how to ensure sanitation services for slum dwellers. Pronita Chakraborti (formerly WSP), Sara Almqvist (formerly
WSP), and Vivek Raman (World Bank, formerly WSP) assisted with taking the research efforts forward to develop this further. This
work was supported by the Ministry of Urban Development Officers, including M. Rajamani, A.K. Mehta and M. Ramachandran.
The Task Team Leader for supervising the development of the Guide has been Joseph Ravi Kumar. Christopher Juan Costain, WSP,
provided support and guidance in development of this document. The research and drafting team comprised Meera Bapat, Barkha
Goel, Pravin More, Rajiv Raman, and Somnath Sen.

We would like to thank all the reviewers who took the time to go through draft/s of the Guide, and suggest changes and improvements.
Reviewers included Dirk Walther, GIZ; Susmita Sinha, Centre for DEWATS Dissemination; Pete Kolsky, University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill; Raghu Kesavan, World Bank; Shyamal Sarkar, formerly with the World Bank, apart from officers and leaders from the
implementing organizations of the initiatives in the cities.

The responsibility of all errors and omissions rests with the drafting team.

Background                                                         This Guide does not recommend a single set of solutions
Following the launch of the National Urban Sanitation              either for technology or for approaches, but serves as

City Sanitation Plans (CSPs, by March 2014). The NUSP              tested in these cities, have to be considered in light of the
recommended development of special strategies for slums            local conditions, before adapting them as relevant.

these settlements face in accessing basic sanitation (and other)   that is, individual toilets, when constructed, used and

and exploration of strategies used to address these.               from a public health point of view.

Based on the experience of slum sanitation initiatives             However, it may be practically impossible for households

Box 1: Slums ….Defined


     In the NSSO 69th round survey, for operational purposes, slums were defined as follows:

     • 	 Areas notified as slums by the concerned municipalities, corporations, local bodies or development authorities
         were termed notified slums.

     • 	 Also, any compact settlement with a collection of poorly built tenements, mostly of temporary nature, crowded
         together, usually with inadequate sanitary and drinking water facilities in unhygienic conditions, was considered
         a slum by the survey, provided at least 20 households lived there. Such a settlement, if not a notified slum,
         was called a non-notified slum. (Note that while a non-notified slum had to consist of at least 20 households,
         no such restriction was imposed in case of notified slums.) The word “slum” covered both notified slums and
         non-notified slums.

Box 3: NUSP Emphasizes CSPs to Serve the Urban Poor and Slum Settlements


     Reaching the Unserved Populations and the Urban Poor

     Experiences from many Indian cities show that a differentiated approach is necessary to extend good quality
     sanitation services to the poor — the group that suffers the most in terms of adverse impacts on health and lost
     earnings.

     Participatory approaches are needed to consult the poor settlements and involve them in the process of
     planning and management of sanitation arrangements. Many settlements may have the necessary conditions
     to support the provision of individual onsite sanitation arrangements (for example, as tried out in some pockets
     in Ahmedabad) that are ideal; in many others, tenure and legal issues prevent provision of individual toilets and
     hence community toilets (CTs) are the only way for immediate succor and access (for example, as is the case
     with Mumbai, Pune). In some places, conventional and shallow sewers have also been tried out as alternative
     to on site solutions in dense settlements. Examination of legal/tenurial, space and affordability issues in close
     consultation with communities becomes a key step in planning innovative means that are owned by users and
     will be sustainably managed by them.

     NGOs can play an important role in mobilizing slum communities. Further, when community groups themselves
     take over the O&M of community facilities, then sustainable services become possible.

     Another segment of population normally without sanitation is those who live in dispersed urban locations not
     being slums or in groups of houses that have legally not been notified as slums. Innovative approaches are
     required to extend services to these population groups too.

     The Implementing Agency will need to take stock of the legal and non-notified settlements in the city and, in
     partnership with NGOs and CB0s, initiate a process of collaborative planning and delivery of services.

     At least 20 percent of the funds under the sanitation sector should be earmarked for the urban poor. The issues of
     cross subsidization of the urban poor and their involvement in the collection of O&M charges should be addressed.

     The last and not least of all obstacles is the mindset of the officers of ULBs and other citizens: biases and myths
     often hinder proper service provision to poor settlements. There must be a concerted effort to raise awareness
     amongst all stakeholders about the huge health and environmental costs that all have to bear if services are not
     comprehensively provided to all citizens.

Box 4: Public Toilets and Community Toilets


     While both Public Toilets (PTs) and CTs provide vital sanitation services in urban areas, there is a clear distinction
     between the two:

     1.	 PTs usually are located in commercial areas such as markets, train and bus stations, and so on in areas
         characterized by high population throughput. These are pay-and-use toilets (in some cases, free to use), and
         could be operated by the government, private operators or NGOs. Examples of such toilets are the Sulabh
         complexes prevalent in many Indian cities.

     2.	 CTs are usually situated in or near slum locations, and have a core group of identifiable regular users. Sometimes
         CTs may be located near a commercial or high population throughput area but their distinctive feature is the
         regular user group and a management arrangement by users themselves, or someone on their behalf.

     PTs can be run as commercial ventures by the government or sub-contracted to the private sector, while CTs
     need to be accountable to user groups while being viable either through user contributions or some other ways
     of financing of expenses.

Box 5: Relevant Definitions


       The Model Property Rights to Slum Dwellers Bill 2011 (Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, 2011)
       proposed some definitions for states to consider in their acts and rules:

       “Slum” or “Slum Area” means a compact settlement of at least 20 households with a collection of poorly built
       tenements, mostly of temporary nature, crowded together usually with inadequate sanitary and drinking water
       facilities in unhygienic conditions.

       “Untenable Settlements” are those settlements which are on environmentally hazardous sites (such as
       riverbank, pond sites, hilly or marshy terrains, and so on), ecologically sensitive sites (mangroves, national parks,
       sanctuaries, and so on), and on land marked for public utilities and services (such as major roads, railway tracks,
       trunk infrastructure, and so on).

       “In-situ Slum Redevelopment” means the process of redevelopment of slum areas by providing dwelling space
       and other basic civic and infrastructural services to the slum dwellers, on the existing land on which the slum is
       based.

       “Slum Resettlement” means the process of relocation and settlement of slum dwellers from the existing
       untenable slums to an alternative site with dwelling space, basic civic and infrastructural services.

       “Basic Civic Services” means services of drinking water supply, drainage, sewerage, solid waste disposal and
       street lighting.

Box 6: Parivartan Slum Networking Program in Ahmedabad


  With a population of 3.5 million (2001), Ahmedabad reported more than 40 percent of its population living in over
  1,600 slums and informal settlements. In the mid-1990s, a private textile mill had approached AMC to help improve
  slums in the mill’s neighborhood. This initiated the formulation of the Parivartan Program or SNP comprising:

  Physical infrastructure services including individual water supply connection; individual toilets connected to
  sewerage; storm water drainage; paved internal roads and lanes; street lighting; solid waste management; and
  landscaping; and

  Community development inputs including mobilization and formation of CBOs and their involvement in
  implementation, O&M, and for supporting health, education, livelihoods, micro-credit, and so on.

  The program was funded mainly by AMC. It realized that, for slum dwellers to access infrastructure services, it was
  quintessential to provide tenure security and urban social protection to slum dwellers. Along with this, state level
  enabling legislations such as an amendment to the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation (BPMC) Act, 1949
  had aimed to progressively eliminate slums, prevent the reemergence of slums and upgrade and control existing
  slums. In Ahmedabad, water and sanitation services were not provided to communities that lacked legal tenure. An
  amendment to the BPMC Act, 1949 made it obligatory for AMC to spend at least 10 percent of its own revenue for
  improving basic services in slums.

  To encourage slum dwellers to continue to invest in their homes, AMC agreed to provide some sort of protection
  for a 10-year period to the households participating in its program. The executive orders and rules at the state
  government and ULB level provided an important enabling legal framework of service provision to slums. AMC
  started the 500 NOC Scheme aimed at helping slum residents acquire a No Objection Certificate (NOC) with a
  payment of INR 500. This document had the photo of the householder declaring that s/he will not claim ownership
  or legal claim over the house structure and services, and AMC declared that it would not demolish the structure
  and stop services for a period of 10 years in normal circumstances. (Only two instances of demolition were noted
  thereafter to acquire land for infrastructure projects. Affected communities were duly relocated.).

Community Slum Sanitation in India A Practitioner’s Guide




     With the help of the NOC, slum residents could now
     apply for legal individual sewage and water connections
     to their house. AMC issued NoCs for the upgradation of
     community and individual household facilities including
     water, drainage, sanitation, pavements and roads for
     a period of 10 years. In addition, it used the BPMC
     Act to systematically make budgetary allocations for
     improvement to health conditions of the city residents
     including slums. The SNP was therefore one of the first
     initiatives to delink tenure from services provision.

     This led to the willingness of slum communities to
     participate in and contribute towards capital cost of
     infrastructure development and a community level
     corpus fund for O&M. AMC, in partnership with a private
     company and NGOs (Saath and Gujarat Mahila Housing
     Sewa Trust), extended a bundle of services including individual toilets, water taps and drains in nearly 50 slum
     settlements beginning the late 1990s. Individual services were preferred and provided over community facilities,
     scaled up to other cities of Gujarat except Vadodara where only community facilities were provided. By 2014,
     only three slums (of the more than 40 slums under Parivartan project) suffered part or full relocation. This was for
     infrastructure projects, and did not lead to AMC revoking its NOC per se.

Box 7: Bengaluru’s Experience with Delinking Tenure and Service Provision


    In Bengaluru, under the AusAID-assisted Master Plan Project, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board
    (BWSSB) waived off the requirement for proof of land ownership as requirement for water supply connections,
    and replaced this with proof of residency. A special new water tariff slab was introduced to provide for shared
    connections (so that, in spite of large combined consumption of five to six families, the applicable tariff would be
    the lowest one, and not the high telescopic slab applicable for normal individual households). Connection fees
    were reduced (INR 830, down from INR 1,850) and permitted to be paid in instalments. The procedures for applying
    for connections, and issuance of meters, and so on, were also simplified.

    In this way, the BWSSB was able to delink service provision from legal tenure – the utility gaining by increased customer-

Box 8: KMC Attempts a New Way of Addressing Sanitation


  Kalyani was faced, in the 1990s, with a large number of settlements with toilets that were not used by residents.
  These toilets were constructed under different schemes for rehabilitation and improvement of the population living
  in bastis (slums), in which many had migrated from neighboring Bangladesh.

  The huge pile of solid waste littered on roadsides and on a field was coupled with the problem of indiscriminate
  dumping of bio-medical waste with this garbage. A rudimentary sewerage was in a state of dilapidation with the
  overall outcome being the image of the two cities of Kalyani, one that was rich and planned, and the other with
  slums, garbage and waste. After being a Notified Area Committee, Kalyani was accorded the status of a Municipal
  Council in 1994.

  On taking stock of the condition of the city and its 19 wards, the newly elected chairman was ready to initiate a
  series of changes in the way the municipality functioned. One of the first set of actions was to start conducting
  municipal meetings in camera to ensure transparency. It was also emphasized to the elected representatives that,
  according to the West Bengal Municipal Corporation Act, the executive powers of the municipality were vested in
  the chairman and elected representatives. Therefore, the role of elected representatives ceased to be representing
  wards and transformed into being members of a decision-making and executive authority.

  The second set of changes involved devolution of financial resources to the ward levels using a consensus approach
  (instead of a quota based one) and incentivizing improved expenditure performance locally. It was very difficult to
  convince other ward councilors, including those from the opposition, to formally resolve not to access scheme
  funds available for toilet construction under KUSP. With the municipality’s own staff, including engineers, there was
  the additional task of convincing them about what would be value for money but sanitary toilets.

  In order to engage with slum communities, the KMC leadership decided to identify and encourage Natural Leaders
  (NLs) from these communities. These NLs were provided special motivation and training, and mobilized around the
  themes of improved public health including sanitation. A number of social and cultural events were organized as
  this community led movement – called Community Based Health Initiative (CBHI) – of which the focus was on the
  outcome of ODF communities.

  The local municipal leadership, that is, the chairman, elected leaders as well as community leaders, were further
  assisted by external experts and well-wishers of this approach. Within a short period of less than two years, more
  than 40 communities were able to become ODF using their own resources, and no subsidy or financial support
  from the government in constructing toilets. Some of these communities had, in addition, constructed improved
  drains, platforms for handpumps and other such small infrastructure using their own resources. The NLs and
  volunteers would continue to monitor behavior of residents, incidents of diahorreal disease and report and discuss
  these on a weekly basis with the municipality.

  A strong municipal leadership that had attempted a fundamental change in the culture of municipal politics was
  therefore responsible for mobilizing communities to take ownership of their health.

Box 9: Mobilizing Children around Health and Hygiene Practices


  Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, is a fascinating amalgam of scenic beauty, old historic city, and planned
  modern settlement. The “city of lakes” has a population of about 18,00,000 (Census 2011), of which about a third
  live in 374 notified slums.

  The NGO Aarambh that has been working with children since 1990s, mainly on issues of child rights, began a pilot
  project on sanitation in 2005. With WaterAid in partnership with BMC and UN Habitat, Aarambh launched a slum
  sanitation program to make slums ODF using the community-led approach. Through a Poverty Pocket Situational
  Analysis that focused on the poorest of poor with no access to water and sanitation facilities, Aarambh identified
  17 slums in Bhopal. A total of 5,000 households were covered – 2,600 individual leach pit latrines and two CTBs
  were built – and 11 slums were declared ODF by the government in 2008.

  The community-led approach targeted women and children. The team began with door-to-door campaigns
  telling women about sanitation issues, wall writing on hygiene practices, septage management, performing
  skits (nukkad natak) to give messages on health and hygiene, celebrating World Water Day, World Toilet Day and
  Environment Day.



  Developing a sanitation solution through community participation was conceived as the first activity in the
  Aarambh pilot program to build toilets in Bhopal. A Water and Sanitation (WatSan) Committee comprising seven
  to13 persons with a third as women, was established and trained in each community. The responsibilities of the
  WatSan Committees were: oversee and monitor construction, O&M of the facility, set and collect user charges,
  carry out repairs directly or through the private sector, and be accountable to the community regarding O&M.
  Shiksha Swasthya Sanitation teams were formed for health promotion and communication and they were active
  in door-to-door campaigning on hygiene, need for constructing toilets with septic tanks, etc.

  Aarambh has also promoted segregation of waste through competitions such as ‘healthy lane’, ‘healthy house’
  where community women act as judges.

Box 10: The Tiruchirappalli Initiative

  Tiruchirappalli city has been a growing industrial center and is the fourth-largest city in Tamil Nadu. It has a
  population of about 9,00,000, of which nearly 27 percent live in slums (Census, 2011).

  Until 2000, the Trichy City Corporation (TCC) managed all CTBs, which were dirty, dysfunctional and not used by slum
  dwellers. In 2000, WaterAid supported NGOs working in the field of urban sanitation (that is, Gramalaya, SCOPE,
  Sevai, Exnora International, Annai, Ramasamy Chellapappa Educational Trust, Environmental Conservation Group
  and Kalki Groups) to work with communities to renovate and take over management of CTBs directly themselves,
  and also supported communities in building completely new toilets.

  The participation of women was a key feature of the TCC project. Gramalaya adopted a process by which a number
  of SHGs were created with 15-20 women each as members. About two to seven such SHGs per community were
  established. Each SHG creates Sanitation and Hygiene Education (SHE) teams from existing members who take
  upon the responsibility of raising awareness and promoting slum sanitation and hygiene. The SHGs were given a
  central place in ensuring their views on the location of the toilet, and procedures followed. The SHE teams manage
  the CTBs on pay and use basis, maintain account books, disburse salaries among staff and improve the facilities

     It has addressed the practical gender needs of women being users of safe and properly maintained sanitation
     facilities; and, secondly, addressed the strategic gender need to give decision-making power to women, to operate
     and maintain toilets and for them to benefit in terms of their livelihoods. One such key agent of change, Indra
     (name changed), a housewife and member of the SHG group in Veragupettai, became a SHE team leader in 2000.
     She began looking after the CTB constructed in 2001 after demolishing the existing structure in a Veragupettai
     slum with about 79 households.

     The SHE team would earn as much as INR 18,000-20,000 per month from the CTB usage. By 2007, the SHE team
     had collected about INR 3,00,000 from user fees, and decided to construct a community hall in its slum that could
     be used for training on hygiene as well as for social gatherings. It now operates as a training classroom for SHGs
     and is also available for rent at INR 1,000 a day.

     Indra spearheaded the movement by encouraging toilet usage in neighboring communities. Initially, no one came
     forward to contribute in construction/maintenance of the CTB despite sincere efforts of the Gramalaya staff.
     Indra was instrumental in motivating the nearby SHG through persistent motivation and hygiene awareness,
     including door-to-door education, to meet with TCC and renovate their CTB. She supported the endeavors of the
     neighboring SHG to renovate the CT and it became functional in 2008.

     Regular meetings for discussions on accounting for funds and using the balance for slum welfare activities in
     concurrence with the sanitation and hygiene promotion activities of the SHE teams have also induced 28 families
     to install household toilets with WaterAID support.

Box 13: Recommendations for Construction


     Materials and workmanship
     Based on the type of waste disposal and water supply, and number of toilet seats, urinals, baths and washing
     areas to be provided, a layout plan of the major component of the CTB including disposal system and immediate
     surroundings should be prepared keeping in view the land area available. Deriving from that, the construction
     drawing of the CT needs to be prepared and material choices need to be made. All construction works should
     be carried out according to the relevant specifications, approved designs and drawings. It should always be
     kept in mind that a CT is a permanent structure. Material used in construction should be of specified quality and
     standards allowing a lifespan of at least 30 years. It should not require frequent replacement or repair, as funds
     might not be available within the community or responsible municipality. The workmanship and quality of work
     should be good. Both are important to insure a long life-cycle of the community toilet.

     Superstructure
     The walls of the superstructure could be of bricks and cement or any comparable low-cost material. Separation
     walls between individual facilities need not be very high, but enough to provide user privacy. The roof of the
     superstructure may be of reinforced cement concrete (RCC) or red stone with cement or GI sheet. RCC is the most
     durable, requiring least or no repair or maintenance, but costs more. Red stone costs a little less than RCC but its
     life is much shorter than that of RCC. Costs for GI sheets are almost the same as for red stone and it has a long
     life and requires low repair and maintenance. The door of the complex and each individual cubicle, respectively,
     is also an important consideration. The three different materials commonly being used are wood, iron, and plastic.
     The most common material used for doors is wood and iron sheet. Plastic doors are durable but cost more than
     the other two.

     The water reservoirs and pipelines should be tested to avoid loss of valuable natural and financial resources. The
     robustness of sewers is equally important to avoid groundwater contamination and respective precautions should
     also be taken when constructing onsite systems.

     Toilets
     The toilet seats should consist of a toilet bowl or squatting pan and a water seal or S-trap. The squatting pan
     should have a slope of about 25-30°, same as those used for household toilets. The squatting pans and traps
     should be fixed carefully so that the S-trap has a water seal of 20 millimeter (mm), requiring 1.5 to 2 liter of water
     per use of the toilet. Also, the top of the pan needs to be level with the floor so that the floor drains freely to the

     pan. Pans and traps may be of ceramic or fiber/plastic. The
     fiber/plastic pan and trap are useful in certain situations
     due to light weight, lower cost, longer life, resistance
     against breakage and ease of transportation.

     For user comfort, there should be a 200 mm space
     between the rear edge of the pan and the back wall of the
     superstructure. Foot-rests should be fixed at the time of
     laying the floor. These should be about 20 mm above the
     floor level, inclined slightly away.

Box 14: Mumbai SSP “Compact” Contract


  The Mumbai SSP’s unique features included a demand-responsive participatory approach; incentives for
  contractors, NGOs and CBOs to work together; contracting innovations; high technical standards and good
  features in toilets; CBO registration and handover for O&M management; and so on. However, during the initial
  years (1997-99) of the Mumbai SSP, the contracts let out (Lots 1 to 5) received limited interest from community
  groups and only 21 public toilet blocks were constructed. Reasons included:

  •	 Residents in slum areas were not initially aware of the comparative advantage of the SSP toilet design over
     common alternatives such as the free MHADA toilets. Besides the SSP toilets required community contributions
     to be mobilized (not the case for either of the alternatives);
  •	 The issuing of separate contracts for the NGO and building contractor did not provide either stakeholder with
     adequate incentives and contract tasks to effectively market the benefits of this particular type of RCC toilet;
     and
  •	 The main project partners were on a learning curve on how best to design and implement the project.

  These lessons led to the development of a revised project approach that was used for subsequent contracts. More
  than 300 SSP public toilet blocks were provided in the period 2000 to 2004 (Lots 6 to 8). Much better progress was
  achieved in the second half of the project through the following measures:

  •	 Bundling the contractors’ and NGOs’ work into one “compact” contract, so that both parties worked together
     to promote the toilet blocks to community groups in an efficient manner. NGO or contractor led joint ventures
     are accepted;
  •	 Inviting bids for larger contracts with the scope for the provision of 20 to 40 public toilet blocks each with 20
     toilet cubicles for a whole ward. Such larger contracts were more attractive to capable contractors and NGOs;
  •	 The above measures enabled the NGO and contractor to generate good demand for the SSP public toilets, by
     constructing one or more good quality public toilets that were demonstrated and promoted to nearby community
     groups;
  •	 The incentive to provide more toilets with a 100 percent positive contract variation was allowed. This enabled
     better promotion of toilet blocks to new community groups and encouraged good quality toilet blocks;
  •	 The provision for 100 percent negative contract variation increased the risk-taking ability of contractors in
     difficult areas where demand may not be generated. This protects against audit objections in the case of non-
     performance in a particular area;
  •	 Flexibility across wards with larger contracts allowed a more demand responsive approach and was more
     attractive to contractors and NGOs; and
  •	 A simple contract payment schedule, based on stages of completion, reduced the time and cost for interim
     payments.

Box 15: Innovations in Training


      A number of innovative approaches are being tested in simplifying technical and management aspects of
      sanitation; and using these as training and capacity building aides. Some of these range from materials that
      demystify the technology, whereas other modules are related to operating and maintaining toilets as enterprises.
      ULBs and NGOs working on community slum sanitation may identify and use such innovative training resources
      and organizations.5

Box 16: The Tiruchirappalli Model


     Until the end of the 1990s, the slums of Tiruchirappalli, with their sanitation and toilet facilities in an appalling
     state, had a high incidence of diarrheal cases and water borne diseases, open defecation, improper disposal
     of garbage and disease transmission, and neglected and abandoned CTs. After 10 years, in 2010, the National
     Sanitation Rating 2009-10 ranked the city as high as the sixth cleanest in India in the sanitation ranking of Indian
     cities.

     It all started with a major initiative launched by the NGO Gramalaya in 2000, mobilizing women into SHGs and
     launching an awareness campaign on sanitation through training. Gramalaya’s comprehensive approach focused
     on construction and renovation of CTBs, introducing child-friendly toilets and providing safe drinking water, on one
     hand, and training and capacity building of CBOs, on the other. SHE teams were set up by the SHGs to propagate
     the message of sanitation, monitor the behavior of residents, and supervise the maintenance of the toilets. WAVE
     is a federation of all SHE teams in urban areas. The federation is headed by a president, assisted by a secretary
     and treasurer, and there are 12 executive committee members. WAVE meets twice a month and discusses matters
     relating to problems faced by SHE teams and solutions for them. WAVE guides SHE teams in the maintenance
     of community toilets and assists other SHGs to take over maintenance of CTs. The standardized procedure
     for keeping accounts and documentation, holding meetings, and so on, assists in ensuring smooth transition
     between SHE teams. WAVE also takes up issues connected with water and sanitation with the city administration
     and engages in sanitation promotional activities in other slums. Men also find a role through WatSan committees
     in monitoring the progress of the overall sanitation status of the slums in the city.

     The average monthly expenditure of a community complex is INR 4,800, ranging from INR 550 to INR 15,700
     per month. The major regular expenditure is on staffing, electricity charges, cleaning materials and electric motor
     repairs. Other expenditure includes WAVE membership fees (INR 100 to 500 per month depending on income),
     street cleaning and garbage collection, informal payment to septic tank cleaners, cleaning drains and blocked
     underground drains.

     On an average, five staff per day work in the well-managed complexes. Two caretakers work each day on a shift
     basis and are paid between INR 20 and 50 per day, depending on the size and income of the toilet. There are two
     cleaners per complex who are paid around INR 1,100 each per month. The watchwoman is paid between INR 500
     and 1,200 per month. These wages are minimal and there is no scope for saving costs through reducing wages.

     CT complexes require large amounts of water to maintain hygiene. Where bathing and clothes washing facilities
     are available, even more water is required. Since water is drawn from borewells using electric motors, the average
     monthly expenditure on electricity is as high as INR 1,200, and ranges up to INR 5,150.

     Initially, the communities managing the CTBs were not required to pay electricity charges and these costs were
     covered by TCC. A few years ago, TCC began passing on these charges to the communities. Appeals by ward
     councilors, SHE teams and WAVE to TCC on the grounds of insufficient income have resulted in exemptions in
     some CTBs. Currently, 65 percent of WAVE complexes pay for electricity. Earlier, commercial rates were being
     charged but, after much lobbying by ward councilors, SHE teams and WAVE to TCC, domestic rates are charged.

  A token system at the pay-and-use toilets has been developed. The typical user charge varies from 50 paise to
  INR 1 per use, while children, the elderly and the physically challenged have free access. After payment, each
  user is provided a token. This ensures transparency as it shows how many people used the toilet each day and
  how much income has been collected. A monthly card system is also followed and the rates set at lower levels
  – between INR 15 and 30 per family per month. At these rates, communities report that they are able to use the
  toilets. The average monthly income of a household relying on a daily wage in the slum communities is between
  INR 1,500 and 3,000. Toilet charges of INR 30 to INR 60 per month are estimated to be between 1 and 4 percent
  of the monthly income. These details are entered into account books kept in the toilet complex. Accounts are
  presented by the SHE teams to WAVE and by WAVE to Gramalaya, and are vetted by an external auditor. Having
  detailed information on the financial status of each toilet enables WAVE to monitor performance and intervene with
  advice on tariffs structures and loans when necessary.

  After covering O&M expenses such as salaries and cleaning material like bleaching powder, soaps and phenol,
  and so on, the surplus is used for health and sanitation related promotional activities such as provision of street
  taps, domestic drains, garbage bins and street lights. Major repairs and any other management issues are also
  discussed at the WAVE meetings. TCC plans to hand over the management of the remaining CTs to communities
  not yet part of the WAVE federation.

Box 17: Estimated Daily Operating Surplus in Mumbai SSP


     The first step in the sustainable management of CTBs in Mumbai will be an operating surplus which enables
     CBOs to run their blocks without making a loss. This analysis was simulated at the main daily loading of 1,300
     users for a 20-seater toilet block at 2005 prices. The figure presents an operating surplus surface that is defined
     by two variables: the proportion of pay and use users (from 0 to 100 percent) and the cost of a monthly family
     pass (ranging from INR 20 to 120). The operating surplus for a typical toilet block ranges from a loss of INR 400
     to a surplus of INR 1,000 per day depending on where the toilet block lies on this surface. The operating surplus
     line (dashed green) separates those conditions in which a loss is made (orange and yellow) from those in which a
     marginal surplus is made (white) and those in which a moderate and substantial surplus is made (various shades
     of green).

Drivers of Successful Slum Sanitation Initiatives




  From this graph, it is clear that surplus is strongly influenced by the proportion of pay and use users. A minimum
  of 40 percent of pay and use users is required for an existing toilet block with a monthly family pass of INR 20 and
  close to 100 percent recovery to show an operating surplus. Similarly, it would require a raise in the monthly family
  pass fee to over INR 120 to enable a toilet block with no pay and use users to have an operating surplus.

  Currently, the toilet blocks are financed with 100 percent capital subsidy (and in some cases, O&M subsidy) and
  have the potential to earn borderline to super normal profits. But a significant proportion of toilets in the city will be
  located in peripheral areas where the proportion of pay and use users will be limited or close to nil. If these toilet
  blocks are to survive financially, some elements of capital as well operational subsidies may be necessary.

  Recently, new models of social entrepreneurship have sprung up whereby caretakers maintain the CTBs on
  individual basis. However, one constraint is that such individuals may be willing to take up maintenance of CTs
  only in viable and profitable areas. However, the SHGs or WatSan/SHE teams may have incentives to maintain
  toilets even in less profitable areas/no-loss-no-profit. The maintenance groups in the loss-making units is cross
  subsidized by the WAVE federation from the monthly contribution fees collected from SHGs across the city, in
  case of Tiruchirappalli.

Box 18: Tiruchirappalli’s Approach to M&E


     The Tiruchirappalli initiative showed another approach to monitoring and assessments, whereby the federations
     of the SHGs carry out active monitoring of CTBs’ performance and related indicators.

     The community latrines in the slums were totally abandoned by the local residents since there was no proper
     maintenance system. The damaged septic tanks and toilet pans filled with feces made the CTs unusable. The
     slum dwellers were unaware of the dangers of open defecation and water borne diseases. With the involvement
     of CBOs, Gramalaya started its urban intervention in sanitation, focusing on the provision of a sanitation facility
     to the slum dwellers of Tiruchirappalli.

     SHE teams manage the CTBs on a daily basis and present account books kept in the toilet block to the
     WAVE federation. WAVE guides SHE teams in maintenance of CTs and assists other SHGs to take over toilet
     maintenance of CTs. Having detailed information on the financial status of each toilet enables WAVE to monitor
     performance and intervene with advice on tariffs structures and loans when necessary.

     Seeing the success of the CTBs under Gramalaya, the TCC has committed to outsource the management
     of all of its 390 CTs with a total of 4,643 seats to provide access to slum dwellers that do not have toilets in
     their homes. TCC is scaling up the work done by SHGs (that have formed WAVE federations) in 148 CTs and
     replicate CTs across the remaining 237 slums. TCC maintains 390 CTs. Tiruchirappalli will be the first city in the
     state to engage user members in O&M of CTs across the city.

     TCC not only provides funding support for CT renovation and supports the CBOs in repair and maintenance
     works of CTs, it jointly monitors the CTBs under Gramalaya. TCC, in its monthly review meetings, has brought
     on board WAVE members who provide their inputs and suggestions as part of the City Sanitation Taskforce.
     The TCC sanitation inspectors and junior engineers are also involved in monitoring of the CTBs.

     In certain cities such as Tiruchirappalli, it is a combination of the ULB and NGO that ascertains the maintenance
     of the CTBs. The municipal corporation is expected to carry out major repairs to CTBs once in three years.
     TCC not only provides funding support for CT renovation but also covers electricity costs in some toilets and
     provides piped water supply in some toilets.

     Gramalaya’s workers regularly visit the toilet blocks that are managed by the SHGs it supports. They have
     prepared a pro forma that lists aspects of cleanliness and condition of toilets to be checked. The information
     collected guides the SHGs in determining what action needs to be taken by toilet managers and the ULB. If
     any action is required at the ULB level, toilet managers may pursue the matter directly with the ULB. If toilet
     managers, especially of toilet blocks that have few users, are short of funds for undertaking repairs, they can
     borrow money from the SHGs. This ensures that repairs are not neglected for want of funds; at the same time,
     there is a cross subsidy for repairs from economically viable toilet blocks to those that are not.

  The WAVE federation of SHGs provides support not only in training on sanitation issues, but also in M&E. The

Box 19: Torrent Power AEC leads in Slum Electrification

     Ahmedabad with a population of 5 million and an area of 190.84 square kilometer is India’s fifth most populous
     (2011 Census) and seventh largest city. This initiative started with the electrification of five slums in 2001 and
     scaled up to 710 slums in a span of seven years.

     The slum electrification project was a result of a multi-stakeholder collaboration between AMC, which is
     responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Ahmedabad, the United States Agency for
     International Development (USAID) and Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. (AEC).

     A very small proportion of households in the informal settlements in Ahmedabad had legal electricity connections
     in 2001. This meant high losses for the Torrent Power AEC, a private utility distributing power in Ahmedabad.

     Since 2002, AEC adopted new and innovative methods for maintaining and improving the quality of power
     supplied to its customers. A viable option of connecting informal settlements to the electricity network was
     worked out for the AEC after discussions with a local NGO, SAATH, and project partner, the Self-Employed
     Women’s Association (SEWA). A pilot was initiated in 2002 by AEC with financial support from USAID. It provided
     in-house electrical power in the first phase to each slum household, with its own household meter and compact
     fluorescent light bulb. Only slums already identified for development under the Parivartan program were eligible
     to participate in the pilot. Another condition for eligibility was obtaining a NOC from the Ahmedabad Urban
     Development Authority, which effectively secures protection from eviction to the slum dwellers. Seven slums
     were included in the pilot project. Working with SAATH, the AEC team disseminated information on its program
     through announcements by megaphone, cloth banners and handbills distributed door to door. In each slum, they
     arranged group meetings with participants and constituted local CBOs to implement the program. The costs of
     connecting the customer and installing internal wiring were split between the household, USAID and AEC; the
     household paid INR 3,350 and USAID and AEC each contributed INR 2,200.

  The role of the NGO was to create awareness and motivate slum dwellers to access legal electrification. Since
  AEC requires slum dwellers to provide proper documentation regarding land ownership, income levels, proof of
  payment, taxes, and so on – something that most slum residents do not have – SEWA worked with slum dwellers
  to help meet the AMC’s documentation requirements. Torrent Power AEC used a combination of NGOs and CBOs
  to perform certain intermediary functions such as customer recruitment, meter reading and bill distribution. Both
  the NGO and AEC worked with the CBO to identify a member (usually a woman) whom they then trained to read
  the individual household meters.

  SAATH facilitated the process of availability of loans to the slum dwellers through SEWA Bank for payment of one‐
  time connection costs. An account holder with the bank was required to save money for a minimum period of six
  months to be eligible to receive loans from SEWA Bank. The loans were offered at an interest rate of 18 percent.
  The CBOs helped AEC identify and target needy families and AEC provided connections to them at a subsidized
  rate cost of INR 1,700. In the post‐pilot phase, AEC offered a connection charge of INR 5,200 for new connections
  in slums. Later, when more people came forward to acquire connections, the amount was reduced to INR 3,700.
  Eventually, it was reduced further to INR 2,500.

  The pilot project was a great success and as many as 820 households in eight slums were electrified. Enthused by
  the success of the pilot, AEC scaled-up the initiative to more than 200,000 slum households. Given the scale of the
  challenge, a slum electrification program that would extend safe, reliable, and legal electricity connections to the
  informal settlements in the city in a collaborative approach was taken up. The initiative was integrated into a larger
  development program for slums and informal settlements, called Parivartan (Change) or SNP. The SNP began in
  December 1995 as a partnership between the government, Arvind Mills, NGOs and the slum community to provide
  infrastructure services including paved roads, water supply and underground sewerage to individual households,
  storm water drainage, street lighting, solid waste management and some landscaping.

  AMC has helped convert a large number of unsafe and illegal connections into safe ones and reduce the losses
  incurred by the utility. The incidences of electricity theft decreased, while regular electricity use increased with
  a reported increase of 200 percent in average electricity consumption per day. The practice of installing meters
  outside the houses was extended to the entire city, following its immense success in the slum areas. As a result of
  the innovative methods and mechanisms, Torrent Power AEC’s transmission and distribution losses are amongst
  the lowest in the country (13-14 percent) and customers enjoy a high level of reliability of power supply. This
  integrated utility has a generating capacity of 500 megawatt and it supplies close to 4 billion units of power to 1.25
  million customers in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar (http://www.torrentlimited.com/aec.htm).

                       Sanitation Initiatives



The foregoing sections have outlined the drivers of successful                                                    Even in cities where a CSP has not been prepared, the
slum sanitation initiatives. This section traces the full cycle                                                   task of addressing a sanitation crisis in slum areas

up to the M&E phase.                                                                                              basis.

Under the NUSP 2008, a series of iterative steps were listed                                                      The phases and activities for a slum sanitation initiative are
out as an aide to preparing the CSP. One of the detailed tasks                                                    presented below:
in overall city sanitation planning is to dwell upon sanitation
in slums and informal settlements of the city.

Generic Steps for Slum Sanitation Initiatives




A) Preparatory and Planning Stage                                      settlements. Some states have formulated such policies while
The preparatory and planning stage comprises the following             others may have precedence in terms of limited government
blocks of activities:                                                  or department orders. In the preparatory stages, it will be
                                                                       appropriate to formalize some sort of policy statement or a

(1)	Political and executive leadership and institutions:               to slum settlements if legally permissible. Budgetary provision
    In the preparatory stage, it needs to be ensured that the          also has to be made for at least supporting the initial activities
    idea of sanitation service provision to the slums enjoys           (for example, baseline studies, awareness generation, planning,
    full support and priority of, ideally, both the political as       preparation of detailed project reports, and so on). It needs to be
    well as executive leadership of the ULB/city agencies. The         identified which central and state/ULB schemes may be available

    conceptualize and manage such an initiative needs also to
    be assessed and areas that need strengthening identified.          ii) Baseline and Mapping of Slums
    In many of the larger cities, slum sanitation initiatives          Depending on the availability of secondary/old records about
    may have already been undertaken that are, at this stage,          the city’s slums and informal settlements, a study need to be
    appropriate to review and develop revised strategies. In           conducted to update the data or, in some cases, carry out surveys

 Many government schemes specify BPL households to have a different level of entitlements as compared to above the poverty line households. In
some places, the type of house structure (kuccha, pucca) or the area of the dwelling may be used as proxy. However, in slum projects, it is advisable to
make the criteria simple to administer and, in case of CTBs, simply make all households eligible to use the facility.

Annex 1: Article 243 of Constitution
(Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act

                        THE CONSTITUTION (SEVENTY-FOURTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1992
                         Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution
                            (Seventy-third Amendment) Bill, 1991 which was enacted as
                              the Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992


                                         STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS


In many States local bodies have become weak and ineffective on account of a variety of reasons, including the failure to hold
regular elections, prolonged supersessions and inadequate devolution of powers and functions. As a result, Urban Local Bodies
are not able to perform effectively as vibrant democratic units of self-government.

2.	 Having regard to these inadequacies, it is considered necessary that provisions relating to Urban Local Bodies are incorporated
    in the Constitution particularly for-

	 (i)	 putting on a firmer footing the relationship between the State Government and the Urban Local Bodies with respect
         to-
		       (a)	 the functions and taxation powers; and
		       (b)	 arrangements for revenue sharing;
	 (ii)	 Ensuring regular conduct of elections;
	 (iii)	 ensuring timely elections in the case of supersession; and
	 (iv)	 providing adequate representation for the weaker sections like Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women.
3.	 Accordingly, it is proposed to add a new part relating to the Urban Local Bodies in the Constitution to provide for-

	 (a)	   constitution of three types of Municipalities:
		       (i)	 Nagar Panchayats for areas in transition from a rural area to urban area;
		       (ii)	 Municipal Councils for smaller urban areas;
		       (iii) Municipal Corporations for larger urban areas.

	        The broad criteria for specifying the said areas is being provided in the proposed article 243-0;

	 (b)	   composition of Municipalities, which will be decided by the Legislature of a State, having the following features:
		       (i)	 persons to be chosen by direct election;
		       (ii)	 representation of Chairpersons of Committees, if any, at ward or other levels in the Municipalities;
		       (iii)	representation of persons having special knowledge or experience of Municipal Administration in Municipalities
               (without voting rights);




70
    Annex 1: Article 243 of Constitution (Seventy-Fourth Amendment) Act




	     (c)	 election of Chairpersons of a Municipality in the manner specified in the State law;
	     (d)	 constitution of Committees at ward level or other level or levels within the territorial area of a Municipality as may be
           provided in the State law;
	     (e)	 reservation of seats in every Municipality-

		         (i)	 for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population of which not less than one-third shall
                 be for women;
		         (ii)	 for women which shall not less than one-third of the total number of seats;
		         (iii)	in favour of backward class of citizens if so provided by the Legislature of the State;
		         (iv)	 for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women in the office of Chairpersons as may be specified in the State
                 law;

	 (f )	 fixed tenure of 5 years for the Municipality and re-election within six months of end of tenure. If a Municipality is
        dissolved before expiration of its duration, elections to be held within a period of six months of its dissolution;
	 (g)	 devolution by the State Legislature of powers and responsibilities upon the Municipalities with respect to preparation
        of plans for economic development and social justice, and for the implementation of development schemes as may be
        required to enable them to function as institutions of self-government;
	 (h)	 levy of taxes and duties by Municipalities, assigning of such taxes and duties to Municipalities by State Governments
        and for making grants-in-aid by the State to the Municipalities as may be provided in the State law;
	 (i)	 a Finance Commission to review the finances of the Municipalities and to recommend principles for –
		      (1) determining the taxes which may be assigned to the Municipalities;
		      (2) Sharing of taxes between the State and Municipalities;
		      (3) grants-in-aid to the Municipalities from the Consolidated Fund of the State;
	 (j)	 audit of accounts of the Municipal Corporations by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India and laying of
        reports before the Legislature of the State and the Municipal Corporation concerned;
	 (k)	 making of law by a State Legislature with respect to elections to the Municipalities to be conducted under the
        superintendence, direction and control of the chief electoral officer of the State;
	 (l)	 application of the provisions of the Bill to any Union territory or part thereof with such modifications as may be
        specified by the President;
	 (m)	 exempting Scheduled areas referred to in clause (1), and tribal areas referred to in clause (2), of article 244, from the
        application of the provisions of the Bill. Extension of provisions of the Bill to such areas may be done by Parliament by
        law;
	 (n)	 disqualifications for membership of a Municipality;
	 (o)	 bar of jurisdiction of Courts in matters relating to elections to the Municipalities.

4.	 The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objectives.

Annex 2:
Government Initiatives in Select Indian Cities

Rapid urbanization has presented a huge unmet demand for housing and infrastructure leading to settlements that have
insecure tenure, are of “quasi-legal” nature, and conventional provision of water and sanitation services to them becomes
complex for urban agencies. A large chunk of households can only be afforded (legally or practically) public or community
level environmental services (for example, shared or neighbourhood level water supply connections, and community toilets to
cater to a group of families) rather than individual piped water supply or household latrines.

The post-independence decades did not accord attention to the issues of slum settlements. In the early 1970s, urban housing
shortage increased at a fast pace and the population of unauthorized and under-serviced settlements or slums also began to
grow rapidly. This led to a growing recognition of the need to utilize funds in a manner that would cover a greater proportion
of the population as compared to conventional subsidized housing programs. A working group constituted by the Planning
Commission recommended slum improvement as an interim palliative, but necessary to ensure at least minimum conditions
of environmental hygiene for slum dwellers (Planning Commission, 2011).

By 1980s, slum settlements started to be viewed less as “evils and blots” and more as housing solutions as the instance of
Mumbai demonstrated (WSP/TARU, 2006). Albeit selectively, other cities in India, especially the metropolises, also mirrored
the approach of Mumbai – through State Slum Acts, these settlements were legitimized and their housing and infrastructure
provision improved.

During the Fourth Five Year Plan period (1969-74), the GoI supported Environmental Improvement of Urban Slums (EIS)
was launched (1972-73) to provide a minimum level of services, water supply, sewerage, drainage, street pavements in 11 cities
with a population of 0.8 million and above. This was later incorporated in the Minimum Needs Programme (MNP) during
the Fifth Plan. The program intended to combine social development with environmental improvement and was extended
to include all cities with populations of over 300,000. In 1979, it was extended to all urban centers irrespective of their size.

Another significant development during the Fifth Five Year Plan (1974-79) was the enactment of the Urban Land (Ceiling &
Regulation) Act (ULCRA) that was designed to prevent concentration of land holding in urban areas, and to make available
urban land for construction of houses for the middle-and low-income groups.

The rise of public toilets was another major development in parallel. Earlier, these were thought of as “public conveniences” for
floating populations in areas such as markets, but this was in the 1990s and 2000s also used to cater to the huge demand for
sanitation in slum settlements where individual household toilets were infeasible.

At the city level, states and cities were undertaking a few interventions for slum upgradation. A systematic approach to
planning and delivering services to slums had to wait until the 1970s, when initiatives were taken up in Kolkata, followed by
Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam.

The Basti Improvement Programme (BIP) in Kolkata sponsored by GoI marked the shift in policy from slum clearance to slum
upgrading in situ. It was perceived as an interim arrangement and not as a viable strategy. Basti improvement “was conceived
and implemented as a sanitation and clean environment drive, rather than as an entry point of social and economic upliftment
leading to the integration of marginalized communities. The effect was that the community did not participate and did not
perceive itself as a part of the upgrading process” (Krishnamurty and Benjamin, 1998). This led to poor maintenance of
facilities and non-payment of service charges by users.

Box: Basti Improvement Program in Kolkata


     The program proposed:

     (1)	 The immediate implementation of a major program of basti improvement covering 400,000 slum dwellers
          within the next five years;
     (2)	 That all future slum clearance be concentrated and accelerated as much as possible in the basti areas of the
          central city, and that specific rehousing programs for the 170,000 basti dwellers in those areas be expeditiously
          developed;
     (3)	 The total acquisition of all basti lands outside the central city by 1971;
     (5)	 The preparation of a systematic program for the eventual clearance and redevelopment of all basti lands
          acquired, and the use of these lands to meet the present and anticipated social needs for such essential
          community facilities; and
     (8)	 The establishment of a strong administrative arrangement for the coordination and execution of the management
          functions essential to the improvement program and social management to enlist the effective voluntary
          participation of the basti-dwellers themselves in a vigorous effort toward basti community development.

     Bastis are registered slums that have been recognized by the Municipal Corporation on the basis of the land title
     handed over to the slum dwellers on lease or are let out on rent. Bastis are legally recognized settlements that
     the Kolkata Municipal Corporation supplies with services such as water, latrines, trash removal, and occasionally
     electricity. Basti huts typically are permanent structures that the government will not demolish, which allows basti
     communities to develop a sense of permanency and to focus on issues of poverty beyond shelter availability.

From Interim Palliative to Long-term Strategy
Slum improvement through the Urban Community Development (UCD) program was another government initiative that has
been attempted in a few cities in India. Hyderabad (UCD started in 1967) and Visakhapatnam (UCD started in 1979) were
conceived as integrated urban development programs. The key concepts involved are ‘self-help’ and ‘felt needs’. “Therefore,
initially the success of the project depends almost entirely upon the work of each community organiser who has to stimulate,
guide and sustain the whole process by working with individuals and groups in the slums, learning about their most commonly
felt needs, and motivating them to help themselves. UCD moves in to help only when the slum dwellers show a certain degree
of interest and enthusiasm.”

The UCD program in Visakhapatnam replicated many features of the program in Hyderabad. It provided some positive lessons,
but also drew attention to difficulties in sustaining the integrated approach. These difficulties arose because of the tension that
exists between the short-term goal of infrastructure and housing provision and long-term process of social development and
empowerment. The experience of UCD pointed out that the inability to change through the program, the existing power structure


80
Annex 2: Government initiatives in Select Indian Cities




and, political patronage and brokerage systems has put limitations on its achievement. It stressed the importance of ensuring that
“community and social development programs provide an entry point for project involvement, housing and infrastructure only
being implemented after community organization has been strengthened.” (Asthana, 1998)

While the experience of initiatives such as BIP and UCD stressed the importance of community organization and their
involvement and participation in ensuring effectiveness and sustainability of physical improvements in slums, the EIS has
continued to concentrate only on the engineering aspect of service provision. A Task Force appointed by the Planning
Commission, GoI, reviewed the progress of the scheme in 1983. It mentioned in its report that in the 10 years since the launch
of the EIS scheme, it had achieved a very limited coverage and only 27 to 34 percent of the estimated slum population was
provided basic services (Planning Commission, Government of India, 1983).

Another study titled “In the Name of the Poor – Access to Basic Amenities” (Kundu, 1993) pointed out the persisting and
acute lack of facilities for the poor. The study stated that nearly a third of urban households did not have access to a latrine
facility. In a large number of cities, public authorities have provided low-cost toilets that are not connected to the city sewers.
In many cases, they are poorly maintained and pose a threat to the micro-environment.

The Task Force (1983) identified a number of problems in the implementation of the scheme for the environmental improvement
of slums. They were primarily related to insufficient budgets, lack of adequate administrative arrangements, legal problems in
improving slums on private and central government land, and lack of proper maintenance of the facilities provided. The report
noted that the scheme is implemented purely as a public works project. Slum dwellers were not involved in the program and
there is no financial participation of the local bodies.

From its recommendations it is clear that the Task Force moved away from treating the EIS as a short-term palliative and suggests
measures to make it a long-term program. Significantly, it suggested measures that go beyond engineering aspects and include
community participation and creating workable arrangements for maintenance of assets. These aspects were emphasised by WHO
in the 1950s. In order to make the scheme for environmental improvement more effective, the Task Force recommended:

•	   The setting of realistic norms;
•	   Full involvement of local bodies in the project;
•	   Firm linkage of improvement program with security of tenure and house improvement loans;
•	   Full involvement of the people through community development projects, voluntary agencies and community organizations
•	   A certain amount of cost recovery; and
•	   Workable arrangements for maintenance of assets and services.

Other than raising expenditure norms by a small extent, the other recommendations made by the Task Force have, however,
remained largely unimplemented.

UBSP, ILCS AND VAMBAY Programs
In the Sixth Plan period (1981 to 1985), the Urban Basic Services (UBS), a collaborative project of GoI and UNICEF, was
launched. The project was proposed to be implemented through the community volunteers to be selected from each slum and
trained to increase their awareness and capacity to participate.

The scheme was introduced across the country during Seventh Plan period as the Urban Basic Services for the Poor (UBSP).
The objectives of the program were to extend child health services, water and sanitation facilities, pre-school and other learning
opportunities outside schools and provide income generation opportunities for women.

Community Slum Sanitation in India A Practitioner’s Guide




In 1981, GoI launched the Integrated Low Cost Sanitation (ILCS) program with an aim to abolish manual scavenging. In
1996, GoI initiated the National Slum Development Programme (NSDP) with the objective of upgrading urban slums by
providing physical and social7 amenities and shelter upgrading (http://muepa.nic.in/).

By combining the three poverty alleviation schemes, the UBSP, Nehru Rojgar Yojana and Prime Minister’s Integrated Urban
Poverty Eradication Program, a new scheme, Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rojgar Yojana (SJSRY) was launched by GoI in 1997.
The objective of the scheme was to provide gainful employment to the urban unemployed or underemployed, through self-
employment ventures or provision of wage employment.

The SJSRY consisted of two schemes: the Urban Self Employment Programme (USEP), and the Urban Wage Employment
Programme (UWEP). The basic aim of this program was to improve the quality of life of BPL families.

In 2001, GoI launched Valmiki Ambedkar Malin Basti Awas Yojana (VAMBAY) with the primary objective of facilitating
construction and upgrading of dwelling units in slums and providing a healthy environment by constructing community
toilets under the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign).
