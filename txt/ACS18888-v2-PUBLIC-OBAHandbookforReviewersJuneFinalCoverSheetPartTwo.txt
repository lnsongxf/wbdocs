Summary
This handbook explains the outcomes-based diagnosis and assessment (OBA) framework for private
pensions. The framework focuses on the pension outcomes that will improve people’s lives and how
private pensions can help to improve these outcomes. The OBA is an integrated framework that
addresses issues ranging from strategic vision and initial data requests to implementation and monitoring
and evaluation. The diagnosis and assessment methodology combines theoretical insights with the
practical work of a reviewer. Recommendations are tested against common implementation challenges
to enhance deliverability. The Handbook provides a wide range of references to the literature that can be
used to illustrate key issues with clients. It is intended as a first round diagnosis and assessment tool that
identifies the most important areas on which to follow-up. So it helps to support a modular approach
where priority areas are then addressed using more specialized tools.

The framework identifies five key outcomes of a pension system: efficiency, sustainability, coverage,
adequacy, and security. It builds on and deepens existing thinking, leveraging insights from a wide range
of pension practitioners and the experience of using the approach in multiple countries. For each
outcome, a set of key features has been developed. For some of the features, international standards
exist—for example, the governance of pension funds. For others, no standards exist—for example, the
scale of bodies delivering pensions. The combined list of features to review should cover all the areas that
are important to improving the contribution of private pensions to a pension system. As the evidence
changes on what works features can be added or removed. For example, it is intended that future editions
of the Handbook will include greater detail on expanding coverage to the informal sector – where practice
is developing rapidly.

This guide and the associated reviewer tools have been used in many reviews already. Using the
methodology helps to enhance transparency and comparability of reviews, whilst preserving the role for
the judgment of the expert reviewer working within or alongside partners in the countries concerned. The
aim is to help develop reforms that expand the coverage of good quality pensions – defined in terms of
their outcomes in relation to efficiency, sustainability, adequacy and security – and increase the stock of
assets that can safely fund long-run development. This requires a diversified mix of public and private
provision – and this Handbook covers the contribution private pension reforms can make to the overall
system.

Chapter One: Introduction and Outcomes
1.1 Overview
This Handbook sets out a new outcomes-based diagnosis and assessment (OBA) framework for private
pensions. It puts the pension outcomes that will improve people’s lives at the heart of an assessment
methodology designed to identify how private pensions can contribute to improving those outcomes.
The OBA for Private Pensions starts with outcomes and works back to the key features that explain the
contribution of private pensions, and the data to support enable comprehensive assessment. The key
features are reviewed in an assessment that produces a country specific diagnosis. Recommendations are
tested against common implementation challenges to enhance deliverability. The outcomes-focus helps
to link the definition of strategic vision with key indicators for monitoring and evaluation. The assessment
methodology draws on international best practice. It has been used for broad reforms of private pensions
or projects reviewing a specific outcome or concern.

The framework identifies five key outcomes of a pension system: efficiency, sustainability, coverage,
adequacy, and security and looks at how private pensions can improve these outcomes. It builds on,
and deepens, existing thinking, leveraging insights from a wide range of pension practitioners. For each
outcome, a set of key features was developed. For some of the features, international standards exist—
for example, the governance of pension funds. For others, no standards exist as yet—for example, the
scale of bodies delivering pensions. Trade-offs between outcomes make reviewer judgment critical.

The framework shows how the contribution of private pensions can be reviewed within the wider
economic and political context of an economy rather than simply focusing on legislation and regulation.
The overall framework in its simplest form is shown in Figure 1.1, which links the key areas of an economy
that affect (public and) private pensions. The approach aims to set up a modular format – where this initial
diagnosis and assessment is used to identify the highest priority areas – and these are then explored in
much greater detail. For example, an identification that costs are an issue could be followed by a detailed
cost benchmarking exercise and a change to the market structure of the pension system to reduce the
costs. Problems with unique identification could be followed by an identification (ID) module.

This modular approach has been used in the projects undertaken so far – where the initial diagnosis
and assessment helps to provide a rigorous methodology to identify the areas on which to focus. For
example, a case study referenced on Costa Rica saw the initial OBA followed by a 2-year project to develop
and implement solutions in the priority areas that involved over 100 deliverables and 2,000 pages of
inputs. But before embarking on this level of detail the OBA was critical in ensuring that the right areas
had been prioritized – and crucially that the reviewers had covered all the potential risk areas to avoid
problems with confirmation bias or reviewers gravitating to issues in which they have a particular interest
without verifying that they were the most important for the client agency.

The OBA focuses in particular on how private pension reforms can improve the overall pension
outcomes. So the overall approach as set out in Figure 1.1 needs to be refined to highlight how private
pension reforms can help to improve overall pension system outcomes. This shows a set of potential
reforms that are highlighted in more detail below – but that that show the type of interventions that are
often pursued. These can be introduced as part of a private-only reform program or one in which public
and private pensions are reformed together. Whether specific or joint reforms are preferable will depend
on the political context in a country at the time.

The OBA framework for private pensions can be used in a wide range of country diagnostic work. It has
been used in Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs), in technical assistance, or projects such as
those from the Financial Reform and Strengthening Trust Fund (FIRST) Initiative to strengthen financial
sector outcomes. For pension FSAPs, the framework provides a link between the broad-based
development assessment part of an FSAP led by the World Bank and the separate Report on Observance
of Standards and Codes (ROSC), which follows the methodology of the standard setter.

This Handbook covers both the development of the framework and its final form, including the tools
for reviewers to enable a review to both explain and use the methodology. The approach has been used
in countries of different sizes and at different levels of development. It been used for broad strategic
projects and those with more focused remits. Using the private pension OBA framework improves the
rigor and comparability of analysis focusing on the long-run objectives of reforms. It enhances the clarity
and consistency of monitoring and evaluation. The outcomes and their indicators are fully consistent with
the World Bank strategy for eradicating poverty and boosting shared prosperity sustainably. They should
be applicable to many countries seeking to achieve better pension outcomes. The particular contribution
of the report is the creation of an assessment methodology unifying theoretical insights within a practical
review tool, an accessible review of some of the key literature and a methodology to compare
international standards in financial markets in a common outcome format.

The rest of this chapter sets out the scope of the outcomes-based assessment framework for private
pensions, how it was designed, and the key elements within it. It explains why the five outcomes—
efficiency, sustainability, coverage, adequacy, and security—were chosen. It introduces some key
concepts that are developed further in subsequent chapters.

Chapter Two reviews the evidence to determine the key features that help to explain private pension
outcomes. It gives the broader context to develop private pension reforms that can improve the overall
pension system. It shows how this methodology can be augmented by emerging evidence - if it helps us
better understand how to improve performance. Chapter Two also summarizes the analysis of the
international standards relevant to pensions. This exercise was an important input to the key features. It
included a unique comparison of insurance, securities and pension standards in a common outcome
framework.

Chapter Three describes how the overall assessment framework was completed and the review tools
that were developed. It highlights the importance of including the economic and political environment
and the preconditions, as well as the importance of focusing on other pension pillars and legislation,
market structure, and supervision. It also shows how the initial diagnosis and assessment can then flow
into the development of Outcomes- and Risk-Based Supervision (O-RBS). This is a broad based approach
to Risk Based Supervision. It is anchored towards achieving specific long-term outcomes and looks at the
impact of systemic risk in an economy and pension market as well as entity specific risk assessment. It
also advocates a focus on a broad toolkit of interventions from regulation, supervision, communication
training and changing market structure as part of an on-going and dynamic discussion with market
participants, members and government.

Private pension OBAs were initially developed to be performed by experienced and skilled reviewers of
private pensions as part of a country-specific diagnostic and policy development process. However, from
using and discussing the approach with many agencies contemplating reform it is clear it may also be
useful as a self-assessment tool. It can help guide practitioners to the huge literature on pensions as well
as on the links to different international standards, as well as to provide clarity on long-run outcomes that

                                                    -3-
represent meaningful deliverables for citizens in a country. In addition, the list of key features help to
identify the most important areas for scrutiny. . Whoever, uses the framework needs to be aware that
trade-offs that exist between outcomes, so reviewer judgment is critical. The approach involves recording
the findings and judgements and assigning a risk rating to their importance and the scale of the challenge
to surface implicit comparisons and discussion of these judgements.

1.2 Context: Private Pensions as Part of a Diversified Pension System
Good pension and retirement income policy is impacted by long-run growth, macroeconomic strength,
robust financial markets, and sound social policy. This creates a challenge for the policy maker and the
reviewer seeking to improve private pensions to ensure that the process has a sufficiently broad and
forward looking perspective, as well as focusing on complex, and technical design issues. It requires a
framework that can bring global insights on what works, in a way that can be tailored to the specific
requirements of a given country. This ensures that the contribution of private pensions to a pension
system can be enhanced - to play its part in the battle to eradicate poverty, to ensure that people do not
fall back into relative poverty in old age and to use pension assets safely and sustainably to finance long-
run development—for this and future generations (Figure 1.3).

The framework was designed to help private pension reviewers to develop a coherent diagnosis and a
set of policy recommendations that help improve an overall pension system. The approach
complements that used to diagnose and improve public pensions centered on the World Bank’s actuarial
pension reform options simulation toolkit (PROST)1. It can be used in a complementary way when
considering reforms of a pension system or as the primary methodology when only the private pension
system is being reviewed. In the latter case the OBA methodology—by paying proper attention to the links
between public and private pensions—can highlight when parts of the public pension environment need
attention by public pension specialists. This was a key recommendation, for example, in the recent FSAP
in Suriname. This is similar to how a review of the bond market must take account of the banking sector
to develop robust bond market reforms but does not aim to cover reform of the entire banking system as
part of its scope. It may, however, provide important insights than can be useful to banking sector
specialists.

Figure 1.3: The Role of Private Pensions as Part of a Diversified Retirement Income System




Some issues are common to public and private pensions, whereas others are of particular importance
to one part of the system or the other. Governance and investment have elements common to everything
from funded social security plans to employer-sponsored occupational plans and individually purchased
voluntary pension plans. However, the issue and emphasis may differ. Likewise, issues of data,
identification, and information technology (IT) are common to all parts of a pension system. Other
elements are more specific to private pensions—particularly the value chain from marketing, product
development, distribution, and sales—as well as the role of pension supervisors; (even then some have a
remit that covers parts of the public pension system as well as private pensions).

The framework was developed using a clear set of guiding principles and methodology to identify the
long-run outcomes, identify indicators, determine the features driving outcomes, and then test and
adapt the methodology before finalization.

1.3 Developing the Five Outcomes
Five outcomes for pension system to which private pensions could contribute were identified. These
are: efficiency, sustainability, coverage, adequacy, and security. They were derived by experimenting
with a range of approaches and testing the outcomes against whether they provided a good guide to
understanding and developing a private pension system. This section explains how these five outcomes
were decided upon.

For consistency and ease of navigation, the outcomes are set out in the same order throughout this
document and in the related toolkit for reviewers. But the reviewer can change the order of outcomes
on which to focus. The precise order is not important—the key issue is that the outcomes are
comprehensive (for example an additional outcome is not needed) and that trade-offs between them are
explored—for example, between adequacy and sustainability or security and efficiency. The order chosen
in this Handbook came from applying the methodology in a regulatory and supervisory context, but the
user can easily change the order when conducting a review. For instance a review focused on expanding
pension provision might use them in the order: coverage, adequacy, sustainability, efficiency and security.

The 2005 World Bank book Old-Age Income Support in the 21st Century: An International Perspective
on Pension Systems and Reform set out four core outcomes: adequacy, affordability, sustainability, and
robustness (Holzmann and Hinz 2005). Contributions to economic growth were considered as a secondary
goal. Although not one of the four main outcomes, coverage of pensions was discussed in significant
detail. Adequacy and sustainability are always central to public and private pension outcomes and must
be part of any pension system framework. They continue to be used extensively both in World Bank work
and in the work of a wide range of other organizations (Schwarz and Arias 2014). The adequacy-


                                                   -6-
sustainability trade-off is one of the perennial issues in pensions and forms the center of the Global Aging
Preparedness Index (Jackson and others 2010, 2013, Help Age 2014).

Sustainability relates to fiscal challenges for governments as well as the level of contributions required
from employees and employers – particularly in Defined Benefit plans that are underfunded. This allows
a simpler but more comprehensive use of the framework across countries—from employer burdens in a
defined-benefit occupational system - to fiscal deficits in a defined contribution system, where the
transitional deficit from diverting contributions to a funded private system has not been closed. Fiscal
sustainability can be enhanced by reforming public pensions alone, or as part of a package of reforms to
public and private pensions. In some countries reforms to expand private pensions are needed to make
previous cuts in public pensions viable – since they may be politically unsustainable (and hence not create
fiscal space) if other sources of retirement income are not developed. A sustainable system should be
designed to deal with macroeconomic shocks from the outset because these will certainly occur over the
life of a pension system. The World Bank’s objectives of eradicating poverty and boosting shared
prosperity explicitly aim to achieve this sustainably —in an environmental but also in an economic and
political sense.

Coverage needs to be considered as a long-run outcome explicitly, rather than implicitly as a component
of ‘adequacy’. Improving coverage has become a central policy issue (Levy 2008; Bosch, Melguizo, and
Pages2013; Rofman, Apella, and Vezza2013; OECD 2012a, among many others). The key question for a
private pension review is the contribution that private pensions can make to coverage – noting the
challenges contributory pensions of all forms have when labor markets are highly informal. That said,
public non-contributory pensions may not exist in some countries, where initiatives to encourage informal
private savings are especially important (Bhardwaj 2014). The trade-off between adequacy and
sustainability is often a trade-off between coverage, adequacy, and sustainability, since costs can come
from extending either coverage, benefits, or both.

For private pensions an explicit focus on system efficiency is also vital. That is, how well do the entities
administering pension plans transform inputs into retirement income? This is clearly an issue for private
pension systems, where the cost of investments and the rate of return on those investments are critical2.
Pension systems can have substantial impacts on capital and labor market efficiency—both positive and
negative. Hence efficiency not only enables improvements in other outcomes—for instance, better net
investment returns that improve adequacy—but can also contribute to economic efficiency. Enhancing
the contribution of pension assets to developing long run investment, including in infrastructure, as an
additional source of finance for development is an area of growing focus (Inderst and Stewart 2014). In
the labor market longer working lives can help to create retirement income, but, other things being equal,
improved labor market participation should improve long-run growth. Extending working lives for the old
should not be seen as a threat to youth employment given that strong labor markets tend to show better
employment rates at both young and old ages (OECD 1994).

The 2012 World Bank report “International Patterns of Pension Provision II” created a particularly
important foundation (Pallares-Mirralles, Romero, and Whitehouse 2012). It sets out an updated
categorization focusing on the “performance indicators” of pensions, including not only coverage,
adequacy, and sustainability but also economic and administrative efficiency. The OBA project
experimented with including separate categories of efficiency in this way. In practice, it proved difficult to

2
 It may also be relevant for public pension systems—both when investing assets and when determining the overall
costs of the collection, recording, and payment systems (Sluchynskyy 2014).

                                                     -7-
draw the dividing lines between different elements of efficiency. This was true both in the data collection
(where some elements overlapped) and in the key features driving the outcomes (where there was often
a great deal of overlap), as in the role of governance in both costs and investment returns. Moreover, it
was important to consider costs and investment returns within the same outcome to emphasize the
importance of net-of-fee returns from invested assets rather than each element of costs or investment in
isolation.

The Private Pension OBA framework follows the logical flow from inputs to outcomes with the
associated focus on strategy and data collection and measurement. The OECD Global Pension Statistics
and Pension Markets in Focus (OECD 2013a) also informed the development of performance measures.
The data collection sheets developed for the framework use the definitions in Pallares-Mirralles, Romero,
and Whitehouse (2012) and OECD (2013a) as much as possible, adding new data requirements where
necessary. Data collection is challenging – and significant improvement is needed in most countries.

The project aimed to develop a clearer focus on security as an outcome. Security is distinct from
sustainability and more clearly focused than robustness. Security is distinct from long-run sustainability
issues because pension entities and supervisors focus on control to minimize avoidable losses within
private pension systems. Also, security includes being protected from shocks such as the potential for
government expropriation of private pension assets (which occurred in limited cases following the recent
global financial crisis). These features are separate from those that determine whether a system can be
technically sustainable. They include some elements that other authors have covered—for example, in
the robustness category in Holzmann and Hinz (2005). The OBA framework integrates the 10 International
Organization of Pension Supervisors (IOPS) Principles for Supervision (IOPS 2010a). Although these affect
other outcomes, their primary focus is whether the assets are secure from issues such as fraud and
maladministration. The OECD Principles of Occupational Pension Fund Provision (OECD 2009)3 are much
broader than the IOPS Principles on Supervision and therefore map to a wider range of outcomes (the
methodology for the mapping is set out below and is compared with other standards).

Other approaches were reviewed to build on insights from leading practitioners in the field. For
example, the Melbourne-Mercer Global Pension Index looks at sustainability, adequacy, and integrity
(ACFS and Mercer 2013). Integrity includes elements of good regulation and supervision, which the OBA
framework includes within security, but also includes costs, which fit more naturally into an assessment
of efficiency. Similarly, the American Academy of Actuaries’ AGES framework relates to alignment,
governance, efficiency, and sustainability as four elements that can “provide a framework for well-
functioning retirement plans that meet the needs of stakeholders in the retirement-income system”
(Forward-Thinking Task Force 2014). So two of the outcomes are shared. The pension OBA framework
sees governance and alignment as contributory factors rather than as outcomes in themselves; either
way, they are a vital part of the story.

The OECD Pension Outlook (OECD 2012a) uses sustainability, adequacy, and coverage as well, but splits
efficiency into administrative and investment efficiency and has a separate category for labor market.
Testing in country reviews found it simpler and more powerful to bring efficiency into a single category
and to integrate labor market impacts with efficiency and coverage. But the similarities are more
important than the differences and represent a shared desire to focus on improving the long-run

 All references to OECD principles and standards are to the current principles as of 2015. New principles are
expected to be agreed by the end of 2016. At this point the mapping from standards to outcomes and key features
will be updated.

outcomes from pension systems. Finally, the International Social Security Association (ISSA) have a
concept of ‘dynamism’ as one of their five principles of good governance (ISSA 2013). This is an attractive
feature as it explicitly requires the government agency, regulator or supervisor to proactively address
issues that are identified that are a threat to good outcomes. This principle is embedded in the overall
ethos of the OBA – by having a broad overall diagnosis, setting out a clear long-run vision and then
implementing the most effective solutions to tackle risks to the long-run objective.

Equity is a critical feature of a pension system that has been integrated with the five outcomes, rather
than identified as an outcome in its own right. Other authors have taken a different approach—as in the
International Monetary Fund’s “Equitable and Sustainable Pensions” (Clements, Eich, and Gupta 2014)—
by highlighting equity separately. As set out later in the section on data collection and the indicators for
each of the long-run outcomes, the distribution of benefits is central to understanding the performance
of a pension system. Coverage needs to focus on who is covered by age, gender, region, or some other
relevant dimension. The key commonality is that equity is important, but should be a component of each
of the five outcomes.

Increasing national savings can be seen as an additional objective – but is one that is not separately
identified in the framework. In theory the development of private pensions can increase national savings.
It can be used as a tool to reduce reliance on attracting foreign capital to fund investment and reduce the
exposure of a country to external shocks (World Bank 2011). The driver for pension reforms can
sometimes come from a focus on old age income and sometimes from a macroeconomic perspective
(World Bank 2014e). But such an impact depends not only on a successful pension reform but also the
impact of fiscal policy and corporate savings. A number of pension reforms in Eastern Europe diverted
part of the social security / Pay As You Go contributions to privately funded savings, but never filled the
gap in revenue to social security as intended – whether through additional taxes, the use of privatization
revenues or reductions in costs through parametric reforms (Price and Rudolph 2013). Untangling the
determinants of savings and the impact of different policies is econometrically challenging – and there
are a range of results, with some showing a positive impact from pension reforms on national savings or
other variables such as economic growth (Schmidt-Hebbel and Serven 1997, Loayza and others 2000,
Davis and Hu 2008, Acuña and others 2013 and Bijlsma and others 2014, Grigoli and others 2014). A
pension reform ultimately is justified by its impact on delivering income in retirement for people who
would otherwise have no or limited resources. The wider macroeconomic impacts are relevant – but this
shifting in consumption can be welfare improving even if there is no increase in net national savings. So
this Handbook does not cover the broader macro-fiscal analysis and reform program that would be
needed to have a concerted approach to raising national savings. Instead it focuses on best practice in
private pension reforms that could be a part of such a wider macro-fiscal reform.

The framework keeps all five outcomes as a set rather than having some elements flow into others or
be a subset of others. For example, thought was given to including efficiency and security as factors
contributing to sustainability, adequacy, and coverage. But it was recognized that improving efficiency
can be an economic benefit in itself. Moreover, there is a choice about the application of efficiency gains.
They could improve adequacy, coverage, sustainability, or even security if, for example, gains are used to
bail out funds in the event of fraud or default. Improved efficiency could allow a country to redirect capital
and labor to other priorities, hence improving growth. So efficiency needs to be considered alongside
other outcomes, not subsumed within them. Likewise, improving security does not just underpin
coverage, sustainability, and adequacy directly but also affects the trust in a pension system. There is a
similarity in that reducing crime, and the fear of crime, can each be seen as outcomes.

In conclusion, the five outcomes draw a clear line from earlier work, updating it, providing important
new contributions particularly in relation to efficiency and security, and ensuring a strong link to efforts
to improve data collection. In work with numerous countries, the aim is to develop or reform private
pensions in order to expand the coverage of good quality pensions – to ensure the provision of income in
retirement through pension systems that have broad coverage and are adequate, efficient, sustainable
and secure; and to increase the supply of pension assets that can safely fund long-term investment (World
Bank 2016b).

1.4 Defining the Five Outcomes
The development of the five key outcomes involved a process of refining their definitions and
developing measures of success, including the data collection process. The key definitions are set out
below. The associated reviewer toolkit starts with these definitions at the head of each section.

Efficiency: Maximizing net-of-fee returns by improving investment and cost performance subject to
acceptable risks. Efficiency also relates to the efficiency of the labor and capital markets, as each interacts
with the pension system through direct contributions to pensions (through longer working lives and
contributions, lower costs of capital, or greater financial inclusion) as well as through indirect
contributions to jobs and investment. For labor markets, this includes removing disincentives for work or
formal work caused by excessive contributions or contributing to growth by increasing labor market
participation at older ages. For capital markets, it relates to capital market depth through the
development of non-bank financial capital to fund productive investment and maximize the benefits of
wider capital market reforms—for example, in securities markets and infrastructure financing.

Sustainability: Ensuring that the promised retirement income will be delivered for this and future
generations without placing burdens on government, employers, or workers for financing that will not
be met. Sustainability is inherently improved by a diversified set of pillars or tiers so that one part of the
system, public or private, does not have to bear all of the weight of long-run demographic trends.
Sustainability also relates to political and individual support—with a technically viable reform having
sustainability challenges if political consensus is weak, public expectations are not realistic, the system is
not equitable, or intergenerational inequity is high.

Coverage: Maximizing the proportion of the working-age population that is accumulating retirement
income entitlements and the proportion of retirees receiving such financial support in retirement.
Coverage encompasses measures to include informal and other difficult-to-reach workers within
retirement benefit accumulation. This includes building on innovations in ID and IT and having multiple
channels into contributory pensions. It also includes a recognition that expanding targeted
noncontributory “social” pensions will be necessary if full coverage of income in old-age is to be achieved
– emphasizing there are limits to private pensions and hence the need to build diversified pension
systems. The coverage outcome includes the impact of a wide range of policies, including broad eligibility
rules, tax relief, educational support, and improved compliance and formality. This is a rapidly developing
area in relation to the informal sector. Extensions to the OBA framework will be developed in the future
– integrating insights from work developing coverage expansion strategies, pilots and implementation
initiatives in a number of countries.

Adequacy: Ensuring people accumulate retirement benefit entitlements that protect them from
poverty, allow them to share in increased prosperity, and that people are protected against a severe
drop in living standards at retirement, taking account of other sources of financial support. In
contributory systems, adequacy involves ensuring sufficient and equitable contributions during retirees’

                                                    - 10 -
working careers in order to generate adequate retirement benefits. It can be measured in a range of ways,
which include retirement income as a percentage of average wages, poverty levels, and own (career)
earnings. It also relates to outcomes immediately after retirement and, as people age, to reflect the
impact of inflation on retirement income over time. And it is essential to see who has inadequate
pensions—for example, to include the distribution by gender, income, and other characteristics.

Security: Ensuring the security of assets to minimize the risk that funds that have been (or should have
been) accumulated to provide retirement benefits are lost or misappropriated before the benefits are
delivered. The importance of long-run growth in assets is central to the promise of pensions. But this is
of no use if the assets are not there in 50 years when they are needed to generate income. So security
covers a wide range of elements, including basic conditions, such as the enforceability of law; accounting,
actuarial, and auditing capacity; data and payment systems; valuations and risk management; and control
frameworks. It also covers the processes to ensure the recovery of any permitted shortfalls in assets (for
example, in defined-benefit plans). Security relates to the performance of the supervisor as well as
compensation mechanisms and protection of assets from government or employer expropriation.

In reality, of course, these outcomes overlap. For example, good governance may contribute directly to
security and efficiency and indirectly to sustainability. Effective supervision may affect all of the outcomes.
To avoid too much duplication, decisions were taken on which features should be linked to which
outcomes, based generally on where the evidence of causality is strongest. Even so, a few features have
been replicated—for instance, tax and financial incentives are included under both coverage and
adequacy where the live-testing revealed that this worked better.

Furthermore, trade-offs between the outcomes are often important when framing the
recommendations arising from pension system assessments. Expert judgment is essential in making the
right trade-offs. These judgments are likely to be system specific and to take account of economic and
political realities as well as the practicalities of implementation. Hence it would be difficult and perhaps
misleading to construct an overall index with weights for each outcome in an effort to automate or
quantify the trade-offs and to make decisions on priorities.

1.5 Measuring the Five Key Outcomes
An intended output of the pension OBA framework is improved clarity of and focus on data collection
and evaluation. The framework includes a set of data collection sheets that document both the core data
needed to understand each pension system and to evaluate system performance. Some elements are
purely descriptive—for example, the number of providers. But when combined with other measures—
like market size—they produce key information such as provider scale that helps to evaluate the efficiency
of the system. This mirrors the approach in the Global Financial Development Reports for 2013 and 2014
(World Bank 2013a, 2014a).

Data collection should be a key part of any private pension review, but often there are significant gaps.
Use of the framework is intended to identify, prioritize, and fill these gaps. The aim is progressive
improvement in data reliability, even if starting from a low base4. The definitions should be sufficiently
tight to enable a degree of comparability between countries, while recognizing that full comparability is
often not possible. Figure 1.5provides examples of potential measures in each outcome.

1.6 Adding Implementation to the Strategy Tool
The OBA framework integrates consideration of implementation from the start of a project. In many
cases a wide range of changes will be recommended that could affect primary legislation, market
structure, regulation, guidance, or supervisory organization or processes. Such broad scope necessitates
a reform project, which is often challenging.

So the OBA includes a short checklist asking questions about the implementation process and reflecting
the literature on challenges and risks to the delivery of complex projects. It was derived from guidance
issued by the U.K. Office of Government Commerce and National Audit Office distilling the lessons of
success and failure. A key aim was to ensure a clear implementation “module” or set of questions. A focus
on the most important changes to affect the long-term outcomes, combined with a focus on whether a
reform package can be implemented given scarce institutional capacity and competing priorities, is an
important part of adding value when working with country authorities (Rodrik 2007). For some countries,
the World Bank has a set of implementation ratings for pensions developed as part of its work on social
protection (World Bank 2015).

1.7Linking the OBA to Risk Based Supervision
One of the most important uses of the framework is as the starting point in the development of risk
based supervision for pensions. The Risk Based Supervision approach has been enhanced to stress the
importance of Outcomes- and Risk-Based Supervision – that is – one can only assess the right risks if you
have a clear statement of the outcomes that you want to achieve. Moreover, these outcomes are best
stated as something that is of real value to pension members. Figure 1.7 shows how the initial OBA
exercise flows into a structure O-RBS process to identify the risks to the long-run outcomes, the best
solutions to these risks and then to track implementation against clear success measures.

In conclusion the private pension OBA seeks to deliver an integrated strategic process with a clear flow
from desired outcomes and impacts to a country-focused diagnosis offering recommendations for
reform, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. The ability to trace the effects from inputs to
outputs to outcomes and impacts is important in demonstrating the value of projects and providing the
type of robust framework for expected results (see, for example, FIRST 2014).

Chapter Two: Developing the Key Features That Drive Outcomes
2.1     Sources of Evidence for the OBA Key Features
Having defined the long-run pension outcomes, the next stage was to determine the key features that
help to drive these outcomes—derived from a broad range of sources (Figure 2.1). The framework was
designed to be flexible and simple-to-update when new evidence becomes available. For example, if a
particular feature once thought to be important turns out to be less so, the feature can be taken out of
the assessment framework or its reduced importance can be signaled in the detailed feature descriptions.
Similarly, if new or additional evidence points to a new feature, it can be easily added into the framework.

Figure 2.1 Sources of Evidence for Key Features That Explain Outcomes




A balance is needed between a list of features that is comprehensive and one that is manageable to
review and discuss in an initial diagnosis. The aim was not to issue 400 pages of guidance that must be
followed when making an assessment. The piloting process helped to determine which areas needed their
own focus and which could be grouped within one feature. So some features are supported by multiple
sources of evidence. In particular, some features cover both accumulation and payout phases, which have
distinct literature. Likewise, this Handbook aims to highlight the most compelling sources, rather than to
offer a full literature review.

A full list of the key features is presented in Figure 2.2, which is split into the long-run outcomes. This
provides the core of the assessment framework. It facilitates assessments that use a combination of desk
research and interviews with a wide range of players in a country to review each key feature. A simple
summary OBA background report is produced that covers each of the key features. This is a core input for
the final report and recommendations. The final report should focus on those areas that are most
important to a particular country or a particular review. These will vary widely between countries. But the
preparation of the OBA background report provides a structured process for gathering evidence and
identifying important issues. It allows judgments on relative importance of issues to be scrutinized and
also provides a resource for future projects that can build on the original analysis – and may have a
different focus and hence need to prioritize other reforms.

2.2 The Role of International Standards
The key features that drive the outcomes have been mapped against international principles, standards,
and implementing guidelines on pensions (from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development/International Organisation of Pension Supervisors, OECD/IOPS), insurance (International
Association of Insurance Supervisors, IAIS), and securities (International Organization of Securities
Commissions, IOSCO).This is the first side-by-side comparison of international standards in a common
outcomes-based evaluation.5 It shows, naturally, that the OECD/IOPS standards have a broader coverage
of factors affecting long-run pension outcomes, but that the IAIS and IOSCO standards have a deeper
treatment of some issues, particularly relating to the security of the (pension) system—for example, IAIS
and fair, efficient, transparent, and deep capital markets. A mapping tool was developed that links
principles, standards, and guidance6 to the outcomes and key features presented in the OBA framework.
This allows a reviewer and country client to know if a particular area of focus is linked to a standard or
not. This mapping can be updated easily as standards evolve7.

There are good reasons why international standards will not cover all of the outcomes or key features
relevant to delivering the best outcomes from a pension system. Some areas, like the importance of
scale, are profoundly important for outcomes, but are difficult to codify in a standard. Moreover, standard
setters are typically most focused on the security aspects, given their membership and remit. The OBA
project has sought to provide an overall framework into which standards could be integrated, to draw
together global best practice, and to foster continued positive cooperation between the World Bank and
the standard setters. In the terminology of an FSAP, the World Bank focuses on the development
assessment when reviewing a country and hence includes all features important for development,
whereas a standard setter focuses on standards and codes.

2.3 Key Features of Efficiency
The efficiency outcome is supported by 14 features, including the impact of scale, the governance of
pension funds, and the role of capital and labor markets. This section provides an overview of some of
the most compelling evidence for each key feature, rather than a full review of the literature. A good
general introduction to many of the investment-related issues is provided by “Evaluating the Financial
Performance of Pension Funds” (Hinz and others 2010), along with the literature reviewed in its various
chapters (e.g. Rudolph and others 2010), so this information is not repeated in detail here.




5
 A separate working paper will be published comparing international standards, so the full details are not presented
here. The material used for the mapping includes IOPS (2010b), OECD (2010), IAIS (2011), and IOSCO (2010).
6
  The guidance currently mapped includes OECD (2012b), OECD/IOPS (2011a, 2011b), and IOPS (2008, 2009).
7
   The OECD is at an advanced stage of completing new Principles for Private Pension Regulation. Once these have
been finalized, it will be simple to remap the links between standards and outcomes and to update the associated
tools for reviewers, which highlight where a particular outcome or key feature is linked to a standard and where it
is not.

Scale. The Cost-Effectiveness Benchmarking, Inc. (CEM) database8 provides evidence showing that both
gross and net returns correlate with size of pension fund(Ambachtsheer, Capelle, and Lum 2006; Dyck,
Alexander, and Pomorski 2011; Cummings 2012, Bikker and others 2012 and Bikker 2013). This picture is
confirmed by many studies and other benchmarking data, for example, from Hymans Robertson (2013),
from reviews conducted as part of the Cooper Review in Australia (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu 2009; Super
System Review Committee 2010, from the Investment Company Institute (2011) for a wide range of
defined-contribution plans in the United States, and from Lane Clark Peacock LLP (2013) for smaller
occupational funds in the United Kingdom. These drivers are examined for Latin American markets in a
publication that also highlights the overall importance of market structure, which is discussed in greater
detail below (Impavido, Lasagabaster, and García-Huitrón 2010).The reasons why scale drives
performance are various and include a heightened ability to benefit from greater investment in
governance as well as economies of scale more generally. Good data on costs and size are often lacking,
and having improved the data could be useful in many projects (see also the discussion of costs).

Member-focused governance. Ambachtsheer has used the CEM evidence to show that good governance
is worth at least 1 percent a year in net investment returns (Ambachtsheer, Capelle and Lum 2006) and
more recently re-stated the central role of governance in pension outcomes (Ambachtsheer 2016). The
importance of governance is seen in the focus given to it by major funds around the world (ATP
2013).Research from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has found persistence in
returns over time, which suggests that good governance has an effect. Both CEM and APRA have shown
that not-for-profit pension funds outperform commercial pension funds (Sy 2008) or mutual funds (Bauer,
Cremers, and Frehen 2010), indicating that their greater member focus has a significant effect. Other
research using Polish pension funds (Jackowicz and Kowalewski 2011) has shown that independent board
members can improve the performance of commercial pension fund investment. APRA research shows a
correlation between good governance and lower operational as well as investment costs, suggesting that
governance is relevant to more than investment efficiency (Sy and Liu 2009).

Expertise of governing body. Expertise is a key attribute of high-performing governance as defined by
Ambachtsheer and colleagues (1998, 2006, 2008) in their research correlating investment performance
with governance and the work from Professor Gordon Clark, Roger Urwin, and others (Clark, Caerlewy-
Smith, and Marshall 2006; Clark and Urwin 2008). Many of the features have been reviewed in previous
World Bank studies (Holzmann and Hinz 2005; Holzmann, Hinz, and Dorfman 2008),including member-
focused governance, robust strategy process, role of advisers and investment managers, competition,
choice and transfers, cost-effective distribution and intermediaries, cost control, caps and transparency,

and efficient operations, recordkeeping, and data. Both publications emphasize the importance of
avoiding (or at least reducing) labor market distortions if a system is to be economically efficient.

Robust strategy process. A robust strategy is another of the key attributes of governance identified by
Ambachtsheer and colleagues and by Clark and Urwin, among many others. All of the elements of
governance and strategy were reviewed in an important book on international experience regarding how
to improve governance and investment strategy in public pension funds that invest assets (Rajkumar and
Dorfman 2010). They have also been the subject of regulatory attention (APRA 2013). Many of its lessons
are equally applicable to private sector or arm’s-length not-for-profit funds, including those in
occupational systems. Further experience from practitioners on investment management of a range of
public pension assets and reserve funds has been gathered through a series of annual conferences
arranged by the World Bank Treasury9 as well as the Toronto Centre and Rotman International Centre for
Pension Management.

Controls on advisers and investment managers are another key attribute of governance. CEM
researchers and APRA have hypothesized that the ability to negotiate better deals helps large funds to
reduce costs, while funds with in-house investment management, which can presumably be better
controlled, outperform funds that outsource investment management (Dyck and others 2011). Controls
are particularly important to ensure a clear understanding, because reliable added value is problematic
to deliver (Tonks 2006, Bauer and Kicken 2008, Bauer and others 2010, Koedijk and others 2010).

Optimal long-term investment strategy and appropriate limits. Optimal strategy is another key attribute
of governance, and there is considerable literature showing a correlation between investment style and
returns (Koedijk, Slager, and Bauer 2010) and the potential benefits can be obtained from greater
allocations to illiquid investments (Cummings and Ellis 2011). Strategic asset allocation is a key driver of
long-run investment returns and their variability (Brinson, Hood, and Beebower 1986; Brinson, Singer, and
Beebower 1991). It is important, however, to ensure these results are properly understood when drawing
policy conclusions (Ibbotson and Kaplan 2000). OECD modeling and analysis (Antolín 2009) provides
further evidence supporting the importance of this feature. This process covers the impact of different
quantitative approaches to regulating investment risk on retirement income stemming from defined-
contribution pension plans. It is important to get the regulations right to avoid unintended consequences
(Srinivas and Yermo 1999). The potential role of benchmarks for long-run investment returns includes
improving investment strategy, governance, and efficiency (Stewart 2014). World Bank analysis supports
the regulation of optimal asset allocation in defined-contribution as well as defined-benefit pension funds
(Castañeda and Rudolph 2011).It also covers the appropriateness of quantitative limits, the potentially
suboptimal impact of competition and choice unless they are well regulated, and how the interests of
members and fund managers can be aligned, avoiding conflicts of interest and contributing to member-
focused governance. Other modeling based on analysis of available research has identified problems with
participant investment choice and indicates why it is good practice to provide default portfolios (Viceira
2010).

Fair, efficient, deep, and transparent capital markets. The need for fair, efficient, deep, and transparent
capital markets has been highlighted in a range of research, including research on the preconditions for
successful private pension reforms (Rudolph and Rocha 2009), and is covered extensively in the IOSCO
guidelines (IOSCO 2010). Evidence from many FSAPs and other pension system reviews indicates that

limited domestic capital market development is a major constraint on efficient pension fund investing in
many less-developed countries, while pension funds can in some circumstances encourage market
development (Chan-Lau 2004). The impact of weak capital markets is especially serious where limits on
foreign investment are tight, as these have been shown to constrain optimal asset allocation through
market diversification (Roldos 2004; Oxera Consulting 2007; Berstein and Chumacero 2003). Furthermore,
where investment abroad is restricted, there may be asset bubbles and other detrimental effects on
domestic financial markets. There is also evidence that investment by pension funds in good-quality
infrastructure projects can spur economic development (Calderón and Servén 2014), but this requires a
clear-sighted and well-structured asset allocation process (Inderst and Stewart 2014).

Cost control, caps, and transparency. Different countries use different approaches to address the issue
of cost control. Cost vary very significant between countries and over time (Covera and others 2006, Tapia
and Yermo 2008, Hernandez and Stewart 2008, Ionescu and Robles 2014). It is important not to take a
naïve approach, because it is important to invest in some elements such as governance and expertise
(Ambachtsheer 2005). Costs can be extremely difficult to identify fully as there can be many hidden layers
of costs that make it difficult even for experts to understand the full picture (Pitt-Watson and others 2014).
APRA research has pointed to the likelihood that investment costs are sometimes hidden, worsening cost
control at less well-governed funds (Sy and Liu 2009). This echoes a finding from the Netherlands
regarding the prevalence of hidden investment costs (AFA2011). There is no consensus on the right mix
of policy responses to reduce costs and fees, but transparency alone does not appear to have a particularly
strong track record. For example, even where there is very good transparency and excellent annual
reporting from an independent body, as in Turkey (Pension Fund Monitoring Center 2013), the impact on
outcomes is limited, and market structure and demand and supply conditions tend to dominate. In this
case, fees have fallen in direct relation to the reductions in the fee caps set by the Turkish Treasury. The
interest in caps as part of a broad set of tools has extended recently to areas not traditionally associated
with such interventions, such as the United Kingdom and Hong Kong SAR, China.

Competition, choice and transfers, and cost-effective distribution and intermediaries have received
renewed attention as part of the growing literature on participant inertia and the impact of switching.
Research shows that in Latin American mandatory systems switching was correlated primarily with sales
agent activity and in only a limited way, if any, with returns or fees (Berstein and Cabrita 2007; Calderón-
Colin, Domínguez, and Schwartz 2008). Despite competition, charges to affiliates varied substantially,
while sales agents’ costs substantially increased the size needed for a pension fund to be considered
efficient. Evidence from the Swedish pension system (Sunden 2014) shows that very low costs can be
achieved where the system is designed to achieve economies of scale in administrative functions
(operational efficiency) and where a strong supply side minimizes marketing and investment costs.

Auctions have been used to try to reduce the costs associated with distribution and sales agents in Chile
and Peru (Canta 2014). In Chile the results of the auction do not automatically lead to lower fees for the
whole market because companies that do not win the auction do not have to lower their fees to members.
Even if they do win an auction, the winning bid only applies to new members. However, in Peru, bidders
have to pass on their bid price to all current members. Even countries with mature systems are
investigating auctions, as growing scale has not led to the reduction in fees expected (Price 2016a). Other
countries have conducted specific campaigns to reduce the impact of sales agents and hence lower costs
and fees (Rocha, Vittas, and Rudolph 2010; Ashcroft, Price, and Robles 2015).

The importance of reviewing market structure and the value chain to improve costs and fees is an
important element for private pension reforms. In the United Kingdom, the Turner Commission reviewed

                                                    - 20 -
international experience(Pensions Commission 2005), noting that, even where participation is mandatory,
competition by itself is not guaranteed to achieve this objective, especially if, as in Australia,10 marketing
costs are high. The Swedish and Danish experiences illustrate that significantly lower costs can be achieved
in national schemes for collection and account administration, with a well-governed and independent
body delivering or purchasing fund management services in bulk. Subsequent U.K. experience has shown
that auto-enrollment with its associated scale benefits and a state-sponsored not-for-profit pension fund
with strong governance and a low-cost mandate (National Employment Savings Trust) can drive down
charges. Competition by itself appears to be inadequate to drive lower costs if individual choice alone is
involved. Lack of transparency is a big issue in determining costs (OFT 2013).

Regarding the efficiency of the transition to the payout phase, a review of the development of the
annuity market in Chile has shown how policy developments have improved efficiency outcomes
through regulation(Rocha and Thorburn 2007).This is also relevant to securing cost-effective distribution
and intermediaries, with the Sistema de Consultas y Ofertas de Monto de Pensión (SCOMP)being a
globally leading example of an intermediation system that reduces transition losses and influences
developments elsewhere in the world. Further research on this subjecting five other countries supports
these findings (Rocha, Vittas, and Rudolph 2011). In particular, the experience of annuity regulation in
Switzerland demonstrates the value of strong regulation of annuity pricing as well as the challenges of
implementing it in a manner that is flexible enough to avoid solvency problems. The existence of excessive
costs at the payout phase has also been highlighted in the United Kingdom (Harrison 2012). Ashcroft and
Stewart (2010) provide a good overview of a range of design issues in relation to Defined Contribution
pensions. More recently the UK has removed the effective requirement for annuitization. This has inspired
some innovative thinking about how to secure retirement income flows using a combination of phased
withdrawals and later life deferred annuities (NEST 2015).

Efficient operational, record keeping, and data management are covered extensively in the
international standards already referenced. However, the importance of data management is often
overlooked as part of the design of new pension systems, with notable exceptions (Barr and Diamond
2009). The issue is discussed both in efficiency, which relates to how effectively a system is using its data,
and in security, which relates to the impact of data loss or theft. For innovative ways to use modern IT to
link fingerprint identification to existing national databases in India, see Bhardwaj (2014).

A contributory or Bismarckian system can be inadequate to extend coverage to the entire labor force,
particularly in countries with high rates of informality and impacts on labor market participation need
to be understood. Trying to mandate excessive contributions can adversely affect the level and structure
of employment—for instance, by promoting informality and reducing participation rates (Frölich and
others 2014). Interactions with means-tested benefits need to be handled carefully (Bosch and
Manacorda 2012, Borsch-Supan and others 2013). Portability is a generally desirable feature in standards,
although some evidence suggests that the benefits for labor market efficiency are overstated.
Nevertheless, they may be valuable for other reasons (Forteza 2008). The capacity to minimize labor
market distortions as a criterion for judging the ability of a pension system to contribute to output and
growth is an important factor in related World Bank work (Rudolph and Rocha 2009). Some countries or
companies have rules that do not allow someone to draw a pension and continue to work. This
impacts labor market efficiency as well – and prevents working longer, perhaps part-time, from
being a solution to the retirement income challenge.

 The issue of charges in Australia is being addressed by reforms based on the Cooper Report (Super System
Review Committee 2010).

2.4 Key Features of Sustainability
Figure 2.4Features Supporting the Sustainability Outcome
     1. Diversification among pillars or tiers     5. Government costs sustainably funded
     2. Intended outcomes are realistic            6. Affordable employer and employee costs
     3. Understanding of intended outcomes         7. Effective and countercyclical adjustment
         and risks                                    mechanisms
     4. Political support

Sustainability, coverage, and adequacy are clearly interrelated, and reforms attempting to achieve one
outcome potentially affect the others. This highlights the importance of building diverse pension
systems with both public and private elements. The Chilean pension reforms in 1981 have been much
studied and praised for their impact on sustainability, but such an exclusively contributory, privately
funded model was always going to struggle to ensure broad coverage. For this reason, major reforms were
needed in 2008 to introduce a zero pillar to ensure near-universal coverage (of some retirement income)
and complement the large funded defined-contribution system. The same journey was taken following
the 1997 Mexican reforms, which replaced the public system with a fully private contributory system for
new private sector workers entering the labor force, again for sustainability reasons.11 But in a series of
changes the Mexican government has begun to fill in the gaps in retirement income that were left under
the post-1997 system, starting with the 70 y Mas Program and gradually extending the scope of ‘social
pensions’.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has set out a framework for understanding the drivers of long-
run fiscal sustainability and for discussing potential high-level policy reforms to offset the impact of
demographic trends (Clements, Eich, and Gupta 2014). This provides invaluable cross-country evidence
on how different countries and regions are dealing with the rising fiscal burden caused by falling birth
rates and rising longevity and how different policy measures have partly offset these trends, but so far
proved insufficient. Related work by the IMF has suggested a sovereign asset-liability management (SALM)
approach that aims to bring powerful actuarial techniques that are used in defined-benefit pension fund
modeling to long-run public finance forecasting (IMF 2014). This helps to build on and complement other
techniques for calculating implicit debt (Holzmann and others 2004). However, both types of exercise
would not be possible within the scope of the original OBA diagnostic, but could be something
recommended for deeper analysis – bringing in additional experts to conduct the analysis.

The importance of balance between the pillars is also supported by evidence that reducing second pillar
contributions increases ultimate public debt and may be unsustainable (see Egert 2012 for one
example). World Bank research across Europe and the former Soviet Union countries documents the
negative effect that overly generous zero and first pillars can have when they try to fulfill all the tasks of
a pension system (Schwarz and Arias 2014). This research highlights a common problem of policy makers
or sponsors not recognizing the eventual costs of defined-benefit systems, whether public or private, once
they mature. The European Union describes the importance of a range of these features in its 2012 Aging
White Paper (European Commission 2012).


11
  The impact on sustainability was moderated by an extremely long transition period, as workers with one day of
contributions in the old system could retire under the pre-1997 benefit formula rather than under the post-1997
system.

                                                     - 22 -
Fiscal reforms are an important part of ensuring sustainability when contributions previously directed
to public pension pillars are partly redirected to funded privately-run pillars (Price and Rudolph
2013).There is also evidence on the risk that funded pensions will be perceived as taxes, which may
weaken political support for them (Leszek, Laursen, and Skrok 2008). Positive lessons can be learned from
a range of international pension commissions, including the U.K. experience of introducing automatic
enrollment, arising from a rigorous government-commissioned but independent review that obtained
cross-party support for its conclusions. Its recommendations focused on using automatic enrollment for
employer-chosen pension funds to augment unfunded government pensions and deliver a sustainable
and realistic overall replacement rate (Bouchal and Norris 2014).

Turning to effective and countercyclical adjustment mechanisms, research on the pro-cyclical and
return-reducing impacts of funding and accounting rules (Severinson and Yermo 2012) and
guidelines12emphasizes the importance of making funding and solvency rules for defined-benefit plans
countercyclical. Research on the payout phase across five countries (Rocha, Vittas, and Rudolph 2011)
supports the importance of retirement product risk sharing. In particular, it demonstrates how flexibility
to cope with changing circumstances can be implemented through retirement product risk sharing.
Another example of adjustment mechanisms is provided by the automatic link between annuity rates and
longevity and interest rates that is built into the Swedish income and premium pension arrangements and
has been effective in keeping this system financially stable (Sunden 2014), although this inevitably involves
a trade-off with adequacy (Barr 2013). More generally, there are strong advantages to linking retirement
ages to longevity (Schwan and Sail 2013).

Research and reform experience that started with the publication of Averting the Old-Age Crisis have
emphasized the centrality of and reasons for adopting a multi-pillar approach to pension system design
(World Bank 1994). Although much has changed in the interim, the central insight—that certain pillars or
tiers have advantages in targeting particular outcomes—remains important, as does the importance of a
long-term, credible commitment by the government.

 4. Publicity and education

Eligibility for participation is clearly a fundamental requirement for gaining access to pensions,
particularly via employers. If a person is not eligible due to age, length of service, or other reasons, then
clearly he or she will not be covered. The OECD guidelines relevant to this outcome focus on the need to
provide wide nondiscriminatory access (equal treatment) to employer-sponsored pension plans, while
noting that these are often provided voluntarily. Long vesting periods, in particular, act against good
coverage for women, who tend to have more broken career paths than men.

Tax and financial incentives. This feature is closely related to incentives for improving adequacy,
although the effectiveness of such incentives may vary between the two outcomes. Furthermore, the

     OECD Guidelines 3.16 and 3.17.

                                                   - 23 -
approach to encouraging someone to join a plan can be different from the approach to encouraging a
person to continue participating. Evidence from across the European Union indicates that tax incentives
can make a contribution to improving coverage but have their limitations (European Commission 2008).
For instance, concerns have been raised about their redistributive effects. Reforms in Turkey in 2013 to
replace tax relief in voluntary pensions with matching contributions appear to have had a significant
impact on increasing enrollment (Pension Fund Monitoring Center 2013). Evidence from an innovative
pilot in the United Kingdom has shown that higher match rates were more effective at encouraging people
to join a saving plan, but had little impact on overall levels of saving, which were guided by maximum
saving limits (Price 2013). This has similarities to the generous initial matches in the NPS (New Pension
System) or Swavalambum plan in India (PFRDA 2014) and in the Kiwi Saver plans in New Zealand.

Mandatory, behavioral, or social stimulus to participate. A range of evidence shows that much higher
coverage is achieved in mandatory or quasi-mandatory private pensions than is achieved in voluntary
private pensions.(Antolín, Payet, and Yermo 2012; Munnell and Quinby 2009). In addition to systems
made mandatory by law, this category can include systems, such as in the Netherlands, where
participation is made mandatory by social partnership agreements. However, such agreements can be
very difficult to replicate in countries with no tradition of such ‘tripartite’ bargaining.

These findings are similar to those from the work on incentives for participation and evidence from
behavioral economics (Madrian 2012; Beshears and others 2006; Benartzi and Thaler 2013). In particular,
there is evidence that providing workers with incentives to save through matched contributions can
increase participation rates, but the effect is limited (Hinz and others 2013).More recently there may be
more positive evidence from Turkey that they are successful in raising private pension coverage (Pension
Fund Monitoring Center 2013). Other evidence similarly suggests that transferring a voluntary tax-
incentivized pension saving model to less-developed countries may be even less effective, not least
because most of the workers targeted pay no tax and because of administrative barriers (Palacios and
Orzag 2012). By contrast, the effect of automatic enrollment on participation is substantial, with relatively
few workers choosing to opt out—experience that was replicated in the United Kingdom (Pension
Regulator 2014), where awareness-raising publicity was a significant element in the success of the
program (Bouchal and Norris 2014).

Publicity and education. These are deliberately split between the more high-level publicity campaigns
and more hands-on attempts to increase financial literacy. The financial education campaigns tend to
have simpler, more action-oriented approaches to persuade someone to take a key decision—for
example, to join a plan or not to opt-out (Atkinson 2012, IOPS 2011, Swedish Pension Agency 2011).
Financial education, in contrast, can range from providing simple messages to giving people a detailed
understanding to help them to make investment allocation decisions. There is a huge amount of literature
with a range of results, including showing a positive impact on asset building to finding little positive
impact (Mitchell and Lusardi 2014, Carpena and others 2011, Xu and Zia 2012).

Breadth of providers' target market. This feature in part draws upon the extensive literature on financial
inclusion and the importance of access to a financial services provider (World Bank 2014d). It links to
the obvious fact that having contributory private pension plan is difficult if there is no reliable way to
transfer contributions to a pension account. However, the potential scope and delivery channels are
changing rapidly. The issue of labor market informality was a key theme in the Sixth Global Pension and
Saving Conference, which included case studies on improving coverage in informal sectors in India
(Bhardwaj 2014) and Kenya (Odundo 2014). The case studies showed positive impacts from using modern
IT and mobile telephone technology to broaden the market accessible to providers and facilitate

                                                   - 24 -
participation. This is a rapidly developing area – on which there are a number of current projects, whose
results will be developed into case studies in due course. The Seventh Global Pension and Saving
Conference will show-case latest developments in the field.

Enforcement. Ensuring that pension payments are made (the ‘missing pension’ issue) or are made on
time (the ‘late payment’ issues) has implications for both coverage and adequacy. The enforcement of
contributions has not received as much attention as it should in the pension literature; it is more usually
associated with attempts to improve tax compliance (Russell 2010). However, some exceptions provide
interesting insights into the importance of incentives and compliance mechanisms in pensions (Kumler,
Verhoogen and Frías 2013, Pension Regulator 2013b).

Reducing incentives for labor market informality. Although mandatory private defined-contribution
systems can lead to good affiliation rates for the formal workforce, they have significant problems for
the informal workforce (Rofman and Oliveri 2012). A series of studies has brought together international
expertise on how to improve coverage using a range of mechanisms (Holzmann, Robalino, and Takayama
2009; Rofman, Apella, and Vezza 2013; Bosch, Melguizo, and Pages 2013), concluding that an approach
with both noncontributory and contributory elements is needed. This demonstrates that pension system
design is not an either-or activity, but one where a range of solutions is needed to tackle the biggest gaps.
These gaps may include social noncontributory pensions or income transfers to the elderly as well as
contributory pensions and savings.

Ensuring high coverage of the self-employed is particularly challenging. In Hong Kong SAR, China, self-
employed workers are required to join the mandatory funded pension system, and the pension supervisor
is required to enforce employer duties to enroll eligible employees. These requirements are associated
with pension coverage of 79 percent of the labor force (OECD 2013b). This level is high for any economy,
even one with a small public pension sector which would increase incentive to find other ways to build
retirement income.

Informality is a challenging and important area in which more research and piloting are needed. It gives
rise to the need to have a pension system with both public and private elements. Without public
provision, there will never be enough retirement income coverage of the lifetime poor. At the same time,
if privately funded pensions are not built at the appropriate point as countries develop, it will not be
possible to deliver sustainable solutions that both eradicate poverty and share increasing prosperity
across generations (World Bank 2014c).Development in Identification and Information Technology are
creating potentially transformative opportunities to deliver services to citizens (World Bank 2016a). For
private pensions they can offer the chance to remove the high costs of customer acquisition, sales and
marketing that can prevent pension savings actually being in the financial interest of consumers compared
to simple cash accounts. A World Bank project in India started in 2015 has an explicit focus on coverage
that is using a six-pronged strategy to expand private pension coverage (Price 2016a). A key lesson is to
build on improvements in Financial Inclusion that can enable new and efficient delivery channels for
collection, investments and payments of benefits (Price, Rawlins and Stewart 2016).

A diversified pension system combines different parts across public and private provision and formal
and informal sectors. This can be illustrated in the form of a pyramid highlighting how the different parts
combine – as set out in Figure 2.6. The OBA focuses on those elements of private and funded savings and
pensions rather than the core ‘Social Protection’ elements relating to public provision or transfers.

Building trust given economic and political history. Using techniques such as pension commissions with
cross-party and independent membership is gaining increasing attention as a way to improve the security
of pension systems. This is due partly to an analysis of some of the private pension reversals in the Europe
and Central Asia region (Price and Rudolph 2013). It is also due to analysis of some of the more successful
pension reforms (Pensions Commission 2005). As with preconditions, this element is not ‘pass or fail’, as
the need for reform continues. Some of the most respected pension systems have continued to use
external pension commissions to take their pension systems to the next level, either proactively or in
response to the exposure of previously underappreciated weaknesses (Super System Review Committee
2010, Marcel Commission 2006, Murray 2014). It is also apparent that bad experiences with failed pension
systems or other products discourage participation—for instance, in Albania due to a failed pyramid
selling scheme in the 1990s, although other issues were also relevant (Price 2014a).

2.6 Key Features of Adequacy

 5. Income provided until death                       11. Enforcing contributions

Contribution levels are clearly a key determinant of adequacy. While mandatory or quasi-mandatory
pension contributions improve private coverage, there is evidence on the importance of setting default
contribution rates sufficiently high for pensions to be adequate (Antolín, Payet, and Yermo 2012). Where
this is not the case, sustainability may also be affected. But the accumulation of adequate entitlements to


                                                     - 26 -
benefits also depends on the years of vested participation, leakage from savings through early access, and
portability)(Alonso, Hoyo and Tuesta 2015, Munnell and Webb 2015).

Research shows that the adequacy of mandatory defined-contribution systems (in Latin America at
least) has been constrained by low persistence of contribution (Rofman and Oliveri 2012). Research from
Chile (Antolín and Fuentes 2012) shows that improvements in how pension projections are calculated and
presented have increased voluntary contributions and led to the postponement of retirement, therefore
improving years of vested participation as well as contribution levels. There has been extensive similar
work by a range of reviewers (Blake 2011).

The OECD’s defined-contribution roadmap is notably relevant to this outcome, underpinning adequacy
features 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10 above, in particular, recommending that policy makers:
     Ensure that the design of defined-contribution pension plans is internally coherent between the
        accumulation and payout phases and with the overall pension system
     Encourage people to enroll, to contribute, and to contribute for long periods
     Improve the design of incentives to save for retirement, particularly where participation and
        contributions to defined-contribution pension plans are voluntary
     For the payout phase, encourage annuitization as a protection against longevity risk
     Ensure effective communication and address financial illiteracy and lack of awareness.

Securing the persistence of contributions is covered by OECD guidelines13 to the extent that they
recommend short vesting periods, restrictions on the reduction of accrued benefits, and the
preservation of benefits. Provisions to enable and facilitate pension portability are prescribed in some
detail within the guidelines14 as a means of encouraging the continuing accrual of entitlements, and good
communication in this regard is recommended. The extensive material on annual benefit statements
within the guidelines15 is also relevant to using communication tools to increase contributions.

Pensions are less likely to deliver adequate income throughout retirement without appropriate
regulatory requirements (Rocha and Vittas 2010). A review of the development of the annuity market in
Chile (Rocha and Thorburn 2007) shows how policy developments have improved the delivery of such
income. In particular, lump-sum distributions have been limited, while the use of fixed inflation-indexed
annuities or life expectancy phased withdrawals has been mandated to protect pensioners from inflation
risk. Joint-life annuities are mandated to protect spouses.

Many jurisdictions have used guarantees on income and returns to reduce the risk of pensions being
inadequate due to low contributions or a decline in investment values. The issue is complex, and the
cost of a guarantee depends heavily on its nature—from a yearly real return guarantee to a lifetime
capital-only guarantee to a nominal guarantee (Antolin and others 2011). The appropriate response could
be to value or cost the guarantee clearly and have an independent body collect premiums to ensure that
the guarantees can be funded in case of need (Viceira and Rudolph 2012).

Fair treatment of spouses and dependents was identified as a key feature because it leads so directly
to whether someone will receive a pension payment. It is included in the Melbourne-Mercer Global

Pension Index16, along with evidence from other sources referenced in this chapter regarding the lower
adequacy of pension entitlements typically accumulated by women in the workforce.

The evidence regarding the influence of contributions (and hence retirement income), tax and financial
incentives, and publicity and education on adequacy tends to come from the same sources as evidence
regarding their effect on coverage. Hence the evidence cited above17 shows that employer matching
incentives have some, but limited, impact on contributions—simplification of processes and related
communication tools for increasing contributions can be more effective. Where automatic enrollment is
used, the default contribution rate can be highly influential on adequacy. Incentives may be even less
effective in developing countries. However, the relative success in Germany of Riester pensions in
increasing contributions and hence adequacy, especially among lower-income groups, indicates that tax
incentives may have value, at least in more-developed economies, but at a significant cost (Borsch-Supan,
Coppola, and Riel-Held 2013).

Enforcement of timely payment of contributions has received relatively little research attention.
Nonetheless, requirements to this effect are common in pension legislation, and there is support from the
OECD guidelines. Guideline 5.04 refers to enforcing access to employer-sponsored plans to the extent
mandated in plan rules or the law and enforcing nondiscrimination and related provisions. In addition,
plan members should be given timely notification of nonpayment of contributions, but the guidelines stop
short of specifying enforcement action.

2.7 Key Features of Security
The security outcome is supported by 26 features, more than any other outcome (Figure 2.7). This is
mainly due to the broad range of features, including those relating to preconditions such as data
through to those relating to the role of the supervisor. This reflects the many ways in which the security
of pension assets can be compromised and hence the many approaches to keeping them secure. A well-
designed pension system with the right market participants and environment might deliver the other four
outcomes, but it carries a huge risk of insecurity.

 13. Matching assets to liabilities and member
     lifecycle



OECD guidelines address the need for a legal system that allows the enforcement of financial contracts
pertaining to occupational pensions (Guideline 1.04). In particular, there should be a body of ethical,
professional, and trained lawyers and judges and a court system whose decisions are enforceable.
Rudolph and Rocha (2009) make similar points. The OECD and IAIS standards relating to financial matters,
such as valuation, investments, risk management, and funding, provide further indications of key features
that drive security.

Clearly defined and separate ownership and control of pension assets have long been considered
paramount in international standards. To take a recent example, a review of the development of private
pensions in the Russian Federation (Rudolph and Holtzer 2010), as well as many of the features referred
to already, demonstrates the problems that can occur when the ownership by participants of pension
assets is unclear. More generally, the consequences of not placing assets held for third parties in a
separate secure arrangement, such as with an independent custodian charged with reconciling what they
hold against fund records, has been demonstrated by a long line of scandals and has led to a preference
for hard-wiring custodian arrangements into private pension reforms in several recent cases.

The Maxwell case in the United Kingdom (along with several other contemporary fund failures such as
the Madoff scandal, MF Global, Colonial Life Insurance Company, and Lehman Brothers) provides a
graphic example of what can happen if some basic controls over security are missing. Subsequent
reports supported the need for better segregation of assets, a prohibition of self-investment, funding
standards, inflation protection for deferred members, member-nominated trustees, independent
professional auditors and actuaries with whistle-blowing duties, clearer definition of what can happen to
fund surpluses, independent supervision, and a fraud compensation scheme (Pension Law Review
Committee 1993). Very many of these basic features are found in the OECD Principles of Occupational
Pension Regulation, with recommendations relating to:
     Clear regulated and documented structuring of pension entities, including clearly structured and
        enforceable or appealable participant rights, secured in part by a licensing or registration regime.
     The prefunding and segregation of assets, especially from the sponsor and between plans, various
        protections from creditors, and strong restrictions on self-investment. Independent custodianship
        is covered, but not mandated.
     The requirements to apply appropriate accounting, auditing, and actuarial standards with
        independent professionals engaged for this purpose (on which the IAIS standards provide even
        more detail).These requirements also cover the quality of data used for actuarial purposes (while
        the OECD defined-contribution roadmap makes recommendations relating to the need for good
        longevity data).
     The use of appropriate risk management and internal controls (with risk management having a
        supporting working paper on best practices that covers internal controls).This is also an area with
        extensive IAIS standards.
     The placement of whistle-blowing requirements on pension entity professionals.

Economic, demographic, and personal data have been identified as critical to the efficient running of a
pension system. It is essential to identify individuals entitled to benefits and ensure that they actually
receive them (echoing the discussion above on coverage, ID and IT). This is one of the reasons why such

                                                   - 29 -
data have been placed in the security category. This is particularly important given the timescale in
pensions, which can lead to orphan accounts. It is also important with respect to fraud and ghost accounts.
As an indication of the increasing importance placed on the issue, the World Bank hosted a flagship event
at its annual meetings in 2014 entitled “Making Everyone Count: Identification for Development.”

The experience of Nigeria illustrates some of the key features (Ubhenin 2012; National Pension
Commission of Nigeria2016). In this country prior to the 2004 pension reform, underfunding of public and
private pension funds, coupled with a lack of member-focused governance, inadequate supervision and
low levels of coverage, resulted in too few citizens having pensions and too few persons with pensions
receiving their due payments on time. The reform greatly strengthened regulation and supervision. The
system of clearly structured pension fund companies, assets placed with independent custodians, and
independent supervision has improved security of assets once they reach the system, although some
problems remain.

Pension assets may also be vulnerable to sequestration by government. Key experiences and lessons
that underpin “security—protection from government policy reversal” are set out in a World Bank review
of the evidence on policy reversals following the financial crisis (Price and Rudolph 2013).

The lack of inflation protection, and often of benefit preservation, within defined-benefit pension funds
can result in significant surpluses that have often reverted in part or in whole to sponsoring employers
rather than to member benefits. Although literature on the subject is limited, there is supporting material
relating to consequential regulatory reforms in South Africa (Andrew 2001). Likewise lack of inflation
protection means that “good “defined-benefit schemes can end up providing very low benefits in real
terms, a key issue in Suriname, for example, following the impact of near hyperinflation in the 1990s.

Prudent funding of pension promises is crucial to the security of many pension plans and is covered
extensively in the OECD Principles of Occupational Pension Regulation. There are requirements relating
to: asset and liability valuation; funding policies; regular independent valuations of the ongoing and
discontinuance position; the choice of appropriate assumptions; the existence of sufficient capital to meet
expected liabilities; taking account of risks to the plan and sponsor; and enforceable recovery plans.
Further detail is provided in OECD/IOPS (2011a) on good practices for pension funds’ risk management
systems and related work on investment and defined-benefit plans (Franzen 2010) and funding.18

Guarantee or compensation funds for fund members affected by the liquidation of employers have
mitigated substantial losses for affected members. This is shown in general by the experience of
countries with such guarantee schemes (Stewart 2007) and more starkly by the experience of countries
without guarantees—for example, in the Waterford Crystal case in Ireland (Financial Times 2013).
Guarantees are however far from simple to run so need to be carefully planned and given the ability to
vary premiums in relation to the risks covered (see for example the experience of the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation in the US compared to the UK’s Pension Protection Fund).

Research on the payout phase has emphasized the importance of the prudent funding of the providers
of retirement products and their use of asset-liability matching (Mitchell, Piggott, and Takayama
2011).Matching concepts are also important for defined-contribution funds—in particular, the use of

18
  Since U.K. pensions law was strengthened to comply with OECD guidelines in 2005, around £100 billion of deficit
correction payments have been made into U.K. funds (by March 2013), supplemented by extensive commitment of
contingent assets and specific hedging of liabilities (Pension Protection Fund 2013; Pension Regulator 2013a).

                                                     - 30 -
lifecycle portfolios. Modeling based on analysis of available research has shown the superiority of such
portfolios (Viceira 2010; Antolín 2009).OECD Principle 3, in particular, includes material on diversification
and other means of controlling investment risk relevant to all phases of the pension cycle.

Research on pension guarantees has enabled conclusions to be drawn on best practice in designing such
arrangements in a way that enables them to improve security of participant entitlements (Castañeda
and Rudolph 2010).It also adds to the literature on how to achieve prudent funding of liabilities and the
use of asset-liability matching to facilitate such funding. Winding-up provisions are increasingly important
as systems mature, but can often be underdeveloped or take many years to complete, as in Trinidad and
Tobago, among other countries. OECD Guidelines 3.20–3.21 expand on protections that should be
available at wind-up. There is some controversy as to the true cost of return guarantees – highlighting
that they should be approached with care (Canon and Tonks 2014).

There has been useful general work on financial market security over more than a decade as well as
many reports and enquiries in the aftermath of the global financial crisis on standards in general, but
this work often relates to financial services other than pensions(FSB 2012; Conference of the Insurance
Supervisory Services 2002;Vinals and Fiechter 2010; World Bank 2013a, 2014d).However, some case
studies prepared for use by the Toronto Centre, among others,19 and technical notes on pensions
produced as part of FSAPs by the World Bank often cover supervisory issues, as do the accession reviews
produced by the OECD against the OECD/IOPS standards.

The IOPS Principles of Private Pension Supervision have been used in full as the final 10 features
supporting the security outcome. The IOPS has published guidance and case studies on risk-based
supervision showing how these can benefit member security.20The toolkit embeds supervisory insights on
how to mitigate risks and underpins the use of the IOPS standards as part of the framework. There is
sometimes a challenge in drawing a direct link between some supervisory inputs to long-run outcomes,
so this is an active area for ongoing evidence gathering, research, and case studies. The OBA framework
will be updated as evidence evolves regarding what works. It also builds on related work (for example, in
Brunner and others (2008) and Blake and others 2008).

2.8 Ensuring a Framework That Updates as the Evidence Updates
The strength of the evidence supporting the OBA framework varies, and in some cases more research
is needed. Hence, in this first iteration of the framework, an inclusive approach was taken to ensure
comprehensiveness. A regular process of review will be undertaken as more evidence becomes available.
This will include progressively expanding the references to useful work and case studies. It will also involve
updating links to international principles and standards as they evolve (for example, the OECD/IOPS
principles on occupational pensions are due to be updated towards the end of 2016). Short case studies
of real-life examples from client countries are particularly important because they often contain highly
relevant material that will take a long time to reach the academic literature, working papers, or standards.

Chapter Three: Completing the Framework and Reviewer Tools

3.1 A Tool for Diagnosis and Reform
A critical issue when conducting a review is the breadth and depth of the review. As highlighted in
Chapter One, private pensions not only are part of the wider pension system and hence social policy, but
also intimately related to the macroeconomic environment, the capital and labor markets, and, through
them, the long-run growth prospects for an economy. The review of the evidence presented shows how
the key features span a wide range of factors—ensuring comprehensibility but posing potential challenges
in completing a review in a limited time.

A more traditional narrative structure is useful not only when describing the country context but also
in presenting which parts of an economy or pension system are creating the biggest problems. In piloting
and testing it helped to explain to stakeholders the range of potential areas that would affect pension
outcomes. In targeted reviews, it was useful to identify those elements that were within the scope, for
example, of a supervisor and those elements that were important to outcomes but outside its scope.
However, even where areas were outside the scope of one player, supervisors typically were engaged in
an active dialogue with a Central Bank, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Social Affairs, or Ministry of Labor
through which to communicate the importance of broader reforms.

The headline picture that links outcomes with the different parts of a pension system is set out in Figure
3.1. The next section explains how this schematic was developed throughout the project and why each
element plays an important role in the overall review framework.

3.2 Pre-conditions and the Economic and Political Environment
Understanding the economic and political environment of a country and whether the preconditions for
pension reform exist is an essential element of developing reforms tailored to the needs of a country.
It is vital to consider the preconditions for a successful private pension system before launching major
reforms (Holzmann and Hinz 2005; IEG 2006; Rocha and Rudolph 2008; Barr and Diamond 2009). These
include economic factors such as the macroeconomic situation as well as the availability of legal,
accounting, and actuarial professionals (highlighted under security). But our review found that these
preconditions are always sensible areas to probe. In other words, if a country has previously demonstrated
these pre-conditions, they should not subsequently be ignored.

A good example showing the on-going importance of the preconditions is the challenging
macroeconomic environment for pensions caused by the global financial crisis and the monetary policy
measures, such as quantitative easing, that followed. Another good example is provided by the scandal
in the United Kingdom arising from actuarial deficiencies at Equitable Life, an insurance company (Penrose
2004). This scandal led to wholesale changes in the regulatory and supervisory structure for actuaries in
the United Kingdom with the formation of the Board for Actuarial Standards. So even in a country with a
well-established and well-respected actuarial profession, it is important to consider how actuaries are
operating.

One critical precondition for successful reform is the development of a political consensus for those
reforms (discussed in the section on key features). The focus on political consensus building and strategic
alignment also comes through when looking at the causes of implementation failures discussed in Chapter
One. Politics are always challenging, but successful reformers have often faced similar or worse problems
than other countries but have found ways to build the case for change.

Figure 3.2 Adding Preconditions into the Front Line of Regular Country Diagnostics




3.3 Regulatory Framework and Other Pension Pillars
The pension OBA framework identifies the key features of the regulatory system and other pillars on
which a reviewer should focus. There is a focus, for example, not only on the main intentions of legal
arrangements for pensions but also on whether the system introduces any automatic adjustment
mechanisms to ensure that the system can cope—for example, with rising life expectancy by automatically
changing parameters such as retirement ages.

                                                  - 33 -
One of the most critical areas, most closely linked to the coverage and adequacy outcomes, is the
combined impact of all the pension pillars. The right level of contributions to an expanded private
pension pillar clearly depends on the sustainable future level of the state pension. In a broad strategic
review of a pension system, the analysis of the private pension system is augmented by a full analysis of
the combined impact of all sources of pension income. The World Bank uses its PROST model to review
contributions, benefit entitlements, revenues, and expenditures to provide a quantitative picture of the
long-run sustainability and adequacy of a pension system (Bogomolova 2013). The OECD produces
Pensions at Glance based on a consistent modeling of future payouts from a pension system, combining
the state pension and mandatory private pensions and, for some countries, voluntary pensions as well
(OECD 2013b).

3.4 Market Structure, Entities, and Governance
An important lesson in recent years is recognition of the impact that market structure or “industrial
organization” can have on pension outcomes, particularly on costs and investment returns (Impavido,
Lasagabaster, and García-Huitrón 2010).In designing the OBA it was clear that the issue of market
structure and the entities potentially involved in private pensions and their delivery needed to receive
sufficient attention. The importance of market structure has been recognized well beyond pensions in
research on the role of competition authorities and in reviews of the causes of financial market outcomes
(Kay 2012).

There is a very wide range of options regarding exactly how a pension system can have its private assets
collected, managed, and paid out. Moreover, many of the issues of investment strategy and execution
that are often discussed in wholly private pension systems are also applicable to anyone managing
pension assets—from provident funds to funded or partially funded state pension funds (Rajkumar and
Dorfman 2010; Price 2014b).

There is no one-size-fits-all design, but rather a need for a careful review of a wide range of key features
from scale to capital market development to levels of governance and expertise. The overall design
chosen to deliver private pensions will affect the demand and supply sides of the market. This includes
distribution mechanisms—the mechanisms for channeling contributions and converting them into
invested assets. In many systems this element has proved to be very costly. It can also have negative
impacts if there is excessive churning of pension portfolios as a result of the use of sales agents.

3.5 Supervision
As with regulation, supervision has a fairly obvious role in driving pension system outcomes. Supervision
is the area most closely associated with international standards, as discussed in Chapter Two. As these
standards are updated, the OBA framework will be updated to ensure consistency. In some projects, the
supervisor is the direct client. The framework can be used to review all of the factors affecting outcomes
and then to focus specifically on those that are within the immediate control of the supervisor.

The framework also helps to generate a more proactive and long-term debate for supervisors on areas
for change that are outside their immediate control but that would reduce the need for costly or
ineffective measures. For example, supervisors may have to spend time investigating allegations of poor
practice and complaints related to sales agents. A move to an auction system could remove the risks
related to sales agents. Or a move to centralized administration with choices among fund managers and
the provision of a default fund might reduce the need to have costly and ineffective education campaigns.


                                                   - 34 -
The recent ‘Murray Review’ from Australia shows that these issues are for developed and long-standing
markets as well as for developing and new markets (Murray 2014, Price 2016b).

As highlighted in the introduction the OBA approach can be used as the starting point for developing a
modern risk based supervision model for a supervisor. The links between the initial diagnosis and the
process to develop Outcomes and Risk Based Supervision is set out below.

Figure 3.3Linking the OBA to Outcomes and Risk Based Supervision




This OBA process can be shown as a step-by-step approach but also as a traditional strategy cycle. This
emphasizes that the process should lead to decision making and implementation but also to regular
review against the evidence and adjustments as required. This is relevant both for a Ministry of Finance
or Social Welfare undertaking significant reforms of pensions and for a regulator or supervision running a
risk based supervision program.

Figure 3.4The strategy cycle




The integration of the narrative approach to reporting with the outcomes approach to analysis can be
shown in a simple grid which can summarize which parts of the system should be reformed and how
this will contribute to each outcome (Figure 3.5). This can help to make the case for broad-based changes,
since maximizing the impact on each outcome will often require changes across the pension system –
even though targeted interventions can still be justified by their own impact on results. Or it can highlight
the limits to action by one part of the system—a supervisor, for example. This can be helpful during a
targeted review to focus on those changes that are within the control of the supervisor to ensure that the
expectations of what reform will achieve are realistic and tailored to the country context (Rodrik 2007).

3.6Practical Tools for Reviewers
This Handbook includes practical tools for reviewers to use on projects. These are highlighted briefly
below and then attached at the end of this Handbook.
 A data request sheet for countries, with various indicators mapped to outcomes. Completed sheets
    provide data, identify gaps to be filled, and link to future measurement of success.
 A list of the key features to review in a system, which provides the areas of focus for questions. These
    features are mapped to outcomes and selected when preparing country-specific pre-visit
    questionnaires and meeting agendas.
 An OBA review sheet, including implementation assessment, in which to record evidence, issues,
    and recommendations and prioritize them based on the size of the problem and the importance of
    the issue. Each outcome then has an overall summary and assessment, which can be used in the final
    report to summarize the current position and the important issues for reforms.
 A key features background sheet for reviewers, which provides a detailed description of the key
    features and definition of the outcomes and cross-references the international standards and
    guidance, if any, that have been mapped to the key features.


3.7Data and Indicators
Each outcome has detailed data and indicators to aid analysis or evaluation aligned with existing global
pension databases where possible. These include the World Bank’s “International Patterns of Pension
Provision II” (Pallares-Mirralles, Romero, and Whitehouse 2012) and Global Financial Statistics Database
and the OECD's data collection for Pension Markets in Focus and Pensions at a Glance (OECD 2012a and
2013a) which are accessible from the OECD’s Global Pension Statistics Database. But additional elements
have been added to ensure full coverage of all elements identified from the analysis of what drives
outcomes. Some additional granularity has been added—for example, on costs to ensure more robust


                                                  - 37 -
evidence collection. In addition, there are more distributional questions—for example, by income and
gender.

Obtaining reliable and relevant data is perhaps the most challenging aspect of any review. The approach
taken is not to compromise on the data request, but to be realistic about what can be supplied.
Reviewers can use all or a subset of the indicators for requesting data from countries. If the review is to
be targeted rather than comprehensive, the data requests can be tailored to the part of the system or the
outcome on which the review will focus. In many countries, it is unlikely that the data needed for the
complete set of indicators will be available. However, an important part of a review and reform process
will be to identify gaps in the data and develop plans to fill them. This is part of a necessary push to
progressively improve pension data (Payet 2012).

Over time, as more and more of the gaps are filled and more case studies are created, it will also be
possible to develop increasingly useful country-specific benchmarks and to evaluate the effectiveness
of reforms more objectively. This effort will also support the refinement of the OBA framework by
contributing evidence of which key features have the greatest effects on the outcomes. To help improve
global data on pensions the World Bank is partnering with the OECD and IOPS to expand their long-
standing data gathering and dissemination efforts to a wider range of countries21.

Efficiency indicators include those related to the size of the market and its distribution among providers.
They also include investment returns and factors that affect them, such as investment fees, transaction
costs, supervisory costs, and asset allocation. The labor supply can affect efficiency, so indicators include
retirement ages and the wedge between gross and net wages.

Sustainability indicators measure total contributions, who makes them, and total government spending
on pensions. Where they are available, sustainability indicators focus on stock and flow measures
including projections, and where they are absent, a review is likely to recommend creating them, as in the
recent FSAP in Suriname. They also show both the current and future balance between various pillars or
tiers of the broader retirement income system. The existence of any mechanisms to adjust pension
benefits automatically is sought as a qualitative indicator. Evidence on political or public support for the
current system or reforms can be obtained formally through surveys or informally through interviews with
market participants and reviews of different media.

Coverage indicators include the current number of contributors and pension recipients and their shares
of the relevant segments of the workforce and population. The data sought also include projections of
these indicators, which would show how coverage under the current system is expected to evolve over
time. The gender breakdown is a critical element, particularly in contributory systems with vesting periods
that may lead to gender-inequitable outcomes.

Adequacy indicators consider both the adequacy of input and the adequacy of the resulting pensions.
Input indicators relate to the level and density of contributions made to and (by considering pre-
retirement withdrawals) retained in the system, as well as the employment rate. Output indicators include
replacement rates and the relative poverty of pensioners. Several adequacy indicators go beyond the
private pension pillar to identify other potential sources of retirement income, such as homeownership,

21
  The World Bank has partnered with the OECD and IOPS to improve global pension statistics to further this goal –

savings, and other financial or insurance products. These can be difficult to find, but again are important
in gaining a full understanding of what private pensions need to achieve.

Security indicators cover a wide variety of factors. They include the funding ratios of defined-benefit
plans and others that provide guarantees, as well as the extent to which pension assets are held separately
from other assets. Data on assets lost to insolvency, fraud, or theft are relevant, as are the potential losses
that were avoided through coverage by compensation schemes. The existence of mortality data and the
availability of projected improvements support the secure funding of pensions. The existence of large data
gaps for any outcome sets a baseline for improvements.


3.8 Key Features
The list of key features can be used to create a pre-visit questionnaire. Responses to such a
questionnaire, together with the various indicators, help the reviewer to gain an initial understanding of
the pension system and to identify issues that might require special attention while in the country.

Even reviews that focus on a particular part of the system or a particular outcome need to cover a wide
variety of issues. The challenge is even greater for reviews that are comprehensive in nature. It would be
easy for even an experienced reviewer to overlook important issues in the course of a review. The key
features can help to minimize this risk by serving as a high-level checklist for the reviewer—much as
checklists for pilots and surgeons are used to ensure that important but routine matters are not
overlooked. An extract from the key features background sheet is set out in figure 3.6.

3.9 The Role of the Reviewer
To obtain a high-quality review of a country’s private pension system, the reviewer must be well -
qualified. The OBA framework helps to structure a review and to guide the reviewer, but reviews are also
qualitative and require the examination of a wide range of issues, which are often interrelated.

Reviewers should have broad expertise that enables them to cope with the diversity of issues commonly
encountered during a review. Issues may well relate to laws and regulations, market structure, the
economic and political situation, accounting and actuarial standards, and investments, among other
things. Ideally, a comprehensive review of all elements of a pension system should be carried out by a
team of at least two reviewers, with complementary areas of expertise—particularly on projects with long
duration and multiple deliverables. Shorter-term or more tailored reviews need a reviewer with broad
expertise and should use strong peer reviewers.

Reviewers need to consider not only the characteristics of the current pension system of a country but
also how effective and efficient it is in terms of achieving desirable outcomes . The review should
examine whether requirements are put into practice and, if so, whether they are working as intended. If
problems are identified, the reviewer should be capable of formulating practical recommendations for
dealing with them.

The necessary expertise and international experience must be combined with the capacity to achieve a
clear understanding of the specific circumstances in the country being reviewed. Reviews should include
in-depth consultations with individuals and organizations that have first-hand experience related to the
pension system of the country. In addition to relevant authorities, those consulted will often include
auditors, trustees, employers, actuaries, researchers, and industry associations.

The OBA framework is designed to guide reviewers in the preparation of comprehensive and
comparable reviews of countries’ private pension systems. However, there is still considerable scope for
a reviewer to exercise discretion. Even in the preparatory phase of a review, discretion is left to the
reviewer regarding which data and indicators will be most relevant to the review, what questions should
be included in the pre-assessment questionnaire, which stakeholders should be consulted, and what will
be on the meeting agendas. Judgment is particularly important when discussing trade-offs between
outcomes. However, the reviewer recording sheets help to make these judgments transparent.

During the review, the reviewer will need to decide which key features are most relevant to the
situation. Judgment will be needed in assigning ratings, particularly for key features that are outside the
scope of the international standards. Discretion is left to the reviewer in determining the relative
importance of the problems identified by the review and in crafting recommendations that are suitable
for dealing with the problems in the context of the particular country. Some features may not be
applicable to the situation being reviewed, but the process of determining that this is the case itself
provides a good discipline.

This Handbook presents an outcomes-based diagnosis and assessment tool for private pensions as a
new way in which to conduct a pension review in a comprehensive and structured way (see annex for
the data and recording sheets). It is a resource used by reviewers in a range of projects. It aims to foster
discussion on the key outcomes and their causes. As reviews are conducted, final reports will be published,
where possible, to provide an increasing database of comparable reviews. The Handbook, tools and
evidence base will be updated as new evidence and experience are gathered.

Implementation/Delivery Questions
Note that questions on external suppliers only relevant if external procurement is required


1. Are there clear links between the project and the organization’s key strategic priorities,
   including agreed measures of success?

2. Is there clear leadership and ownership from senior management and Ministers?

3. Is there effective engagement with stakeholders?

4. Does the team/organization have the skills and proven approach to project management and
   risk management?

5. Has development and implementation of the project been broken down into manageable
   steps?

6. Has evaluation of proposals been driven by long term value for money rather than initial
   price/cost?

7. Is there deep understanding of, and contact with the supply industry at senior levels in the
   Organisation purchasing the services?

8. Is there effective project team integration between clients, the supplier team and the supply
   chain (where applicable)?

The questions ensure an enhanced level of focus on delivery and implementation risks as part of the
Outcomes Based Assessment Framework. Not all questions will be relevant for every project. But the
questions are based on assessments of the causes of project failures across a wide range of
industries/government policy areas. These questions have been adapted from a review of common causes
of project failures undertaken by the Office of Government Commerce in the UK. The questions are also
linked to extensive guidance on how to ensure best practice delivery, with examples of guidance material
and overall project management and appraisal material listed in the references).

Tool 3: OBA Review Sheet 1: Summary of Review
Note on Gap and Importance: If no standard then rate size of problem/gap on 4 point scale (small, medium, medium-large and large). If a
standard exists use usual 4 point rating (fully met, largely met, partly met, not met and N/A). For importance use low/medium/medium-
high/high. Visual display in risk matrix can be helpful. Note that no overall rating or single point estimate is required.

Tool 4: Pensions Outcomes Based Assessment Review Sheet 2
Detailed Description of Key Features to Investigate and Cross-Reference of Key Features to International Standards and Selected Best Practice
Guidance
References are to the following documents:
       OECD Core Principles of Occupational Pension Regulation 2010 (OECD)
       International Organization of Pension Supervisors Principles of Private Pension Supervision 2010 (IOPS)
       International Association of Insurance Supervisors Insurance Core Principles 2012 (IAIS)
       International Organization of Securities Commission IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation 2010 (IOSCO)
       OECD/IOPS Good Practices for Pension Funds’ Risk Management Systems 2011 (RM)
       IOPS Good Practices in the Risk Management of Alternative Investments by Pension Funds 2010 (AI)
       OECD roadmap for the good design of defined contribution pension plans 2012 (DC Map)

Note that a link to international principles or standards, or other guidance means that some of the elements in each key feature are covered in a
standard. But the match is often partial. Also, in many cases where multiple standards are referenced there is significant overlap between them.

                             ensure that their records are accurate and stay accurate, and that data
                             integrity and confidentiality are not compromised - data issues are often
                             overlooked. Excludes controls over the security of operations.
Efficiency - Reduce labor Covers both the avoidance of the private pension system distorting the OECD: 1
market distortions        labor market and the potential role of the system in reducing distortions.
                          Therefore includes barriers that the system may place on labor mobility
                          (because of non-vesting, for instance) and whether the system
                          incentivizes early or late retirement. Influenced by the size of ‘tax wedge’
                          between gross wages and take-home pay caused by size of current or
                          newly proposed pension contributions. Can therefore cover the scope for
                          finding other sources of finance (such as sales tax or from natural
                          resources) that avoid increasing the tax wedge and hence encourage
                          formal employment.

                         or over reliance on one pillar to do the job. In particular, can highlight a
                         'European' problem - too much reliance on zero/first pillar, or an 'Asian'
                         problem - too much reliance on second pillars and not enough on

                          uncertainties inherent in these assumptions. For instance, are public
                          statements made that a certain level of retirement benefit is guaranteed
                          when this is not the case in all possible scenarios? Have a range of
                          plausible outcomes been modeled under different scenarios?

                               frequent design changes arising from changes in Government which
                               damage the system. Also includes the actions that policy makers and
                               supervisors can take to win support and build cross-party consensus, or

sustainably funded           and the funding of pillar 0/1, in the context of their proportionality to
                             GDP. It is not just the level of funding that is relevant but the health of
                             the public finances more generally and whether there is pressure to
                             reduce public spending. Includes, therefore, the extent to which taxation
                             levels or Government debt would need to rise to sustain the system, and
                             actions taken to mitigate or prevent reduced financial support from

                             The funding of transition costs is particularly important and relying on
                             debt financing not taxes raises significant risks.

Sustainability - Effective Covers whether the system will automatically or can be flexible enough OECD: 3.17, 3.18, 4.22
and         counter-cyclical to enable it to adjust to significant changes. There are a number of ways
adjustment mechanisms        to build in risk sharing mechanisms, for example, retirement age
                             increasing with longevity, benefits or payments being reduced due to
                             under-funding or contributions increasing. Includes regulatory or
                             supervisory actions intended to improve funding levels in good times and
                             mitigate impacts on sponsoring employers in bad times, such as
                             discretion or forbearance in setting discount rates and recovery periods
                             and smoothing of valuations. Also includes design of regulation and
                             supervision that avoids forced selling of assets when their value is
                             depressed, with consequent negative feedback loops through the
                             financial markets and financial demands on sponsors that are also issuers
                             of equity and debt.

participation              mandatory enrolment, requirements or legal inducements for auto- Guidance: DC 2.00
                           enrolment, and requirements that employees should be given access to
                           a pension plan. Also includes legal provisions that prevent or enable the
                           exclusions of certain categories of workers and non-discrimination
                           between types of employee.
Coverage - Tax         and Includes drivers of increased coverage arising from tax incentives to Guidance: DC 3.00
financial incentives       enroll or participate, and inducements given by employers or
                           Government to participate, such as contribution matching.
Coverage - Mandatory, Includes the strength of the business case for employers to provide a
behavioral     or     social pension plan (for instance, to improve recruitment and retention) and
stimulus to participate      societal norms (such as social partnership arrangements) which place any
                             expectations or requirements that employers should provide a plan or
                             employees should join a plan. Such norms can lead to high coverage that
                             is difficult to replicate in other countries with otherwise similar legal
                             frameworks.

providers' target market via employers. Do providers reach all segments of the market and all

                         such as marketing, promotion, and education. If costs of customer
                         acquisition through marketing are too high, then certain segments of the
                         market will not be covered and alternative mechanisms to boost

Coverage - Enforcement      Covers how requirements for mandatory access, mandatory enrolment OECD: 5.04
                            and auto-enrolment are enforced, whether by the supervisor, the tax
                            authority or other means, dealing with abuses such as non-enrolment,
                            hiding of staff, falsely claiming an employee's pay is below the entry
                            threshold or coercing employees to opt out. Will include effectiveness of
                            data sharing and co-operation among agencies (e.g., tax and pension
                            authorities) and whether clear incentives exist to undertake or assist
                            enforcement.

incentives for labor market economy and the access to pension plans in practice for workers in the

given      economic  and trust pensions to grow), political policy reversals (so that people don't
political history         trust money not to be stolen or are too worried to lock money away given

                          or restore trust such as institutional change or reform programs.
ADEQUACY
Adequacy - Contribution       Includes legal provisions on minimum contribution levels and maximum OECD: 5.03, Guidance: DC 0.00, DC
levels and benefit accrual    tax-benefited levels, as well as any requirements on minimum or 1.00, DC 2.00
rates     given     income    maximum benefit accrual (including conversion factors) in plans with
objective relative to other   guarantees. Also includes norms for contribution or benefit accrual rates
pillars                       that arise from common business practice and social partnership
                              arrangements. Whether contribution levels are adequate depends on
                              other forms of provision - for instance 8% is too low if you are expecting
                              it to deliver a pension that replaces two-thirds of pre-retirement income
                              by itself, but might be acceptable if 40% is being delivered by other
                              pillars, although even then factors such as investment returns and costs
                              will have a bearing. Hence, covers the interaction of intended or forecast
                              absolute and relative private pension benefits with the retirement
                              income available from other pillars, so as, in particular, to minimize
                              poverty in retirement. For instance, whether benefits are calculated net
                              of pillar 1 benefits and the extent to which other sources of income
                              augment the income available from private pensions.
Adequacy - Years of vested Even if contributions are expected to deliver the adequacy objective OECD: 5.05, 5.06,             5.07,   5.08,

                           impact that changes in employment or years of employment or
                           participation in the workforce have on the accumulation of benefit

early access               accumulation until retirement age, or an age somewhat lower than

                            participants when they change employment, such as restrictions on 5.2
                            prevention of cashing out, the protection of benefits retained in the
                            previous employer's pension plan and whether benefits can or must be
                            transferred to a pension account sponsored by the new employer (and
                            the fairness of any such transfer, especially if a DB to DC transition is
                            involved). The importance of this factor depends in part on the labor
                            market dynamics, as portability is key where there are more dynamic
                            labor markets/shorter tenures/more informality. Also includes fair

                         participation. Identifies who exactly provides the guarantee, how it is
                         funded and whether this creates any perverse incentives or concerns
                         about reliability of payment if the guarantee were called. The impact may
                         be negative if the guarantees are inappropriate or distributionally
                         regressive and the circumstances prove to be unfavorable.
Adequacy - Protection Includes the use of indexation (mandatory or discretionary) or up-rating Guidance: DC 7.00

                           requirements for DC plan providers. Can take into account any
                           guarantees from the sponsor employer, which may reduce reserving
                           requirements, so long as there is a reasonable prospect that they can be
                           enforced. (Their enforcement comes under Security: Sponsor/provider
                           guarantees and compensation funds.)
Security - Recovery plans Includes regulatory and supervisory provisions intended to ensure that OECD: 3.17

                            promote or hinder diversification. Pension funds as long-term vehicles
                            typically have lower liquidity needs than other financial institutions. But
                            the issue still needs attention, as shown by issues highlighted during the
                            2008 Global Financial Crisis. APRA has produced guidance on dealing with
