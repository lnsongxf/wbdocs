THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business

permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in this year’s economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      comply with the Building Code and meet current safety
      standards and zoning requirements. Once plans are approved, a
      contractor or contractor’s representative may apply for a
      construction work permit.

      Simple projects, as in the case of BuildCo, can opt for a fast-track
      service offered by the New York City Department of Buildings
      (DOB), called the Professional Certification Program. The
      program, introduced in 1996, enables registered architects and
      professional engineers to certify, through an affidavit signed by
      the owner, contractor, and all responsible professionals
      (architects, engineers, plumbers, and the like) that the plans they
      file with the department are in compliance with all applicable
      laws. This reduces the amount of time a builder normally would
      wait for a DOB permit by eliminating the process of DOB
      examination and approval of the plans.

      The professional certification must be submitted at the time of
      pre-filing and in advance. A professionally certified application
      goes through the same pre-filing, payment, and data entry
      process as normal applications:
      • Information on the availability of a public sewer system
      • If a private sewage treatment plant is proposed, evidence of
      submission of plans for approval of such a plant to the
      department of environmental protection and the department of
      health as required by law
      • The lot diagram showing compliance with the zoning
      resolution
      • The foundation plans
      • The floor and roof plans showing compliance with exit
      requirements
      • The detailed architectural, structural, and mechanical drawings
      • General description of the proposed work

      After analyzing the plans (assuming that all required documents
      are present), the DOB approves the application at the end of
      data entry.

      A professionally certified application does not go through plan
      examination. The applicant can check the application status by
      using the Buildings Information System and, upon approval, can
      retrieve the application folder from the DOB to apply for a
      permit. Twenty percent of all professionally certified applications
      are selected for audit within 10 days of first permit issuance. The
      audits for new projects may take place within 30 days after the
      application is issued.

      The overall time of application clearance is 5 days on average.

      According to the 2008 Building Code No. 26-212, the fee for the
      new building permit is USD 0.26 per square foot. The plumbing
      permit and foundation fee are calculated inside the above flat
      rate.

      The Building Code says that "fifty percent of the total fee for the
      work permit, but not less than one hundred dollars, or the total

                                                                              complete
      fee for the work permit where such fee is less than one hundred
      dollars, shall be paid by or on behalf of the owner or lessee of
      the building premises or property affected, and shall accompany
      the first application for the approval of plans or other statement
      describing the building work when submitted prior to
      submission of the permit application; and the whole or
      remainder of the total fee shall be paid before the work permit
      may be issued.” Still, most companies of BuildCo’s size would opt
      to pay the amount upfront, not in two separate transactions.
      Only for large projects is dividing the amount widespread.

      Starting in 2011, the NYC Department of Buildings began
      accepting digital plans for new buildings. While our contributors
      have noted that the processing time isn't any faster in practice
      than submitting in person, it does allow the applicant more
      project control and improved accessibility to the plan examiner
      and inter-agency communications, as well as online tracking of
      application progress.

      Obtain work permit from the Department of Buildings (DOB)

      After obtaining the Building permit, the company must request a
      work permit. The request should be accompanied by a copy of
      the current insurance policy of workers’ compensation insurance.
      This procedure must be done by the contractor even if they are
      not the owner of the land. Different types of work require
      separate licenses. However, in one application, more than one
      permit can be requested. For instance, plumbing and
      construction work permits can be requested in the same
      application.                                                           1 day        no charge

      For a warehouse, BuildCo must request a new building permit, a
      plumbing permit, and a foundation and earthwork permit. The
      request must include the detailed architectural, structural, and
      mechanical plans. One to two days prior to construction works,
      the company must notify the DOB by phone.

      Transportation

      A Construction Activity Permit fee costs USD 50.00, and is valid
      for 90 days unless otherwise stated. Once the 90 days expire, the
      company buys another work permit for the remaining period of
      construction. Upon applying, the company gets an account
      number, and the next day obtains the work permit.

      Unless otherwise authorized, permits shall be kept at the work
9     site or designated field headquarters at all times and shall be        2 days        USD 50
      made available for inspection upon request of any police officer
      or any authorized employee of the Departments of

      Request occupancy certificate from the Department of
      Buildings (DOB)

      Upon completion of construction, the company must arrange for
      DOB inspections. For construction and plumbing, the company
      should contact the borough office where property is located.

      After completion of satisfactory inspections and submission of
      the required fillings (including inspections reports), DOB issues a
      new certificate of occupancy that describes the legal use and
      occupancy of a property.

      Each application must be accompanied by an accurate and                1 day        no charge
11
      complete lot survey made by a licensed surveyor. If the
      certificate of occupancy application is not signed by a
      professional engineer or registered architect, the form must be
      notarized by an official notary public.

      To obtain the certificate of occupancy, the company must obtain
      the work permit/approval from the Bureau of Electrical Control,
      the Department of Environmental Protection, and the
      Department of Transportation. If these approvals have not yet
      been granted at the time of applying for the certificate of
      occupancy, a temporary certificate can be issued. The company
      then has a year to obtain all the necessary approvals.

        If the building does not comply with all the plans and the New
        York City building code, the company must make the necessary
        changes. Then the Department of Buildings inspects the
        warehouse again. This process is repeated until the building
        complies with all the rules. It is common to have 2 -- 3
        inspections of this sort. Once the building passes the inspection,
        the issuance of the certificate of occupancy is immediate.

        Receive building plan check and permit

        Building plans are screened for completeness and accuracy. An option
        to expedite the plan check is available for an expedite fee of 50% of the
        plan check fee. Plans that are expedited are usually handled in 5
        calendar days, as expedited plans can include weekend work, instead of
        the normal 3-4 week waiting period.

        Smaller projects such as tenant improvements and small offices may
        receive a counter plan check that takes only 45-60 minutes.

        Building plans must be submitted to the Department of Building and
        Safety, including:
        • Description of the work to be covered by the permit.
        • Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be done,
        and the street address.
        • Description of the use for which the proposed work is intended.
        • Two sets of site plans, including all boundaries, lot lines, existing and
        proposed buildings and structures, neighboring public ways, and
        dimensions.
        • Valuation of any new building.
        • Be signed by the permittee, or an authorized agent.
        • Give such other data and information as may be required by the
        Superintendent of Building.

        Building plan checks include electrical, mechanical, disabled access and
   1    structural plan checks. Grading plan checks may also be required if the       15 days      USD 48,646
        location is in a hillside area. Mechanical plan checks may also be
        required when there are HVAC systems or elevators required. HVAC
        systems may be required if the building is in the desert areas, but
        would not be required in the beach or basin areas. BuildCo's warehouse
        is also not likely to require an elevator, according to the CBC Title 42
        Chapter 11B, because it is fewer than three stories, and "a reasonable
        portion of [the] facilities and accommodations normally sought by the
        public... are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities."

        Costs include:
        - For the plan check, a total of $22,782.75 including:
          • Plan check fee: $9,699 (90% of the building permit fee) but if

      A sewer permit is required for all new connections to sewers. This is an
      over-the-counter permit and can be issued in as little as 30 minutes.

      In order to issue an S-Permit, BuildCo must identify the address of the
      property and work. This will be verified by the Bureau of Engineering
      (BOE) staff, and they will confirm the availability of the main line sewer.
      Furthermore, the BOE District Office where the project is located must
      be identified, in case the District Engineer’s input is required.

      could have completed the works until the panels/ switchboard before
      Coned comes and inspects and then only do the wiring when they know

      however, wants to avoid to have to re-wire, they can first wait for the
      service layout that tells them where the service room should be. The
      electrician is in charge of all the works until the connection point. The

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

       A title report is obtained from one of many competing private
       companies, regulated by the state. Fees for title insurance are set by
       state regulators. Fees for services vary. A title report is not technically
       mandatory, but is routinely used to analyze the quality of title. A title
       report is an essential prerequisite to securing title insurance. No title
       company would offer title insurance without a title report tracing the

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business
taxpayer service centers or allowing for more deductions          recorded in United States (table 8.1)?

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                            As a general rule, unless a debtor believes that restructuring is
                                            hopeless, a debtor will likely seek bankruptcy protection. This is
                                            particularly true in a case where the chairman or other decision-maker
                                            controls and/or owns a large portion of the debtor equity. Moreover,

                                            plan. Mirage would therefore likely file for bankruptcy protection and
                                            seek and likely achieve a reorganization. However, there is a chance in
                                            the current environment that the case could end in a sale or return of

                                             the US Trustee). Unofficial (ad hoc) committees may also be involved.

                                             representation of the loan, the issues will be litigated before the court.
                                             Once all claims have been confirmed, Mirage will propose a
                                             reorganization plan, which must pass "the best interest of the creditors
                                             test", so that creditors who vote against the plan receive at least as
                                             much as they would have received if the debtor were liquidation. The
                                             creditors will vote on the plan and accept it. When the plan becomes
                                             effective, the court will enter a final decree closing the case.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
