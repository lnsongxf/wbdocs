Preface

                   The objective of this report is to update the Government of Bangladesh, think tanks
                   and researchers, the general public as well as the Bank’s senior management on the
                   state of the economy, outlook, risks, progress on structural policy reforms and key
                   challenges the economy is currently facing. The coverage includes developments in
                   the real sector focusing on growth, inflation, and poverty; external sector
                   developments focusing on the balance of payments, foreign exchange reserves and
                   the exchange rate; fiscal developments focusing on revenue mobilization, public
                   expenditures, and deficit financing; financial sector developments focusing on credit
                   and interest rates; and monetary developments focusing on reserve money and
                   broad money growth trends. This update also focuses on introducing carbon
                   taxation in Bangladesh.

   Executive Summary




This update introduces Bangladesh’s new poverty numbers at $1.90 per capita per day in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP)
prices, followed by an account of recent economic development, the outlook, risks, and policy responses. The revised poverty rates
are significantly lower, but follow the same downward historical trend seen when using the 2005 international extreme poverty
line. Bangladesh can bring its extreme poverty rate down to nearly zero by 2030 either by accelerating GDP growth to 9 percent
per year, or by maintaining its recent growth rate while taking steps to make growth more inclusive. Bangladesh is on track to
sustaining its recent 6 plus percent growth in the near and medium-term, driven by exports and strong domestic demand.
Security, financial and trade shocks are the main risks. The policy challenges are to boost productivity and private investment by
reforming business regulations, addressing infrastructure and energy deficits and increasing the efficiency of financial
intermediation. A special policy focus in this report is on introducing carbon taxation.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

 Based on the                 The international extreme poverty line was updated in 2015 to reflect new price
 international                data, and while most countries reported updated statistics at that time, the World
 extreme poverty line         Bank did not apply the 2011 PPP for Bangladesh; rather it took extra steps to assess
 of $1.90 per person,         that the 2011 PPP accurately reflected the prices of goods for people in the country.
 per day, and the
 2011 Purchasing
 Power Parity (PPP)
 conversion factors,
 the World Bank has
 revised the entire
 series of estimated
 poverty rates from
 1991 to 2010 for
 Bangladesh.

THE WORLD BANK                                                                                              October 2016
                                                                                                                                ix
         Sustained Development Progress                                  Bangladesh Development Update


                         The World Bank estimates the proportion of people living below an
                          international extreme poverty line primarily to monitor global and regional
                          poverty, to allow for comparisons between countries, and to track progress
                          toward global goals to end extreme poverty set by the World Bank, the United
                          Nations, and others. National poverty rates are the most appropriate for
                          underpinning dialogue or targeting programs to reach the poorest in a country.

                         The number of poor in Bangladesh is much lower, but the historical trend is the same. The
                          extreme poverty rate at $1.90 (2011 PPPs) was 18.5 percent in 2010, which
                          corresponds to around 28 million poor in that year, the latest year for which a
                          household survey is available for Bangladesh. In contrast, the international
                          extreme poverty rate measured at the old line of $1.25 per day (at 2005 PPPs)
                          was 43.3 percent, which corresponds to an estimated 65.6 million extreme poor.
                          Regardless of the line used, however, the declining trend of extreme poverty
                          shows strong progress over the last 25 years.

                         The purchasing power of the Taka was much stronger than previously estimated. The 2011
                          PPP conversion factor suggests that the Bangladesh taka’s purchasing power
                          relative to the US dollar in 2011 was much stronger than what the 2005 PPP
                          conversion factor suggested (adjusted for inflation). As a result, Bangladesh’s
                          GDP and poverty statistics based on the 2011 PPPs show that Bangladesh is
                          better off in USD terms than previously thought.

                         The international extreme poverty rates at $1.90 per day are more closely aligned with those of
                          other countries in South Asia, as well as with Bangladesh’s national lower poverty line.
                          According to the new estimate, Bangladesh is slightly better off than countries
                          at a similar level of income, and the revised estimate is much more comparable
                          to other countries in South Asia. Also, the international extreme poverty line is
                          now much closer to the Bangladesh government’s Lower Poverty Line.

Bangladesh fared      The poorest 40 percent of the population not only saw positive per capita
reasonably well on    consumption growth, but this grew 0.43 percentage points higher than the per
sharing prosperity.   capita consumption growth of the total population during 2005-10. Using this
                      indicator, called the Shared Prosperity Premium, Bangladesh outperformed a
                      number of countries in the South Asia Region (including India, Bhutan and
                      Pakistan), but fell behind neighbors in East Asia such as China, Vietnam and

                           based. Remittances declined in FY16, driven entirely by a decline of inflows
                           from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, despite a significant increase

                           Development Plan (ADP) expenditure target. Domestic financing of the fiscal

                           destination for Bangladesh after the United States and Germany. The
                           depreciation of the pound as well as the euro risks eroding the competitiveness
                           of Bangladeshi exports to these markets. With currencies having stabilized at

    A. Trends in Poverty and Shared Prosperity




 This section reports Bangladesh’s poverty reduction results using the international extreme poverty line of $1.90 per person per
 day and progress in promoting growth among the poorest 40 percent of its citizens. The World Bank did not report poverty
 numbers at the $1.90 international extreme poverty line for Bangladesh in October 2015, when the updated line was adopted
 globally, but chose instead to do additional research to ensure that the 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates were
 an accurate reflection of the prices of goods in Bangladesh. The revised series of poverty rates are found to be significantly lower,
 such that the divergence between the number of extreme poor based on the national Lower Poverty Line (LPL) and the
 international extreme poverty line has nearly disappeared. Bangladesh can end extreme poverty by 2030 either by accelerating
 GDP growth to 9 percent per year or by taking steps to make existing growth more inclusive.

                               Global monitoring of extreme poverty has been measured by the proportion of
                               people living below an international poverty line. In October 2015, 1 the
                               international poverty line was updated from $1.25 a day at 2005 PPPs to $1.90 a day
                               at 2011 PPPs for most countries. Bangladesh was one of five countries which
                               retained the $1.25 poverty line to calculate international extreme poverty rates, as
                               the switch to the $1.90 line resulted in a significant change in the estimated poverty
                               rate, warranting further analysis. For the 2016 update of the global poverty
                               monitoring, after a detailed assessment of the data and methodology, the World
                               Bank, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and the Asian
                               Development Bank, recommended that poverty for Bangladesh be estimated using
                               the updated international extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day at 2011 Purchasing
                               Power Parities (PPP). Accordingly, the entire series of extreme poverty numbers
                               from 1980 to 2013 has been revised, ensuring comparability between various

inclusion.

                       To estimate the required growth rate, the growth elasticity was estimated for a five
                       year period (2005 to 2010 or 2000 to 2005)7. Starting from a projected 13.8 percent
                       extreme poverty rate in 2015, the poverty rate is projected for 2020, 2025 and 2030
                       using expected growth elasticities. If the growth elasticity remains unchanged from
                       what was observed between 2005 and 2010, then Bangladesh needs an annual GDP
                       per capita growth rate of 7.5 percent (Table 2), which corresponds to a total GDP
                       growth rate of around 9 percent. This will be challenging. However, if Bangladesh
                       could share growth more widely, at levels seen from 2000-2005, then maintaining
                       the current rate of GDP per capita growth may suffice. Thus, growth that is more
                       inclusive will be critical for Bangladesh to end extreme poverty by 2030.




                       6   The World Bank’s goal of ending extreme poverty is similar but slightly different to the
                           first Sustainable Development Goal in terms of measurement. The World Bank aims to
                           reduce the extreme poverty index to 3 percent globally by 2030. The World Bank goal
                           does not try to reduce the extreme poverty index in all countries to zero. So, for
                           instance, if a country cannot reduce its poverty rate to below 3 percent, the global target
                           might still be achieved.
                       7   The growth elasticity is the percentage change in poverty that results from a 1 percent
                           change in growth.

                          growth rate, the more quickly economic progress is shared with the poorer
                          segments of society. Building on this concept, the Shared Prosperity Premium is
                          estimated as the difference in the growth in per capita consumption of the poorest
                          40 percent in a country to the growth in per capita consumption of the total
                          population. If the premium is positive, the poorest are doing better than the country
                          as a whole, and if the premium is negative, then the poorest are staying behind.

                          1.34 percent per annum. Therefore, Bangladesh had a shared prosperity premium of
                          0.43 percentage points during 2005-10, outperforming near neighbors like India,
                          Bhutan, and Sri Lanka, whilst falling behind East Asian countries such as China,

 B. Recent Economic Developments




 Bangladesh is on track to sustaining the recent 6 plus percent growth in the near and medium-term, driven by exports and strong
 domestic demand. However, private investment rate has been stagnating and remittances have been declining. Headline inflation
 has declined but core inflation has increased. Official foreign exchange reserves has crossed the $31 billion mark, equivalent to
 8.2 months of imports of goods and non-factor services. Although taka-dollar exchange rate has been stable, the real effective
 exchange rate has appreciated significantly because of large differential between inflation rates in Bangladesh and its trading
 partners. Interest rates have declined, but the banking system remained flush with excess liquidity. Fiscal deficit undershot the
 budget target in FY16 and the composition of domestic financing continued to shift towards costlier sources. Monetary policy
 remained accommodative. The near and medium terms outlook is stable, but the inflation target is not ambitious enough.
 Security, financial and trade shocks are the main risks. The policy challenges are to boost productivity and private investment by
 reforming business regulations, mitigating infrastructure and energy deficits and increasing the efficiency of financial
 intermediation. A special policy focus in this report is on introducing carbon taxation to build on Bangladesh’s commitment to
 contribute towards climate change.

                               GDP growth in FY16, provisionally estimated at 7.05 percent by the Bangladesh
                               Bureau of Statistics (BBS), has been healthy despite slowing private investment and
                               weak remittances. On the demand side, growth came from increases in government
                               consumption and investment expenditures, while on the supply side it came largely
                               from increased growth in services (Table 3). These reflected increases in public
                               sector wages. The growth windfall from such increases cannot be sustained.

                               The magnitude of the provisional growth estimate (Table 3) is debatable in the
                               context of the growth assessments based on available and relevant high frequency
                               indicators.8 However, there is little doubt that growth has exceeded 6 percent which,
                               by current international standard, is commendable performance.

  Agriculture.                 Growth in agriculture is estimated to have been a decent 2.6 percent in FY16, driven by growth in
                               non-crop agriculture. Rice production has stagnated, but minor food crops, livestock products and
                               fish production have grown remarkably.

  Rice production              The government’s food grains (rice and wheat) production target for FY16 was 36.4
  maintained at the            million metric tons (mmt), of which targets for aman, aus, boro and wheat were 13.6
  same level as last           mmt, 2.5 mmt, 19 mmt, and 1.4 mmt, respectively. The target was about 1 percent
  year.                        higher than the actual production in FY16 (36 mmt). Aman and aus production has
                               been estimated by the BBS at 13.19 mmt and 2.29 mmt, which are just about the
                               same as last year (Table 4). The wheat production estimate has been finalized at 1.4
                               mmt for FY16, which too is almost the same as the previous year’s actual
                               production. The 19.1 mmt target of boro production may not have been achieved as
                               cultivation declined with many farmers switching to other crops such as potato,
                               wheat and maize. Farmers grew boro paddy on 4.7 million hectares (mh) of land
                               during the current harvesting season, lower than last season’s 4.8 mh. Taking the
                               reduced boro acreage into consideration, the US Department of Agriculture
                               (USDA) projects Bangladesh’s total boro production at 18.6 mmt in FY16, down
                               from 19.2 mmt in FY15. Thus, the total food grain production in FY16 is likely to
                               have been lower than the target and also slightly lower than last year’s actual
                               production.

  Increased                    The crop sector has played a critically important role in ensuring food security and
  productivity in rice         creating jobs. Notwithstanding a severe and increasing farmland constraint,
  needed to sustain            Bangladesh has achieved near self-sufficiency in rice production through a
  self-sufficiency.            considerable increase in cropping intensity and technological progress. Cropping
                               intensity increased from 177 percent in FY05 to 190 percent in FY13. During this
                               period rice production rose by about 40 percent, while production of other crops
                               also experienced a rise. The increasing costs of irrigation and agricultural labor
                               coupled with higher returns from alternative crops are now discouraging farmers

                                from remaining engaged in rice cultivation. This is evident from the slow growth of
                                rice production since FY11 (Table 4). In fact, total rice and wheat production
                                growth (4.4 percent) fell short of population growth (6.2 percent) during FY11-16.
                                Sustaining productivity increases in rice cultivation is likely to become more
                                challenging in the future than it has been in the past. Boro rice, the main driver of
                                crop productivity in Bangladesh in the past, is nearing the frontier of existing
                                technological potential. Expansion of farm land is not an option. Excessive use of
                                chemical fertilizers for growing more agricultural products continues to pose a
                                serious threat to land fertility, public health and biodiversity. The most significant
                                challenge facing agriculture is the overuse, degradation, and change in quality of
                                critical natural resources, including land and water.9 Assuming no immediate
                                advancement in technology, further increase of rice cultivation may happen only
                                through expansion of modern varieties in aman and aus while maintaining the
                                existing level of Boro production. Climate variability has added to uncertainties
                                faced by farmers in cultivating aus and aman rice. In addition, excessive use of water
                                for irrigation is causing groundwater table to fall further, which is making irrigation
                                more costly.

 Fish production has            The fisheries and animal farming (livestock and poultry) sub-sectors accounted for
 grown at a healthy             about 5.31 percent of the GDP in FY16, of which the fish sector contributed
 pace.                          around 3.23 percent and the animal farming sector contributed 2 percent. Nearly
                                17.1 million people are involved in fish production, while animal farming has
                                created job opportunities for around 6.5 million people. For around a decade or so,
                                fish production in the country has been increasing to keep up with the growing
                                demand at home and abroad. Bangladesh’s annual demand for fish is about 4.1
                                million tons while production in FY16 was around 3.85 million tons.10 It produced
                                3.7 million tons and 3.5 million tons of fish in FY15 and FY14, respectively. Yet,
                                the country has a deficit of 0.25 million tons, which could be met by by ensuring
                                proper utilization of water bodies as well as using latest technologies.

  Poultry production     The country’s poultry industry has achieved self-sufficiency in meeting local demand
  continues to thrive.   for meat and eggs. The industry is now producing 1,500 mt of poultry meat per day
                         against the target of 1,400 mt. It also produces 16 million eggs per day against a
                         demand of 15 million eggs, and almost 10 million pieces of chicken every week
                         against the weekly demand for nearly 9 million pieces. As a result, the industry now
                         has an exportable surplus. Although Bangladesh could not yet export poultry due to
                         the inability to maintain international standards, the poultry industry is in a new
                         phase of development. An increasing number of poultry farms are tilting towards
                         integrated farming to market chicken meat and eggs. This trend will not only lead
                         to greater competition among the industry operators to ensure safe and hygienic
                         poultry products, but also make it more difficult for smaller operators to compete.
                         Increased integration in the industry will benefit consumers through competitive
                         prices.

  Industry.              Industrial growth is estimated at 10.1 percent in FY16, driven by growth in large and medium
                         scale manufacturing and construction.

  Double digit           The manufacturing sub-sector grew by 10.3 percent in FY16, the same as last year.
  manufacturing          Large and medium scale industries grew by 11.01 percent in FY16, compared to
  growth sustained.      10.7 percent in FY15. Small scale manufacturing industries grew by 7.02 percent in
                         FY16, compared to 8.54 percent in FY15. Industrial activity suffered due to supply
                         disruptions and weaker consumer confidence than in FY15. Overall imports for the
                         industrial sector grew about 6.5 percent in dollar terms, mainly due to import of
                         capital machinery which grew by 14.1 percent. Power plants, Padma Bridge
                         construction, flyovers and balancing, modernization, rehabilitation and expansion of
                         industrial units, garments and textiles in particular, spurred capital machinery
                         imports. Political stability and a decline in prices of capital machinery in
                         international markets appears to have encouraged entrepreneurs to get into new
                         ventures or expand their existing businesses.

  Recovery underway      The construction sub-sector performed better in FY16, growing at 8.9 percent
  in construction.       compared to 8.6 percent the previous year. Real estate, renting and business
                         activities have also performed better, expanding by 4.5 percent in FY16 compared
                         to 4.4 percent in FY15. In spite of the tremendous potential of the construction and
                         real estate sector, various factors adversely affected its development: land value
                         distortions, absence of secondary property markets, limited asset securitization and
                         sale of mortgages, and weak backward linkage industries such as cement, ceramic,
                         and brick manufacturing industries. The real estate business recently recovered due
                         to property price corrections, falling interest rates on home loans and sustained
                         political stability. The number of unsold ready apartments has now declined to
                         8,000 from 22,000 a couple of years back. The recent decline in lending rates is
                         expected to further boost apartment sales. However, the terror attack in Gulshan
                         has dampened the prospect of a faster revival. The construction sector now
                         accounts for about 8.9 percent of GDP, employing around 3 million people, and
                         accounting for 5.1 percent of the employed labor force in 2015.11

 power has been              Electricity generation has remained below capacity because of gas shortages and
 increasing as well.         plant shut downs for maintenance. The number of plants in operation increased
                             slightly from a year ago, as has the peak demand. An increase in peak generation nearly
                             kept up with the rise in peak demand. Total generation increased significantly from a
                             year ago, but load-shedding still continued.

 Services.                   Growth in the services sector increased from 5.8 percent in FY15 to 6.7 percent in FY16, largely
                             reflecting an increase in the estimated value added in public administration, education and health
                             due to public sector wage increases.

                             Notable among the well-performing sub-sectors in FY16 were public administration
                             and defense, and education where growth reflected the implementation of large
                             public sector wage increases (Table 5). Proxy indicators such as trade financing,
                             bank advances to the transport and communication sector, and cargo handled
                             through Chittagong port suggest robust activities in the services sector generally.
                             Although the service sector has been rapidly rising in Bangladesh, it continues to be
                             dominated by traditional activities. As in the past, traditional services comprising
                             wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, real estate, transport, personal
                             services, and public administration, predominate. There is no runaway, dynamic
                             sector as evident from the near constancy of sub-sector shares within the service
                             sector (Table 5). Since service industries tend to be labor-intensive, encouraging
                             dynamic services activity is critical from the employment perspective. Bangladesh’s
                             future growth will depend increasingly on raising productivity in the service sector.

 Investment.                 Progress in easing the binding constraints on investment has been slow. Inadequate infrastructure,
                             financial intermediation, bureaucratic inertia, and corruption continue to hinder domestic as well as
                             foreign investment. The lack of effective alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and slow judicial
                             processes impede the enforcement of contracts and the resolution of business disputes. There was
                             significant political stability since March 2015, but recent terror attacks have raised concerns about
                             a short-term, adverse impact on business and investment.

 Structural                  Private investors are discouraged from investing in Bangladesh because of infrastructure
 impediments                 deficits, scarcity and high prices of land, corruption, political uncertainty and, of late,
 continue to bite.           concerns about security. Severe scarcity of gas and electricity is making the process of
                             getting utility connections for new businesses difficult. Currently, approximately 2,000
                             new businesses are waiting to get electricity connections. The demonstration effect of
                             such delays on new investment is bound to be negative. The cost of investment has
                             increased as a result of scarce and high priced land for industrial purposes. This is
                             preventing many large companies from investing. The most recent evidence from Doing
                             Business indicators provides very little comfort. Bangladesh remains well behind

                             contracts (Table 6). On corruption, Bangladesh ranks 2nd worst in South Asia and the
                             13th worst in the world.15 This discourages domestic as well as foreign investment since
                             corruption increases the costs and uncertainties of doing business. The political turmoil

                          15.1 percent in FY16. In an export-driven economy like Bangladesh this is a trend in
                          the wrong direction.

                          Exports to the United States, which remains the single largest destination for
                          Bangladeshi exports, grew by 7.6 percent. This was accompanied by a 9.7 percent
                          expansion of exports to the European Union (EU). Within the EU itself, exports
                          grew by 18.9 percent in the UK. The growth in these markets was led by the strong
                          performance of the RMG sector. This allowed exports to exceed the US$ 33.5

                          products have still not been able to move up the RMG value chain. In FY15, the
                          significant depreciation of the Euro against the USD took away most of the effect
                          of a strong volume growth on the dollar value of RMG exports.

 Little progress has   RMG exports accounted for nearly 82 percent of the total export value in FY16, a 2
 been made towards     percentage point increase from FY15. However, there has been progress in the
 product               performance of the RMG sector in non-traditional markets. Japan, which is one of
 diversification.      the largest non-traditional export markets, witnessed a 19 percent increase causing
                       overall exports to Japan to break the US$1 billion mark for the first time.
                       Additionally, RMG exports have also increased by 19 percent in Australia, 12
                       percent in China, 16 percent in Russia and 31 percent in India. During 2015
                       (calendar year), Bangladesh also increased its global market share for RMG products
                       to 5.9 percent.19 During the same period Bangladesh’s competitors such as Vietnam,
                       Turkey and India also increased their market share. The impressive performance in
                       a non-traditional market such as Japan can be attributed to the relaxed Generalized
                       System of Preference granted by Japan for Bangladeshi knitwear products. This
                       policy change coupled with the earlier duty waiver on apparel items from
                       Bangladesh has helped to facilitate export growth. Bangladesh was also successful in
                       securing duty free access for its RMG products in markets such as China and India.
                       While RMG growth was led demand from traditional markets, the impressive
                       performance in the non-traditional markets played an important role in boosting
                       exports above target in Bangladesh.

 Imports declined.     As reported in the provisional national accounts estimates for FY16, an 8.9 percent
                       decline in imports in real terms resulted in a 47 percent drop in the absolute value of
                       (negative) net exports, thus more than offsetting the impact of a real decline in
                       exports on GDP growth. Decline in imports of food grain and fertilizer contributed
                       to the real decline in total imports. Note that growth in households’ real
                       consumption expenditure fell from 5.8 percent in FY15 to 5.3 percent in FY16.
                       Also, growth in real private investments fell from 6 percent in FY15 to 5.5 percent
                       in FY16. These may have contributed to softening the demand for imports.

 Remittances.          Remittances fell in FY16, driven entirely by declines from GCC countries, despite a significant

                          since 2008. Other regional countries in the region also experienced slow or negative
                          growth in remittances in the recent past.

                          In theory, remittances can decline because of a combination of the following: a
                          decline in the stock of migrant workers abroad, lower earnings per capita, a reduced
                          propensity to save, and a weaker propensity to remit out of what migrants are
                          saving. Detailed data to quantify the contribution of each of the factors noted above
                          is not available.

  The number of           In FY16, the number of migrant workers abroad increased by 7.6 percent, the
  Bangladeshi             highest in the last 7 years. The annual number of migrants going abroad reached

                          Oman, Qatar and Malaysia. Migration to Singapore has been steady. Female
                          migration has also surged, and the number of female migrants exceeded 100,000 in
                          FY16 for the first time since FY92.

  Average earnings        Because of increased unemployment and/or decreased wages of illegal migrants in
  may have declined.      GCC countries in particular as the authorities have been tightening enforcement of
                          regulation against illegal migrants. There is anecdotal evidence that the real income
                          of migrants is waning in GCC countries, as prices for staple goods and public
                          services have increased.20 The unemployment rate among Saudi citizens is 11.5
                          percent, but relatively few have lost jobs because of legal complexities in firing
                          Saudis. Hence, the weight of layoffs has fallen on foreign workers.21 Saudi
                          construction firms have been hard hit due to lower oil prices that have curbed and
                          in some cases delayed government spending on major infrastructure projects. Oil
                          exporting countries in the Middle-East have lost $390-500 billion in revenue due to
                          the fall in oil prices since last year.22 The number of construction contracts shrank
                          by about 65 percent in the second quarter this year relative to the same period the
                          previous year. Saudi Arabia, the biggest economy in the GCC, depends
                          predominantly on oil exports for its revenues.23 Lavish bonuses, overtime payments
                          and other benefits have been slashed.

                          (SR) 1200, a migrant worker could manage a decent living for SR300 two years back.
                          The same living standard now costs SR700. Conventionally, if income falls,

                               companies are passing the fees on to the migrants. As part of efforts to offset the
                               impact of oil price shock on revenues, Saudi authorities increased oil prices in the
                               domestic market.

                          consumption should fall proportionally, but this does not necessarily happen
                          because consumption habits are hard to change. Certain consumption habits are
                          formed at high income levels that are not completely abandoned when income falls.
                          This effect is particularly strong when the income decline is perceived to be
                          temporary. The propensity to remit may also have been adversely affected by the
                          decline in interest rates. The deposit rate fell from 7.26 percent in January 2015 to
                          5.67 percent in May 2016. The interest rate on national savings certificates was
                          reduced by 2 percentage points in May 2015.

 Inflation.               Inflation has slowed, benefitting from soft global commodity prices, but remains high relative to
                          global inflation and inflation in comparator countries.

 Overall inflation        Compared with 6.4 percent in FY15, its lowest in the last twelve years. The slowing
 decelerated to 5.9       was driven largely by a deceleration in food inflation (Figure 7). The fall in global

                          taka-dollar rate, and restrained monetary growth contributed to the lowering of the
                          inflation rate. The annual average food inflation rate decreased from 6.7 percent in
                          FY15 to 4.9 percent in June 2016, while the non-food inflation rate increased from
                          6 percent to 7.5 percent during the same period. Core inflation, excluding food and
                          fuel, is accelerating.24

 Food inflation           According to Food Price Watch, the average Global Food Price Index25 declined by
 decelerated due to       15 percent in FY16 compared to FY15. Low international food prices contained the
 the fall in              cost of imported food items. Declines in the price of rice at the retail level also
 international            contributed to lower food price inflation. During Jan-Mar of 2016, the average retail
 commodity prices         price of coarse rice was Tk 26-27 per kg and wheat was Tk 32-33 per kg, which
 and good rice            were respectively 16 percent and 9 percent lower compared to the same period of
 harvests.                previous year. The monthly average price of coarse rice in Dhaka dipped to as low
                          as Tk 26.4 per kg in May 2016, compared with Tk 31.1 per kg in May 2015.

 Non-food inflation       From 6 percent in FY15 to 7.5 percent in FY16, mainly due to a rise in the new pay
 increased by 1.5         scale for government employees, hikes in electricity and gas tariffs, and a rise in the
 percentage points.       flow of credit to the private sector. The decomposition of non-food inflation shows
                          that average inflation accelerated in clothing, footwear, rent, lighting, household
                          equipment, transport, communication, and medical care.

 The urban-rural          Average inflation in rural areas slowed to 5.3 percent in FY16 from 6.2 percent in
 inflation differential   FY15, but inflation in urban areas picked-up to 7.1 percent from 6.8 percent due to

                          in urban non-food inflation largely reflected increases in rents and household
                          furniture and appliance prices. The gap between urban and rural areas increased
                          further to 1.9 percentage points in FY16, compared with 0.6 percentage points in
                          FY15. The food inflation gap increased to 2.3 percent in FY16 from 0.9 percent in
                          FY15. The gap for non-food inflation widened to 0.5 percent percentage point in
                          FY16 from 0.4 percent in FY15, mostly driven by rent, fuel and lighting.

 External balance.                       Notwithstanding the decline in remittances, the persistence of a large surplus in the current and
                                         financial accounts has led to further reserve accumulation and appreciation pressure on the nominal
                                         exchange rate. BB interventions kept the latter in check against the US dollar, but the real
                                         exchange rate has appreciated significantly.

 Comfortable                             The overall external balance recorded a surplus of over $5 billion (Table 7) and the
 external balance.                       level of foreign exchange reserves exceeded the $30 billion mark at the end of FY16
                                         (Figure 9). The current account surplus increased from $2.8 billion in FY15 to $3.7
                                         billion in FY16 due to an 8.9 percent expansion of exports and a somewhat subdued
                                         5.5 percent growth of imports. A combined $670 million decline in the services and
                                         income account deficits helped offset the impact of a $453 million decline in
                                         remittances on the overall current account surplus. A $2.1 billion surplus in the
                                         financial and capital accounts complemented the surplus in the current account.
                                         Increase in aid disbursements, foreign direct investments (FDI), and decline in the
                                         size of “errors & omissions” helped sustain surplus in the financial, although the size
                                         the surplus declined relative to last year because of a large increase in outflows on
                                         account of trade credit and other short-term loans (Table 7).

 The real exchange                       The Nominal Exchange Rate (NER) of the taka against the US$ has varied within a
 rate appreciated                        narrow band between Tk 77.80 and Tk 78.4 throughout FY16. This is largely due to
 further (Figure 10).                    large scale USD purchases by the BB to prevent any nominal appreciation of the taka
                                         in order to maintain export competitiveness in the global market. However, the value
                                         of the taka against other major currencies has been volatile. The taka appreciated
                                         against the euro, pound-sterling, Indian and Pakistan rupees, and Chinese yuan in the
                                         12 months ending August 2016 (Table 8). This, combined with a large inflation
                                         differential with these countries, has led to an 8.8 percent real appreciation of the taka
                                         from January 2015 to May 2016, thus challenging the competitiveness of Bangladeshi
                                         exports in these markets. Furthermore, with the nominal appreciation of the US
                                         dollar against major global currencies including the euro and pound-sterling, the
                                         appreciation of the Bangladesh currency in real terms against these currencies is even
                                         more pronounced. The one big exception is the Japanese yen against which the taka
                                         depreciated by nearly 23 percent during this period, helping overcome the 5.6
                                         percentage point inflation differential between Bangladesh and Japan, and increasing
                                         the competitiveness of Bangladeshi exports in the Japanese market.

 The aggressive                            Foreign exchange reserves grew by 21.6 percent in FY16. This in turn has caused a
 pursuit of nominal                        substantial increase of liquidity in the banking system due to only partial sterilization
 exchange rate                             of capital inflows. In view of the rising trend in non-food inflation, this presents a
 stability of the taka                     serious risk. Also, while the underlying policy protects exporters who do USD-based
 against USD is not                        contracts with major trade partners, those trading in other currencies remain
 without risk.                             exposed to exchange rate volatility against those currencies. Using a basket of
                                           trading partners’ currencies as a benchmark for intervention, rather than implicitly
                                           pegging the taka against the USD, could help Bangladesh maintain export
                                           competitiveness from a broader perspective.

  The management of             A comfortable reserve level is important for absorbing external shocks and
  foreign exchange              uncertainties without disrupting the economy. The current level of reserves is
  reserves remains              equivalent to nearly 8 months’ of imports. A major part of Bangladesh’s official
  challenging.                  reserve assets is maintained in the form of convertible foreign currencies (83.7
                                percent), short-term deposits with overseas commercial banks, overnight
                                investments, and foreign bonds. BB has consistently maintained reserves in safe but
                                low-yielding foreign government securities with high liquidity. The return on these
                                investments has declined from 1.15 percent in 2011 to 0.61 percent in 2015,
                                although they have persistently exceeded the 6-month USD London Interbank
                                Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate (Table 9). Countries with the extent of import
                                dependency such as Bangladesh tend to maintain similar reserves-to-GDP ratios.
                                From these perspectives, Bangladesh’s reserves does not appear to be inordinately
                                high. However, the experience of the reserve heist and the inability to recover large
                                chunk of it so far shows that reserve management is not just about balancing
                                liquidity and return but also about security of the funds from being stolen. BB’s
                                capacity on all these dimensions need continuous strengthening.

 A problem of plenty.   Growing amounts of foreign exchange reserves demonstrate the comfortable
                        position of Bangladesh in terms of foreign trade. However, it leads to pressure for
                        sterilization, inflationary pressure, and asset price bubbles. The stagnation of private
                        investment has contributed to the excess of savings over investment leading to
                        reserve accumulation. This needs to change. The government needs to stimulate
                        domestic investment by improving the climate for private sector activity. Greater
                        exchange rate flexibility may be allowed in an orderly manner, which would enable
                        reducing further accumulation. Given a continued, steady surplus in the financial
                        account, the government might consider liberalizing the financial account. In view of
                        the current situation, capital outflows could be liberalized further, allowing private
                        firms and individual investors to invest abroad. However, this process would need to
                        be gradual and cautious based a careful assessment of the medium and long-term
                        outlook for saving-investment balance and the trends in international capital
                        movements.

 Financial Sector.      Interest rates have been declining, but the financial sector remains plagued by falling profitability and
                        rising concerns about non-performing loans and capital inadequacy, particularly in the state owned
                        commercial banks. Large loan restructurings have so far failed to produce the intended results.
                        Trading in the stock exchanges has stagnated and the price indices are broadly unchanged.

                        fundamental issues within the financial sector such as containing the volume of non-
                        performing loans (NPLs) and persistently high interest rates on National Savings

                            net profit in 2015 compared to the previous year.26 According to the BB, the
                            increased profitability in the banking sector was attributable to the decline in loan
                            loss provisioning in 2015. Both Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity
                            (ROE) increased by 10 and 130 basis points respectively in 2015 (Table 10).

  The decline in            Driven by excess liquidity in the money market and a declining lending rate, banks
  interest margins          are moving towards more non-interest/investment income to generate profits. What
  persisted (Table-9).      is even more worrying for the banking sector in the medium to long run is the
                            decline in the capital adequacy ratio. Over the last year, the capital adequacy ratio
                            declined to 10.8 percent. However, eight banks were identified as having capital
                            bases lower than the level consistent with the BASEL III Framework. When
                            analyzing this ratio closely, it is evident that the overall industry was pulled down
                            mainly by the performance of the State Owned Commercial Banks (SCBs) and
                            Specialized Development Banks (SDBs). It therefore was not at all surprising that
                            SCBs requested significant recapitalization funds during the FY17 budget process.
                            During FY16, the SCBs were allocated Tk 20 billion for recapitalization. BB profits
                            have been declining too. The reverse repo operations to sterilize liquidity created by
                            the acquisition of excess foreign exchange by BB contributed significantly to the 25
                            percent decline in BB’s operating profit in FY16 relative to the previous year. Over
                            the same period BB’s interest expense increased to Tk 8.01 billion from Tk 1.20
                            billion.

                            and significantly hampers its stability. As of June, 2016, NPLs in the banking system
                            increased by 23 percent over December, 2015 to reach Tk 633.7 billion, or nearly 10
                            percent of total outstanding loans. The situation is even more severe in the SCBs,
                            where NPLs account for nearly 24.3 percent of total classified loans. At the
                            aggregate level SCBs account for nearly 48 percent of total NPLs. Industry experts
                            expect this to rise even further as some borrowers may fail to make repayment of
                            installments against the restructured large loans. During 2015, the BB permitted the
                            restructuring of loans worth nearly Tk 141 billion. The timeline for repayment is

                       on June 30, 2016, less than 1 percent higher than a year earlier. The other two
                       indices also ended only slightly higher. The aggregate turnover at the bourse
                       declined to Tk 1,072.46 billion in FY16, Tk 51.06 billion lower than the Tk 1,123.52
                       billion registered in FY15. Portfolio investments in the DSE declined by nearly 35
                       percent in FY16. While portfolio investment accounts for a very small percentage of
                       the bourse’s market capitalization, this represents a significant decline and may
                       worry that local investors reduce holdings as well. Slow credit growth and poor
                       dividend declarations have been the key drivers behind the sluggish performance of
                       the capital market in FY16.

 Monetary Policy.      A cautious stance has been maintained overall, with some easing of policy rates in the second half of
                       FY16. This led to a large deviation of growth in reserve money, the monetary policy operating
                       instrument, from the monetary program target. Excess liquidity continues to swell, despite some
                       pick up in the demand for credit in the private sector.

 Reserve money         Although monetary policy overall has remained cautious with broad money growth
 growth overshot its   below the 15 percent target, the growth of reserve money overshot considerably the
 target.               14.3 percent target envisaged in the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) for the
                       second half of FY16. This overshooting is largely due to more than expected
                       increase in the foreign exchange reserves of the BB. As a result, liquidity in the
                       banking system increased, which was only partially mopped up through the BB’s
                       reverse repo operations.

                       Following successive years of significant deviations between the announced MPS
                       stances and their implementation in the guise of “accommodative” monetary policy,
                       there was a widespread realization that the BB’s inability in the past to adhere firmly
                       to its announced monetary program targets had fueled inflation, contributed to the
                       creation of asset market bubbles, and weakened Bangladesh’s balance of payments
                       position. The BB recognized the imperative for prudent monetary policy and
                       accordingly established quantitative targets for key monetary aggregates in each and
                       every MPS in recent years (Table 11). The BB took a series of monetary tightening
                       measures and allowed the exchange rate to move freely. These tightening measures
                       helped contain the expansion of monetary aggregates close to the monetary targets
                       of the BB. The objective of monetary tightening was to restore both internal and
                       external imbalances by taming inflation and thereby also stabilizing the exchange
                       rate. The BB adhered to the monetary targets stated in the MPS and maintained a
                       cautious policy stance.

                               in excess liquidity helped reduce lending rates which in turn boosted demand for
                               credit in the private sector. Declines in interest rates over the last two and a half

                               take loans in the backdrop of a relatively stable political environment over the past
                               year and a half. In addition, foreign currency loans have become less lucrative as the
                               interest rate differential between foreign and domestic loans is narrowing.

                               More recent monetary developments have generally been moving in the right
                               direction to achieve the MPS targets. In its monetary policy operations, the BB
                               should continue to focus primarily on the quantitative targets and not on policy
                               instruments like interest rates. It is beyond the capacity of any central bank to
                               influence or target both, and the BB is no exception. Like most developing
                               countries, the transmission of monetary policy is inefficient in Bangladesh.
                               Development of the treasury bills and bond market will be keys to boost the
                               effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.

  Fiscal Policy.               A large revenue shortfall relative to the original budget led to an increase in the overall budget
                               deficit, despite the usual undershooting of the ADP expenditure target. Domestic financing of the
                               deficit nearly doubled, with an excessive reliance on costly non-bank sources. Consequently, the
                               fiscal room for maneuver has shrunk despite a stable debt to GDP ratio.

  The budget deficit           The dependence on high cost domestic borrowing continued. The government
  increased relative to        leaned heavily on domestic nonbank sources, despite large excess liquidity in the
  last year, but               banking system. This is unnecessary, given that there is an aid pipeline of US$23
  remained below the           billion. At 3.4 percent of GDP, domestic financing was the highest in FY15. Still,
  original budget              this financing did not crowd out the supply of bank credit to the private sector
  target.                      because most of the financing came from non-banking sources and the demand for
                               bank credit by the private sector was weak, albeit recovering. The good news is both
                               domestic and foreign debts remain on a sustainable path.

  Revenue collections          However, there was a significant shortfall in revenue collection relative to the
  increased by a               original budget target. The National Board of Revenue’s (NBR) collection increased
  percentage point of          by 14.6 percent to Tk 1555.2 billion (9 percent of GDP) in FY16, exceeding the

 GDP relative to                 lower revised target of Tk 1500 billion. The drastic downward revision became
 FY15.                           unavoidable because total revenue collection in the first half of FY16 posted a
                                 growth rate of 15.8 percent against the annual target of 42.8 percent. NBR
                                 invigorated its tax collection drive in the last two quarters of FY16, leading to the
                                 increase in the tax to GDP ratio by 0.8 percentage points relative to FY15 (Table-

 The vast                        Bangladesh does not do nearly as well on tax collection as do countries at a similar
 undershooting of                level of per capita income and economic structure. Bangladesh's taxable capacity is
 the revenue target              underexploited. Three key reasons underlie this outcome:
 was expected.
                                    Tax policy has too many distortions. There are too many loopholes in VAT,
                                     SD, CD, and direct taxation codes. The policies on indirect taxation have not
                                     kept up with the development of the market economy in the country. The
                                     policies on direct taxation penalize the honest and reward tax evaders.
                                    Tax administration is inefficient. Its reach is neither wide nor deep enough, and
                                     is taxpayer unfriendly. It continues to use outdated systems and procedures.

                             Paying taxes is at times more cumbersome than evading taxes. Efforts to
                             digitize tax administration have not gone deep enough to be a game changer.
                            Corruption is a hindrance, depriving the government of revenues. Bangladesh
                             consistently ranks among the bottom ten in Transparency International’s
                             Corruption Perception Index.

                         development of necessary soft and hard infrastructure, human resources and skill

                         compliance. The Joint Committee proposed several other amendments. These
                         include imposing a 4 percent VAT on supply value for the service sector;
                         differential treatment of bargaining shops and reduced VAT on a number of
                         commodities including iron and steel. These would bring back the very problems in

                         Corporation (BPC) continued to earn profit in FY16. Since fuel prices fell and the
                         electricity prices at the retail level were raised, the government was able to cut
                         subsidies in these areas. An emerging Achilles heel in the recurrent budget is the 47.5
                         percent growth in expenditure on interest payments for national saving certificates
                         (Table 13). As a result, despite a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio relative to FY14,
                         the effective interest rate in FY17 budget is higher than FY14 (Figure 12).

 C. Structural Reforms




 The pace and direction of structural reforms have been uneven. Positive developments include the setting of a new mechanism to
 review interest rates paid on savings instruments and their use in financing the budget and the approval in principle of a new
 power bill that allows introducing independent system operator in a more coordinated manner. However, the implementation of the
 new VAT and Supplementary Duty Act 2012 has again been pushed back to July 2017.


 New mechanism                The government has formed a permanent committee consisting of nine members to
 established to               review and re-fix interest rates on savings instruments, and help tighten extensive
 review interest rates        government borrowing through savings certificates. The committee will assess the
 paid on savings              fiscal implications of borrowing via national savings certificates, while also looking
 instruments and              at its impact on total revenue receipts, non-development expenditure and cash
 their use in                 reserve portfolio of the government. An Additional Secretary of the Finance
 financing the                Division will be heading this committee. It will also include the representatives from
 budget.                      the BB and the National Board of Revenue (NBR). Going forward, the Ministry of
                              Finance will also announce any changes on a bi-annual basis, which is expected in
                              January and October of each year.

 Parliament passed            Some of these reforms include an increase in the source tax rate to 0.7 percent from
 ‘The Finance Act,            0.6 percent on export receipts. The initial budget proposal had the rate set at 1.5
 2016’ with limited           percent. As in previous years, this rate was reduced during the passage of the
 reforms.                     budget. Jute exporters on the other hand will continue to enjoy the 0.6 percent rate
                              on their export income till June, 2019. Another notable change in the budget was
                              increasing the Supplementary Duty (SD) on premium cigarettes by 1 percent, while
                              also simultaneously increasing the floor price of the lower value cigarettes and bidis.
                              It is expected that these steps will help to contain tobacco consumption in
                              Bangladesh, although more needs to be done. Through the Finance Act, the
                              government has also reduced the investment ceiling for tax rebates for the

                        digital services in Bangladesh, all e-commerce activities have been given VAT
                        exemption. This will definitely help small e-commerce entrepreneurs and also
                        increase digital penetration in the country. The government has also introduced a
                        ‘Tax Day’ to help publicize tax payment deadlines, in line with international best
                        practice. Unfortunately, the government has pushed back the implementation of the
                        new VAT and SD Act to FY18. Despite the reforms highlighted above, without the
                        implementation of the new VAT law, the revenue target may prove difficult to
                        achieve.

                        between Bangladesh and Russia. Of the total project cost, the Russian government
                        will provide $11.39 billion via a Russian line of credit, and the rest will be raised by
                        the Government of Bangladesh. This credit will have interest rate of LIBOR plus
                        1.75 percent. The credit is to be repaid in 30 years with a 10-year grace period and
                        the loan repayment will start from March 15, 2027. It must be noted that the current
                        external debt of Bangladesh stands at US$ 37.1 billion as of FY 16. Hence, this deal
                        represents an increase of around one third.

                     The policy also introduced minimum standards that suppliers have to meet to
                     partake in the tender process. These include conditions on the firm’s turnover,
                     working capital, capacity and experience. Similar standards were also introduced for
                     state owned enterprises participating in the government-to-government process. It
                     is expected that the introduction of this policy will help to improve the efficiency
                     and transparency in BPC’s petroleum import process. In the first open tender since
                     the enactment of this new policy, a total of 13 firms participated. At a time when,
                     market prices are low, it is expected the open tender process will help to facilitate
                     savings of Tk 1 billion.

 D. Outlook




 The near term outlook for Bangladesh is favorable, driven by exports and strong domestic demand, and supported by prudent
 macroeconomic policies, continued improvements in infrastructure provision, and ongoing structural reforms.

 Weakness in global           Global growth this year is projected at 2.4 percent, 0.5 percentage point below
 growth expected to           January forecasts.29 Bangladesh’s main export markets—the advanced economies—
 continue.28                  are projected to expand by only 1.7 percent this year, 0.5 percentage point slower
                              than had been expected in January. Investment continues to be soft, and the export
                              prospects of advanced economies have worsened. Despite a boost from lower
                              energy prices and improvements in labor markets, advanced-economy growth is
                              expected to level off in 2016, rather than strengthen as previously expected. Growth
                              disappointments have extended into 2016 for emerging market developing
                              economies (EMDEs), which are prospective new markets for Bangladesh.
                              Aggregate growth for EMDEs is projected at 3.5 percent for 2016, just above the
                              post-crisis low reached in 2015. However, there is a significant difference in the
                              prospects of commodity exporters and importers. After stagnating last year, growth
                              in commodity exporting EMDEs for 2016 is expected to be 0.4 percent—
                              substantially lower than the 1.6 percent forecast in January, reflecting a significant
                              downward revision in commodity price forecasts, weak global trade, volatile capital
                              flows, and persistent domestic challenges. In contrast, growth projections for

                        commodity importing EMDEs are little changed at 5.8 percent for 2016, and are
                        expected to be broadly stable at that level through 2018.

Continued low oil       Growth in the Middle East and North Africa is projected to rise slightly in 2016 to
prices, together with   2.9 percent from the 2015 rate of growth, but 1.1 percentage points below the
tightening fiscal and   January estimate, largely due to a lower projected path for oil prices.30 Given that oil
monetary policy,        exporting economies account for four-fifths of the region’s GDP, the expected
remain a drag on        recovery in oil prices in 2017 is projected to lift regional growth to an average of 3.6
activity in the GCC     percent in 2017–18. However, the main reason for the slight improvement in
countries in the near   regional growth in 2016 is stronger activity in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the
term.                   region’s second largest economy, which is forecast to grow 4.4 percent in 2016, up
                        from an estimated 1.6 percent in 2015, following the removal of sanctions.
                        Excluding the Islamic Republic of Iran, growth in oil-exporting countries in the
                        region will be somewhat lower than in 2015, at 2.5 percent. Policy buffers continue
                        to erode in oil exporting countries, reducing their ability to withstand further
                        downside shocks. This does not bode well for the employment and earnings
                        prospects of Bangladeshi migrant workers in oil exporting economies.

Brexit related       The outcome of the UK vote surprised global financial markets, with Brexit the
uncertainties appear materialization of an important downside risk for the world economy. As a result,
to be abating.       the global outlook for 2016-17 has worsened, reflecting the expected
                     macroeconomic consequences of a sizable increase in economic and political
                     uncertainty. This uncertainty is likely to take a toll on confidence and investment,
                     including through its repercussions on financial conditions and market sentiments.
                     The initial financial market reaction was severe but generally orderly. The pound
                     weakened by about 10 percent, equity prices fell in some sectors, and yields on safe
                     assets declined. The implications of Brexit are still unfolding, in a process that is
                     likely to last several years. Prolonged negotiations are likely to precede a new
                     relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and could still
                     affect global growth negatively. Thus, growth in the Euro Area, a major trading
                     partner of Bangladesh, is expected to remain steady but modest in 2016–18.

Commodity price         Except food and precious metals, all the main commodity price indexes are
declines projected      expected to decline in 2016 due to ample supplies. Energy prices are expected to fall
to continue.31          16 percent, with average oil prices projected at $43/bbl in 2016. This implies
                        marginally higher prices for the second half of 2016, as the oversupply in the oil
                        market diminishes. Downside risks to the energy price forecast include higher-than-
                        expected output and further weakening in EMDE growth. Supply disruptions
                        among key producers could lead to higher prices. Non-energy commodity prices are
                        expected to fall by 4 percent in 2016. Agricultural prices are projected to average
                        marginally lower in 2016 than in 2015. The outlook reflects adequate supplies for
                        most commodities but also takes into account reduced harvests in South America


                        30   “The outlook assumes an average oil price of $41 per barrel for 2016, down from $51
                             per barrel assumed in January, and that the price will rise to $50 in 2017 and $53 in
                             2018. Other assumptions are that there is no further worsening of negative spillovers
                             from the conflict in Syria; that the security situation in Iraq will continue to improve
                             slowly in 2016; and that Libya’s political agreement will be endorsed by the
                             internationally recognized parliament in the east of the country and that the new

                                     due to dry weather conditions. Agricultural commodity prices are also expected to
                                     be dampened by lower energy costs and plateauing demand for biofuels. Although

                                     percent in 2016 due to surplus capacity, weak demand, and low natural gas prices.
                                     Metals prices are projected to decline 11 percent in 2016, which follows last year’s
                                     21 percent drop, due to weak demand prospects and new capacity coming on line.

    Growth in                        Real GDP is could grow at 6.8 percent in FY17, reflecting weaker private
    Bangladesh is                    consumption growth (5 percent) and government consumption growth (10.4
    projected to remain              percent) relative to the preliminary estimates for FY16. (Table 15). Growth is
    resilient.                       projected to ease to 6.2 percent in FY18, driven by slower consumption growth in
                                     both the public and private sectors, as well as somewhat slower investment growth.
                                     Without boosting Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth and private investment
                                     relative to GDP, Bangladesh is unlikely to sustain 7 percent growth going forward.
                                     Delivering necessary energy, infrastructure, and regulatory improvements remains
                                     critically important to ensure sustained and inclusive GDP growth with strong
                                     employment creation. Two essential road projects have recently been completed,
                                     which, if managed well, should contribute significantly to reducing travel time and
                                     transport costs, thus boosting productivity and trade (Box 1).

               Box 1: The Dhaka-Chittagong and Dhaka-Mymensingh Highways Opened to Traffic
The 190 km long four-lane Dhaka-Chittagong highway formally opened in late July, facilitating trade and road
communications between the capital and the Bangladesh’s largest port city. Considered the country's economic lifeline,
the highway will significantly boost exports and imports, and contribute to economic dynamism. It is Bangladesh's
busiest road with daily traffic exceeding 40,000 Passenger Car Unit per day. But the highway had only two lanes and
was struggling to accommodate the rising volume of traffic, with regular tailbacks. The highway has been expanded to
four lanes from two. The time over-run was 3 years and cost over-run was 130 percent, indicating that significant room
for improvement remains in implementing infrastructure projects. The travel time between the two cities has declined
to five hours from 10-15 hours. Around 95 percent of the imported and exported goods are transported along the
Dhaka-Chittagong highway, including more than 75 percent of Bangladesh’s RMG exports. The reduction in travel
time significantly reduces transportation costs. More work is needed to realize the full benefit of the highway by barring
slow-moving vehicles from plying the road and building enough rail overpasses, flyovers and bridges.
 The completion of Dhaka-Mymensingh highway is another significant addition to the road infrastructure. In this
 case, the time overrun was 2 years and the cost overrun was 100 percent. The journey on this 87 km highway - from
 Joydebpur intersection to Mymensingh – is still interrupted by construction work on several kilometers in Bhaluka
 that are yet to be completed. These interruptions notwithstanding, one can reach Mymensingh from Joydebpur in
 only one and a half hours, a journey which used to take at least three hours or more due to the dilapidated condition
 and narrowness of the road. The traffic chaos at the entries and exits of the highways around the capital hinder
 realizing the full benefit of the four lane highways.

                               telecommunications and IT infrastructure.
                              On logistics quality and competence, 70 percent of the respondents spoke
                               highly of the freight forwarders, 100 percent confirmed that they were able to
                               choose the location of the final clearance and 90 percent reported improvement
                               in private logistics services.
                              On tracking and tracing, the improvement in ICT infrastructure will have been
                               enabled by GPS tracking used by private logistics operators.
                              Still, Bangladesh’s rank deteriorated significantly on timeliness, with 10 percent
                               of respondents reporting often or nearly always encountering incidents of
                               compulsory warehousing/transloading, another 10 percent reporting pre-
                               shipment inspection, 30 percent reporting criminal activities (such as stolen
                               goods), and another 30 percent reporting solicitation of informal payments as
                               the causes of major delays.

 Other indicators        The most recent data on a number of indicators that were anemic in the first half of
 also point to           FY16 showed a pickup in the second half of the year. Growth in NBR tax
 sustained strong        revenues, imports of industrial raw materials, capital machinery, exports, indices of
 growth.                 manufacturing, and flows of credit to the private sector have improved significantly
                         relative to the same period last year (Table 17). Exports in July-August, 2016 grew
                         by 8.4 percent relative to the same months in 2015. There are two significant
                         exceptions—growth in imports of construction materials and growth in remittances,
                         both of which show significant deceleration relative to the same period a year
                         earlier. Remittances in July-August 2016 declined by 15.3 percent relative to July-
                         August 2015. Hence, there is no room for complacence.

Stable near term        Inflation may edge up in FY17–18 on account of higher public sector wages, a one-
outlook.                off effect from the introduction of the new VAT, and overheating with actual
                        output exceeding the potential. The current account surplus is projected to swing
                        into deficit over the medium term. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain below 5
                        percent of GDP.

Policy outlook.         The overall fiscal framework underpinning the FY17 Budget is prudent, with sustainable deficit
                        and debt levels and an improved composition of spending. However, the revenue targets are
                        aspirational while the size of the ADP is large in relation to the government’s ability to implement
                        spending. The FY17 Budget fell short of providing specific directions on policy reforms in the near
                        and medium term. On the monetary front, policy continuity has been maintained, although the BB
                        could be more aggressive on containing price pressures and moving towards the inflation target.

The revenue target      The revenue target of 12.4 percent of GDP in FY17 is ambitious in light of the
is ambitious.           poor revenue performance in recent years and the lack of any major revenue
                        increasing policy or institutional reforms in the budget (Table-11). The required
                        revenue growth rate, relative to the revised FY16 estimate, is more than 35 percent,
                        compared with the 14.6 percent growth rate recorded in FY16. A 2 percentage
                        points increase in the revenue-to-GDP ratio would represent the largest ever
                        increase and the highest ever revenue buoyancy. Capacity expansion and automation
                        identified as the key drivers for achieving the revenue target (raising the number of
                        taxpayers from 1.2 million to 1.5 million). After accounting for the autonomous
                        gains in revenue due to economic growth and price developments, the total revenue
                        yield from discretionary measures is estimated at no more than Tk 300 billion.

Improved                The FY17 budget anticipates spending equivalent to 17.4 percent of GDP, which is
expenditure             not excessive given Bangladesh’s development and service delivery needs. The level
allocation.             is 2.1 percentage points of GDP higher than the FY16 revised budget (RB).
                        Expenditure allocations to social infrastructure in the FY17 budget has rebounded
                        after several years of decline. Out of total budgetary spending, the share of social
                        infrastructure is projected at 28.3 percent in FY17, the same level as in FY11.
                        Expenditure on all key social welfare and development sectors like education,
                        health, food and social security had stagnated or declined in recent years relative to
                        GDP, and their share in total spending declined at a time when social service
                        delivery needs were expanding. Thus, the increase in allocations to social sectors is a
                        step in the right direction.

ADP                     The FY17 budget projects an expanded size of the ADP, reflecting an increase of
implementation will     50.9 percent over that of the revised FY16 budget. The ADP allocation for FY17
remain challenging.     seems high in nominal terms, and it has crossed the Tk 1 trillion ($12.7 billion)
                        mark. As usual implementation will remain challenging and based on past
                        experience, actual ADP utilization may be 15 - 20 percent less than the budgeted
                        amount. The sectoral allocation pattern of the ADP for FY17 indicates a further
                        increase in allocations for the transport sector owing to the Padma bridge project,
                        along with major railways and Dhaka Metro projects. The emphasis on
                        transportation is appropriate and consistent with the need for better inland
                        connectivity.

                        export-orientation, which requires a decline in the share of the domestic market

                        that is protected.33 The emphasis in the FY17 budget is on a mix of protection to
                        domestic activities and revenue mobilization. The 4 percent regulatory duty (RD)
                        has been reduced to 3 percent after many years. What is new in the tariff structure is
                        the introduction of a 15 percent tariff slab to the existing five.34 While the new slab
                        breaks the huge gap between the 10 percent rate for intermediates and 25 percent
                        for final consumer goods, it provides the opportunity to offer protection to selected
                        intermediate goods, thus departing from the long tradition of only protecting final
                        consumer goods. However, with supplementary duties being adjusted in both
                        directions, the average nominal protection rate (NPR) remains stuck at around 25
                        percent, while the top NPR, a protection indicator of most import substituting
                        consumer goods, has been lowered marginally from 87 percent to 85.6 percent. The
                        result is a further rise in the effective protection to industries such as textiles,
                        construction, electrical and chemical industries, all of which have the benefit of the
                        highest NPR of 85 percent. Some of these may be considered infant industries that
                        warrant time-bound protection, unlike others such as biscuits and ceramics, which
                        appear to be permanent beneficiaries of protection. The implementation of the new
                        VAT Law was aborted, among others, due to stiff resistance from protection-
                        seeking industries that have come to rely on SD as the primary instrument for
                        protection.

 Monetary policy is     While there was pressure for relaxing the monetary policy stance in order to
 not firm enough to     stimulate private investment, the modest relaxation reflected in the BB's MPS for
 reduce the inflation   July-December 2016 is open to debate. The risks of expansionary monetary policy
 rate in line with      were dramatically illustrated during FY10-11, when M2 growth averaged 22 percent
 competing              per year and private credit growth accelerated to 25 percent per year. Excess
 countries.             liquidity did not increase private investment but instead fueled inflation, depreciated
                        the exchange rate, and contributed to the generation of land and stock price
                        bubbles.

                        Although the liquidity growth targets in MPS 2016 July-December are not as
                        expansionary as in FY10-11, they nevertheless are on the high side. The evidence
                        suggests that the higher growth of liquidity is unlikely to help private investment or
                        GDP growth but may simply feed into inflation.35 The MPS does not adequately
                        address existing inflationary pressures and the continued appreciation of the real
                        exchange rate. With global inflation slowing dramatically to the 2-3 percent range,

                        33   Theory and evidence show clearly that the policy of sustained high protection to
                             domestic import substituting industries creates an inherent anti-export bias of incentives
                             to become a drag on exports or its diversification.
                        34   1%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 25%.
                        35   There is no obvious correlation between the flow of credit to the private sector and
                             investment. The private investment rate remained nearly flat at around 22 percent of
                             GDP during FY10-16, irrespective of the behavior of growth of private credit and the
                             pattern of real interest rates. Private credit growth has ranged from a high of 26 percent
                             to a low of 11 percent, with little discernable impact on the private investment
                             rate. Similarly, the real average lending rate has fluctuated between a low of 2 percent to
                             a high of 7 percent without influencing the private investment rate. This lack of
                             sensitivity of private investment rates to private credit growth and real interest rates
                             suggests that neither is a constraint to private investment in the present conditions. The
                             binding constraints include the high cost of doing business, difficulties of procuring
                             land, the high rates of corporate taxation, the severe shortage of energy (especially
                             natural gas), the inefficiency of trade logistics (especially transport costs), and the limited
                             availability of skills.

                Bangladesh needs to reduce domestic inflation through firmer fiscal and monetary
                policies.

                Inflation control and exchange rate management deserve much more policy
                attention than is reflected in the MPS. A 12-13 percent expansion of M2 is
                consistent with the government’s GDP growth target of 7.2 percent and an inflation
                target of less than 5 percent. It is not advisable to target inflation at 5.8 percent
                when all the external competitors and export markets have much lower inflation.
                Growth with stability is the need of the hour in a poor country like Bangladesh
                where so many people face continuing vulnerability.

 E. Challenges and Policy Responses




 Downside domestic risks related to terror attacks, vulnerability of remittances to shocks in GCC countries, weak bank balance
 sheets, and revenue shortfalls are the key concerns. The challenge is to boost productivity and private investment by reforming
 business regulations, mitigating infrastructure and energy deficiencies, and enhancing the efficiency of financial intermediation.
 Greater investment—in infrastructure, productivity enhancing technology, and human capital—could lay the foundation for
 stronger growth.

  Risks to the outlook         Domestic risks to growth and fiscal positions include setbacks in implementing
  are predominantly            reforms affecting the allocation of labor, land and capital, such as the removal of
  domestic and                 impediments to productivity. Delays could be driven by entrenched political
  weighted to the              obstacles to the implementation of reforms (e.g. the new VAT law). Postponing
  downside.                    reforms would compromise future productivity, dampen growth prospects and
                               increase fiscal pressures. Although Bangladesh’s systemically important banks do
                               not rely heavily on wholesale funding, vulnerabilities in bank balance sheets may
                               lead to financial stress and weigh on lending. Several banks must raise their capital
                               adequacy ratios to meet Basel III requirements. Some corporate borrowers,
                               particularly state-owned enterprises, are facing a deterioration in asset quality.

                       potential to cause damage to the economy, particularly be weighing on investment
                       and consumer confidence. Income and consumer spending, which accounts for 70
                       percent of the economy, could be significantly affected. Continued weakness in the
                       state-owned banks could undermine growth prospects and affect fiscal
                       sustainability, as would further delays in launching the new VAT. On the external
                       side, a protracted slowdown in the European Union due to Brexit related
                       uncertainties could hurt exports (Box 3). Remittances are vulnerable as persistent
                       low oil prices could further worsen investment and employment in host countries.

                                              Box 2: Impact of terror attacks
In addition to focusing global attention on vulnerability to terrorism, security risks could set back the steady
progress of the economy in recent years. Although individual foreigners have been targeted before, the Holey
Artisan Café attack is the biggest to hit Bangladesh in recent times, sending shock waves through the expat community,
many of whom are involved in the garment trade or work for aid institutions. Such terrorist attacks have the potential
to damage the economy by undermining investment and consumer confidence. An economic contraction may result if
fear and uncertainty cause tens of thousands of workers to stay home and consumer spending, which accounts for 70
percent of the economy, is severely affected. The service sector, including hotels, beauty parlors and restaurants, have
been badly affected in the immediate aftermath of the attack, as people are fearful to go to these places. Consumer
transactions and turnout declined. Banks and insurers could also be hard hit—the former on concern of a looming
economic slowdown and the latter on uncertainty about insurance claims.
A second potential economic impact could stem from the counter-measures that are adopted. The installation
of security measures is costly. In addition, the cost of security measures at airports - in terms of time wasted in queues
- is hard to calculate. There are other less obvious economic costs that are also difficult to measure. Terrorist attacks
can result in greater spending on unproductive activities such as heightened counterterrorism measures, expanding
para-military and police forces, and stricter border controls. The money diverted to extra surveillance and policing
rather than investment and trade may eventually pose a drag on growth. Over time, this friction in the economic system can
have substantial effects.
Apprehension of further attacks could hurt Bangladesh’s economic prospects. It will decrease foreign
investment and lead to more capital flight as investors feel insecure about making investment decisions in an uncertain
security context. Domestic investment was already weak, with capital leaving Bangladesh. According to Swiss central
bank data, Bangladeshi citizens’ deposits with Swiss banks rose by nearly 9 percent to 551 million Swiss francs in 2015,
compared with 506 million Swiss francs in 2014. Preventing future terror attacks will be essential to restoring investor
confidence, and implement mega projects like the Dhaka metro rail and the Matarbari power plant. Security concerns
may already be discouraging visits by foreign nationals and adversely impacting new projects as people will think about
the security of their employees as well as their invested funds.
Terrorism fears could also have an adverse impact on export oriented sectors. The country’s export-oriented
sectors, especially the apparel industry, are once again facing an image problem when it comes to foreigners’ security in
Bangladesh.

                                         Box 3: Likely impact of Brexit in Bangladesh
 In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (EU). Brexit sent shockwaves across major
 markets. Immediate impacts across South Asia and in Bangladesh have been more subdued compared to earlier episodes of market volatility.
 Though Bangladesh is adequately insulated from Brexit, there are certain challenges which policymakers must be aware of in the coming months.

 The most immediate impact of Brexit felt in Bangladesh has been the appreciation of the taka against the
 pound sterling (GBP). In the two days after the vote, there was a 10.3 percent appreciation of the taka against the GBP
 from Tk 116.19 on June 23 to Tk 104.28 on June 25, as well as a 4.8 percent appreciation against the euro from Tk 89.03
 on June 23 to Tk 84.78 on June 25. Additionally, the 8 percent depreciation of the GBP against the USD implies about
 USD99 million valuation loss (measured in dollars) in Bangladesh’s holding of foreign exchange reserves in GBP. This
 valuation loss constituted about 3.3 percent of Bangladesh’s foreign exchange reserve holdings on June 23. Subsequently,
 the currency market stabilized at around Tk 104 against the GBP and Tk 88 against the euro. Unlike other stock markets,
 there was hardly any reaction from the stock markets in Bangladesh.
  The medium-term impact of Brexit, if any, will likely come from the external sector. On the trade front, the UK
 represents the third largest export destination for Bangladesh after the United States and Germany. In FY16, the UK and
 the EU accounted for 11.1 percent and 54.6 percent, respectively, of total exports from Bangladesh. Exports to the UK
 grew by 18.9 percent in the FY16 relative to the same period last year, and to the EU as a whole they grew by 9.7 percent
 during this period. The depreciation of the GBP as well as the euro therefore risks eroding the competitiveness of
 Bangladeshi exports to these markets. With currencies having stabilized at this weaker level, it is unlikely that these
 currencies will go back to their pre-Brexit levels in the medium term. Achieving export growth of 8 percent or more for
 FY17 may therefore prove challenging for Bangladesh against the backdrop of a weakened GBP and euro.
 Depending on the terms of the UK’s exit, there are long term considerations for Bangladesh. Through the EU
 common market, Bangladesh is enjoying 12.5 percent duty benefit on its exports. Bangladesh may need to renegotiate
 Everything But Arms (EBA) benefits in the UK market, and may lose a champion for EU market access. Bangladesh
 also routes much (magnitudes not precisely known) of its exports to EU through the UK. With the implementation of
 Brexit, this trade will have to be redesigned. Whether or not this will mean an increase in trade facilitation costs depends
 on what kind of market access deal the UK negotiates with the EU. While Bangladesh, as a member of the
 Commonwealth, may get sympathetic consideration, there is a risk that the implementation of Brexit may lead to a build-
 up of protectionist and anti-globalization tendencies in the UK and elsewhere. Should this risk materialize, Bangladeshi
 exporters may face increases in transportation and financial services charges.
  Another challenge on the external side centers on remittance flows from the UK to Bangladesh. Due to the
  presence of a large Bangladeshi diaspora, the UK is a major source of remittances, accounting for 6 percent of
  remittances received by Bangladesh in FY16. The rest of the EU accounts for only 2 percent of remittances received.
  Total remittances from the UK amounted to $805 million in FY15 and $862 million in FY16. A weak pound sterling
  could have an immediate impact on the remittances being sent from the UK as remitters choose to wait for the
  exchange rate to return to “normal” level. A lasting appreciation of the taka against the pound and euro would also
  act as a disincentive to remittance from UK, other things equal. While it is too early to identify a causal impact,
  during the first two months of FY17, remittances from the UK declined by nearly 31 percent over the same period
  last year.

 Remittances are                 GCC countries have used their substantial reserves to maintain spending levels and

                                 reforms were implemented in all GCC countries in 2015 or early 2016. Modest
                                 efforts to expand revenue have also been implemented, including raising corporate
                                 and consumption taxes, but in the short term, these will not make up for large
                                 revenue losses in 2015 from plummeting oil prices. A GCC-wide agreement to enact
                                 a value-added tax at an expected rate of 5 percent at the beginning of 2018 was
                                 announced in March. The downward pressure on growth from fiscal consolidation
                                 will be reinforced in GCC countries by tightening monetary policy in tandem with
                                 any rate increase in the United States. While oil prices will recover only gradually
                                 over the medium term, supply shocks could lead to a spike in prices. Since

Room for                Even though low commodity prices have reduced fiscal and external vulnerabilities,
expansionary macro      and eased inflationary pressures, the scope for expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies is limited.    policies in Bangladesh remains limited because of binding structural constraints on
                        the supply side. Expansionary policies could support activity in the event of an
                        adverse shock, but the returns to such policies may diminish quickly. In an
                        environment of binding structural constraints, rising risks and limited policy buffers,
                        growth-sustaining structural policies are urgently needed. These measures would
                        boost medium- and long-term growth, reduce vulnerabilities, and signal to investors
                        that the government is committed to enhancing long-term prospects. If well
                        targeted, they could also support short-term aggregate demand. Easing inflation
                        pressures have allowed the BB to cut policy rates and maintain their accommodative
                        policy stance. Since the drop in international commodity prices is responsible for
                        only part of the decline in inflation, further policy easing is not warranted in view of
                        rising core inflation and uptick of credit growth. Monetary policy rate tightening
                        may also be required if inflation rises above target or more sharply than consistent
                        with macroeconomic stability. Macroeconomic policies in the near-term need to
                        focus on safeguarding stability. If the economy is hit by large temporary shocks,
                        counter-cyclical fiscal policy responses would be needed. The exchange rate should
                        be allowed to depreciate if the shocks are protracted.

                         rescheduled loans increased by 50.1 percent. Public sector banks (which represent
                         about 27 percent of total banking system assets) account for most of the problem. A
                         resolution of the issue would facilitate easier access to loans by credit-worthy
                         borrowers, and thereby boost investment. Sound insolvency legislation and
                         procedures encourage bank lending and support the reallocation of resources to the
                         most productive uses. Bankruptcy processes in Bangladesh are among the most
                         challenging in the world, with insolvency processes that take an average of 4 years,
                         and recovery rates of only about 27 cents on the dollar.38 Such barriers to legal
                         resolution of debts delay the exit of unviable firms, and hinder productivity gains
                         from the reallocation of resources to more productive firms. In this regard,

 F. A Carbon Tax for Bangladesh?




 Bangladesh’s Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan in 2009 made it the first developing country to articulate such a
 coordinated action plan. It was also the first country to set up its own Climate Change Trust Fund to help mitigate and adapt to
 climate change. In 2011, the Bangladesh Constitution was amended to include protection of the environment and safeguarding
 natural resources for current and future generations. Bangladesh has the chance to lead again. While carbon taxes have, so far,
 mainly been introduced in developed countries, an increasing number of emerging markets are recognizing their benefits. If
 Bangladesh joins them, not only would it place the country in the forefront of a critical global movement, but the direct benefits
 could be significant.

                        “business as usual” scenario, and more if sufficient financial and technological

Refocused and simpler taxes

“goods” and toward      that cause harm. Carbon taxes – and “green taxes” more generally – can contribute
“bads”.                 toward reduced pollution. Further simplification and increased use of tobacco taxes
                        could also be a part of the reorientation toward such Pigouvian taxes on goods with
                        negative externalities. To maximize the positive impact of this shift, it will be
                        important that Bangladesh continue to ensure that fuel is not implicitly subsidized
                        and priced at below world prices, as has been the case in the past (and is still the
                        case for some sectors that receive privileged pricing).

Carbon taxes can be     The carbon tax can be collected using the same administrative systems as existing

                        carbon tax does not (immediately) need to cover all carbon emissions. In
                        Bangladesh, it could focus on fuel, since it may be difficult to collect carbon taxes
                        from other sources, such as landfills or forestry. Typically, carbon taxes only cover
                        two thirds to three quarters of total emissions, and even developed countries
                        exclude emissions that are hard to measure.

                         cycle, they tend to do so by less than other factors that impact tax receipts. This
                         helps to make them less pro-cyclical than other taxes, helping to shore up fiscal

                         some fuels. These resources, combined with any additional climate adaptation and
                         mitigation resources raised following COP21 commitments, can also be used to

Monitoring and the     was to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty between 1990 and
2015 revision          2015 globally. The extreme poverty was measured by the proportion of people
                       living on less than an international poverty line of $1.25 per day in 2005 Purchasing
                       Power Parities (PPPs). The latest comprehensive revisions on the international
                       extreme poverty index took place in October 201547. The two most notable changes
                       were a switch to the use of the 2011 Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) and an
                       updated poverty line of $1.90 a day per person. PPP conversion rates are used to
                       convert the international poverty line to local currencies. The market exchange rate
                       reflects price differences in tradable goods and services only. In contrast, the PPP
                       conversion (or exchange) rate reflects price differences of all goods and services. Since
                       the poor consume both tradable and non-tradable goods, the PPP conversion rate is
                       a better measure to use for poverty monitoring than a market exchange rate. Both
                       PPPs and the global poverty line have to be periodically updated to reflect changes
                       in prices, as the cost of living across the world evolves. In 2015, monitoring of the
                       World Banks’s extreme poverty index was updated and two related changes were
