1- Yemen’s education system consists of kindergarten, basic education, and general or vocational secondary education or vocational training,
followed by undergraduate and postgraduate universities, teacher training institutes, community colleges, or technical education. Preschool and
kindergarten—which are not compulsory and mostly private—cater to 3–6 year olds, with generally one year in preschool and two years in kinder-
garten. Basic education—which is compulsory and free—starts at age 6 and covers grades 1–9. It includes a six-year primary cycle (grades 1–6)
and a three-year preparatory cycle (grades 7–9). Governorate-level examinations are held at the end of grade 9, \awarding successful students
with a basic education certificate. General secondary education—which is not compulsory covers grades 10–12. Students choose a science or
humanities track at grade 11, and receive a secondary education certificate after passing examinations at the end of grade 12. Vocational second-
ary education and training takes place in vocational training centers (two-year courses) or vocational institutes (three-year courses).
