INTRODUCTION


I
  ntegrated civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) and identity management
   systems (IDMS) provide a critical basis for identity management and the estab-
   lishment of personal identity. When developed in an integrated matter, these
systems can provide major savings in terms of time and costs, in addition to creat-
ing efficiencies in the flow of information across relevant institutions. Some coun-
tries are leading the development of more integrated approaches, and the lessons
learned, if properly documented, may be useful to many low- and middle-income
countries.
        This report describes the particular case of Estonia, and the process through
which the country has developed an integrated population registration and iden-
tification system aiming at improve public service delivery. The report identifies
enabling factors and best practices that may be applicable to other countries. The
audience of this report includes both policymakers and stakeholders interested in
developing national population-based identification systems in conjunction with
improving government services delivery, in particular health care services.



Why Estonia?

Estonia, one of the three Baltic countries, experienced a political and economic
reorganization after regaining its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
One of the first priorities of the newly established government was to rebuild a
national identity system. As a result, during the 1990s, the legal foundations for the
new system were laid out, and both a national identification number system and a
population register were established. Since then, Estonia has rolled out a compul-
sory national identification card program and introduced secure, authenticated dig-
ital identities, which are widely used and trusted, for citizens to use when accessing
public services. With more than 1.2 million active electronic identification (eID)
cards issued to nearly 95 percent of its 1.3 million residents, Estonia has not only
successfully developed an effective new system, but has also become an exemplary
case for countries designing new population registration systems or reestablishing
population registries after l periods of political instability and unrest.

E
           stonia is situated strategically on the east coast of the Baltic Sea bordered
        by Finland to the north and the Russian Federation to the east. It is the
        smallest and most northerly state of the Baltic countries—Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania (table 1.1). With a current population of 1,313,271 inhabitants,
Estonia is the fourth smallest country in the European Union. Its territory,
approximately 45,227 km2, is larger than that of Belgium or Switzerland, but at
31 inhabitants per square kilometer, it is one of the least-densely populated coun-
tries in Europe. Currently, the country is organized into 15 counties, the first-level
administrative subdivision, and further into 213 municipal districts, including
30 towns and 183 parishes. One-third of the population is concentrated in its
capital, Tallinn, which is the main destination of internal migration (Statistics
Estonia 2013).
        The development of the current identification and population registration
systems in Estonia occurred in tandem with other significant changes in the coun-
try’s policy and economic environment, which were initiated after Estonia regained
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Other factors, such as social and
demographic dynamics, and striking technological change, also influence how the
country’s unified CRVS/ID system works.

2          PRINCIPLES OF
           INTEGRATION


A
         successfully integrated identification system, such as the one devel-
         oped in the Estonian case, takes into account the complementarities
         among different identification systems by laying out the legal basis for
collaboration, designing information technology solutions to ensure intercon-
nection, and establishing consistent guiding principles and goals for collaborat-
ing agencies.



Main goal: Providing legal identity

The main benefit of having an integrated identification system is providing people
with legal identity. Possessing a legal identity allows individuals to have access to
public services and to protect their rights. There is also evidence that lacking a
legal identity has negative consequences for vulnerable populations in risky situa-
tions. In particular, the poor are more vulnerable to becoming legally “invisible.”
Having a unified, coordinated identification system creates long-lasting bene-
fits for individuals by providing protection for children from birth. When birth
registration is not part of a central national system, and there is no connection
between birth registration and other public services, there is no way to certify that
the person holding a birth certificate is the person for whom it was issued. On the
other hand, identification systems focused exclusively on personal identification,
which use ID cards, usually target adults rather than children, limiting children’s
access to public services. The concept of legal identity is not without challenges, as
some people might say that providing legal identity may also create vulnerability
and exposure if sensitive information is not protected, or if access is not controlled
by data protection and confidentiality regulations.

           AND ID SYSTEMS
           INTEGRATION


I
  n Estonia, identification, population registration, and vital statistics activities are
  carried out within two key subsystems. The first is the population registration
  and vital statistics system (CRVS), which is aimed at recording and certifying
births, deaths, and other vital events occurring in a population. The second is the
identification management system (IDMS), which is focused on providing legal
identity and associated documents to the population. These subsystems comple-
ment each other rather than duplicating their functions. These complementarities
provided the basis for their integration.



Evolution of integration

The historical evolution of identification and population registration systems in
Estonia is crucial to understanding Estonia’s successful integration of these pro-
cesses. Three particularly effective practices in this model are: (i) early introduction
of a personal identification number (even before the ID card and a population
register were established); (ii) cooperation among ministries and scientific institu-
tions involved in data collection, analysis, publication, and storage; and (iii) use of
a population register to support the national identity program.
        During the early 1990s, as a result of the dissolution of the former Soviet
centralized system, Estonia, like other ex-Soviet republics, faced the challenge
of developing new and improved systems of population registration and vital
statistics data collection. The previous system suffered from over-centralization,
poor quality control, and data comparability issues. In addition, population sta-
tistics were not freely distributed, and the use of such information was restricted
(Anderson, Katus et al. 1994). As a result, in 1992 the Estonian Government
formed a governmental commission to establish a population register that would

F
      ollowing the tradition of the Nordic countries, Estonia’s population registra-
      tion system was established on the basis of a population register (see box 4.1).
      These systems are known to produce up-to-date quality vital statistics, and
to foster interconnection of registries, which permits multi-sectoral collaboration.
The Estonian Population Register (PR) was not the exception—it was through the
PR and the personal identification code (PIC) that public registries were able to
connect through X-Road.

  Box 4.1:  Population Register
  “A population register is a ‘mechanism for the continuous recording of selected
  information pertaining to each member of the resident population of a country or area
  making it possible to determine up-to-date information about the size and characteristics
  of the population at selected points in time.’” (UNSD – Population Registers)

       Registration of vital events in the PR are provided in the Vital Statistics Act
and carried out at vital statistics offices. These offices are under the responsibility
of the Ministry of Finance, and as provided for in the law, can register births and
deaths, certify marriages and divorces, and make name corrections in the PR.
       Local and central vital statistics offices referred to under the law include the
following:

  Box 4.2:  The Estonian Medical Birth Registry (EMBR)
  “The Estonian Medical Birth Registry is a database belonging into the state information system. which maintains information
  on live and stillbirths, epidemiological research on perinatal illness and mortality, organization of pregnancy and post-delivery
  health services, and birth statistics”—Public Health Act.
  The birth medical register (EMBR) was introduced very early, after the middle of 1991, and includes data collected since
  1992. Since the commencement of its operations, the information on each birth card received by the birth registry has been
  entered into a computer, creating a continuous database for health statistics (Anderson, 1994). The EMBR plays a significant
  role as a complement to the population registration data. “The data to be collected make it possible to measure fertility
  in Estonia. The gathered data are also used in epidemiologic scientific research, and for organizing of post-delivery
  health services and birth statistics” NIHD, 2014.
  Since they were introduced, birth cards have included each infant’s assigned Personal Identification Code (PIC). The use of
  the PIC both in birth and death registration has made it possible to link birth and death records, a feature that has been used
  regularly as a check between medical registries and the Population Register (PR). This connection also allows errors to be
  assessed and the completeness of legal records to be determined. Because the EMBR includes births from non-citizens and
  non-legal residents as well, it has a larger scope than the PR. A second reason the EBMR has provided additional value is the
  additional level of information collected in the registry. Unlike the PR, the EMBR includes background information about the
  mother and father, including: nationality; education; occupation; number of previous pregnancies, miscarriages, and induced
  abortions; and other characteristics. This information of the mother at the time of birth can help shed light on the factors
  affecting delivery and perinatal mortality.
  At the EMBR, the following functions are performed (NIHD, 2014): data coding; Input of data; control and correction of data
  (in cooperation with health institutions and the PR); standards data processing and data processing to requests; saving data
  and storing filled forms in archives.

The structure and operation

Estonia has made significant progress in implementing an innovative and inte-
grated identification system characterized by its interoperability to other cross-gov-
ernment systems. The national Electronic Identification Management System
(eIDMS) is governed by the Identity Documents Act put into effect in January
2000. In accordance with the law, it is mandatory for all Estonian residents over 15
years of age to possess an ID card. Possession of an ID card is also mandatory for all
aliens who reside permanently in Estonia (Identity Documents Act). This feature
distinguishes the Estonian eIDMS from those of other countries, such as Finland,
where the ID card is not compulsory. There are no sanctions for not having a card,
but as expected, when the first Estonian passports issued in 1992 expired, most
people applied for either the ID card only, or the ID card together with an Estonian
passport, when renewing their documents in the period from 2002–2006. By the
end of 2006, one million cards were issued.28 Currently, the rollout of the ID card
is complete and more than 1.25 million ID cards have been issued. A number of
studies have suggested that some of the key contributing factors of the success of
the Estonia ID system are innovative public procurement, public sector competen-
cies and leadership, adequate funding and legislation support, and the development
of information technology infrastructure.

      n addition to the legal framework, and the introduction of a personal identifica-
   tion code (PIC), the interconnection between the Population Register (PR)
   and identification management systems (IDMS) was operationalized by
X-Road—an innovative data exchange platform behind eGovernment. X-Road
was introduced in 200133 and was originally designed to standardize the usage of
public databases through a standardized interface over the Internet for informa-
tion queries. Estonia had started developing public sector databases in the early
1990s, and the connection with other databases prompted individual ministries
to develop their own interfaces. With X-Road, only one single solution was neces-
sary to provide interconnection among governmental agencies. The development
of this platform showed the advantageous role of public-private partnerships in
Estonia. At least eight private companies, IT firms, and commercial Banks par-
ticipated in the project.34 Between 2001–2003 development cost was approxi-
mately $2 million (Kalha, A, 2003). Over time, X-Road became an adaptable
scaled-up tool that allows users to transmit large datasets, perform searches across
several databases, and interconnect registries. In 2013, more than 2,000 services

7          KEY ENABLERS AND
           CRITICAL SUCCESS
           FACTORS FOR
           INTEGRATION


I
  n understanding the Estonian success with system integration, it is important to
   note that neither the identification nor the population registration systems were
   conceived in isolation of each other. This is important because the holistic view
that the government utilized in developing all these necessary components had the
ultimate goal of improving public services delivery and ensuring public adminis-
tration efficiency. Thus, the integration process followed a systemic view where all
pieces had a function, and they operated in unison rather in isolation.
       In addition to the good practices already mentioned, there were three main
enabling factors that paved the path for system integration: sound and comprehen-
sive governance and legal frameworks; the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI); and
Public-Private Partnerships (PPP).



Governance and legal framework

Estonia‘s Identification Management System (IDMS) and Population Register (PR)
are governed by sound legal frameworks. Good governance and stability have allowed
Estonia to solidify the development of the IDMS and eGovernment with appropri-
ate legislation. Therefore, while the fundamental principles of data protection, pri-
vacy, and mandatory ID cards did not change, the legal basis for them has evolved
in parallel with the new digital solutions. Because Estonia was a pioneer in develop-
ing technological solutions, it was also a forerunner in establishing legal provisions
required to back them up. Thus, the legal basis was designed to work seamlessly
with technological solutions in Estonia. For example, when a new public e-service is
developed and made accessible via the X-Road, one of the central benefits is that it

Overview of the Estonian health system

Estonia’s health care system is composed of the Ministry of Social Affairs and its
agencies, the Estonian Health Insurance Fund (EHIF), the Health Board, and the
National Institute for Health Development (NIHD). The Ministry of Social Affairs
plays a central role in developing national health plans, overseeing the adoption of
national legislation, establishing regulations, and ensuring quality assurance con-
trols for the whole sector. In conjunction with the Ministry, the EHIF, as the major
purchaser of services in the country, plays a significant role in controlling health
care costs, and ensuring adequate access and quality assurance across contracted
providers.
        Estonia’s health care is based on a compulsory social health insurance scheme,
built on the principle of social solidarity. As a result, health care is provided irre-
spective of a person’s capacity to pay, social contributions, or status. The scheme
finances an established publicly funded package of services through social contribu-
tions in the form of payroll taxes (about 13 percent). Uninsured individuals without

 e-Prescription in Estonia
 Electronic Prescription (e-Prescription) was launched in 2010 with the objective of making digital prescriptions possible for
 every doctor, and ensuring every pharmacy in the country could process electronic prescriptions. The project was developed
 by EHIF took five years and involved several stakeholders (hospital managers, GPs, private sector, pharmacy software
 companies). Currently 99% of all prescriptions in Estonia are electronic, and it is considered the most popular eService in the
 country.
    Issuing medical prescriptions have benefited patients, providers and pharmacies. Before the system was implemented,
 patients were required to pick up refill prescriptions or those prescribed by telephone at doctor’s office. Using standard
 electronic data exchange environment have allowed medical practitioners to submit the prescription to a central prescription
 center. The e-prescription is then immediately accessible in every pharmacy on a patient’s request. Patients can then pick
 up their prescriptions directly in the pharmacy using the ID-card reducing the opportunity cost of traveling to the doctor
 office, but also have contributed to a more transparent prescription process. Patient can actually see the log-file for every
 prescription, and electronic information promotes monitoring and better prescription habits.
    Doctors, on the other hand, have the possibility of checking patient’s medications history (for all providers) and have
 access to the automatic calculation of the correct rate of reimbursement on medications compensated by the Health
 Insurance Fund. The family doctor can also automatically check the health insurance status of the patient by making a
 relevant query to the Population Registry. This query at the same time retrieves relevant personal information for the PR and
 automatically fills in the required fields in the e-prescription formula without the need to complete additional documents
 or submit again any of the information already stored in the PR. The pharmacy simply retrieves the prescription from the
 e-health system and reports back to the system that the medication was delivered to the patient. Because part of the form
 has been already filled by the doctor, the prescription is almost ready for e-invoicing by the EHIF. The entire process is
 conducted online using the digital ID card without any need for using paper-based documents

9   LESSONS LEARNED

The first lesson we can learn from Estonia’s experience is that the integration
of systems is not an automatic or immediate process. On the contrary, it
took the country about 15 years to develop such a successful unified system.
At the time of regaining its independence, Estonia faced many similar chal-
lenges as did other former-USSR countries. Among them were the need to
provide a new national identity document, to develop the national ID and
population registries, to improve public administration and its information
system, and to make public service delivery more efficient. The Government
of Estonia, still, realized very early on that innovation and reliance on appro-
priate legislation were important to give Estonia a good start. Thus, invest-
ing time in laying out a legal basis for the initiative, carrying out consulta-
tions and establishing guiding principles and goals became the system most
important strength.

Among this guiding principles, Estonia bestowed special importance to the
protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons upon pro-
cessing of their personal data. Thus, the government worked on ensuring
that the public and every person has the opportunity to access information
intended for public use, based on the principles of a democratic and social
rule of law and an open society. It also ensured that each individual has
control on their own personal information and ensure a clear and legitimate
purpose for sharing information. This feature not only empowers the citizen
but also generates a sense of accountability and trust in the system. Estonia’s
case shows the numerous benefits that a unique ID can have by guaranteeing
data protection and safety.

A very important aspect of the Estonian ID system development to consider
was the gradual chronological order in which the different components were
created. For instance, the initial introduction of the unique ID number facil-
itated the establishment of the Population Register. By entering this valu-
able information on each person in only one record, introducing ID cards
was relatively straightforward, as well as the ID-mobile and e-residency. The
