                              This publication is a joint effort by the GEF partnership to showcase some of the
                              insights gained from the now substantial portfolio of GEF-funded adaptation
                              projects. The GEF has invested over US$1.3 billion to help communities in the
                              developing world adapt to the changing climate, notably through the Least
                              Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF).
                              This publication, while drawing on only a sliver of the adaptation portfolio, gives
                              readers a flavor of the diversity and breadth of activities that the GEF has supported.
                              The projects featured in this publication illustrate that there is no one solution
                              that fits every context. What these projects show perhaps most clearly is that
                              development and adaptation are part and parcel of the same endeavor.

CEO and Chairperson           Despite our best efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, the world is already
Global Environment Facility   locked into climate change trajectories that we will have to cope with for many
                              years to come. Indeed, the implementation of the commitments made in the Paris
                              Agreement will only limit average warming to between 2.7-3.7C, confirming the
                              need for continued adaptation measures.

                              We therefore have no choice. We must continue to invest, more than ever, in the
                              health of the precious natural infrastructure that makes life possible, strategically
                              protecting those existing defenses that, if lost, may greatly worsen the severity of the
                              climate impacts. We must also urgently seize the opportunities that are available for
                              adaptation now, for they may not be available later.

                              The imperative to meaningfully adapt and assist others in adapting is now almost
                              universally accepted. This will require substantial funding, and it logically follows
                              that we must invest those funds wisely. It is therefore important to take the time to
                              better understand what the lessons are from the different efforts in adaptation.

                              The GEF is committed to using its programming resources to devise integrated
                              solutions to the multi-dimensional problems facing the global environment. As
                              articulated in the GEF2020 Strategy, the GEF will harvest synergies between
                              its partner agencies and its multiple investment lines, such as chemicals
                              management, international waters, biodiversity, the energy sector, and sustainable
                              land management, given the importance of integrating adaptation within and
                              across sectors.
4   TIME TO ADAPT




                    The GEF will remain at the forefront of the international effort to strengthen
                    countries’ resilience and help them adapt to climate change. The GEF Scientific
                    Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) has noted the urgency of GEF’s projects seeking
                    broader outcomes beyond single program silos, better addressing the key drivers
                    of environmental degradation and not solely the pressure points, and developing
                    a comprehensive approach toward scaling-up the impact of its investments.
                    Adaptation funding offers an avenue to pursue programming that is integrated and
                    synergistic with other efforts to improve the global environment.

                    In parallel, the role of the GEF and the value it generates in resilience alone,
                    by protecting and enhancing the systems in which it operates — landscapes,
                    oceanscapes, watersheds, and cities around the developing world — is directly
                    relevant to the broader adaptation effort.

                    Lastly, the GEF’s implementing agencies have greatly increased their awareness
                    and capacity on climate change impacts and adaptation — and most have now
                    developed tools and methodologies to address these. For projects that are sensitive
                    or vulnerable to climate change, it is of utmost importance that current and future
                    climate risk be taken into account in project design. Failure to do so could mean
                    that the project will not yield sustainable benefits over the appropriate time horizon.

                    The Paris Agreement on climate change has ensured that the GEF will continue
                    to play a fundamental role in the provision of finance for adaptation activities.
                    Moving forward in the post-Paris era, the GEF aims to: (i) continue to demonstrate
                    leadership with emerging issues in adaptation in the developing world; and
                    issues with environmental dimensions in particular, (ii) help advance the effort of
                    integration and mainstreaming of adaptation and resilience at all levels, including
                    throughout the GEF’s work; and (iii) assist countries in developing a better
                    understanding of adaptation in practice, including synergies between adaptation
                    and global environmental issues.

Introduction: Why this Book?

Adaptation is an issue of global concern and of equity. Climate change affects all
countries, but many developing countries are particularly vulnerable due to their
low adaptive capacities and lack of resources.1 Yet, these countries, communities,
and individuals are among the least responsible for climate change. Over the last
decade, climate change adaptation has begun in earnest to prepare for rising seas,
higher temperatures, worsening droughts, and other impacts.


This book shares the growing body of knowledge on adaptation, using the
experience of adaptation project teams to construct narratives that convey
meaningful and compelling knowledge based on practice. These adaptation
projects have one thing in common: they have all been made possible by funding
provided by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), under the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As such, the book draws
upon objective data and subjective observation, quantitative and qualitative
methods nested in real-world examples. This approach builds upon and complements
the growing number of other efforts to synthesize and share adaptation knowledge.


The wealth of adaptation literature, mostly theoretical and some practical, has
lacked in-depth accounts of actual adaptation projects and programs, and the
challenges that implementation brings. What is also markedly different about
this effort is that it draws upon a mature and diverse portfolio of adaptation
projects across the GEF’s network of partners. Indeed, the projects showcased in
this book were selected in consultation with the agencies involved in
implementing GEF-financed adaptation projects in 130 countries, totaling over
US$1.3 billion, embodying a diversity of perspectives, lessons, experiences,
sectors, regions, and contexts.


The intended audiences for this publication are adaptation and development
practitioners, fund managers, policymakers, adaptation decision-makers, and
other stakeholders.

     that low-lying and other small island countries, countries with low-lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable
     to floods, drought and desertification, and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly
     vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.”

struggling with drought, floods, food insecurity, disease,                            The international community’s approach to climate change
displacement, political instability, and armed conflict (IPCC,                        adaptation has undergone an evolution through the formal
2014b). Climate change adaptation has the potential to help                           UNFCC process. This section describes some of the more

DEFINITIONS (ADAPTED FROM IPCC 2014)

Adaptation: The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks
to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate
adjustment to expected climate and its effects.

Climate change: Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using
statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period,
typically decades or longer.

Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles,
volcanic eruptions, and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the
UNFCCC, in its Article 1, defines climate change as: “a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human
activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed
over comparable time periods” (UNFCCC, 1992, p. 7). The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change
attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes.

Disaster risk management: Processes for designing, implementing, and evaluating strategies, policies, and measures to
improve the understanding of disaster risk, foster disaster risk reduction and transfer, and promote continuous
improvement in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery practices, with the explicit purpose of increasing human
security, well-being, quality of life, and sustainable development.

Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, services, and resources,
infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected.

Hazard: The potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend or physical impact that may cause
loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service
provision, ecosystems, and environmental resources.

Impacts of climate change: Effects on natural and human systems of extreme weather, other climate events, and climate
change. Impacts generally refer to effects on lives, livelihoods, health, ecosystems, economies, societies, cultures,
services, and infrastructure due to the interaction of climate changes or hazardous climate events occurring within a
specific time period and the vulnerability of an exposed society or system. Impacts are also referred to as consequences
and outcomes. The impacts of climate change on geophysical systems, including floods, droughts, and sea level rise, are a
subset of impacts called physical impacts.

Resilience: The capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or
disturbance; responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity, and structure, while also
maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning, and transformation.

Risk: The potential for consequences where something of value is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain, recognizing
the diversity of values. Risk is often represented as probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by
the impacts if these events or trends occur. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard.

Transformation: A change in the fundamental attributes of natural and human systems. Within this summary,
transformation could reflect strengthened, altered, or aligned paradigms, goals, or values toward promoting adaptation for
sustainable development, including poverty reduction.

Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts
and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.

24   TIME TO ADAPT



                     Through the LDCF, the GEF has enabled 51 of the world’s poorest
                     and most vulnerable countries to access resources for the
                     preparation of their NAPAs. Fifty countries have completed their
                     NAPAs, and all but one have accessed resources for the
                     implementation of their NAPA priorities. Capacity constraints
                     notwithstanding, LDCs have made rapid progress in accessing
                     resources from the LDCF. The GEF has helped support a wide
                     range of adaptation interventions, which have been grouped in
                     ten main categories. The GEF’s portfolio of projects has also
                     spanned broad categories or types of adaptation. These
                     categories of adaptation are described in Table 2, along with
                     examples of projects that fall into each of these categories.

                     The GEF’s approach to adaptation has been based on the
                     recognition that climate change affects all aspects of human,
                     social, and economic development. The GEF has supported the
                     integration of appropriate adaptation measures into
                     development plans, policies, programs, and projects at the
                     regional, national, sub-national, and local levels, with the
                     ultimate aim of achieving climate-resilient development.

                     GEF-financed adaptation projects are working to reduce the
                     vulnerability of some 15 million people, while also introducing
                     more climate-resilient management practices over 5 million
                     hectares of productive and natural landscapes. Importantly,

Case Study Overview


Glaciers in the tropical Andes of South America regulate water flows and hence

are a key aspect of the region’s water cycle. However, those glaciers are melting

away, with overwhelming evidence pointing to climate change as the main cause.

The project Adaptation to the Impact of Rapid Glacier Retreat in the Tropical

Andes (PRAA) in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru contributed to increasing the

resilience of local ecosystems and economies to the impacts of glacial retreat.2
PRAA helped generate climate change scenarios and tools to: assess the effects of

glacier retreat; include climate change considerations in strategic planning,

including expected temperature increase, consecutive dry or wet days, and

precipitation variability; design and implement adaptation activities, such as

improving water supply and irrigation; monitor glacier dynamics; and promote

regional collaboration. The project also addressed fundamental issues for

adequate country development: pressing potable-water demands in the cities of

La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia; the need to strengthen water supply systems by

protecting watersheds near Quito, Ecuador; and irrigation water management

improvements in priority water basins in Peru.




2	   In Spanish, the name of the project is Proyecto Regional Andinode Adaptación (PRAA).

Case Study Overview


Armenia, a mountainous landlocked nation in southwest Asia, is vulnerable to

severe forest fires. The pressures of climate change – rising temperatures, drought,

and outbreaks of pests – are worsening the problem. The fires are harming the

people of Armenia and reducing the country’s ecosystems services capacity. In

response, the GEF and UNDP supported a project in the species-rich forests of the

Syunik region as a testbed to improve forest management in Armenia (Government

of Armenia and UNDP, 2008). The project, which ran from 2009 to 2013, worked to

implement forest rehabilitation pilot projects, establish early-response fire teams,

enhance institutional capacities and coordination, and revise Armenia’s legal and

policy framework for improved forest management. The project improved forest

health, forest fire management on over 100,000 hectares, and the capacity of the

Syunik region to manage wildfire risk in nearly 95% of its forested area; it also

supported national-level efforts to mainstream wildfire management considerations

into national policies and frameworks (National Statistical Service of the Republic

of Armenia, Undated).

Case Study Overview


Coastal communities in Bangladesh face rising sea levels, changes in tropical

cyclones, flooding, saltwater intrusion, and erosion. The Government of

Bangladesh and UNDP are working to enhance the resiliency of the most

susceptible coastal districts through mangrove reforestation and the Forest, Fish,

and Fruit (FFF) project. The FFF project helps communities plant protective,

productive vegetation interspersed with fish nursery ponds. The project provides

Bangladeshis with additional income and has established a “green shield”

surrounding some of Bangladesh’s most vulnerable communities. To date the

project has involved 30,119 households in adaptation and training measures; more

than 9,000 hectares of vulnerable coastal zones have been planted with trees to

protect these zones and maintain local livelihoods in a changing climate.

Case Study Overview


The World Bank and the GEF partnered on the Mainstreaming Climate Change

Adaptation in Irrigated Agriculture project in China’s Huang-Huai-Hai River

basin (the “3H basin”), spanning the provinces of Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui,

Shandong, and Henan. From 2008 to 2012, the project demonstrated

mainstreaming climate change adaptation activities within a conventional

agricultural sector project, how local development can be informed by integrated

modeling that considers climate change, and the expanded uptake of adaptive

practices by farmers. By the end of the project, average per capita income among

farmers had risen by US$326 per year, and high-value crop production had risen

from 3.2 million tons to 4.2 million tons per year (World Bank, 2015).

drought by improving agriculture-based livelihoods. The government implemented

the project, Coping with Drought and Climate Change in Ethiopia, between March

2009 and March 2013. It was one in a series of projects in Ethiopia, Kenya,

agricultural technologies and practices in Africa. This project led to increased

incomes, improved nutrition, and more secure and resilient livelihoods for

Ethiopians. The project also generated important lessons on effective techniques for

livelihood diversification and climate change adaptation, which have been captured

and shared in a variety of publications (see the References and Additional Tools and

rainwater. The project also gave farmers access to pumps, to
move the water from the ponds to crops for irrigation. This initial
support helped 280 farmers irrigate 23.3 hectares of land and
served as a foundation for additional work.

Irrigation brought significant financial returns for the farmers.
The majority earned US$498–$996 more than the previous
season, with the most successful model farmers earning
US$2,987. These were significant earnings improvements: in
2013, the per-capita gross domestic product in Ethiopia was
US$505 (World Bank, Undated).

Furthermore, small-scale irrigation enabled the farmers to grow
a variety of crops, including papayas, onions, and other
produce. On average, for example, model farmers (described
below) earned approximately US$2,000 per year by primarily
growing papaya and onions.                                               Credit: UNDP.

Case Study Overview


The Gambia is vulnerable to a number of hazards associated with climate change,

including drought, windstorms, coastal flooding, and sea level rise. Between 2011

and 2014, UNEP, the GEF, and The Gambia Ministry of Fisheries, Water Resources

and National Assembly Matters supported Strengthening The Gambia’s Climate

Change Early Warning Systems to: (1) improve the capability and resources of

hydrometeorology personnel, (2) engage stakeholders to interpret and

disseminate information, and (3) integrate climate change into national policies

and protocols. The project successfully developed a more adept national

hydrometeorology agency, enhanced the capacity of local hydrometeorology and

media agencies, and created more effective means for sharing climate information

with farmers and other stakeholders through radio listening groups.

The Gambia project achieved success in three separate areas:
improving the resources and capability of hydrometeorology
personnel; engaging stakeholders to interpret and disseminate
information; and integrating climate change into national
policies and protocols.

Improved resources and capability of
hydrometeorology personnel
As an initial step to improve the provision of climate information
to communities in The Gambia, the project worked to strengthen
the capabilities and technology of the NMHS through training
and technology enhancement.

In order to enhance the capacity of hydrometeorological
services, the project supported a number of training activities.
For example, the project sent three meteorologists to the United
Kingdom’s Met Office for an initial forecasting course. The project
also trained NMHS staff, increasing the number of personnel
with weather forecasting and hydrometeorological skills.

The Met Office conducted in-country training for forecasters to

sessions covered weather prediction, dynamics and

climate modeling. A hydrological technician also took part in an
18-month course in hydrology. At the local level, the project
conducted training sessions for hydrometeorological technicians
in the Department of Water Resources Training School.

The project also worked to improve technologies used by the
Hydrometeorology Service. Infrastructure such as synoptic
automated weather stations and high-capacity data processing
and storage equipment were repaired, upgraded, or installed
(Figures 1–5). An automatic weather station was installed in

Engaged stakeholders to interpret and
disseminate information
The project worked with a number of stakeholders to educate
them on the importance of climate information services, assess
what communication methods were best for their respective
groups, and begin disseminating climate information. As a first
step, two studies were conducted on approaches for cost-
effective, sustainable, and efficient ways of communicating

Case Study Overview


The project, Reversing Environmental Degradation and Rural Poverty through

Adaptation to Climate Change in Drought-Stricken Areas in Southern India: A

Hydrological Unit Pilot Project Approach, or Strategic Pilot on Adaptation to

Climate Change (SPACC), focused on increasing the knowledge and capacity

of farming communities in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to adapt to climate

change impacts. More than 210,000 people inhabit the project area and roughly

10,000 individuals directly benefited from participating in the project, including

women, who frequently suffer from limited access to educational resources

and livelihood support (Das et al., 2015). From 2010 to 2014, the project helped

participants monitor climate variability; complete courses on climate change

adaptation, sustainable water use, and sustainable land-use practices through

Farmer Climate Schools (FCSs); develop climate change adaptation plans; and

take part in weather and climate awareness-raising activities through local media

and text messaging. These activities increased the resilience of poor farming

communities to future climate impacts.

Approximately 60% of the 83 million people who live in Andhra
Pradesh and Telangana depend on agriculture as their primary
livelihood. Many reside in rural areas affected by periods of
drought (Reddy, 2011). The region has a harsh socioeconomic
environment characterized by high poverty and infant
mortality, reliance on child labor, and low literacy levels. Past
droughts and insufficient irrigation have led to food scarcity and
limited availability of grain. At the beginning of the project, the
area experienced average annual yield reductions of 3–6% due
to drought (World Bank, 2008).

Even without considering the further challenges of climate
change, these communities need support to improve their
land- and water-management practices so that they can
increase or even sustain current levels of productivity (Reddy           1 SAID–Nathiganichervu pilot HU	       6 SAFE–Ampaleru pilot HU

Case Study Overview


Malawi, a country of 16.7 million people, ranks as one of the poorest in the world.

With an annual per-capita gross domestic product of US$857, it is estimated

that nearly one-third of the population lives in extreme poverty. Agriculture

accounts for 37% of the gross domestic product, and employs roughly 80% of the

labor force (World Bank, Undated). The most important cash crop is tobacco,

produced primarily for export, while maize is the most important food security

crop. The country’s prospects for economic development are hindered by poor

infrastructure and services in the transportation, health, and education sectors.

The socioeconomic state of the country contributes to its climate vulnerabilities

(Magrath and Sukali, 2009).




The Climate Adaptation for Rural Livelihoods and Agriculture (CARLA) project

was the first project to work on climate change adaptation in Malawi’s agricultural
sector. The project was implemented in the Karonga, Dedza, and Chikwawa
districts, identified in Malawi’s NAPA as highly vulnerable to climate change:.

To help rural agriculture communities adapt to changes in precipitation and

temperature, CARLA financed projects to implement adaptation measures at the

community level, and enhanced the adaptive capacity of the national government

on community-based adaptation to provide lasting support for community-level

work. The project’s adaptation activities were designed to complement a broader

set of development interventions associated with rural poverty reduction.

Case Study Overview


Half of Mongolia’s 2.7 million residents rely on herding as their main source

of income. Together with ongoing challenges to their traditional way of life,

Mongolian herders also face a changing climate, including the potential for

increasing annual mean temperatures; increasing precipitation; more frequent

and more intense extreme events, such as drought, dzuds,1 heavy snow falls,
floods, and desertification.




In 2011, in response to these challenges, the International Fund for Agricultural

Development (IFAD) and the Government of Mongolia initiated a five-year

project, the Project for Market and Pasture Management Development (PMPMD).

This project focuses on increasing the resilience of the Mongolian livestock

system to climate change by strengthening the adaptive capacity of herders,

organized into community-level Pasture Herder Groups (PHGs). The project

conducts special training sessions concerning pasture conditions, pasture

management techniques, and climate change impacts. The PHGs then carry

out specific activities to address climate change, including developing water

harvesting points, fencing spring sources, storing hay and fodder, constructing

winter shelters, distributing sprinklers, and repairing broken wells. These

activities will help improve the herders’ resilience to climate change by improving

the long-term sustainability of rangeland and water resources in order to maintain

livestock production.




1	A dzud is a climate event that frequently results in large losses of livestock. It occurs because of a combination of
  natural events: a summer drought followed by heavy winter snow and abnormally low temperatures, which may fall to
  -50°C in certain areas. Dzuds are devastating to livestock, who die of exposure to cold temperatures or of starvation
  because they cannot find grass or fodder.

animals have difficulty locating and accessing food, and more
livestock die because of hazardous weather conditions.

Case Study Overview


Beginning in 2009, the GEF, UNDP, and key local partners worked together to

improve food security in response to drought in Niger. The project, Priority Action

under the National Adaptation Programme of Action to Strengthen the Resilience

and Adaptability of the Agricultural and Water Sectors in Response to Climate

Change in Niger, distributed drought-resilient seeds; developed and promoted

fruit and vegetable gardens; created sewing centers to generate income for

women; constructed cereal, fertilizer, fodder, and pesticide banks; and restored

degraded plateaus. The project also expanded the use of meteorological data for

agriculture via text and radio, built the adaptive capacity of the producers, and

restored natural ecosystems. The project-supported agricultural yields were

higher than those of traditional farming.

Niger’s endemic poverty, dry climate, and economic
dependence on agriculture have adversely impacted its
development for decades. Droughts in the region have always
resulted in complications for agricultural production, food
security, and water resources; however, climate change will
likely exacerbate these issues throughout the nation, according
to the IPCC (Niang et al., 2014).

Compounding existing and expected conditions in Niger are
additional pressures, stemming from rapid population growth
and an underdeveloped rural economy. Rural areas lack
critical infrastructure such as roads, schools, and hospitals
(USGS, 2012).

 techniques included distributing drought-resilient seeds,
 creating grain banks, building erosion-control measures,
 testing organic fertilizers and pesticides, and establishing
 sustainable farming practices. Furthermore, the project
 expanded irrigable areas to ensure water availability for crops.   Credit: UNDP.


 Enhanced institutional capacity in the agriculture and

 water sectors. The project provided climate information and
 risk management tools to farmers and regional technical
 service agents to guide the integration of climate change

Case Study Overview


The Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC) program brought together 14

Pacific nations between 2008 and 2012 to respond to the shared concerns of sea

level rise, storm surges, changes in precipitation, and extreme weather events.




UNDP worked in 14 countries — the Cook Islands, Micronesia, Fiji, Marshall Islands,

Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga,

Tuvalu, and Vanuatu — to train national officials to consider climate change in

development decisions and policymaking. Program personnel worked in pilot

communities to introduce interventions that enhance water resources management,

develop secure food production, and improve coastal zone management.1 Country

governments, UNDP, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment

Programme (SPREP), the GEF, and the Australian Agency for International

Development (Australian AID) supported the PACC program.

COMMUNITY-LEVEL FOOD SAFETY AND SECURITY
INTERVENTIONS IN FIJI

Climate events are already beginning to affect Fiji, with an
increase in the incidence and intensity of extreme rain
events. In 2009, UNDP and the United Nations International
Strategy for Disaster Reduction noted that high-intensity
floods would become more frequent in western Fiji. In the
Nadi area, for example, these types of floods used to occur
every 190 years. With the influence of climate change, they
are predicted to occur every 25 years by 2100 (Hay, 2009).
This increase is having an adverse impact on food security
throughout the country. Many Fijians rely on subsistence
farming for their livelihoods, but heavy rains overwhelm
existing drainage systems. When the excess rainwater does
not drain properly, crops are ruined, with cascading effects.
Without enough food from the harvest, people must buy food.
As a consequence they do not have the money to pay for
other needs, such as their children’s school fees. To help
Fijians adapt, the program helped introduce an array of
measures to improve food security in the villages of Namsori
and Nauvua. These interventions included the construction of
drainage channels and excavating creeks so that water can
drain from farmlands into the sea, as well as constructing
floodgates where these channels meet the sea. These
floodgates stay open during low tide so that water is able to
flow out, but close during high tide to prevent saltwater
intrusion upstream. For further protection, government
officials worked with local research institutions to develop
saltwater-tolerant crops, as well as crops that withstand
waterlogging. The selected crop varieties ultimately varied by
location, depending on local climate change projections and
other parameters.

  Gender and youth in adaptation

  It is important to involve a mix of people to ensure successful
  adaptation to climate change; thus, the PACC program developed
  a PACC gender assessment and action plan supported by
  regional experts and organizations. The plan included the
  development of a Pacific Regional Gender and Climate Change
  Toolkit (Leduc et al., 2013). Examples of how the PACC gender
  assessment and action plan (SPREP, 2014c), together with the

Case Study Overview


Southeast Europe is highly exposed to climate-related natural disasters, particularly

flooding. Climate change is further expected to increase the frequency and severity

of hydro-meteorological disasters. As a response, the GEF supported a project

aimed at creating catastrophe and weather risk–insurance markets in three

countries: Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of Macedonia, and Serbia.

Risk sharing and transfer mechanisms such as insurance have been recognized by

the international community as an important aspect of adapting to climate change

(Sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, 2010).




The Southeast Europe and Caucases Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (SEEC

CRIF) project supported catastrophe-risk mapping and modeling; design and

pricing of innovative catastrophe risk insurance products; collection of data to

support parametric weather insurance; and assistance for local insurance
regulators in developing new regulatory requirements for the catastrophe
insurance market. By the end of 2014, homeowners, farmers, and small and

medium enterprises (SMEs) in the participating countries benefited from the

opportunity to insure against financial damages caused by climate change and

geological hazards. Additional adaptation benefits created through this project

included public access to property-based flood risk information, as well as a new

damage assessment and claims system. These new types of information and tools

can serve as a foundation to inform national climate change adaptation plans,

disaster risk management, and disaster risk financing strategies.

Conclusions and Discussion


Climate change adaptation is a multidimensional problem with unique

challenges. While the 12 projects highlighted in this study are but a small subset

of the US$1.4 billion GEF adaptation program portfolio, taken together they reveal

a set of emerging insights.




The case studies provide and illustrate two major groupings of insights: the first

are specific to adaptation, and the second are more general in nature. The case

studies also highlight a number of ideas concerning the way forward, including

the areas where additional efforts appear to be both likely and potentially fruitful.

 What are the implications for learning from these types of

 experiences?

These questions remain largely unanswered in part because it
is simply too early to do so. As these case studies
demonstrate, many governments are still in the early stages
of testing climate adaptation strategies at broad scales. The
primary difficulty related to learning and adaptation is that it
takes a long time to assess the impacts of adaptation. For
many projects, the full impact of these interventions —
whether they were ultimately successful or not — will not be
known for years. In the meantime, there is an increasing need
to adapt and to act based on best available data and evidence.

Adaptation is contextual and dynamic, and requires constant
learning at all scales and across scales. Evaluative thinking
must be embedded into day-to-day conversations and actions.
Response strategies depend on the context, conditions, and
timeframes. It is crucial to try and inform the theory of change
with practice-tested knowledge, especially since adaptation
as a practice is no longer in its infancy and as empirical
evidence grows.

The evidence emerging from these case studies make a
compelling argument to direct more attention toward the issue
of knowledge management. Learning from adaptation
experiences is an urgent and important endeavor. While
knowledge is being generated, it is not always clear how
systematic this effort is, where this knowledge can be found,
and how it can be readily accessed. This is yet another important
area where investing more attention is likely to produce
significant dividends in the future. As these projects collectively
demonstrate, making adaptation tools and strategies widely
applicable and available will be essential to turn adaptation
successes into truly transformational outcomes.

The preparation and production of this publication was led by Saliha Dobardzic of the GEF. Rawleston Moore, Fareeha
Iqbal, Roland Sundstrom, Chibulu Luo, Dustin Schinn, Robert K. Dixon, Andre Laperriere, Ming Yang, Chris Severin,
Christian Hofer, Omid Parhizkar, Glynis Barber, Mark Foss, Scholastica Nguyen, Chase Keenan, Jonathan Adams,
Steffen Cole Brandstrup Hansen, and Jihyea Kim all provided support to this publication. Editing support was provided
by Joel Smith and his team project team at ABT: Diane Callow, Megan O’Grady, Stephanie Renfrow, and Alexis St. Juliana.

Rosina Bierbaum, Saleemul Huq, Robert Mendelsohn, Anand Pathwardan, and Cynthia Rosenzweig, served on the
Advisory Board for this project, and generously provided substantive input early on concerning the overall concept
and outline of the book. In addition, they provided in-depth comments and suggestions on the intermediate drafts of
individual chapters, along with Leonard Nurse, Penny Urquhart, and John Saka. We received many excellent comments,
yet practical considerations prevented us from addressing some of them. In this regard, any errors, omissions, or
deficiencies with the text are solely the authors’ responsibility.

Aside from the above-mentioned advisors, the following are some of the individuals who also provided valuable
upstream input on the content and structure of the book:

Those include Youssuf Nassef (UNFCCC), Kanta Rigaud (The World Bank), Sophia Bettencourt (GFDRR), Rob Van Den
Berg (GEF Independent Evaluation Office, until 2013), John Griffin (FAO), Walter Vergara (IADB), Pradeep Kurukulasuriya
(UNDP), Naoufel Telahigue (IFAD), Rami Salman (IFAD), Ermira Fida (UNEP), Craig Davies (EBRD), Bruce Dunn (ADB),
Anna Viigh (GEF Independent Evaluation Office), Bonizella Biagini (GEF, until 2014), and many others.

Chapter One (Introduction) was written by Saliha Dobardzic. Chapter Two (Background and Overview) was written by
Saliha Dobardzic and Roland Sundstrom. Chapter 15 (Conclusions and Discussion) was written by Saliha Dobardzic
and Joel Smith.

The opinions expressed in the study and chapters are only those of the authors, and need not represent those of the
Global Environment Facility, including its Agencies, or the countries.

ABOUT THE GEF

The Global Environment Facility (GEF) was established on the eve of
the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, to help tackle our planet’s most pressing
environmental problems. Since then, the GEF has provided over
$14.5 billion in grants and mobilized in excess of $75.4 billion in
additional financing for more than 4,000 projects. The GEF has become
an international partnership of 183 countries, international institutions,
civil society organizations, and private sector to address global
environmental issues.
