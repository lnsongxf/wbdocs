PARTICIPATING IN CHANGE
   Promoting public sector
     accountability to all
  Myanmar has a unique opportunity to enable people’s participation in change by promoting transparency
  and accountability throughout the public sector, including in revenue collection, the management of public
  expenditure, public policy making, and service provision. This could have a pivotal impact on the effectiveness
  of the public sector and thereby its ability to promote inclusive growth. In Myanmar, the public sector’s historically
  narrow revenue base and its limited role in public service delivery have led to weak development outcomes.1
  A history of opacity and lack of public engagement in policymaking (figures 1 and 2) have fueled corruption and
  compounded the loss of public trust in government.

  Yet evidence from other countries shows that active citizen participation can lead to improvements in
  the quality of public services and development outcomes. Since 2011, Myanmar has begun a process of
  transformation through more transparency in its Union Budget, increased government spending on socio-economic
  priorities, decentralized governance, and adoption of community development programs.2 Seizing the opportunity
  to further improve public sector accountability is critical in the context of growing expectations of improved service
  delivery and welfare.

major reforms in response to the Asian Financial Crisis
including the introduction of Medium-Term Expenditure
Frameworks. These led to more predictable and per-

a period of 30 years, and over time provided more and
better information on service delivery standards.
	
Establishing greater fiscal transparency has been a
common thread across all reformers. Evidence shows
that fiscal transparency is both important for macroe-

delivery. Several standards have been developed to

  The World Development Report 2004, “Making Services Work for Poor People” noted that the main difference
  between success and failure was the degree to which poor people themselves were involved in determining the
  quality and the quantity of services they received. It documented three ways in which services could be improved:
  by increasing poor clients’ choice and participation in service delivery, so they can monitor and discipline providers;
  by raising poor citizens’ voice, through the ballot box and making information widely available; and by rewarding the
  effective and penalizing the ineffective delivery of services to poor people.

                                                          With Myanmar’s recent reforms and development, the country
                                                          is well placed to improve all three relationships. The successful
                                                          elections in November 2015 contributed to strengthening the

                                                          The second link between policy makers and providers can be
                                                          strengthened by incentivizing public servants’ performance. This

  Several countries in the region have made innovative reforms to strengthen accountability between people and
  service providers - the third link above. Countries have taken different routes to establishing modes of ‘citizen centric
  service delivery’, which may be relevant for both Union level agencies in Myanmar but also municipal authorities.
  Malaysia around 2000 started providing public services like renewal of car registration, driving licenses, passports
  and other administrative procedures in convenient locations that the public can access easily. In 2008 the govern-
  ment established one-stop service centers. Malaysia also established minimum standards for waste collection with
  a helpline to report any fall in standards, which local authorities are required to address. This type of a feedback
  mechanism is also practiced in Thailand for street lighting, waste collection, and street cleaning.
  In early 2008 one district in Pakistan’s Punjab province, recognized the need to strengthen citizens’ role in the
  monitoring of service delivery – the third link above. The district began to contact citizens on their cell phones to learn
  about the quality of the service they had received. Those spot checks became the basis for a social audit system that
  spanned all 36 districts in Punjab by 2014. The provincial government outsourced much of the work to a call center,
  which surveyed citizens about their experiences with 16 different public services. The data from that call center
  helped district coordination officers identify poorly performing employees and branches, thereby enhancing the
  capability of the government to improve service delivery. By early 2014, the province was sending about 12,000 text
  messages daily to check on service quality. More than 400,000 citizens provided information between the beginning
  of the initiative and 2014. Known as the Citizen Feedback Monitoring Program, the Punjab’s social audit system
  became the template for similar innovations in other provinces and federal agencies in Pakistan.
