CHAPTER ONE
Introduction
The objective of this paper is to develop an approach for integrating a gender dimen-
sion into Agricultural Sector Risk Assessments (ASRAs). The focus is on the approach
because both agricultural risk and gender issues are contextual—thus the outcomes
of a gender-based risk assessment are highly dependent on the social, cultural, geo-
graphic, and economic contexts of the setting in which the assessment is applied. Each
ASRA must be tailored to capture gender differences that arise due to a country’s
unique combination of risks, cultural differences, institutional arrangements, and fis-
cal constraints. The target users of this approach are agricultural development practi-
tioners in charge of making decisions about, planning, and/or conducting an ASRA
and designing (and implementing) the corresponding risk management strategies.

For over 10 years the World Bank has assisted developing economies in designing
agricultural risk management (ARM) products, tools, and strategies. A wealth of expe-
rience and lessons learned were gained over the last decade by conducting a number
of ASRAs across several countries and agricultural commodities. This work extended
and refined the understanding of agricultural risks, their impacts, and their transmis-
sion across the sector, and the efficacy of different strategies to manage them. Cap-
turing this experience, the World Bank published in 2015 “Agriculture Sector Risk
Assessment. Methodological Guidance for Practitioners” on how to assess risks and
develop risk management solutions in the agriculture sector (World Bank 2015a).
While development practitioners welcomed that guidance, it failed to address issues
related to gender differences and their implications for risk management. This paper
addresses that omission.

The conceptual framework and step-by-step illustrations presented herein are based
on lessons learned by the World Bank and other institutions in assisting developing
economies in conducting sector and key commodity supply chain risk assessments
(World Bank 2015a). The paper also relies on recent work by international institu-
tions and academic research that offer insights into the complexities of gender issues
in relation to agricultural shocks. These experiences inform this paper’s case for a
gender-based approach to ARM and help to illustrate a practical, stepwise approach
for conducting gender-based ASRAs.

CHAPTER TWO
Agricultural Sector Risk Assessment
Conventional analyses of agricultural value chains typically emphasize productivity
and value addition, often through identification and removal of critical constraints or
bottlenecks, and aim at efficiency gains and/or distributional purposes. This approach
tends to ignore the issue of volatility in both production and markets and its effect on
supply chain performance; it also does not address the incidence, allocation, or impli-
cations of risk or how incentives to add value among different actors (i.e., smallholders,
women, and small and medium-size enterprises) might explicitly alter risk patterns.
Whereas the definition of risk implies the presence of uncertainty and the probability
of losses (e.g., from a pest outbreak), the definition of constraint implies a certain fac-
tor known to cause suboptimal performance in agriculture (e.g., poor soil) (Box 2.1).
This is important because a risk management strategy aimed at reducing volatility will
provide sustainability to agricultural investments targeting increases in productivity
and efficiency. Both strategies are typically mutually reinforcing.

The World Bank’s conceptual framework for ARM looks at risk from a broad sector
perspective and considers it as a decision support tool for designing strategies to man-
age risks in the agriculture sector.

An ASRA is simply an orderly process to analyze, identify, and prioritize risk, and
serves as the basis for the design of risk management strategies. The ASRA’s primary


 Box 2.1. Distinguishing between risks, constraints, and trends
 It is important to differentiate “risks” from “constraints” and “trends.”

 “Risks” are uncertain events that have the probability to cause losses. The element of uncertainty is present. As a symptom, yield
 volatility might be caused by a drought or a pest or disease outbreak.

 “Constraints” are conditions that lead to suboptimal performance. For example, low yield (symptom) might be caused by lack of
 access to inputs or poor technology. The element of certainty is present.

 “Trends” are longer-term or “chronic” patterns (reversible or irreversible) that provide context. For example, declining yield
 (symptom) might be caused by structural changes in agriculture or changes in climatic patterns (e.g., desertification).

CHAPTER THREE
Gender-Differentiated Impacts
and Responses to Agricultural Risk
ASRAs conducted by the World Bank to date have adopted an approach that places
priority on high-value commodities and considers stakeholders in supply chains as the
unit of analysis. The result is that greater attention has been devoted to the analysis
of risk for high-value supply chains, which are mostly represented by men. Even when
ASRAs focused expressly on domestic crops and livestock for reasons of food security,
the emphasis was on farmers in general, without unpacking the differences that a gen-
dered lens can provide.

Some efforts have been made in the design of ARM strategies and policies to iden-
tify and target specific exposed, vulnerable farmers. Farmers, however, are part of
households made up of individuals, and an intervention may affect household mem-
bers differently. It is important to understand how proposed interventions are likely to
work and the contexts in which certain social, economic, or political factors may affect
women and men differently, rather than affecting the household as a whole.

Understanding how exogenous shocks impact women and men is a key issue to
address if risk mitigation measures and risk coping programs are to reduce rather
than reconstruct people’s risk in the agriculture sector. A review of the evidence shows
that aggregate economic shocks do not have homogenous effects on farmers’ house-
holds. Gender matters in explaining differential effects, in terms of both the direct
(or first-round) effects of an economic shock and of households’ response strategies
(or second-round effects). Moreover, these effects vary across countries and stages of
development.

Past empirical studies typically presumed that households behave as though they are
single individuals, as the assumption of a “unitary household” is convenient and innoc-
uous in many contexts (Udry 1996). However, a growing number of studies since the
early 1990s have found strong evidence to the contrary (Strauss and Thomas 1994).
These studies conclude instead that the aggregate demands generated by households

 Box 3.1. Household surveys and asset ownership
 Despite the existing evidence on the gender gap in asset ownership and wealth, the required information is currently not avail-
 able for the overwhelming majority of countries. This situation is in part due to knowledge gaps in preferred questionnaire design
 and respondent selection protocols for capturing individual-level data on ownership of and rights to assets. With this in mind, the
 United Nations Evidence and Data for Gender Equality (EDGE) project and the World Bank Living Standards Measurement
 Study (LSMS) program established a partnership in March 2014 to implement a randomized household survey experiment that
 documents the relative effects of different approaches to survey respondent selection and questionnaire design on individual-level
 measurement of ownership and control of assets.

 The household survey experiment, known as the “Methodological Experiment on Measuring Asset Ownership from a Gender
 Perspective” (MEXA), was implemented by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) during the period of May–August 2014 with
 in-country training, survey management, field supervision, data processing, and quality control support from the LSMS. MEXA
 was conducted successfully using the World Bank’s Survey Solutions Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) software.

 The MEXA analysis yields an extensive set of findings that underlie recommendations for survey implementers in specific areas of
 data collection on ownership and control of physical and financial assets at the individual level. Subsequent phases of this experi-
 mental survey design detailing the experience and its applications in household surveys promise the construction of large national
 databases that will be extremely useful for risk analysis.

 Box 3.2. Review of asset ownership worldwide
 Land Ownership. Most data on asset distribution by sex in developing countries refer mainly to land, not surprising since in
 developing countries land is the most important component of wealth, especially in rural areas. Across the world, women account
 for less than 20 percent of the world’s landowners (UN Women 2012).

 A sizeable gender gap in land ownership exists in Africa, though the data on land ownership in Africa are hard to interpret, since
 much land is held collectively or is untitled. Recent data in FAO’s Gender and Land Rights Database show that women’s land own-
 ership is still irregularly dispersed. For example, women in Nigeria and Honduras own 4 percent of plots; in Nicaragua and Uganda,
 women’s ownership is as high as 20 percent and 18 percent, respectively (FAO 2010–11). The categories of private, communal, and
 state-owned land include a range of overlapping rights that add layers of complexity to any analysis of land “ownership.”

 Livestock. Livestock offer women a path toward additional income and food security (FAO 2013). Sales of meat, eggs, and milk
 can increase women’s decision-making and economic power, particularly important when coping with risk. In turn women fre-
 quently use the money to purchase food, household items, or medical treatment or to pay school fees that conceivably benefit the
 household (IFAD 2010). A general pattern is for men to own large livestock, particularly work animals, while women own smaller
 livestock and yard animals.

 Women face several challenges specific to their gender that constrain their ability to succeed as livestock keepers. In addition to dif-
 ficulties already discussed, access to training, extension services, markets, financial services, and occupational health hazards make it
 harder for women to improve quality of life by raising livestock (FAO 2013). Other inequalities include that women have less access
 to improved livestock species and enjoy fewer rights (ILRI 2010).

 Pastoral women are further marginalized even as they account for a necessary part of agriculture, raising stock in parts of the
 world where conventional farming is impossible. They build homes, tend to livestock, raise and educate their children, and manage
 domestic tasks such as cooking and fetching water and firewood. Women’s responsibilities prevent their mobility, so they are less
 likely to receive relief food or to venture out to look for work in towns (Anderson and Brouch 1999). In many developing countries
 women are responsible for milking and processing livestock products as well as selling them at market, but do not necessarily have
 control over money from sales. Methods to increase income and access must take into account the roles and responsibilities of
 women and men, social norms, and customary laws (IFAD 2012).

 Nonfarm Business Assets. Business assets usually provide a stream of income that provides security to the owners. Micro-
 finance programs throughout the world have focused on increasing women’s access to business capital for purchase of business
 assets. Notwithstanding the large amount of international research on microenterprises and informal sector businesses, little of this
 research has focused on whether a gender gap exists in business assets. In an early study in Ghana, Doss (2006b) found that although
 women are more likely than men to own business assets, the mean value of business assets owned by men is much higher than that
 owned by women.

    Box 3.3. The legal framework for asset ownership
    National constitutions, civil codes, and legislation shape the policy context of women’s de jure property rights. While most countries
    no longer deny women ownership rights over assets, many national laws are still inconsistent with international legal frameworks,
    including the Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), to which most countries
    are signatories.

    The framework that determines women’s property rights—particularly of married women—is the combination of legal marital
    and inheritance regimes, sometimes referred to as family law. The legal marital regime defines the property rules governing assets
    acquired prior to or during the marriage. Legal marital regimes can be differentiated as to whether: (i) the assets acquired prior to
    marriage remain individually owned or are pooled to form community property during the marriage; (ii) the assets acquired dur-
    ing the marriage (through wages, salary, rent, interest, etc.) are in fact joint assets or owned individually by the person generating
    the income; and (iii) the assets inherited during the marriage belong to the individual or the married couple. The right to marital
    assets extends beyond the marriage and determines what happens to the assets upon dissolution of the marriage through divorce
    or death of a spouse.

 Obtaining water: Interviewees revealed that obtaining water for household use and for drinking purposes is very difficult during the
 drought period. Lack of rain means the rivers dry up. This creates competition for the available water sources, which are usually
 so far that women and girls have to walk long distances to get to them. They walk up to 2–10 km in the Turkwell area and 30 km
 in the dry Kapua area. To beat the long queue at the water points, women start the trip before dawn. This poses security problems
 because they may be attacked by bandits or rapists on their way. To counteract this, women walk in groups. Transporting the water
 for long distances is also a problem because women carry the water on their heads in heavy traditional wooden troughs originally
 meant to be carried by donkeys, before the drought killed them. The few people using boreholes/shallow wells face similar short-
 ages because the wells dry up due to too many users. If they break down, they are not repaired because the majority cannot afford
 the maintenance costs.

 Provision of fuel: Women have to walk long distances to get firewood because of slow tree regrowth during the dry season.

 Construction of houses: The construction materials (twigs and leaves) are from a wild plant called egol (dumb palm). Construction
 becomes tedious during the dry season. Women have to keep dismantling, loading, unloading, and reconstructing new houses as
 the migrations become more frequent.

 Provision of food for the family: Food becomes scarce during the drought period. Women have to rely on alternative sources of food
 since the usual foodstuffs (milk, meat, and blood) are no longer easily available. Wild fruits are found in the fields while maize meal
 is bought at the markets or supplied by famine relief agencies. Even those living near the river are not better off because it dries up.
 Farming activities are reduced to small plots along the river where water forms pools (amokolol). Alternatively, people use boreholes.
 Consequently, only vegetables are grown on a small scale. Most women complain that cooking the “new” kinds of goods (maize and
 beans) is more time- and fuel-consuming compared to cooking milk, blood, and meat.

 Provision/decision making: Men feel that their role as heads of households is adversely affected during the drought period because of
 reductions in family resources. There is no money to provide food, clothing, and even school fees for family members. There are
 therefore fewer chores to distribute and delegate. Most of the men interviewed feel that women’s status in the family is uplifted
 because they receive famine relief food. Many men interviewed feel threatened by this because their role as providers is undermined
 by the relief food controlled by women. This creates conflict in some families.

 Provision of water for livestock: Women are responsible for provision of water to livestock left at the homestead; they obtain this water
 from boreholes. During the dry period, the water table of the wells lowers and thus women have to scoop these wells almost on a
 daily basis. The wells are as deep as 10 meters. This task is laborious and dangerous because the wells may collapse. Apart from
 providing water for the stock left behind, women must take on additional roles because most of the time men migrate in search of
 livelihoods. Women have to perform the role of household heads.

 Procurement of pasture and water: This role is performed by men. Water and pasture become scarce during the dry season, which
 necessitates migrating to new locations and walking for long distances. Men’s role as security providers intensifies during this period
 because insecurity mounts as the movements become frequent and long, especially from the neighboring Pokots. Even in homes,
 security needs intensify during drought.

 Box 3.5. Illustration of gender-differentiated responsibilities in West Africa
 In West African cocoa farm units, men and women earn separate incomes within the same household. Men control most high-
 income cocoa crops, while women cultivate smaller plots of consumption crops, which provide less income. Money collected from
 cocoa crops is not always shared equally among household members, but women and men have specific obligations to pay for ordi-
 nary expenses in support of the household. This varies within each home, but men (high earners) typically pay for large expenses
 and women (low earners) pay for smaller expenses. However, because women tend to have less income to apply toward necessary
 expenditures and therefore less excess money to retain, they have less power in decision making and bargaining, and household
 food security is negatively influenced.

An Operational Approach
to Gender-Based ASRAs
Chapter 4 provides practical guidelines on how to integrate gender issues into the pro-
cess of conducting ASRAs as advised by the World Bank and other development part-
ners in developing countries. It first identifies the existing gaps in taking into account
gender differences in the agriculture sector. It then addresses the various entry points
in the process of risk assessment where a gender lens could be introduced in a practical
way. It next presents the issues of vulnerability and understanding capacity to manage
risk. The chapter ends with examples of best practices related to gender-based solu-
tions to risk management that illustrate the design of gender-based risk management
strategies.

4.1 A gender-based approach:
    Women’s role in supply chains
The end product (output) of the ASRA process is a set of actions that require special
attention to reduce vulnerability to shocks associated with the identified key priority
risks. As resources are scarce, decision makers need to see an explicit risk prioritization
and strategy identification process. The risk prioritization helps justify the proposed
interventions in terms of reduction of agricultural income volatility, consumption
smoothing, food security, protection of vulnerable stakeholders, and agricultural resil-
ience. The measures can then be incorporated into government plans and budgets as
part of government agricultural policy and strategies.

Risks faced by agricultural stakeholders can be classified primarily into three catego-
ries: production, market, and enabling environment risks. Depending on the market
integration of any particular supply chain and its context, each type of risk can be
present, dominant, or absent. Each can also affect unique segments of the supply
chain or the entire chain. Many women farmers are more vulnerable to agricultural
risk compared to men for many of the same reasons that farm productivity is lower for
women than men, as discussed in Chapter 3.

 Box 4.1. Questions and checklist for background research
          for a gender-differentiated ASRA
 When conducting the background research for an ASRA, using a gender-focused checklist can help ensure that the assessment team
 collects the information it needs to incorporate a gender dimension from the start. These questions are for illustrative purposes
 and may vary from country to country depending on the circumstances and required depth of the risk assessment in question, but
 should generally be guided by two overarching questions:

     »» What constraints limit women’s full involvement along all parts of the value chains in question?
     »» What are the differences between men and women in their capacity to manage agricultural risk?

 Information from a gender perspective to gather during a background research should include, but is not limited to, the following:

     »» National and cultural policies around asset ownership (i.e., women’s ability to legally own assets without men’s permission,
        joint ownership, ability to make asset-related decisions)
     »» National and cultural policies and practices around women’s access to land, mobile assets, and finance/loans
     »» National and cultural policies around inheritance
     »» Women’s flexibility and possibilities to seek employment, attend trainings and meetings, and organize childcare
     »» Women’s mobility to travel for jobs, trainings, market sales, milk delivery, etc.
     »» Women’s ability to travel alone
     »» Gender differences in access to assets (physical and financial)
     »» Gender differences in access to technology and information
     »» Gender differences in roles played in the supply chains
     »» Gender differences in education and literacy and numeracy skills of participants in supply chains

 Box 4.2. Gendered line of enquiry to establish capacity to manage risk
 Understanding risk profiles entails (i) analyzing the roles of different stakeholders for each supply chain under assessment in a
 gender-disaggregated enquiry, and (ii) understanding their risk management capacities. To guide the assessment of stakeholders’
 risk profiles, the team should aim to answer the following broad questions:

     »»   Who is involved in the value chain analyzed (different stakeholders, segments of population, gender roles, etc.)?
     »»   What risks have the greatest impact on women?
     »»   What is the differentiated exposure and impact of risk for women and men? Are there regional differences?
     »»   What are women’s current risk management practices in terms of risk mitigation, risk transfer, and/or risk coping strategies?
     »»   How do women and men manage risks, and are their instruments effective? Why or why not?
     »»   What are the limitations of women’s current risk management practices? Why are some risks not being managed?
     »»   What is the capacity of supporting institutions to manage key risk predominantly faced by women?

 The assessment team needs to address those questions during the field interviews with stakeholders along each supply chain. For
 smallholder women farmers, who are often the most vulnerable and least vocal, focus group discussions are an important technique
 to discuss their risks and vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and coping mechanisms.

 Box 4.4. Gaps in land ownership and control
 Twenty years ago, Argawal’s study of rural South Asia identified gaps in land ownership and control as the most important con-
 tributor to disparities in economic well-being, social status, and empowerment (Agarwal 1994). More recent studies reinforce and
 extend this finding with the following associations:

     »» In Vietnam, women with a joint title are more aware of legal issues, are more likely to proactively seek a Land Tenure Cer-
        tificate, have more say in the use and disposition of land, and are more likely to earn independent incomes than women who
        are not on the title (World Bank 2008).
     »» In Peru, squatter households given property titles experienced a 22 percent reduction in fertility rates, and women who
        received a joint title were two times less likely to have a child than women in families in which the title was in the male part-
        ner’s name only. Receipt of titles also allowed women to seek paid work instead of spending time safeguarding their land
        against property invasion (Field 2007).
     »» In Nepal, women who own land are significantly more likely to have a final say in household decisions, and children of
        mothers who own land are less likely to be underweight, with associated benefits for almost all maternal and child nutritional
        outcomes (Allendorf 2007).
     »» In Ecuador, joint land ownership increased women’s participation in household decisions about crop cultivation (Deere and
        Twymen 2012a, 2012b).
     »» In rural Karnataka, India, ownership of land and housing improved women’s mobility outside the home and their ability to
        make decisions about their work, health, and household spending (Swaminathan, Lahoti, and Suchitra 2012).
     »» Expanding women’s ownership of land and housing is not a panacea, nor is land legislation alone. Access to credit, markets,
        education, extension services, technology, personal mobility, and public voice all influence women’s ability to claim and make
        use of property rights (Spichiger et al. 2013).

 Box 4.5. ARM and social protection
 In many countries, a policy priority is to keep households from losing their asset base below a certain threshold, and to likewise
 ensure consumption is not destabilized after a disaster (Carter et al. 2006; Heltberg et al. 2009). Doing so is only possible if social
 protection interventions can be scaled up or introduced rapidly after a shock. Clarke and Hill (2013) investigated the case of Ethio-
 pia and Malawi and found that the cost of a drought to households increases from zero to about US$50 per household if support
 is delayed by four months after harvest and to about US$1,300 if support is delayed by six months or more. This rapid increase is
 due to distress sales and loss of assets (especially livestock).

 Acting rapidly implies: (i) scaling up social protection immediately after a disaster; (ii) targeting the affected population; (iii) enhanc-
 ing livelihoods to make them more resilient to shocks, and (iv) having stronger institutions for managing risks and crises (Kuriakose
 et al. 2013; World Bank 2013). In a world in which climate change makes such disasters more frequent or intense, the effect on
 poverty could increase significantly, making policies to support affected vulnerable households even more important.

CHAPTER FIVE
Report Findings and Conclusions

This paper examines the conceptual basis and available empirical evidence sustaining
the thesis that agricultural risk has a differentiated gendered impact on rural house-
holds involved in agricultural activities. The emerging research strongly suggests that
this area deserves more attention to enable practitioners to effectively incorporate
those effects into agricultural policy and risk management strategies. Review of the
evidence shows that aggregate economic shocks do not have homogenous effects on
farming women and men. Gender matters in explaining differential effects, in terms of
both the direct, or first-round, effects of the economic shock, and of households’ cop-
ing strategies, or second-round effects. Moreover, these contrasts vary across countries
and stages of development.

Women farmers typically face different constraints than men when facing risk, and the
feasible options open to women also differ. In certain contexts, social norms or barriers
increase the complexity of the challenge for women to mitigate risk or cope in a man-
ner that preserves their agricultural and nonagricultural livelihood strategies.

If these prevailing differences across gender lines are not taken into account when
assessing agricultural risk, the potential for women to benefit from risk mitigation strat-
egies could be overestimated, and the potential for men and households as a whole to
benefit underestimated—providing a misleading indication of what Agricultural Risk
Management (ARM) strategies can achieve. To truly capture and address agricultural
risk, incorporating gender-based impacts and responses, assessment of those differ-
ences must be an integral part of Agricultural Sector Risk Assessments (ASRAs) and
the findings incorporated in corresponding ARM strategies.

Understanding the different roles and situations of women in their participation
along agricultural supply chains in terms of their access to and control of productive
resources, services, and employment opportunities is critical for assessing and prioritiz-
ing agricultural risk and for identifying gender-smart solutions for managing risk and
strengthening resilience. And recognizing the root causes of such gender differences is
essential if risk mitigation investments and risk coping programs are to reduce rather
than reconstruct people’s risk in future risk events.

Risk Management Strategies
and Instruments
The vulnerability of individual stakeholders and the agriculture sector as a whole
depends on the nature of the risks (i.e., their correlation, frequency, timing, and sever-
ity) and the effectiveness of the risk management instruments in use. It is unrealistic
to suppose that all risks can be managed, as one solution or product cannot serve as a
“silver bullet” for all risks in all circumstances. Indeed, a complex variety of strategies
are discussed at length within the existing literature. Rather than reviewing all possible
risk management strategies, the strategic framework used in these guidelines presents
a simplified approach for risk management strategy development for illustrative and
practical purposes. The conceptual framework can be adapted to be as complex or as
simple as needed given a country’s circumstances.

Following the assessment of risks and analysis of stakeholder vulnerability, risk man-
agement strategies can be proposed. A practical way to identify solutions is by classify-
ing possible risk management strategies into three categories: mitigation, risk transfer,
and coping. The appropriate set of strategies depends in part on participants’ capacity
to effectively use them.
     1.  Risk mitigation (ex-ante): Risk mitigation strategies are actions taken
         prior to a risk event to reduce the likelihood of risk or the severity of losses.
         They are particularly useful for risks that occur with relatively high frequency
         but with lower impact intensity. Risk mitigation options are numerous and var-
         ied. Examples include: adoption of improved agronomic practices such as soil
         drainage and mulching, conservation farming, and the use of short duration
         and disease- and stress-resistant cultivars; irrigation and flood control infra-
         structure; soil and water conservation measures; changes in cropping patterns;
         crop and livestock diversification; income diversification; improved early warn-
         ing systems; and modern information and decision support systems.
     2.	 Risk transfer (ex-ante): As not all effects of realized risks can be mitigated,
         risk transfer tools and mechanisms transfer the potential financial consequences of
         particular risks from one party to a willing third party, usually for a fee or premium.
         These mechanisms usually trigger compensation in the case of a risk-generated

                   countries the use of informal risk transfer within fam-    Output and priority measures

Analysis of Existing Material
Preliminary analysis of agricultural supply chains often entails a comprehensive
review of existing material (reports of agriculture sector reviews, studies, research the-
ses, major news items, trade reports, etc.). Issues to be thoroughly researched include:
     »» Demand conditions. Identification of major markets of the commodities under
        study (export, regional, and domestic), end use of the commodity, character-
        istics of the commodity, quality attributes, demand and supply dynamics, and
        market trends.
     »» Supply chain structures. The current structure of supply chains, which includes the
        flow of goods, information, and finance, and the degree of concentration of
        different operators (in terms of volume or value). Agricultural supply chains for
        a single commodity can be composed of various sub value chains with distinct
        and different participants, depending on market demand. Different levels of
        technology, integration, women’s participation, and risk can be present.
     »» Stakeholders and their functions. Identification of the various actors in the agricul-
        tural supply chains (those directly affecting the flow of goods, as well as those
        providing support services) and their functions. A disaggregation of the various
        stakeholders in terms of relative size and gender.
     »» Performance. Analysis of time-series data of yields, area, and production for each
        of the agricultural commodities under study. This analysis includes disaggrega-
        tion in terms of gender and region (provinces). Understanding the frequency,
        intensity, and causes of yield volatility for the various crops revealed in the anal-
        ysis of time-series data is one of the key activities to support the findings of the
        risk assessment.10

able to provide information and opinions about the topic or subject that is the focus
of discussion. Focus groups may be homogeneous or heterogeneous depending on the
purpose of the focus group meeting (e.g., to identify a pattern, a homogeneous group
is more appropriate, whereas to ascertain perceptions of risks affecting a whole supply
chain, a heterogeneous group is more appropriate). Both ways are valid for assessing
gendered differences in risk management.11

Although the Ministry of Agriculture staff assisted in the selection of focus groups for
the risk assessments, the team should:
     »» Be careful that there are no significant power differentials among group mem-
        bers, as this often results in influential people (often men, or better-off individu-
        als) dominating the discussion.
     »» Aim to cover a mixed sample of representative farming entities covering (i) small
        and (ii) medium farmers. Within this continuum there may still be considerable
        differentiation within groups, which should also be accounted for. For example
        some small farmers (possibly in different regions) may have low input (e.g., lim-
        ited inputs, family labor) versus high input use (e.g., moderate input use, hire
        labor). The level of commercialization may also vary among medium/large
        enterprises and regions in the country.
     »» Keep the size of the focus group manageable. A focus group is most effective
        with 10–15 participants.

The team could conduct a minimum of three (3) farmers focus group discussions: on
the major cash crop, on all food crops, and one more cash crop at the consideration

 Narrative description: A sense of prioritization?


Let’s discuss the dynamics of the format of interaction.        group and farmers raise their hands for suggested answers;
Options: (i) written questions with closed answers to fill in   (iii) Open questions to the group and open answers and
by farmers like multiple choice; (ii) Open questions in a       team just take note; (iv) etc.
