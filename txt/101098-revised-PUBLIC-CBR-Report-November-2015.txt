                                        Executive Summary

   1. Background

ES.1. Correspondent banking services are essential to enabling companies and individuals to transact
internationally and make cross-border payments. Recently there have been indications that certain large
international banks have started terminating or severely limiting their correspondent banking
relationships with smaller local and regional banks from jurisdictions around the world. To find out
whether this is indeed happening, the World Bank, with support from the Financial Stability Board
(FSB) and the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), surveyed banking
authorities and banks worldwide to examine the extent of withdrawal from correspondent banking, its
drivers, and its implications for financial exclusion/inclusion. In total, 110 banking authorities, 20 large
banks, and 170 smaller local and regional banks participated in this exercise.
ES.2. This is not a comprehensive, quantitative survey that presents an exhaustive overview of the
status of correspondent banking globally in 2015. While significant – and heterogeneous – economic
effects may result from the withdrawal of CBR, a quantitative discussion of those effects was outside
the scope of this report. It addresses national and international AML/CFT policy makers, and those
involved in implementing AML/CFT in banks and remittance service providers.


   2. Findings

ES.3. Roughly half the banking authorities surveyed and slightly more local/regional banks indicated
they were experiencing a decline in correspondent banking relationships (CBRs). For large
international banks the figures are significantly higher at 75 percent. The Caribbean seems to be the
region most severely affected.
ES.4. The products and services identified as being most affected by the withdrawal of correspondent
banking are: (check) clearing and settlement, cash management services, international wire transfers
and, for banking authorities and local/regional banks, trade finance. The ability to conduct foreign
currency denominated capital or current account transactions in US dollars (USD) has been most
significantly affected followed by Euro, pound sterling (GBP), and Canadian dollar (CAD)
denominated transactions. A large majority of respondent banking authorities indicated that money
transfer operators and other remittance companies are most affected, followed by small and medium
domestic banks and small and medium exporters. They also specified other types of clients/client
segments that have been affected, including retail customers, international business companies, and e-
gaming/gambling.

Where, Why, and What to Do about It                                                                 6


ES.5. Though there was some misunderstanding of the question, information from banking authorities
and large banks on the obligation to conduct due diligence on the customer’s customer (so-called “know
your customer’s customer” or “KYCC”- in this case the customer of the respondent bank) - showed
that large banks do not consider themselves to be under an explicit legal KYCC obligation, but believe
that under certain circumstances a risk based approach might require them to conduct it anyway.
Uncertainty regarding regulatory obligations or expectations leads them to err on the side of caution.
ES.6. The ability of financial institutions in affected jurisdictions to find alternative correspondent
banks varied, but the majority indicated they were able so far to find replacements. Sometimes however,
the time and cost involved in finding alternative channels are significant and the terms and conditions
were not comparable to the previous foreign CBRs, with some noting a substantial increase in pricing.
It is unclear whether the withdrawal of correspondent banking services has resulted in banks largely
finding alternatives in so-called nested accounts - but certain authorities expressed concerns about that.
ES.7. The drivers of the decline in foreign CBRs can be divided into two groups: one category of
causes that are more business related, explaining the decision to terminate a foreign CBR in purely
economic terms, and one more regulatory and risk related, explaining the decision to sever ties with
certain actors as based on the level of Money Laundering/Financing of Terrorism (ML/FT) risk of the
counterpart deemed unmanageable, concerns that one might fall foul of AML/CFT,
international/regional sanctions—or other legislation or regulations. The two drivers are related though,
since higher risk can result in greater cost. While local/regional banks put more of an emphasis on the
economic/business rationale for the decline, banking authorities and large banks emphasized both
regulatory AML/CFT and business-related concerns.


   3. Conclusions and recommendations

ES.8. The concern is that while large banks might be cleaning up their books and terminating
relationships with higher risk customers, the system as a whole ends up as it were pushing that risk to
channels that are less transparent, or excluding legitimate customers, and thus actually increasing
overall risk. The extent that this might actually be taking place is unclear and was not within the scope
of the current project.
ES.9. The withdrawal from foreign CBRs is a complex and manifold phenomenon. Some of the
drivers are not susceptible to policy tweaks. A bank is completely justified not doing business because
of business rationale, compliance costs, or excessive risk. There are risks that should not be taken.
ES.10. The issue to consider is whether in other cases—particularly where applicable rules or facts and
circumstances are unclear—but there is in principle a business and risk-related rationale for
engagement, there is something that authorities or the banks themselves could do to encourage the
establishment of a correspondent banking relationship. It is important to emphasize that this is a joint
public-private responsibility that needs to be dealt with in partnership. Only such an approach, with
efforts by all actors, can help reverse the decline experienced in certain parts of the world. We believe
the following actions could be useful.

Where, Why, and What to Do about It                                                                 7


             a. Supervisors should ensure banks follow a risk-based approach
ES.11. An unequivocal statement from national supervisors that there will not be a zero tolerance
approach for failures to detect money laundering and setting out the tenets for a reasonable risk
assessment (to the extent supervisors have not already done so) for establishing correspondent banking
relationships can provide banks with the comfort they say they are lacking at this moment. This also
implies that the standard setter and the national AML/CFT policy makers clarify the acceptable level
of risk tolerance.
            b. Supervisors and other authorities should ensure the effective implementation of
                international AML/CFT standards
ES.12. Concerns about the effective implementation of AML/CFT obligations by countries and
jurisdictions featured prominently among the reasons large banks are withdrawing from correspondent
banking relationships—despite significant on-going work by many countries to improve their
AML/CFT regimes. All jurisdictions must therefore ensure that the legal and regulatory AML/CFT
framework is in place and that their financial institutions are being effectively supervised for risk-based
compliance with those obligations. The World Bank stands ready to assist them. In addition, supervisors
should coordinate to clarify regulatory expectations and facilitate international exchange of
information.
ES.13. Respondent banks seeking to establish or maintain correspondent banking relationships should
improve their AML/CFT internal controls to reduce their risk profile.
            c. Supervisors should provide clarity on the extent of obligations to conduct due
                 diligence on the customers of the respondent banks
ES.14. Along those same lines, supervisors should provide detailed guidance on the extent to which,
or the circumstances under which, banks should conduct due diligence on the customers of a respondent
bank, the so-called “know-your-customer’s-customer” obligation. In other words, supervisors should
set out under what conditions it is incumbent upon a correspondent bank to go beyond conducting due
diligence on the respondent bank. If the supervisor does not consider KYCC ever to apply to its
institutions, then it should say so clearly- leaving no room for misinterpretation or misunderstanding.
           d. Improve the information position of correspondent banks
ES.15. Banks should use technical tools, notably KYC utilities, to limit information challenges as an
effective means to reduce the burden of compliance with KYC procedures and consider the use of the
Legal Entity Identifier for all banks involved in correspondent banking as recommended in a CPMI
report published for consultation on October 6, 2015.
ES.16. When establishing a relationship, a correspondent should consider gathering information from
the supervisor of a prospective respondent. To assist a correspondent bank in understanding country
risk context it is recommended that countries publish their national risk assessment in order to
demonstrate their commitment to AML/CFT and to inform outsiders of the risks they face and how
they intend to address them. The World Bank has developed a capacity-building tool for conducting a
national risk assessment and stands ready to assist countries in this process.

Where, Why, and What to Do about It                                                               8


           e. Correspondent banks should consider respondent’s interests when deciding to
              terminate a foreign CBR

ES.17. Large banks should consider placing limits or trial periods instead of terminating relationships,
or give a longer notice period. Correspondent banks should consider placing appropriate credit and
other limits/conditions on their client banks, rather than terminating the relationships. They may also
consider trial periods. Even when banks have an existing correspondent banking relationship to which
they can shift their business, banks need time to arrange for an increase in credit and the amount of
transactions and such that the existing CBR is able and willing to provide. Therefore correspondent
banks are encouraged to extend their notice period to at least three months—preferably more, and could
during that period use some of the risk management tools described below.

ES.18. Correspondent banks should be transparent on their reason for terminating a relationship. The
reasons for termination of a correspondent banking relationship are not always made clear to respondent
banks, making it hard for them to understand the underlying reasons and how to improve the situation.
If correspondent banks are more transparent about the reasons for terminating a correspondent banking
relationship, this will help smaller banks address possible concerns on AML/CFT issues if that was
among the basis for terminating the relationship.
            f. Authorities should monitor the status of correspondent banking in their
                jurisdiction
ES.19. Finally, it would improve the overall ability of governments and private actors to take action if
jurisdictions were to more systematically gather information on the status of foreign CBRs. The surveys
overall met with a positive response but not all jurisdictions responded, and among the respondents, a
not insignificant number indicated that they lacked systematic data to complete the survey. Authorities
and financial institutions that do not already do so, should consider taking a proactive approach in
communicating with one another to monitor foreign CBR related developments in their own jurisdiction
and jurisdictions of their CBR counterparts, as well as developments at the regional and global levels.
This holds especially true for smaller jurisdictions, with fewer and smaller institutions, which appear
to be most susceptible to trends in CBRs.

        I.    Introduction
1.      The international payment system relies heavily on foreign correspondent banking. Generally
speaking correspondent banking is about the payment services provided by one bank to another bank.
The Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) refers to correspondent banking as “an
arrangement under which one bank (correspondent) holds deposits owned by other banks (respondents)
and provides payment and other services to those respondent banks.”1 More specifically, the Wolfsberg
group of banks defines correspondent banking as “the provision of a current or other liability account,
and related services, to another financial institution, including affiliates, used for the execution of third
party payments and trade finance, as well as its own cash clearing, liquidity management and short-
term borrowing or investment needs in a particular currency.”2
2.      For some time now, stories and anecdotes have been circulating in media and international
policy fora that large international banks (predominantly US/Europe/Canada based) are terminating or
severely limiting their correspondent banking relationships with smaller local/regional banks from
jurisdictions around the world. Smaller banks are particularly dependent on such relationships to be
able to offer payment and clearing services in foreign currencies (i.e. USD/EUR/GBP/CAD). This
development is considered by many to be part of an apparent “de-risking” trend, according to which
financial institutions are limiting their exposure to the perceived risk posed certain classes of customers
or partners.
3.      The “risk” in “de-risking” is usually used in reference to the concern that the customer or partner
could pose a higher than average risk for money laundering or terrorism financing, or that processing
transactions for them might entail a breach of sanctions regulations. However, it is not always evident
that the withdrawal from correspondent banking is driven by risk-related concerns—and therefore
whether “de-risking” is the most suitable term to describe it.
4.     The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international standard setter on anti-money
laundering, defines de-risking as: “the phenomenon of financial institutions terminating or restricting
business relationships with clients or categories of clients to avoid, rather than manage, risk (…). De -
risking can be the result of various drivers, such as concerns about profitability, prudential
requirements, anxiety after the global financial crisis, and reputational risk.”3
5.       In order to explore the basis for these stories and provide concrete evidence of the withdrawal
from correspondent banking services and the factors driving it, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in
March 2015 asked the World Bank “to examine the extent of withdrawal from correspondent banking
and its implications for financial exclusion/inclusion.” This report is the result of that examination, and
attempts to provide some clarity on the extent of the withdrawal from correspondent banking services,
the services particularly affected and the possible knock-on effect for the clients of the banks whose
relationships are being terminated or restricted, and the reasons for its occurrence.
6.    As implied in the FSB request, the crucial question is also to determine whether the final
outcome of the withdrawal from correspondent banking services, leaves certain categories of legitimate

customers—whether defined by reference to the sector in which they are active or the geographic area
where they are based—without access to financial services. Access to finance per se is not the only
concern. One also needs to consider the cost of maintaining access and the transparency of the financial
flows involved: e.g. if a big international bank A terminates its relationship with a small regional bank
B, but B subsequently establishes another relationship, is there a risk that the scrutiny of the funds
handled by B will be lower because the institution willing to do business with B applies lower
standards—or because the institution that ultimately processes payments for B is not aware that B is its
ultimate customer? This is where the problem of so-called nested accounts arises. In addition there may
be an increase in cost due to lack of competition and a concentration of providers.

       II.        Method
7.     The main data gathering for this report took place from April through October 2015. The data
and information are drawn primarily from three sources:
                       Surveys conducted under the auspices of the FSB, CPMI and the World Bank Group of
                        banking authorities; large international banks; and local/regional banks;
                       High level fora with top officials of central banks and other banking authorities and
                        representatives of large international and local/regional banks; and
                       Follow-up discussions by the project team with authorities and banks.
The timeline for the project is provided in the Figure 1. A detailed description of the method followed
is contained in Annex 1.

8.      Special attention was paid to a regulatory issue which has become especially significant in the
international debate—namely the topic of “knowing your customer’s customer” (KYCC). The extent
to which a correspondent bank is legally required to conduct due diligence on the customer of the
respondent institution and under which circumstances and to what purpose—and the costs incurred in
having to carry out such measures, is one of the contentious issues in the debate surrounding the
withdrawal from correspondent banking.
9.      This is not a comprehensive, quantitative survey that presents an exhaustive overview of the
status of correspondent banking globally in 2015. While significant – and heterogeneous – economic
effects may result from the withdrawal of CBR, a quantitative discussion of those effects was outside
the scope of this report. Rather, it was more narrowly focused, seeking to provide some clarity in an
ongoing debate playing out in media and in policy fora, to determine whether there is indeed a decline
in CBRs and if so, to describe it, delve into the possible causes, and to determine what, if any, policy
action would be required.

      III.      Participation
10.     In all, the surveys were sent to 137 banking authorities, 24 large international banks and 433
local/regional banks. One hundred and ten jurisdictions (80 percent), 20 large international banks (83
percent) and 170 local/regional banks (39 percent) responded.4 The surveys sought to obtain
information on the development of correspondent banking relationships in the period from 2012 to mid-
2015. Follow-up teleconferences and other discussions sought to gather information on more recent
developments experienced by the respondents. Not all authorities’ responses consisted of completed
surveys: some sent letters explaining the information was not available and some only provided banks
contacts (Table 1). Moreover, not all respondents answered all the questions. Therefore, the numbers
provided above serve only as the maximum number of responses to any given question—but for almost
every question the actual number of responses provided was lower. The findings reflect information
received as of November 3, 2015.

4.    Please note that the total number for local/regional banks surveys completed includes only those who completed and
      returned their surveys (either directly or through their authorities) to the project team. The number does not include
      the local/regional banks to whom the authorities conducted outreach directly in order to gather data for completion of
      the authority survey. Some jurisdictions specified the number of banks that they reached out to; some did not specify
      but mentioned that they had reached out to domestic banks.
5.    In addition to the 91 authorities that completed the survey, 19 authorities participated without completing the survey.
      One authority completed the survey in its capacity as a commercial entity. Sixteen additional authorities did not
      complete the survey but provided list of contacts at local/regional banks in their respective jurisdiction to be invited to
      participate in the project. Two authorities indicated that they could not complete the survey due to lack of data. They
      are being counted as participants, as some of the authorities that did complete the survey also indicated that they lacked
      data to be able to complete the survey.

      IV.      Substantive Findings
11.    Given the different perspectives of each of the groups of respondents, the findings below have
not been synthesized, but are instead presented separately. While in some instances overall patterns
emerge, the differences in responses are sufficiently important to merit independent treatment.
                    a. Overall Trend in Correspondent Banking Relationships6
12.     In certain parts and regions of the world the number of foreign CBRs is declining. As will be
clear from the different groups of responses below, roughly half the banking authorities and slightly
more local/regional banks indicated a decline in CBRs. For large international banks the figures are
significantly higher at 75 percent. The differences might be explicable in that a great majority of the
large international banks were surveyed precisely because there had been mention of those institutions
having terminated, albeit to varying degrees, their foreign CBRs. For the local/regional banks there was
an indication that others had withdrawn CBRs from the jurisdiction in question – but not from the
specific institutions surveyed. It is important to note that the overall trend is not uniform for all
jurisdictions or regions. The Caribbean seems to be the region most severely affected. The United States
is most often mentioned as being home to correspondent banks that are withdrawing from foreign
CBRs.
      I.       Banking Authorities
13.     Among the 91 authorities that completed the survey, slightly more than half indicated a
significant or some degree of decline in their financial institutions’ foreign CBRs, from the recipient
(nostro7) perspective.8 Thirty-two jurisdictions (35 percent) indicated significant declines and
seventeen (19 percent) indicated some decline.9 Thirty jurisdictions indicated no significant change,
two indicated significant increase, nine indicated “unknown” and one did not answer the question.




6.    Many of the respondents were selected because of indications that the jurisdiction or institution concerned may be
      facing challenges with its foreign CBR - therefore the percentages mentioned are not reflective of the different
      populations as a whole.
7.    The terms “nostro” (ours) and “vostro” (yours) are used to r efer to a bank holding an account with another bank to
      distinguish between the two sets of records of the same balance and set of transactions. From the perspective of the
      bank whose money is being held at another bank, a nostro is our account of our money, held by the other bank and a
      vostro is our account of other bank money, held by us. Thus this report uses the term “vostro” to refer to the perspective
      of the provider of the correspondent banking services, while it uses “nostro” to refer to the bank rec eiving the service.
8.    The actual number may be higher. At least three jurisdictions did not complete the survey but experienced declines in
      their foreign CBRs, according to IMF Article IV review reports and/or press releases issued by their Central Banks. In
      addition other reliable sources/experts in the field have mentioned other jurisdictions. Those jurisdictions are not
      included in this report since the results are based solely on inputs by the three categories of respondents.
9.    A category “some decline” has been created to include jurisdictions that had checked “declined significantly” or “no
      significant change” because there was no option to check moderate decline, and for those whose surveys were
      inconsistent. Some jurisdictions indicated that they had noticed a moderate decline or a trend towards decline, but not
      a significant decline. Others indicated “no significant change” but noted that a number of large international banks that
      have restricted or terminated foreign CBRs with their domestic banks. Two jurisdictions also responded “no significant
      change.” but Article IV review reports by the IMF indicated that the countries had experienced some changes in their
      CBRs; they have been included in the “Some Decline” tally.

Regional Breakdown10
14.     Regionally, Latin America and Caribbean appears to be the region most affected by a decline
of foreign CBRs. A majority of banking authorities in the Caribbean region reported significant decline.
In total, 89 percent of jurisdictions reported experiencing significant to moderate declines in their
foreign CBRs. Of the 19 respondent authorities, 15 reported significant declines and two others noted
a trend towards decline or a moderate decline with no significant impact on the banking system overall.
Only two jurisdictions reported “no significant change” to their foreign CBRs. The decline appears to
be less pronounced in Latin America with one notable exception.
15.      The Europe and Central Asia region has experienced significant decline in its foreign CBRs. A
majority of respondent authorities in the region reported experiencing significant to moderate declines
in their foreign CBRs. See for further regional breakdown figure 3 below and the tables in Annex 3.




10. Regions in this survey follow the World Bank Regional Country Classification. Please note however that some
jurisdictions surveyed in this report are not World Bank client countries and as such are not covered by the World Bank
country classification. They have been included in the regional breakdown. An additional classification “Rest of World”
has been included and covers US and Canada, and European countries that are not part of Europe and Central Asia World
Bank classification (Europe-other). For more on World Bank regional designations, please see

Country Profiles
16.    Jurisdictions where there has been a decline include small jurisdictions with low volumes of
business/transactions, particularly in Europe and Central Asia, the Caribbean, and Africa.
17.     Small jurisdictions with significant offshore banking activities are particularly affected by the
decline of CBRs. First and foremost, the Caribbean appears to be the region the most affected by a
decline of foreign CBRs. Small countries with significant offshore banking sector in Europe and Africa
are also experiencing a significant decline in their foreign CBRs. Despite their size, some of the relevant
off-shore jurisdictions count among the top international financial centers worldwide (measured by
volume of transactions).
18.     Jurisdictions perceived as ML/FT high-risk jurisdictions or those subject to international
sanctions, and jurisdictions affected by sanctions by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
in particular, are also affected.
19.     Some significant decline in foreign CBRs has been noted in major economies which are among
the top remittance recipient countries (in terms of value of remittances). In addition, eight G20 member
jurisdictions, experienced significant to moderate decline in their foreign CBRs—four a significant
decline and four moderate decline in nostro accounts.

Jurisdictions of Financial Institutions Terminating/Restricting CBRs
20.      Jurisdictions most often mentioned as being home of financial institutions terminating/
restricting CBRs were, in order of times mentioned, the US, the United Kingdom (UK), the European
Union (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and others), and Canada.
Switzerland is also significant. The US most significantly outnumbers other jurisdictions.11 Thirty-six
(84 percent) of the 43 respondent banking authorities that answered this question listed the US as the
top jurisdiction where the foreign correspondent banking relationships have been terminated or
restricted. The UK was the second jurisdiction most mentioned with 42 percent of respondents. The
European Union (EU) as jurisdiction and other (non-UK) EU countries were also among those most
mentioned. See the table in Annex 5 – for jurisdictions of terminations/restrictions.
21.      From the provider’s perspective (vostro accounts), 11 jurisdictions indicated that their financial
institutions terminated or restricted a significant number, or significantly altered the nature of, their
foreign corresponding banking relationship. The jurisdictions are located in Africa, the Caribbean, East
Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Rest of World.12


Figure 4: Banking Authorities: Jurisdictions of terminations/restrictions (%)




11.   Such feedback has to be considered in the context of the US being understood to be the largest provider of foreign
      CBRs. However, we lack of authoritative data on the overall number of CBRs and distribution among jurisdictions.
12.   However please note that while certain authorities did not respond to this question, they discussed the most prominent
      causes for reduction/restrictions in foreign CBRs by their financial Institutions.

22.     The authorities also indicated jurisdictions of financial institutions with whom their banks were
terminating CBRs. The Middle East and Africa are mentioned most frequently. One of the main reasons
given is related to concerns with countries that have sanctions imposed against them. In addressing the
issue, most authorities on both the side of correspondent and respondent banks, recognized the need to
have robust AML/CFT frameworks in place, and discussed initiatives taken to enhance AML/CFT
standards within the jurisdiction – including through:
                 conducting national risk assessments;
                 issuing guidelines and carrying out awareness raising among stakeholders; and
                 elevating the issues faced by de-risking with the international financial community
                  through direct representations with concerned standard-setting bodies in various
                  international fora.
23.     More specifically, Mexican authorities have responded to the situation by taking steps to amend
their legislation to allow domestic banks to share information in relation to clients with foreign
correspondent banks at their request. Foreign correspondent banks need to register with the Mexican
Ministry of Finance in order to gain access to this information... In addition the Mexican authorities are
developing a centralized database that will hold information in relation to all cross-border transactions
undertaken by domestic banks, which will enable the authorities to access information held on clients.13
      II.     Large international banks
24.     Three quarters of the large international banks responded that the number of vostro accounts
they held had declined in the period between end 2012 and mid-2015. One large bank indicated an
increase, two noted no change and two did not provide data. Due to the different methods used (and
data provided) by the various banks, it is difficult to provide an accurate count of foreign CBRs closed
by the banks. However, in percentage terms the declines ranged from low single digits to more than
half in the case of one bank. For the one bank that had noted an increase in its vostro accounts, this
increase was quite small in number of relationships and in low single digit in percentage terms.

25.     Fourteen banks provided data on regional distribution of their vostro accounts, however two of
them only provided data for 2015 and one provided data only for end-2014. Six remaining banks did
not provide data, citing business confidentiality. Some banks also were not able to provide the data by
region as specified in the survey, further complicating the regional trends analysis. However, it is
significant that except for a very small number of cases, the banks as a whole experienced declining
trends, in varying degrees, in their foreign CBRs across Africa, East Asia and Pacific, Europe and
Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean (although respondents noted that the trend is more apparent
in the Caribbean than in Latin America in general), and Middle East and North Africa. The regions of
South Asia and Rest of World appeared to have increased in the number of their foreign CBRs, but the
increases were quite small, usually in double digits in number of accounts increased.
26.      Eighty percent of the banks responded that they had terminated all CBRs with financial
institutions in certain jurisdictions. A slightly larger percentage of banks responded that they had
restricted the size and/or scope of CBRs in certain jurisdictions. The banks also specified the
jurisdictions (and in some cases, regions) where they had terminated or restricted their foreign CBRs.
The central banking authorities and local/regional banks in these jurisdictions formed a significant part
of the project team’s outreach in the second phase of data-gathering. The results of those surveys
confirm the data provided by the large international banks.

27.    The large international banks’ withdrawals from foreign CBRs are part of wider policy changes
implemented in recent years. Seventeen of the 20 large international banks responded that their foreign
correspondent banking policy had been revised since 2012 (Figure 7). Many expressly indicated that
their CBR policies are subject to regular or periodic review, either separately or as part of review of
other policies and guidelines pertaining to conduct risk and financial crimes, for example.

28.     The banks adopted or revised their policy not just for one reason but for a combination of
factors. The most frequently cited reason for the policy change related to the banks’ broader risk
management, as part of their business strategy or the need to comply with new or revised legal
requirements. Four banks noted that policy change was undertaken in order to comply with supervisory
direction or enforcement action.

          III.           Local/regional banks
29.     A majority (60 percent) of local/regional banks indicated a decline in foreign CBRs. As a whole,
local/regional banks experienced declining trends at various levels throughout the world.
30.    Some of the regions most affected by declining foreign CBRs included Europe and Central Asia
where over 80 percent (30 banks) indicated a moderate or significant decline in CBRs.14
31.    Latin America and the Caribbean was also highlighted as being a region significantly affected
by declining CBRs where 66 percent of the banks reported a decline. The Caribbean more specifically
was affected with 69 percent (32 banks) indicating a moderate or significant decline in CBRs. Follow-
up conversations and phone interviews with several local banks confirmed this trend in the Caribbean.
32.     Africa was also considerably affected where over 51 percent (46 banks) from a number of
jurisdictions that vary as to the size and nature of their banking sector indicated a moderate or
significant decline in CBRs15. A detailed overview is contained in Figure 10 below.




14.             Please note that only local/regional banks form Eastern Europe provided surveys.
15.             Please note that the numbers may be somewhat skewed for the Africa Region since local/regional banks from one
                jurisdiction under targeted sanctions completed 13 surveys (out of a total of 47), which represents 28 percent of
                responses from the region. However, the authorities and large international banks surveys and other outreach support
                the local banks survey findings for the region as a whole.

33.     Jurisdictions most often mentioned as being home to financial institutions terminating CBRs
were, in order of times mentioned, United States (67) and UK (30). Switzerland (14), Canada (13) and
Germany (13) are also mentioned often (please see annex 12). The US most significantly outnumbers
the others—more than double of the UK, the second most mentioned. Such feedback has to be
considered in the context of the US being understood as the largest provider of foreign CBRs. However,
we lack of authoritative data on the overall number of CBRs or regional distribution.

                                 b. Effect on Products and Services
34.      The products and services identified as being most affected by the withdrawal of correspondent
banking are: check clearing, clearing and settlement, cash management services, international wire
transfers and for banking authorities and local/regional banks, also trade finance. The discrepancy on
trade finance between the responses from the large international banks and from the other categories of
respondent may be due to the fact that local/regional banks experience the effects directly in having to
tell their customers they cannot provide trade finance17.
          I.                 Banking authorities
35.     Authorities that had indicated a decline in their CBRs were asked to indicate which
products/services were affected and to what extent. The products/services most often noted as affected
significantly to moderately significantly affected are international wire transfers (80 percent of
respondents)18, with international wire transfers in USD noted most often (46 percent); clearing and
settlement (46 percent); and check clearing (39 percent); trade finance (37 percent); cash management
services - deposit accounts, payable through accounts (34 percent); investment services (32 percent),

16  Please note that respondents were asked to provide the name of the jurisdiction(s), however several respondents put
    regions instead, such as Europe.
17. The report of the International Chamber of Commerce ('Rethinking Trade and Finance 2015 - An ICC Private Sector
    Development Perspective'), based on responses from 482 banks across 112 countries, notes that AML/KYC
    requirements are seen as the most significant impediment to trade finance with 70% of respondents reporting declining
    transactions due to AML/KYC issues. Report at http://www.iccwbo.org/Products-and-Services/Trade-
    facilitation/ICC-Global-Survey-on-Trade-Finance/.
18. Out of 41 respondents, 33 noted that international wire transfers were moderately to significantly affected (19 for
    international wire transfers in USD; 6 in euros, and 8 in other currencies).

Currencies Affected
36.     Banking authorities mentioned the impact of the decline of CBRs on their ability to conduct
foreign currency denominated transactions in the following jurisdictions: 87 percent of respondent
authorities mentioned the United States (20 respondents), 48 percent the European Union (11
respondents), 17 percent the United Kingdom (seven respondents), 13 percent Canada (four
respondents), and 13 percent China (three respondents). Based on the jurisdictions most often listed by
respondents, the ability to conduct foreign currency denominated capital or current account transactions
in US dollar (USD) have been most significantly affected followed by Euro, pound sterling (GBP), and
Canadian dollar (CAD) and the Renminbi (RMB).
           II.                  Large International Banks
37.    Nearly all banks provide the full menu of foreign correspondent banking services to their clients,
including clearing and settlement, foreign exchange services, international wire transfers and trade
finance. The vast majority also indicated that they provide cash management, check clearing,
investment and lending services. While a large majority of the banks indicated that they had not stopped
providing any particular products/services, there have been reductions in their provisions. It is
important to bear in mind that 75 percent of the banks indicated that the number of Vostro accounts
they held had declined in the period between end 2012 and mid-2015.
38.    Sixty percent of large international banks responded that they had significantly or moderately
reduced their check clearing services, 30 percent their clearing and settlement services and 20 percent
cash management services. Please note that for clearing and settlement and international wire transfers,

most banks provide these services in multiple currencies, but some tend to specialize in the currency of
their jurisdiction of headquarters.

39.     For check clearing, banks noted that they do not provide check clearing services for checks not
drawn on that bank’s accounts or the service had always been restricted to third party banks for checks
drawn on banks of its home jurisdiction. Others noted that check clearing was significantly reduced
globally for USD checks cleared out of New York or noted a significant reduction in check clearing for
the currency of the jurisdiction of their headquarters and primary clearing currency.
40.     There was little feedback as to the jurisdictions affected but a small number of banks indicated
that they were moving towards focusing on their “home” currencies, including decision to reduce
clearing for exotic currencies. See Annex 9 for table of large international bank responses on
products/services affected.

to access the following top three products/ services: check clearing, clearing and settlement services
and trade finance (letters of credit).

percent) and small and medium exporters (26 percent). Respondents also specified other types of
clients/client segments including retail customers, international business companies, and e-

43.    The respondent banking authorities that reported significant impact on money transfer operators
and other remittance companies were located mostly in the Caribbean, in East Asia and Pacific, in
MENA, Africa, and Europe and Central Asia. It is interesting to note that some jurisdictions where
money transfer operators and other remittance companies are most affected are among the top
remittance recipient countries (in terms of value of remittances).19
      II. Local/Regional Banks
44.     The respondents indicated that money transfer operators (MTOs) and other remittance
companies/ service providers are significantly affected, followed by small and medium exporters.
Respondents also specified other types of clients/client segments including “casas de cambio” (money
exchange houses), exporters, importers and PEPs. Small and medium domestic banks appear to be less
affected, but it should be highlighted that local/regional banks selected in this survey are more users
(nostro accounts) than providers (vostro accounts) of foreign CBRs. See Annex 10 Client segment
impact.


19.             The top recipients of remittances as a share of GDP were also considered, but the response rate for those countries
                was low.

                              d. Possible causes of decline in foreign CBRs
45.    The drivers of the decline in foreign CBRs can be divided into two groups: one category of
causes that are more business related, explaining the decision to terminate a foreign CBR in purely
economic terms, and one (as mentioned in the introduction) more regulatory and risk related, explaining
the decision to sever ties with certain actors as based on the level of ML/FT risk of the counterpart
being unmanageable, and concerns that one might fall foul of AML/CFT, international/regional
sanctions—or other legislation or regulations.20



20.             To be clear: AML/CFT and sanctions regulations, though often bracketed in the same category, are different in
                application. AML/CFT will often involve subjective judgment by the institution whether a specific transaction is
                related to money laundering or terrorism financing and should be reported or frozen. For the application of sanctions
                regulations there is no such subjectivity: if a transaction benefits a person or entity or country that is subject to
                sanctions, then the financial institution has no choice but to freeze the transaction.

Where, Why, and What to Do about It                                                                 29


46.     Of course, the two categories of drivers are related. The requirement to comply with a regulatory
rule might drive up the costs of establishing and/or maintaining certain relationships. As one respondent
succinctly put it: “[B]anks face high costs of complying with standards (particularly for banks who are
concerned about jurisdictional risk and – notably given some of the uncertainties around AML/CFT
requirements - consider it necessary to know their customer’s customers), but also high costs for any
oversight/mistakes. This risk-reward ratio, of high (potential) costs and low profitability, is a key driver
behind the decline in correspondent banking services. Given the potential damage to reputation and
balance sheet from any enforcement case, firms seek to avoid any counterparties/jurisdictions where
there is uncertainty.”
47.     Indeed quite a number of respondents indicated the decline in foreign CBRs was due to drivers
in both groups. However, the AML/CFT and/or regulatory factor cannot always be expressed in
monetary terms—and precisely therein lies at least some of the problem. Recent high profile fines for
infringements of AML/CFT provisions and uncertainty about what exactly is required, about what the
regulatory expectations are (including in terms of acceptable risk appetite), how they might evolve over
time and what the consequences would be of possibly falling foul of certain regulatory rules (as also
highlighted in the quote above), has led banks to play it safe. As one respondent put it “We’re supposed
to have a risk-based approach, but what we have is a fear based approach”. That uncertainty makes it
impossible to give it a monetary value—and quantify the costs in terms that can be factored in and dealt
with as part of their overall risk-reward ratio assessment.
48.     While local/regional banks put more of an emphasis on the economic/business rationale for the
decline, banking authorities and large international banks emphasized both actual level of risk,
regulatory AML/CFT and business related concerns. The discrepancy is possibly due to the fact that
not all local/regional banks are fully informed about the reasons for termination of their accounts (or
only in more vague terms) as was also mentioned in follow up discussions.


      I.   Banking authorities
49.    As noted, overall, authorities that had indicated decline in their foreign CBRs point
predominantly to both categories of drivers to explain the decline in foreign CBRs in their jurisdiction.

50.     More than 18 percent of the banking authorities that responded mentioned the high-risk
customer base of their financial institutions as a cause of decline. When asked to specify the high-risk
customer base, the following categories of high-risk customers were mentioned by some of the
authorities:
                 Money transfer operators/ Money exchange companies

51.     Ninety-one percent of banking authorities respondents (40 out of 44) mentioned either lack of
profitability of foreign CBRs services or structural changes together as accounting for the decline in
foreign CBRs. Increasing costs of regulatory compliance however, notably the inability and cost to
undertake CDD and/or insufficient information about respondent’s CDD procedures (for AML/CFT or
sanctions purposes) have been mentioned significantly by half of respondent authorities. Almost half
of the respondents also mentioned overall risk, concerns about ML/TF risks, and changes to legal or
regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions as causes of decline. Altogether, 73 percent of
respondent banking authorities mentioned AML/CFT concerns as one of the driver for restriction or
termination.21 The impact of other regulations such as Basel III (14 percent)22 and FACTA were also
mentioned albeit marginally.
52.     Some banking authorities noted a recent switch in the rationale provided by banks for
termination or restriction of foreign CBRs in their jurisdictions. They have shifted from core business
portfolio reorganizations to the increasing cost of regulatory compliance, particularly related to
AML/CFT. It is unclear whether in all instances the switch is real—or whether it is only the justification
provided to the outside world.
53.      An illustrative example was recently provided by a small financial center which had indicated
a significant decline in their CBRs in the past year. After a “Notice of Finding” by the US Financial
Intelligence Unit, FinCEN, that one of the banks in the jurisdiction was perceived as a financial
institution of primary concern for money laundering under the US Patriot Act, all of the concerned
bank’s foreign CBRs were terminated. This decision had a broader impact on the other banks in the
jurisdiction where a significant decline in foreign CBRs was noted for all banks in the country, even
though these institutions did not have any transactional relationships with the financial institution of
primary concern for AML/CFT. Compliance lapses – actual or alleged – by even one financial

      purposes), and/or high-risk customer base”.

institution can have a potential spillover effects for other financial institutions in the jurisdiction, in
particular in small jurisdictions.
54.     While only four jurisdictions indicated that imposition of international sanctions was a driver
in decline in foreign CBRs, this should be seen in conjunction with the responses from large
international banks which indicated that they simply cannot conduct activities with institutions in
sanction countries.23
55.    From the provider (vostro account) perspective, consisting of a smaller number of authorities
(14 respondents in total), many of the same concerns listed above are cited, be it that profit related
concerns are not so prominent. Specifically, see Table 2 for the main causes/drivers indicated.

      II.     Large international banks
56.     For large international banks, AML/CFT and CDD/KYC related concerns topped the list of
causes/drivers for terminating and/or restricting foreign CBRs. The banks’ overall risk appetite and
lack of profitability of certain foreign CB services/products also ranked high among the reasons for
terminating and/or restricting CBRs. In follow up interviews, large banks also mentioned that they were
worried about being “the last man standing” in a country other banks had exited because they
considered it too high risk or not worth the cost. This was leading some to exit, merely because others
were exiting, rather than being based on an individual assessment of the country’s risk profile.




23.    Three authorities that completed the survey and one authority that completed the survey as a commercial entity
       indicated that imposition of international sanctions was a driver in decline in foreign CBRs.

banks indicated that their risk assessment of correspondent banking clients take into consideration the
ML/TF risk levels of their client banks’ jurisdiction. As noted above, concerns over the ML/TF risks
of the foreign correspondent bank’s jurisdiction was cited b y 19 out of 20 banks and was the top
cause/driver for termination of CBRs.
58.     Only three banks mentioned having downstream correspondent banks as clients (that is to say
offering correspondent banking services to a bank that would offer those services itself on to other
banks) as high risk situation. However, it should be noted that at least one of the banks that did not
provide a list of high risk client types is in the process of closing all accounts with downstream banks.
An enforcement action against another bank also centered on the issue of nested accounts (see further
discussion below under “nested accounts”).

          III.                Local/regional banks
59.     For local/regional banks, as with the other categories of respondents, economic factors feature
prominently as a reason that would explain the decline in foreign CBRs. While risk appetite is among
the factors mentioned most often, AML/CFT risks and regulatory concerns do not come up as often as
with the other categories of respondents. Since this group of respondents is the target of the withdrawal
or restriction of foreign CBRs, it is possible that the correspondent bank does not in all cases deem it
appropriate to share those concerns with the institution with which that it is severing/restricting its
relationship. See also Annex 8.

62.     The ability of financial institutions in affected jurisdictions to find alternative correspondent
banks varied, but the majority indicated they were able so far to find replacements. Of the 46 banking
authorities who responded to this question—23 authorities indicated that their financial institutions had
found replacements and 8 indicated that they had found alternative means. Thirteen banking authorities
indicated that their banks had been unable to find replacements.

63.      Authorities noted the impact of having to find replacements/ alternatives or arrangements on
their financial institutions include:
                 Increased costs24 of finding replacements/alternatives.
                 Time spent looking for replacements – noting that often, banks are given limited notice
                  of termination of relationships (about 30 days) to find replacements.
                 Newly imposed minimum thresholds below which the account would be closed.
                 Higher (often due diligence) related costs in establishing the new CBR being passed on
                  to the customer, and
                 Sometimes terminating or restricting relationships with certain clients to be able to
                  maintain access. Several small banks mentioned severing ties to MTOs to maintain
                  access to their foreign CBRs.
                 Several authorities noted particular difficulties with finding replacements in the US.

64.     According to the results of the local/regional banks’ survey, the ability of financial institutions
to find replacement CBRs, or alternative means, varied across banks. A majority (54 percent) of local/
regional banks (92) responded that they were able to find replacement CBRs, or establish alternative
arrangements to meet their needs. However, there were 10 local/regional banks (6 percent) that were
unable to find replacement CBRs, or alternative means.
65.      One local bank in a small international financial center, is extremely concerned and in danger
at the time of the survey of shutting down operations. During follow-up calls with local banks, there
were several other local banks that expressed the same fears of not being able to replace CBRs or
finding alternative means, and being threatened to close down their business in the near future. The
banks most affected tend to be the smaller banks in ‘higher risk jurisdictions’ or ‘offshore fi nancial
centers’.
66.     In terms of level of difficulty, a large majority (62 percent) of local/regional banks (56)
responded that they easily found replacement CBRs, or alternative arrangements. However, there were
25 banks (28 percent) that mentioned that it was difficult, or somewhat difficult, to get replacement
CBRs or find alternative means, with some banks indicating that it was expensive and time consuming
to find replacement CBRs and that the terms and conditions were not comparable to the previous
foreign CBRs. Some noted a substantial increase in pricing. Maintaining relationships however, can
come at quite a steep price, with several mentioning, newly imposed minimum thresholds below which
the account would be closed, higher (often due diligence) related costs being passed on to the customer,
and sometimes terminating relationships with certain clients to be able to maintain access. One bank in
a small offshore jurisdiction, preemptively closed all its relationships with MTOs, in order not to lose
its access to USD clearing.
                   f. Diligence on the customer’s customers (so-called KYCC) and Nested Accounts
67.     As mentioned in the introduction, the surveys also sought to obtain information from banking
authorities and large international banks on the extent to which they considered there to be an obligation
to conduct due diligence on the customer’s customer(s) (in the policy debate surrounding the issue

24.   There are limited options available for replacements and alternative arrangements – and these are often more costly
      options, for example, an alternative means by financial institutions in one jurisdiction is to contract cash courier/ pick-
      up services. Furthermore, the process for onboarding and establishing new CBRs is costly, including the need for
      enhanced due diligence and other processes to be undertaken by the banks.

often referred to by shorthand as “KYCC” for “Know Your Customer’s Customer”)—in this case the
customer(s) of the respondent bank. Since many who responded to the question appeared not to
understand what was meant by so-called KYCC and provided only an outline of their AML/CFT
system, an overview here of the responses received is not considered useful. Probably the first issue to
clarify is what is meant by knowing your customer’s customer(s) in the context of correspondent
banking.
68.     One of the main interests of a respondent bank in establishing a correspondent banking
relationship is that it can offer cross border services to its customers—allowing them (the respondent’s
customers) to transact internationally. It is, in other words, really for the benefit of a third party, the
customer of the respondent, that the service is then provided. The principle of due diligence with
regards to correspondent banking is that the correspondent bank conducts due diligence and
understands the business and internal controls of the respondent bank before establishing a
correspondent banking relationship—and then monitors the relationship on an ongoing basis. It is the
responsibility of the respondent bank to conduct due diligence of its customers, and the correspondent
always checks the respondent bank’s due diligence system and protocols very carefully, in order to be
able to rely on them.
69.     Typically therefore, the correspondent bank merely executes transactions ordered by a
respondent, and does not conduct any further scrutiny on the underlying transaction. Furthermore it is
not always possible to identify an underlying transaction—specifically when individual transfers are
batched into one transfer, such as is the case for remittances for instances, when the bank does one
transfer that aggregates a whole number of smaller individual transfers. The margins in correspondent
banking are already thin—and the extra cost of conducting due diligence on every transaction processed
for a respondent would surely make the whole business unprofitable. More fundamentally though, it
goes against the logic of the relationship to have the correspondent redo what the respondent already
did. That is their contractual relationship.
70.     Pursuant to national AML/CFT and sanctions laws however, the correspondent bank may be
under an independent obligation to apply sanctions provisions and to report suspicious transactions. 25
It will have automated systems in place that pick up possible hits against sanctions lists and apply
certain algorithms to detect suspicious transactions (where it can identify individual transactions - see
above). The question therefore is what to do when, in processing a payment for a respondent bank, one
of those systems picks up on e.g., an originator or beneficiary that is on a sanction’s list, or raises
ML/FT concerns. Does the correspondent revert to the respondent and ask for and check the due
diligence on the ultimate client—or does the correspondent rely on the respondent having conducted
the necessary due diligence as per its contractual obligation?
71.     Large international banks mentioned in follow up discussions that although conducting due
diligence on the customer’s customer is not, in most countries, an obligation that can be found in the

25.   To be clear: under the international standard on anti-money laundering, this would not be the case. FATF Rec 16 on
      wire transfers, lays out the roles for the different banks involved in a wire transfer: the ordering, the intermediary and
      the beneficiary financial institution. The correspondent bank would typically be the intermediary financial institution
      processing a payment on behalf of the ordering institution. The Recommendation is quite clear about the
      responsibilities of the intermediary institution: It “should ensure that all originator and beneficiary information that
      accompanies a wire transfer is retained with it” and that it take “reasonable measures to identify cross border wire
      transfers that lack required originator or beneficiary information”. Under this standard there is no obli gation that the
      intermediary conduct any further scrutiny on the substance of the originator or beneficiary information.

law—banks do conduct such due diligence as a matter of practice in those types of cases—just to be
on the safe side. It is not clear to such banks that reliance on the respondent’s banks systems—and a
showing of the checks that the correspondent has conducted on those systems—would be a sufficient
defense if a correspondent is found to have let a sanctioned person conduct a transaction using its
system. It would be useful if such clarity could be provided.
72.     The need felt to perform due diligence on the customer of the foreign respondent bank depended
on the risk profile of the respondent, which itself depends on various factors such as involved
jurisdictions, the type of the correspondent bank relationship as well as on the services/products that
are provided by the correspondent bank.
Nested accounts
73.      A particular variation on this topic of customer’s customer, is the so-called nested account. A
nested account, also referred to as a “downstream correspondent”, occurs “when a correspondent bank
client provides correspondent services to other banks, domiciled inside or outside their country, to
facilitate international products and services on behalf of the downstream correspondent’s clients, e.g.
when a regional savings bank offers correspondent services to the local savings banks in its area.” 26 It
is as it were, a respondent bank acting as a correspondent for another bank.
74.     The more such nested accounts are inserted into the payment chain, the more tenuous (and more
opaque) becomes the link between the institution finally processing the payment and the originator of
that payment. In fact this is one of the concerns with the knock-on effect of the withdrawal from
correspondent banking. Those whose relationships are being terminated and who can no longer
establish directly relationships with large international banks may seek to establish nested relationship.
While from the original correspondent bank’s point of view it may have increased transparency in its
own operations by severing its ties with the respondent in question, the system as a whole has become
more opaque if that respondent is allowed to establish a nested relationship.
75.     It is not clear whether in fact the withdrawal of foreign CBRs is resulting in an increase in nested
relationships, but it is certainly a concern expressed by some respondents. Three of the large
international banks specified that they considered nested/downstream correspondents to be high risk
clients, because they lose sight of the ultimate customer and the diligence conducted on that person.
While they do not consider themselves under an obligation to perform CDD on the customers of their
respondents, they are in the process of implementing restrictions on the processing of nested
transactions. They deem such steps necessary because of their inability to validate the CDD standards
being applied by the nested account holder (the client of the respondent banks) on the ultimate
customer. In other words, they consider the level of reassurance that the due diligence conducted on
the end customer is not adequate.

      V.    Conclusions and Recommendations
76.      The individual stories and anecdotes mentioned in the introduction, appear to be founded in
reality. Several large international banks are withdrawing from a significant percentage of their foreign
CBRs and there are sufficient indications from the different groups of respondents that this trend is
real. Respondents—particularly from smaller jurisdictions—but also from some larger economies,
from the Caribbean, Africa and Europe and Central Asia, and to a lesser extent East Asia and Pacific
indicate there is a decline in CBRs. From the vostro (provider) perspective, MENA countries were also
mentioned often (not all relevant MENA countries completed the survey). It is not clear whether this
development has already reached its peak—or whether further large scale withdrawals are still to come.
77.     As a result, smaller regional banks are facing challenges offering certain services, notably USD
payment services, and their customers, particularly MTOs, are affected in their ability to access
international payment systems. While in the large majority of cases, local/regional banks appear to be
able to find alternatives and come to some arrangement, that can sometimes come at great cost: in
purely monetary terms, in terms of the customer base of the respondent bank, in terms of time and effort
spent finding replacements and in terms of the regional banks own risk having to rely on fewer foreign
CBRs. The concentration of correspondent banking relationships could become a concern. Smaller
banks in particular, are very concerned about being at the mercy of only one correspondent bank, who
can set the terms at will. Moreover, in a very small number of cases the banks do not find replacements
and they are about to go out of business. On the basis of those two considerations alone, policy action
to address the situation appears to be justified.
78.     Quite apart from that, it is not quite clear to what extent the local/regional banks whose
relationships are being withdrawn are finding second and third-tier banks to meet their needs for foreign
CBRs and the further effect on overall transparency. The concern is that while large international banks
might be cleaning up their books and terminating relationships with higher risk customers, that risk is
then moved to channels that are less transparent, and thus actually increasing overall risk. Though a
number of respondents, including banking authorities, mentioned these concerns, neither the surveys,
nor the follow up interviews were able to shed sufficient light upon the extent to which overall
transparency is decreasing.
79.     So there is a rationale for further action—but what intervention is useful or necessary at this
time (as it is still unclear whether the decline will continue further)? As will have become clear, the
withdrawal from foreign CBRs is a complex and manifold phenomenon that manifests itself in different
ways and for different reasons. Some of those reasons are not susceptible to policy tweaks. Banks offer
correspondent services for different reasons: many banks offer them only to support the cross selling
of other products to respondent banks or to support the needs of corporate customers for cross border
payments. If a large international bank decides to withdraw from a country and sever its foreign CBRs
because there is no other business there to support, then it is not for any outside party to try and cajole
the bank into maintaining them.
80.    And even if a bank is in principle willing to do business, but decides not to because the
compliance costs are too high or because the risk profile of the entity it is dealing with, is too high and
not manageable, there will still be individual cases in which a bank is completely justified not doing
so. There are risks that should not be taken.
81.    The issue to consider is whether in other cases—particularly where applicable rules or facts and
circumstances are unclear, but there is in principle a business and risk related rationale for engagement,

there is something that authorities or the banks themselves could do to encourage the establishment of
a correspondent banking relationship. It is important to emphasize that this is a joint public-private
responsibility that needs to be dealt with in partnership. Only such an approach with efforts by all
actors, can help reverse the decline experienced in certain parts of the world.
82.     Even between the submission of information in the surveys and some of the follow up
interviews, several respondents noted that changes had taken place as far as correspondent banking in
their institution or jurisdiction was concerned. Indications as to what may happen in the near future
were mixed. Some respondents indicated the large scale withdrawal from correspondent banking was
over- others indicated that much more is yet to come. This area of the international payments system is
undergoing rapid change.
83.     Therefore, the World Bank will continue to monitor developments over the next year, and seek
to gather information from all relevant actors in this field to contribute to the international policy
discussion surrounding this topic. Where possible, it will seek to provide more insight into the further
effects on financial inclusion and economic activity resulting from the withdrawal of CBRs. Further
work could include amongst others a more detailed examination of the effects of the withdrawal of
CBR on the flows and costs of remittances and on the provision of trade finance (and possible economic
cost thereof). In addition the following actions by supervisors, authorities and banks could contribute
to improving the situation.
Supervisors should ensure banks follow a risk based approach
84.      Whether justified or not, large international banks indicate that they are uncertain what the
consequences would be if, through the provision of foreign CBR-services, they were facilitating the
movement of tainted funds, or funds linked to a sanctioned jurisdiction, person or entity. They argue
that, even when they have conducted a solid risk assessment and are dealing with the respondent
institution accordingly, they can be penalized if that respondent institution has accepted funds from a
money launderer or a sanctions evader. In that view, they need to get it right 100 percent of the time
and are on the hook for every failure.
85.     This strikes at the heart of a risk based approach. A risk based approach requires institutions to
determine the risk level of a certain customer and take proportionate action to address that risk. A
financial institution needs to have the systems in place to gather information to be able to determine
the risk, and ensure it acts accordingly to address it. Those systems evolve according to the money
laundering methods detected and cannot be foolproof. Thus, provided an institution can show it acted
reasonably in determining risk and mitigating it, failures to detect individual instances of money
laundering should not automatically trigger penalties.
86.      An unequivocal statement from national supervisors that there won’t be a zero tolerance
approach for failures to detect money laundering and setting out the tenets for a reasonable risk
assessment for establishing correspondent banking relationships, can provide banks with the comfort
they say they are lacking at this moment. The mere fact that a bank dealt with tainted funds is not in
itself sufficient to conclude that the bank in question “should have known”. This also implies that the
standard setter and the national AML/CFT policy makers clarify the acceptable level of risk tolerance.
87.    The withdrawal of CBRs is also driven by legitimate risk-based decisions by correspondent
banks, based on an individual risk assessment of their respondent banks. In such cases, making sure

Where, Why, and What to Do about It                                                                                42


that respondent banks improve their own AML/CFT internal controls and reduce their risk profile is
paramount.
88.      As noted earlier, banks may be completely justified withdrawing correspondent banking
relationships. It should not, however, be conducted in a wholesale, categorical manner that terminates
all relationships with certain categories of customer. The AML/CFT supervisor should verify this in its
supervision. While the decision to establish a relationship is ultimately a commercial decision,
wholesale de-risking is a sign that a bank is in fact not capable of conducting a proper risk assessment-
based on an individual appraisal of the situation.27 In addition it may give rise to concerns about
breaches of consumer protection or competition legislation.28
Supervisors and other authorities should ensure the effective implementation of international
AML/CFT standards
89.     Concerns about the implementation of AML/CFT obligations by countries and jurisdictions
featured prominently among the reasons large international banks are withdrawing from correspondent
banking relationships. All jurisdictions must therefore ensure that the legal and regulatory AML/CFT
framework is in place and that their financial institutions are being effectively supervised for
compliance with those obligations. For jurisdictions that believe they are unfairly being considered
high risk because of actual or perceived AML/CFT compliance lapses, it is especially important to
demonstrate to their counterpart regulators, to foreign financial institutions and to the public at large
the reforms that have been implemented or to correct misperceptions. Particularly for small
jurisdictions, compliance lapses – actual or alleged – by even one financial institution can have a
potential spillover effects for other financial institutions in the jurisdiction.
90.     For financial institutions, especially the smaller ones deemed more vulnerable to having their
relationships terminated solely on the basis of lack of sufficient business diversity and volume, effective
compliance with AML/CFT standards is essential. Internal controls systems need to be in place. Staff
from both the business lines and compliance units should be properly trained to know and be in line
with both the AML/CFT requirements of their respective jurisdictions and those of their CBR service
providers’ jurisdictions.
91.     The World Bank has a long track record providing technical assistance to countries to put in
place AML/CFT systems, to implement them effectively and to train relevant authorities, including to
conduct ML/FT national risk assessments. Countries are encouraged to avail themselves of this
assistance to improve their AML/CFT systems.


27.   See in that sense the statement from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand: “It seems unlikely, but if banks are using
      blanket de-risking itself as a procedure to manage and mitigate those risks, then the Reserve Bank would consider that
      an inadequate means of complying with their obligations under the AML/CFT Act.”, available at
      http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2015/6004856.html
28.   See in that sense the statement from the Financial Conduct Authorit y in the UK: “(…) we now consider during our
      AML work whether firms’ de-risking strategies give rise to consumer protection and/or competition issues.” available
      at https://www.fca.org.uk/about/what/enforcing/money-laundering/derisking. Further, there may be other types of
      protection- e.g. non-discrimination provisions. The second European Payment Services Directive contains provisions
      that address account denials and closures of accounts of payment service providers, including money remitters. It
      requires European Member States to ensure that credit institutions provide payment service providers with non-
      discriminatory and proportionate access to payment accounts. The access must be extensive enough to allow payment
      institutions to provide payment services in an unhindered and efficient manner. Where any payment service provider
      is rejected, the credit institution must provide the competent authority with duly motivated reasons for its decision.

Supervisors should provide clarity on the extent of due diligence on the customer’s customer
(KYCC obligations)
92.      Along those same lines, supervisors should provide detailed guidance on the extent to which,
or the circumstances under which, banks should conduct risk-based due diligence on the customers of
a respondent bank, the so-called “know-your-customer’s-customer” obligation, and what it would
entail. In other words, supervisors should set out under what conditions, if any, it is incumbent upon a
correspondent bank to go further than only conducting due diligence on the respondent bank. Given the
exceptional nature of this obligation, the supervisor should provide clear risk-based guidance on the
circumstances under which it might apply. If the supervisor does not consider it ever to apply to its
institutions, then it should say so clearly- leaving no room for misinterpretation or misunderstanding.
93.     Concern about the respondent’s customer also underlies the high-risk customer base of the
respondent bank as a driver for withdrawing from CBRs. Large international banks rated this factor
third and nearly all of the banks that further specified classes of customers that they considered high
risk indicated that MTOs fell into this category. The current work in FATF on guidance to MTOs is
very welcome, but will only usefully contribute to this discussion if it leads to more clarity on risk
differentiation. Well regulated and supervised MTOs should not be systematically considered as high
risk. Increased communication and outreach on supervisory practices and actions, particularly in the
case of MTOs, could further contribute to more differentiated risk decision making by banks.
Improve the information position of large international/correspondent banks
Banks should use technical tools to limit information challenges and lower costs
94.    A lack of knowledge and understanding of the entity that is seeking to establish a foreign CBR
contributes to a risk averse attitude. Conducting thorough due diligence of a prospective respondent
can be expensive. The more readily accessible the relevant information, the lower those costs. The
CPMI will shortly be issuing a report on the use of enhanced technological tools to limit information
challenges and use facilities offered by third parties to have the relevant information promptly available
and at much lower cost. This report will be an important contribution to this debate and its
recommendations on the use of KYC utilities and the Legal Entity Identifier are endorsed here. 29
Increase information exchange between correspondent banks and respondent banks and supervisory
authorities
95.     A further source of information for the large international banks that are providers of
correspondent banking services are the respondent banks themselves. Banks noted that there is greater
communication among the compliance staff of provider and client banks and in a more direct manner.
In this regard, it is significant that for example, Mexico has adopted legislation which removes legal
barriers to information sharing by its domestic banks with their foreign correspondent banks. Countries
should consider how they might allow for such exchange of information without breaching data
protection and privacy rules.
96.    In addition the setting up of working groups consisting of banking authorities and major
correspondent banks in the most relevant jurisdictions where higher restrictions are being imposed was
mentioned by one respondent. Such contacts have allowed all involved to reach a common
understanding on the interpretation and implementation of regulatory requirements imposed by the

29.   See Annex 11 for the current list of recommendations included in the consultative CPMI report.

foreign jurisdiction and to promote the development of best practices that foreign correspondent and
domestic respondent banks should follow to maintain CBRs.
97.     One supervisory authority suggested that correspondent banks reach out to the supervisor of a
prospective respondent bank, if there are concerns about the risk level of that bank. Given
confidentiality requirements, likely an explicit approval from the respondent bank to allow the
supervisor to provide the relevant information would be required. It would appear in the bank’s interest
though to give its approval for that transmission of information. Correspondent banks should consider
foreign supervisors as a potential source of information on their respondent banks. In addition,
supervisors should coordinate to clarify regulatory expectations and facilitate international exchange
of information.
Banking authorities of respondent banks should provide information on the country risk profile and
how higher risks are being addressed
98.     In assessing the risk of a prospective respondent bank, correspondent banks include
consideration of the risk profile of the country in which it is based. The international standards on
money laundering and terrorism financing oblige countries to assess their risk and to take action to
mitigate the identified risks. Many countries are currently in the process of conducting such risk
assessments and drawing up their action plans. Though countries are not obliged to publish this risk
assessment, it is recommended that countries do so, both to demonstrate their commitment to
AML/CFT and to inform outsiders of the risks they face and their plans for mitigating them. Moreover,
publication of such an assessment provides an opportunity for the country to highlight how it is
implementing AML/CFT standards. Indeed a number of authorities mentioned that they intended to
use their national risk assessment as part of their policy to address the withdrawal of correspondent
banking and problems faced by their remittance companies. The World Bank has developed a capacity
building tool for conducting a national risk assessment, which has so far been delivered in 40 countries
or jurisdictions, and stands ready to assist countries in this process.
Correspondent banks should take into account respondent’s business needs when deciding to
terminate a foreign CBR
Provide transparency on reasons for termination
99.     Several respondents from smaller banks indicated that the reasons for termination of a CBR
were not always provided, making it hard for them to understand why a relationship was being
terminated and how to improve their situation. Possibly this fact also explains why money laundering
and financial integrity related concerns featured less prominently among the reasons provided by
local/regional banks as driving de-risking than it featured among the reasons provided by large
international banks. In order to enable the smaller banks to address possible outside concerns on
AML/CFT, large international banks are encouraged to be more transparent about the reasons for
terminating a foreign CBR relationship.
Consider longer notice periods
100.    Many of the smaller respondent banks mentioned that when their relationships are terminated
they are sometimes given only 30 days after the correspondent bank announces its intention to terminate
the relationship. For those banks maintaining only a few foreign CBRs, that can make it very hard to
find alternatives. Even when banks have an existing CBR to which they can shift their business, time
is needed to arrange for increase in credit and number transactions that the existing CBR is able and

willing to provide. The longer notice period is of greater importance in smaller jurisdictions or where
options for alternatives are limited. Moreover, the loss of a foreign CBR without replacement can result
in only a few channels being available to a respondent bank, thus becoming dangerously dependent on
only a few or sometimes just one institution. In order to provide smaller banks with more room for
maneuver and more time to undertake a careful review of the options available to them, large
international banks are encouraged to extend their notice period to at least three months- preferably
more, and could during that period place limits as described below.
Consider placing limits instead of terminating altogether
101.    Large international banks that are the providers of foreign correspondent banking services
should consider placing appropriate credit and other limits/conditions on their client banks, rather than
terminating the relationships. Placing conditions on a relationship is considered preferable to
straightforward termination and a trial period can be a pragmatic and efficient way to deal with possible
AML/CFT related concerns.
Consider establishing relationships at the parent level
102.    In order to meet the large international banks’ requirements for business volume/size, some
banks indicated they had established the CBR at the parent level, when the correspondent was unwilling
to establish it at the subsidiary level because of the low volume. In that way they were able to
consolidate the volume of transactions from the various branches and subsidiaries in other jurisdictions
and improving the risk/reward determination. It is recommended that other banks also explore the
possibility of this solution when volumes of an individual subsidiary bank are too low to justify the
establishment of a CBR.
Authorities should monitor the status of correspondent banking in their jurisdiction
103.    Finally, though not directly addressing the drivers of de-risking, it would improve the overall
ability of governments and private actors to take action if countries were to more systematically gather
information on the status of foreign CBRs. The surveys overall met with a positive response but not all
jurisdictions responded, and among the respondents, a not insignificant number indicated that they
lacked systematic data to be able to complete the survey.
104.     Authorities and financial institutions that do not already do so, should consider taking a
proactive approach in communicating with one another to monitor foreign CBR related developments
in their own jurisdiction and jurisdictions of their CBR counterparts, as well as developments at the
regional and global levels. This holds especially true for smaller jurisdictions, with fewer and smaller
institutions which appear to be most susceptible to trends in CBRs – since they cannot always meet the
business volume/profitability requirements of the large international banks that are their correspondent
banking products/services providers. For the smaller institutions and jurisdictions, even the loss of a
small number of CBRs can have a greater impact for all concerned. Authorities should focus their
monitoring efforts on the banks with very few or only one or two CBRs, that are heavily dependent,
and at the mercy of, the correspondent banks who can set the terms almost at will. And where necessary
assist them in their efforts to establish or maintain foreign CBRs. In addition it would be useful to
monitor to what extent banks whose foreign CBRs are being terminated or restricted, are finding
alternatives with second and third tier foreign banks, or are establishing connections with other banks
to use them as their gateway for foreign CBR services in so-called nested CBRs.

Annex 1: Method followed
1.      To initiate the fact gathering exercise, the WB and the FSB organized a roundtable meeting in
Washington DC at the margins of the WB/IMF Spring Meetings, on April 16, 2015. The objective of
this event was to discuss the size, scope and drivers of decline in correspondent banking and other
cross-border financial services and possible policy responses. Governors and other regional and
national banking authorities, as well as representatives from the Financial Action Task Force (the
standard setter on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism – AML/CFT)
and the World Economic Forum, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on
Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) participated in that event. On the basis of the observations
made at that meeting and of the media reports mentioned earlier, the WB worked with FSB and CPMI
to put together two surveys: one for banking authorities and one for large international banks. A third
survey was designed specifically for smaller local (i.e. presence in one jurisdiction) and regional banks
to try and ascertain the impact of the decline trend on these financial institutions.
2.    Beginning in June 2015 and through October 2015, the surveys were sent, on behalf of the
CPMI, the FSB and the WB, to 3 groups of respondents:
      Central banking authorities of jurisdictions, including those which were believed to be home
       to banks that are themselves terminating relationships, as well as jurisdictions home to banks
       whose relationships are being terminated by other banks (including as identified in the results
       of the large international banks survey), and/or members of the FSB Regional Consultative
       Groups. In addition to completing the survey, these authorities were also asked to identify five
       to ten banks in their jurisdiction for whom the authorities believed that the topic of a withdrawal
       from correspondent banking might be particularly relevant.
      Large international banks which were allegedly withdrawing from foreign correspondent
       banking on a significant scale (and some others who are among the top providers of
       correspondent banking services for whom the trend was unclear from public reports), and
       primarily geared towards obtaining information on their vostro accounts (that is to say, those
       providing a service to another bank), and
      Local/regional banks whose home jurisdictions were identified in the authorities and large
       international banks surveys as affected by the withdrawal of correspondent banking and whose
       contact information was provided by their banking authorities. This survey was primarily
       geared towards obtaining information on their nostro accounts (that is to say those where they
       are receiving a service from another bank). Beyond gathering information on size and drivers,
       the objective of this survey was specifically to find out information on the ability of banks to
       find alternatives when their relationships had been terminated or restricted.

3.      Extensive outreach was conducted to clarify some of the responses received. Because the
responses to questions on possible policy actions and on finding alternative correspondent banking
relationships were not always complete, a further series of follow-up interviews by telephone was
conducted from late September to mid-October with relevant bank and country respondents.

Local/Regional Banks and Client Impact
Please note that local banks that indicated decline in their overall CBRs as well as a small number of banks that
did not indicate overall decline responded to the question regarding impact on client segments.
The respondents indicated that money transfer operators (MTOs) and other remittance companies/service
providers are most affected; however, a not insignificant number of banks also indicated impact to their clients
who are small and medium exporters and small and medium domestic banks. Respondents also specified other
types of clients/client segments including casas de cambios (money exchange houses), importers and PEPs.

Annex 11: Recommendations included in Consultative Report Correspondent Banking
  published by the CPMI34
• Recommendation on the use of KYC utilities: The use of KYC utilities in general - provided that they store
at least a minimum set of up-to-date and accurate information - can be supported as an effective means to reduce
the burden of compliance with some KYC procedures for banks active in correspondent banking business.
Relevant stakeholders (eg the Wolfsberg Group) may review the templates and procedures used by the different
utilities and identify the most appropriate data fields to compile a data set that all utilities should collect as best
practice and that all banks have to be ready to provide to banks which require the information.
• Recommendation on the use of the LEI in correspondent banking: In addition to the general promotion of
LEIs for legal entities, relevant stakeholders may consider specifically promoting the use of the LEI for all banks
involved in correspondent banking as a means of identification which should be provided in KYC utilities and
information-sharing arrangements. In a cross-border context, this measure is ideally to be coordinated and
applied simultaneously in a high number of jurisdictions. In addition, authorities and relevant stakeholders (eg
the Wolfsberg Group) may consider promoting BIC to LEI mapping facilities which allow for an easy mapping
of routing information available in the payment message to the relevant LEI.
• Recommendation on information-sharing initiatives: The work already conducted by the authorities with
responsibility for AML/CFT (i.e. the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision AML/CFT Expert Group (AMLEG)) is very much appreciated. It is recommended that the FATF
and AMLEG be invited to: (i) provide additional clarity on due diligence recommendations for upstream banks,
in particular to what extent banks need to know their customers’ customers (“KYCC”); (ii) further clarify data
privacy concerns in the area of correspondent banking; and (iii) detail, to the extent possible, the type of data
that information-sharing mechanisms could store and distribute in order to be a useful source of information. In
order to facilitate compliance with FATF customer due diligence recommendations, (i) the use of information-
sharing mechanisms (if they exist in a given jurisdiction and data privacy laws allow this) for knowing your
customers’ customers could be promoted as the first source of information by default, which (ii) could be
complemented bilaterally with enhanced information should there be a need. In order to support information-
sharing in general, the respondent bank may include provisions in its contractual framework with its customers
(eg in the terms and conditions or in a supplementary agreement) which allow the bank to provide such
information on request to other banks for AML/CFT compliance purposes.
 • Recommendation on payment messages: It is recommended that the relevant stakeholders determine
whether the MT 202 COV payment message is as efficient and effective as intended or whether relying only on
the MT 103 and the serial processing method would better serve the needs of clients, the industry and law
enforcement in light of the fee structure, technological changes and payment capabilities for processing
correspondent banking payments. The Wolfsberg Group seems to be the most appropriate body to review the
issue and to initiate a recommendation in this field and lead any consequential changes if required.
