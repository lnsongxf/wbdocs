                      Podgorica, June 2017
The present Guide was drawn up as part of the Support Program of the World Bank (hereinafter
WB), the Public Procurement Agency (hereinafter PPA). The Guide is funded by the WB and
implemented by Vladimir Boričić, a local expert. The implementation of the "program" was
initiated in January 2017 and it will end in May 2017.

The general objective of the Guide is to contribute to increased participation of SMEs in the
public procurement market in Montenegro.

We thank everyone who have helped with research and collection of information, in particular

map the key activities aimed at overcoming potential obstacles in business activities faced by
Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises when participating in public procurement procedures in
Montenegro.

We are grateful to all the representatives of state bodies and local self-government for the
information provided, which have had a special significance in the development of this Guide.

1. INTRODUCTION: This short chapter usually begins with the notes on key objectives of
the Guide to encourage greater participation of SMEs in the public procurement market in
Montenegro. The introduction clearly defines SMEs and thus explains which type of
enterprises the Guide focuses on specifically. The introduction distinctly explains how the
Guide to support the development of SME is tuned in with the Strategy for Supporting the
Development of SMEs, Strategy for the Development of the Public Procurement System in
Montenegro for the period 2016-2020 and how they are used to the utmost extent at the
national, regional and local levels. It is necessary to bear in mind that one of the characteristics
of effective economic development is the harmonization of sectoral plans at various levels of
government. What local government is able to achieve varies from level to level, but is still
within the framework of activities carried out by the Government.

2. ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION: This significant chapter includes, first of all, the
analysis of the economy in the state and municipalities, as well as the nature of SMEs. It lays
out an analysis of the structure and trends that are typical of the economy at the state and local
levels. Important questions that should be answered are: What are the key economic activities
in the state and the municipalities? Has the scope of the economic activity in the past five to ten
years increased or decreased and what are the reasons that caused such changes? Important
information about SMEs that are presented in this section refer to the number of SMEs by
activity, the number of entrepreneurs, the number of individuals employed in SMEs, the trends
of employment in the last five to ten years, the market and the challenges that SMEs are
currently facing. In addition, we have also carried out an analysis of weaknesses, opportunities
and threats, an analysis which highlights the main issues that should be addressed through
support plan for SMEs, and more importantly, their relationship i.e. their cause-and-effect link.
3. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK: This section describes what state and local governments
and stakeholders in the sector want to achieve. It often begins with the statement of vision, for
example indicating the proposed business environment that encourages and enables the
development of SME. A brief summary of ways for achieving the vision through the activities
which the state and local governments and stakeholders wish to undertake. The chapter moves
on to describe the priorities and strategic objectives of the plan and the specific targets that are
associated with the implementation of the plan for the Guide. These objectives are the
indicators by which it is possible to measure progress, performances and the like, in the
implementation of the Guide plan.

4. ACTION PLAN: This chapter introduces specific activities to be undertaken in order to
realize the vision. These activities include certain changes in policy at the national level and
local self-government level as well as new projects. An example of a change in policy is, for
instance, a change in rules governing the public procurement of goods, works and services. The
Action Plan covers the period from 2017 to 2020.

5. BUDGET AND FUNDING PLAN: Consideration of project costs - Guide and ways to
obtain necessary funds are included in Chapter IV of the Action Plan. Without clearly allocated
funds in the state and local budget, the Action Plan will only remain a dead letter without
coverage.

6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES: The final chapter focuses on the
manner in which to monitor progress and impact of this Guide. Monitoring is often overlooked,
but it is an extremely important and essential part of implementation. Monitoring on state and
local self-government level allows to determine whether the implementation is on the right
track and if not, which modes for implementation should be reviewed.

                                     1. INTRODUCTION


The sector of small and medium-sized enterprises (hereinafter SMEs) represent an increasingly
important segment of Montenegrin economy and have been key drivers of its economic growth
and employment for the past several years.

With foreign direct investment, this sector could be an important lever of economic
development and the main creator of new jobs in the future. In order to survive and develop in
the market, these enterprises have to constantly build new competitive benefits. The same can
be built within the enterprises themselves through their strengthening and development, but
also through mutual cooperation and linking.

Because SMEs have an important role in the economic development of each country, it is
necessary to encourage and facilitate their participation in public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the fact that procurements merge at all levels (national and local), special
attention should be paid to get SMEs more closely involved in the procurement procedures with
contracting authorities, subject to the application of the LPP.

Public procurement is of key importance to the Strategy Europe 2020, established in the EU as
"Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth". It is one of the
instruments based on the market that are used to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive
growth, while ensuring the most efficient use of public funds.

Montenegro has recognized in its Agenda through the Strategy for the Development of the
Public Procurement System for the period 2016 – 2020 the necessity of active relationship
between the state and local self-government on the development and encouragement of SMEs.

Based on research carried out in direct communication with the representatives of these entities
and their associations, with the aim to assess the readiness of SMEs to adapt to future activities
in the field of public procurement, it is evident that they are planning new investments and
expansion of business. They are ready to invest in human resources, technical, technological
and other facilities necessary for successful business, in order to be competitive in the market.

To that end, they expect more support from the state of Montenegro and the local community.
In accordance with the orientation and expectations of SMEs this Guide is intended to
encourage the participation of SMEs at all levels in the area of public procurement.

By following the steps, tips and ideas contained in this Guide, the State and local self-
governments can create their own "setting", the document - Guidelines whose implementation
will significantly affect the improvement of the business environment.

For this purpose, the rules on public procurement adopted pursuant to Directive 2004/17/EC of
the European Parliament and the Council and Directive 2004/18/EC of the European
Parliament and the Council will be reviewed and improved in order to increase the efficiency of
public spending, especially in order to facilitate participation of Small and Medium-Sized
Enterprises (SMEs) in public procurement and to allow contracting authorities to make better
use of public procurement in order to achieve common social goals2.

                                                6
Montenegro is on the right track regarding the full implementation of the Directive from the
package 2014/EU, which clearly recognize the role and importance of SMEs in the economy of
countries.


                                      2. ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION

                           2.1. The structure of business entities in Montenegro

In Montenegro, according to size, in accordance with the criteria applicable to their
classification, businesses are divided into small and medium. According to Monstat data of
March 2017, there are 27,954 or 98.9% of small enterprises and 268 or 0.9% of medium-sized
enterprises operating in Montenegro, which generate about 76% of the total turnover, and
account for 67% of the total added value, employing almost 2/3 of the total number of
employees.

The sectors in which small and medium-sized enterprises mostly operate are: wholesale and
retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, accommodation and catering services,
professional, scientific and technical activities, construction, manufacturing industry3.

The classification of enterprises into small, medium and large, in accordance with the Law on
Accounting and Auditing ("Official Gazette of the Republic of Montenegro" no. 069/05 of
18/11/2005, 080/08 of 26/12/2008, 073/10 of 10/12/ 2010, 032/11 of 01/07/2011), is based on
the average number of employees, total annual turnover and the value of total assets.

They include physical and legal entities, which perform a specific activity in order to make a
profit on the market, including self-employment and family-run businesses generating profit
and other activities, registered with the competent authority regardless of the form of
organization. The structure of business entities in Montenegro viewed on the basis of size class
should meet the following criteria:

- Small enterprises are those legal entities in which:
     1) the average number of employees ranges between 1 and 49;
     2) business turnover is less than or equal to euro 10,000,000;
     3) the average value of assets is less than or equal to euro 10,000,000.

- Medium-sized enterprises are those legal entities in which:
     1) the average number of employees ranges between 49 and 249;
     2) business turnover ranges between euro 10,000 and 50,000,000;
     3) the average value of assets ranges between euro 10,000 and 43,000,000.

According to the Statistical Business Register of Montenegro, in terms of the form of
ownership, business entities in Montenegro are divided into three forms of ownership4, as
follows:
     private,
     two or more forms of ownership, and
     state-owned.

Of the total number, approximately 99% of business entities are privately-owned. More
detailed information is given in the following table;

For the classification of enterprises by size, the annual average of employees is used, rather
than the number of employees on a particular date, as well as generated profits and assets
available on an annual basis.

Table 3 shows the number of small, medium- sized and large enterprises in Montenegro for the
period 2014-2016. In the class of small enterprises, the number of businesses in 2016 compared
to 2015 has increased by 8.1%, and there was a rise in the number of businesses in the class of
large enterprises.

 If we take into account the number of active business entities and their trend in Montenegro for
 the period 2014/2016, we can conclude that the most difficult period of the economic crisis has
 passed, and that there are positive changes in the business environment that make room for
 further improvement.

 However, many analyses show that there is a need for various means of acquiring knowledge
 and skills by management and employees, improving access to finance, certification of quality
 standards, raising competitiveness, encouragement of innovation, strengthening the dialogue
 between the public and private sectors, strengthening the institutional framework for SME
 development, strengthening cooperation between all institutions, at national and local levels.


                                               10
These needs are particularly important for business entities in order to reduce weaknesses that
have a negative impact on the operations of SMEs and the exports of products of our
enterprises on the international market.


                          2.2. Small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU

Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up 99% of all enterprises in the EU,
provide two out of three jobs in the private sector and account for more than half of overall
GDP generated by enterprises in the EU. Nine out of ten SMEs are actually micro enterprises
with less than ten employees. In order to support and assist SMEs, various action programs
such as the Small Business Act were adopted, which included all these programs in order to
create a comprehensive policy framework. Horizon 2020 and COSME programs have also been
established to increase the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises with the help
of research and innovation, in order to get better access to funding for SMEs.

SMEs mainly operate at the local and national level because they are relatively less involved in
cross-border activities within the EU. Their business is covered by EU legislation in various
areas such as taxation (Articles 110 to 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union (TFEU)), market competition (Articles 101 to 109 of the TFEU) and enterprise law
(right of establishment: Articles 49-54 of the TFEU), whereas the definition of SMEs can be
found in the recommendation of the Commission 2003/361/EC.


In EU countries, the definition of SMEs is different. Small enterprises comprise those legal
entities which have fewer than 50 employees, with less than ten million euros annual turnover
and/or total balance sheet of less than ten million euros. Medium-sized enterprises have less
than 250 employees, less than 50 million euros turnover and/or total balance sheet of less than
43 million euros. A more detailed approach to the classification of business entities, their
structure and share of SMEs in the EU is provided in the following tables.

These enterprises are key to business, the source of entrepreneurial spirit and innovation that
ultimately have a decisive impact on the competitiveness of enterprises in the EU. Therefore,
the aim of EU policy in the field of small and medium-sized enterprises is to ensure that the
policies and measures of the Union are tailored for small enterprises and contribute to greater
attractiveness for the establishment of enterprises and strengthening of their business activities6.

To that end, certain accomplishments have been achieved:

    a) In 2008 the Small Business Act was passed, which includes:

            smart regulations in terms of reducing barriers to business, combating late payment,
             issuing of electronic receipts upon payment so as to equalize the fiscal bills,
             reducing the administrative burden of SMEs in public procurement procedures, the
             introduction of possibilities for community submission of offers, simplification of
             financial reporting, etc.;
            access to funding in order to obtain the necessary funds on the financial market and
             credit by providing loans, guarantees and venture capital, increased activity by
             European financial institutions, the EIB and EIF, and in that sense, the Action Plan
             to improve access to funding for SMEs was adopted in 2011;

             contains policy initiatives to facilitate access of SMEs to venture capital markets;
            policy of state aid for SMEs.

     b) The program and the EU network for SMEs
     c) The program for SMEs and research;
     d) COMSE - the program for the competitiveness of enterprises and SMEs, which carries
        out its activities within the Framework Program for Competitiveness and Innovation in
        accordance with the set general aims.

There are 21 million SMEs in the EU. These enterprises are a key source of employment
because they employ around 66.7% of total employment figures in the EU, of which 29% are
employed in micro enterprises, 20.5% in small and 17.2% in medium-sized enterprises,
whereas large enterprises employ 33.3% of the employees. In terms of business areas, the
largest number of SMEs are those engaged in wholesale and retail trade, as high as 27%,
followed by real estate trade, renting and other services at 22%, SMEs engaged in production
make up 13%, followed by construction at 11%, and the smallest number of SMEs are in the
field of financial, health and social services8.


                          2.3. The role of public procurement markets for SMEs

In Montenegro, public procurement was introduced in 2001 by adopting the first LPP when
important prerequisites for efficient market operations were created, which was amended later
on. In the period following the introduction of the system of public procurement it has been
noticed that it plays an important role and is a key element of public investment, it is important
for strengthening the single market, achieving economic development and it represents an
important component of economic development, accounting for a substantial share in the total
GDP of our country.

From the statement on the agreed public procurement prepared by the Public Procurement
Agency9 it is evident that in 2016 the stakeholders subject to the application of LPP agreed a
total of 447,739,222.36 euros for procurement of goods, services and works and completed a
total of 7653 contracts by carrying out tender procedures and 84,967 contracts through direct
agreement (see the figure on agreed purchases for the period 2011/2016 and its share in GDP).

The management of public procurement is a key determinant of good governance and progress
of Montenegro, because annual volume of funds allocated from the Budget of Montenegro, the
budgets of contracting authorities, donations, funds from the European structural and
investment funds for the procurement of goods, services and works are a potential market for
all enterprises in Montenegro. Public procurement opens new opportunities for SMEs which
encourages investment and contributes to strengthening the overall economic growth and
development.


    2.4. Analysis of the most common barriers to the participation of SMEs in public
              procurement procedures and possibilities of their elimination

Public procurement procedures are very complex, and therefore may pose difficulties for SMEs
to understand the procedures themselves, as prescribed by the Law on Public Procurement
("Official Gazette of Montenegro" no. 42/11, 57/14 and 28/15, hereinafter: LPP). Furthermore,
there are other problems that can present a barrier to these enterprises participating in the
bidding process.

Conducted research and analysis have pointed out the most frequent obstacles faced by SMEs
in the procurement process:

 a) high-value contracts and the impossibility to meet optional conditions related to the
    necessary capacities (economic, financial, professional and technical personnel), as well
    as the temporary closure of the market through "framework agreements";
 b) lack of information and inadequate communication with contracting authorities;
 c) tight deadlines for the preparation of offers for particularly complex procurement;
 d) lack of necessary knowledge of procedures and experience in participation in public
    procurement procedures;
 e) giving priority to the lowest bid in relation to the criterion of the most economically
    advantageous offer;
 f) unnecessary administrative burden;
 g) delay in payment or non-payment for the work done,
 h) lack of procedures to protect rights in public procurement procedures,
 i) high banking costs with financial security in public procurement procedures (guarantees),
    and
 j) other.

The section below describes the stated obstacles and provides certain information in order to
overcome them.




                                             14
            a.) High-value contracts and the inability to fulfill optional conditions, temporary
                          closure of the market through "framework agreements";

The centralization of public procurement, on the one hand, can provide contracting authorities
with significant savings, but can negatively affect the operations of SMEs. The
centralization/consolidation of procurement can pose a potential threat to SMEs to be excluded
from public procurement procedures because they are not able to meet the requirements of the
contracting authorities. This is actually one of the greatest challenges of each country, to
provide SMEs with access to these procedures, which are usually intended only for large
bidders. It is of crucial importance to find a way to get the SMEs to be part of such huge
transactions.

The LPP has taken into account the difficulties that would be encountered by SMEs, and
predicted that the contracting authorities must organize their purchase into lots whenever
possible, so as to allow the participation of SMEs10. Distribution of items into lots should be
carried out in quantitative and qualitative terms. In quantitative terms, it is necessary to
determine the lot by taking into account the size and the number of lots that would be in line
with the production capacity of the bidder, whereas in qualitative terms, it is necessary to
consider the contents of the lots so as to adapt them to specialized sectors of SMEs. Naturally,
the organisation of procurement items into lots can also be considered while implementing
Framework Agreements.

In order to facilitate SMEs' participation in framework agreements, contracting authorities may
consider the possibility of concluding framework agreements with multiple bidders, rather than
with one. Compared to a traditional public procurement procedures in which the contracting
authorities choose one bidder and conclude the contract with him (which is usually a major
legal entity), in the framework agreement concluded with several bidders, and at the same time
divided into lots, greater chance is given to a larger number of smaller bidders to get the part
that they may fulfil. The above is particularly important because the conclusion of framework
agreements for a longer period in a way temporarily closes the market. In some EU countries,
Guidelines for the implementation of the framework agreements were adopted, providing
guidance to contracting authorities that during the implementation process in order to conclude
a framework agreement as a minimum level of the bidders’ skills should be linked to "the
largest contract" and not to the total value of all contracts to be concluded by a framework
agreement.

In addition to the qualitatively and quantitatively major contracts, the contracting authorities
can exclude SMEs by determining capacities as optional conditions for participation that are
disproportionate to the subject of procurement. In this way there is discrimination against
bidders who could undertake such a purchase, if such conditions were realistically placed. For
example, determining the financial capacity which is unreasonably high may discourage SMEs
to participate in the process. The Directive from 2004 and the Directive from 201411 predict
the optimal financial capacity which the contracting authorities can foresee in the tender
documents, i.e. the minimum income required of bidders. It must not be greater than twice the
estimated value of procurement except in particularly justified cases, when that is necessary
because of specific risks associated with the subject of public procurement. There is a
commitment that the optional conditions (facilities that are generally required) must be
logically related to the subject of procurement and must not discriminate the bidders.

                                                                        15
Limiting the participation SMEs by determining capacities which are unrealistic or aimed at
reducing competition in public procurement procedures in the EU Member States has led to the
clear definition of this issue in the new Directive.


         b.) Lack of information and inadequate communication with contracting authorities

SMEs are faced with a major problem of the lack of necessary information related to public
procurement procedures (where to find "ads" on public procurement, how to see the tender
documents, what is necessary to prepare a bid, how to get in touch with contracting bodies,
etc.).

The LPP MN clearly stipulates the process of publication of tender documentation on the
Public Procurement Portal12. This law has taken a further step, and thus Article 66 commits
each contracting authority to publish a notice on a public procurement procedure in one daily
newspaper issued and distributed throughout the territory of Montenegro, and which is also
available on the Internet within three days from the date of publication of tender documentation
on the Public Procurement Portal. The public procurement procedure launched or implemented
without a notice is null and void.

Downloading tender documents by SMEs is free of charge. Therefore, all information and all
the documents concerning a specific public procurement are easily accessible to SMEs. Access
to the Public Procurement Portal is very simple and does not require prior registration on the
part of the bidder. The website and the Public Procurement Portal PPA allows browsing:

          public procurement plans,
          tender documents for procurement of goods, services and works;
          decisions on qualification of candidates,
          decisions on the best bid,
          decisions to suspend the public procurement procedures,
          decisions to annul of the public procurement procedures,
          agreements on public procurement,
          amendments or additions to the public procurement plan, tender documents, decisions
           and contracts,
          PPA's opinions regarding the regularity of application of the law,
          reports on agreed public procurement and
          other documents.

The Public Procurement Portal allows for a significantly improved browsing of public
procurement, and the website has a significant amount of information in English. SMEs can use
instructions which is important to search the Portal13. Furthermore, the SMEs have the
possibility to get answers related to certain queries about the LPP from PPA in a simple and
quick way by phone, e-mail or through a written request14. Similar solutions exist in EU
countries. In Bulgaria, it is envisaged that experts from the Public Procurement Agency should
give advice over the phone, whereas in Italy, in the context of their central body, a project of
cooperation is designed through a functional Help Desk which helps enterprises, particularly
SMEs to increase their participation in public procurement procedures15. In Latvia there is also

a unique online Portal that publishes procedures, which is free and offers information on a daily
basis16.

In preparing offers, it is important that SMEs as bidders know what they need to offer. A
contracting authority is obliged to clearly and accurately describe the characteristics of the
subject of public procurement. In this regard it would be advisable that the contracting
authority should previously explore the market in order to consider the solutions which exist
therein, and to prepare the technical specifications so that they are really in line with their
actual needs. Unclear technical specifications can often deter bidders from participating in the
present proceedings because they are not sure what exactly the contracting authority is buying.
Some EU countries, therefore, tend to set up a dialogue between contracting authorities and
bidders so as to determine what can be bought in the market, whether there are any alternative
solutions and how to sufficiently and properly to describe the subject of public procurement.
Very often not even the contracting authorities themselves have the necessary knowledge on
the subject of public procurement, and this can cause that in the process they may receive all
improper offers or do not receive an offer at all. When there is a dialogue in place between the
contracting authorities and bidders it should be borne in mind to act in accordance with the
principles of equality and that the technical specifications should not be adapted to a particular
bidder.

In addition, if the process has already been initiated, but the deadline for the submission of bids
has not yet expired, bidders may ask for further explanations regarding the preparation of the
bid. This kind of communication between contracting authority and bidder is allowed and
necessary. Very often, in doing so they provide significant clarifications and give assistance to
bidders in order to prepare an acceptable offer. Accordingly, the LPP foresees that the
stakeholder shall have the right to require the contracting authority to clarify the bidding
documents. Depending on the type of public procurement procedure, the contracting authority
is obliged to submit to the applicant the clarification of the bidding documents and to have it
published on the Public Procurement Portal within three days upon receiving of the request, but
the clarification shall not be used to make changes and/or additions to the bidding
documentation and it shall be an integral part of the bidding documents.

Depending on the type of public procurement procedure, the bidder, i.e. an SME can require a
clarification from the contracting authority within:

1) 22 days after the date of its publication, or submission of the tender documents, if the period
for the submission of bids is at least 37 days, from the date of publication or submission of the
tender documents;
2) eight days after the date of its publication, or the submission of tender documents, if the
deadline for submission of tenders is at least 22 days from the date of publication or submission
of tender documents;
3) six days after the date of its publication, or the submission of tender documents, if the
deadline for submission of bids is at least 12 days from the date of publication or submission of
tender documents;
4) three days after the date of its publication, or the submission of tender documents, if the
deadline for submission of tenders of less than 12 days from the date of publication or
submission of the tender documents.

In terms of increasing the level of bidder’s (SMEs) awareness, future activities in the area of
electronic public procurement are more closely aimed at developing a system for electronic
bidding, through the following stages:

      analysis of the necessary amendments to the legislative framework for the
       implementation of electronic public procurement;
      analysis of the current institutional frame in MN;
      analysis of technical solutions and options that are being used or are under development
       in the EU Member States;
      the choice of optimal selection of the legal, technical and institutional model to be used
       in MN;
      preparation of technical solutions, in accordance with the selected optimal model;
      development and commissioning of a new platform of electronic public procurement.

The ultimate goal is the establishment and functioning of a single, comprehensive platform of
electronic public procurement, which would contain all of these key functions, namely:

      The procedure prior to the award of public procurement: e-notices; e-tender documents;
       e-submission of bids; e-review and evaluation; e-awarding of public procurement;
      The procedure after the award of public procurement: e-orders; e-invoicing and e-
       payments.

In the process of the development of electronic public procurement system in Montenegro the
following activities were conducted: in November 2015 the Minister of Finance formed a
workgroup for drafting the Terms of Reference (ToR) to prepare for the introduction of
electronic public procurement ("Implementation of e-procurement system"). The workgroup
developed a drafted a Prior Information Notice - PIN (notice of the contract) and it was
published in January 2016 (published on the website of the Ministry of Finance - Directorate
for     Finance       and     Contracting      of     the      EU       Assistance     (CFCU)
www.mif.gov.me/rubrike/CFCU_tenderi/Tenderi). Further activities related to the project that
followed are the drafting of Contract Notice and the finalization of the Terms of Reference s
(based on the Action Document for the given project), based on which some specific items in
the Contract Notice were amended. In December 2016 the Contract Notice was finalized and it
was given approval for its publication. In order to publish the ToR it is necessary to obtain
approval of the Ministry of Information Society on the project task – through the reform of the
state administration, these matters are the responsibility of the Ministry of Public
Administration, the ToR was agreed upon and after all the expectations by the end of
April/May 2017 an invitation to submit the most favourable offer for this project will be
published. In this regard, the process of improving the Public Procurement Portal shall be
followed by the process of implementing training in order to promote electronic public
procurement.

When introducing electronic public procurement, it is necessary to use exclusively such
information systems and technologies that are widely available to all stakeholders, whereas at
the same time there must be no restriction of competition, or any form of discrimination of
participants.

Montenegro is conducting an intensive preparation for the implementation of the New
Directive which demands mandatory introduction of legal provisions for the application of
certain techniques of e-procurement by the Member States (e-auctioning, dynamic procurement




                                               18
system and e-catalogs), whereby the contracting authorities are free to decide whether they will
apply them.

                                            c.) Tight deadlines for preparing bids

One of the difficulties for SMEs are tight deadlines for the preparation of bids. LPP stipulates
minimum deadlines for submission of bids in public procurement procedures, which does not
mean that contracting authorities can determine a longer deadline, especially if the object of
public procurement is complex and complicated and involves more serious preparation. The
deadline for submitting bids is adapted to the type of public procurement procedure and ranges
from a reasonable period in the cases referred to in Article 25 Paragraph 1, Item 1, Items 2 and
3-37 days in the open public procurement procedure:

                                                                     Deadline for submission of
              Type of public procurement procedure
                                                                       tenders/applications

Since the process of preparing tenders is quite complex, it is necessary for SMEs to provide for
adequate time for their preparation because these entities often lack sufficient and necessary
qualified staff, and in cases of public procurement of great value and complex procedures these
enterprises need additional time to find a partner for the joint appearance i.e. to participate in a
joint bid or tender with subcontractors, i.e. manufacturers.

The EU Directive 2014/24/EC stipulates the possibility of publication of prior information
notice so as to inform the bidders and SMEs in a timely manner that a public procurement
procedure will soon be carried out17. Prior information notice should be sufficiently detailed
and contain the information necessary for preparing bids.

Ever since it was passed, the LPP of Montenegro has stipulated this responsibility in a very
transparent way, namely by means of mandatory publication of the public procurement plan on
the Public Procurement Portal by 31 January of the current year so that each provider has
insight, at the beginning of the calendar year, into what will the contracting authorities buy, at
what price and when it will be bought.

           d.) Lack of necessary knowledge about procedures and experience in public
                                     procurement procedures

Insufficient knowledge of public procurement procedures by contracting authorities and SMEs
can be the cause of a lesser participation of SMEs in public procurement procedures. Some
countries have drafted manuals for contracting authorities and bidders with a focus on the needs
of SMEs. An example of good practice that provides guidelines for contracting authorities on
how to facilitate the participation of SMEs is the brochure "Small bidder better value"18which
aims to raise awareness of contracting authorities on the possibilities of achieving "value for
money" that SMEs can offer. In this sense, the stated brochure briefly describes what problems
may be encountered by SMEs and how the problems can be overcome.

In the Netherlands, the Ministry of Economy established the "PianoO"19 agency which helps
contracting authorities to be more professional in their procurement. On its website," PianoO"
publishes information regarding the legislation in the area of public procurement, as well as
examples of good practice. "PianoO" also encourages dialogue between public and private
sectors within its network with approximately 3,500 professionals in public procurement.
Training in the field of public procurement is necessary for bidders, especially for SMEs
because they most often lack the administrative capacities which are exclusively engaged in
public procurement and thoroughly understand the "language" of public procurement. It is
therefore necessary to continuously organize workshops and training sessions intended
exclusively for SMEs, prepare guides that will be of assistance in public procurement
procedures. France has drawn up a detailed guide for SMEs 'Guide pratique pour la réponse
des PME à la commande Publique "20. The above guide gives instructions to SMEs on how to
obtain information on procurement in order to understand the needs of contracting authorities
on the basis of the published tender documentation, how to assess whether they have the
necessary capacities for specific procurement, etc. Great Kingdom went a step further, and has
developed an SME training program. The goal of this program is to provide the necessary
knowledge to participate in public procurement procedures and raise awareness of contracting
authorities on the problems faced by SME. Following the success of this program, the United
Kingdom has organized online courses for SMEs called "Winning the Contract" which provide
practical advice for finding potential jobs. The European Commission has paid particular
attention to SMEs and has established a portal designed exclusively for SMEs - "European
Small Business Portal”, which provides important information to SMEs (e.g. loans,
guarantees, business rules in the EU, research, development and innovation, doing business
outside the EU, etc.)21.

The Development strategy of the public procurement system of Montenegro for the period
2016-2020 and AP have envisaged liberalized activities of the PPA, CCMN, MEF, MBA and
AMMN in order to:

        facilitate access to information on public procurement for SMEs,
        establish the informational table of SMEs,
        draw up communication guidelines for business entities, with a focus on developing
         guidelines for SMEs which has resulted in the preparation of this Guide,

         benefits with a special focus on SMEs,
        include strategic issues surrounding SMEs within the curriculum for the training of
         procurement officers.

PPA performs continuous training of contracting authorities22 in accordance with the
professional training program, and it is recommended to do so also for bidders, when
sustainable legal requirements are created.

     e.) Preference for the minimum bid price in relation to the criterion of the most
         economically advantageous offer

One of the key issues for SMEs participation in public procurement procedures is the inability
to be competitive towards high bidders if the selection of the best offers is reduced solely to the
criterion of the lowest price offered. Therefore, it is recommended to make more use of the
option provided by the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender, which ensures
through different elements of criteria that, in addition to the acquisition cost, other important
elements referring to and related to the subject of procurement should be taken into account,
such as: quality, running costs, cost effectiveness, technical and technological benefits, post-
sale servicing and technical assistance, etc.

In this way, contracting authorities have a possibility to carry out the evaluation not only of the
price of a specific subject of public procurement, but also take into account the cost of the life
cycle, which includes the following:

        costs associated to procurement,
        running costs, such as the consumption of energy and other resources,
        maintenance costs,
        costs at the end of the life cycle, such as the cost of collecting and recycling
        costs attributed to external environmental factors associated with the product, service or
         work during their life cycle, provided that their monetary value can be determined and
         checked;
        costs of emissions of greenhouse gases and emissions of other pollutants, and other
         costs of climate change mitigation and
        other costs.

In EU countries, the criterion of the lowest price is normally used as a criterion for selecting the
best offer only exceptionally, when the subject of public procurement are standardized goods,
services or works and it is used more rarely than is the case in our country.

Directive 2014/24/EU has foreseen that the contracting authority may base the award of public
procurement contract on the most economically advantageous tender23, and the lowest price as
a special criterion no longer exists. The Directive has given the possibility that Member States
may stipulate, that the contracting authorities may not solely use the price or the cost as the
only element of the criteria for the award of contracts or may limit its application to certain
categories of contracting authorities or certain types of contract 24. However, this does not mean
that contracting authorities may not determine only the price as an element of the criteria.

The LPP stipulates as the criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender (for contract
awards) the lowest price and the most economically advantageous tender 25. Consequently, in
the practice of the Montenegrin public procurement system the lowest available price is used
more often, on average about 83% (in the period of the last five years), while the criterion of
the most economically advantageous tender was used on average approximately 17%26.

Furthermore, by examining the annual reports on public procurement at the national level, it is
evident that the contracting authorities generally opt for the procurement procedure by
shopping. The reason for this state of facts is a simpler procedure in the sense that the
procurement is conducted by a public procurement official, and shorter deadlines for
submission of tenders. However, in the procurement procedure by shopping, the lowest price is
the only criterion, which causes a high percentage of this criterion in public procurement in
Montenegro.

In contrast to that, the Directive from 2014 stipulates that contracting authorities should base
the award of public procurement on the most economically advantageous tender 27and the
lowest price as a special criterion no longer exists. The countries have been given the
possibility to stipulate that the contracting authorities should not use the price or the cost as the
sole criterion for the award of contracts or may limit its application to certain categories of
contracting authorities or certain types of contract28. However, this does not mean that
contracting authorities cannot determine the price as one of the criteria. The harmonization of
national regulations in public procurement will go in this direction.

                                              f.) Unnecessary administrative burdens

In addition to the above stated, certain administrative burden may also negatively affect the
SMEs. To this end, the forthcoming LPP (whose draft has been completed) to be aligned with
the new directives shall enable substantial relief. In this regard, there is a possibility to prove all
or certain requirements for participation in public procurement procedures with a statement of
the business entity. Directives stipulate that such a document may serve as preliminary
evidence instead of certificates issued by the competent authorities and other evidence,
whereby it is certified that the business entity:

            is not in any of the situations for which the business entity shall be excluded or may be
                excluded from the public procurement procedure,
            meets the capability requirements of business entities,
            if necessary, meets the objective rules and criteria for reducing the number of qualified
                candidates, offers and solutions.
            and other relevant information required by the contracting authority by means of tender
                documentation.

The business entity will deliver a statement in the standard format as part of the offer or
application for qualification in accordance with the tender documentation. If the business entity
relies on the ability of another entity, it is obliged to deliver a special statement containing
information for that entity as part of the offer of application for qualification. A business entity
shall be obliged, at the request of the contracting authority, to submit the required documents or
information stating the issuers of supporting documents, the website for information which can

be accessed electronically, all identification data and the declaration of consent, if applicable,
within a period of not less than eight days of receipt of the request. If it is not possible to do a
check or issue a certificate for the capacity requirements, the public contracting authority shall
require the business entity to deliver all or a part of the supporting documents or evidence,
within a reasonable period, but not less than eight days. The contracting authority is obliged,
before making a decision on the best bid in the public procurement procedure, to ask the bidder
who submitted the most economically advantageous tender to submit the updated supporting
documents, unless they already possess a valid document, within a reasonable period, but not
less than eight days.

If the information or documentation to be delivered by a business entity is incomplete or
incorrect, or appear as such or if certain documents are missing, the public contracting authority
may, while respecting the principle of equal treatment and transparency, demand from these
business entities to supplement, explain and deliver the necessary information or
documentation within a reasonable period of time which may not be less than five days. If the
bidder who submitted the most economically advantageous tender does not submit the updated
documents within the extended deadline or they fail to prove the requirements, the public
contracting authority is obliged to reject the offer of the bidder and opt for the bidder who
submitted the next best offer or annul the procurement procedure, if there are grounds for
annulment. This provision shall not apply when concluding the contract based on the
framework agreement.

In addition to the abovementioned, the forthcoming LPP MN, in order to facilitate and alleviate
the burden, shall stipulate the establishment of the “Register of bidders” which will be
managed by the competent authority, and the most optimal is the PPA. In this way, the register
of bidders would be available on the PPA Portal (website). Those bidders who are registered in
the Register of bidders will have to submit evidence on the fulfilment of the mandatory
requirements for participation in the public procurement procedure. It will suffice to state that
they have been registered in the Register of Bidders.

The Register of Bidders can register all persons who are otherwise registered with the National
Institute of Statistics - MONSTAT or the Commercial Court by submitting documents proving
the fulfilment of the mandatory requirements in pursuance of the Law. When bidders are
registered in the Registry, they do not have to collect the necessary certificates to prove that
they meet the required conditions for participation for each procedure which they are taking
part in. In this way, the participation of bidders and SMEs shall actually be facilitated to the
highest extent.

As regards any changes that arise in connection with the status of bidders, the organizations and
bodies responsible for imposing sanctions and measures that prevent the participation of
persons in the public procurement procedure shall inform the PPA, i.e. the data will be updated
automatically. The Register of Bidders will allow to minimise the administrative difficulties
that bidders and SMEs have in the collection of evidence, so that they can participate in public
procurement procedures in a simpler and cheaper way.

In the EU Member States, enterprises and SMEs find that the greatest barriers to their
participation in public procurement are administrative burdens arising from the need to deliver
a substantial number of certificates or other documents relating to the participation in the
procurement procedure. Therefore, Directive 2014/24/EU has envisaged the limitation of such
requests, through the use of the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD), which
consists of updated statements, and thus significantly simplifies the procedure in favour of the



                                                23
contracting authorities and enterprises.29 Contracting authorities have the right to require the
submission of all documentation or parts of it if they consider it necessary for the proper
implementation of the procedure, at any time. The documentation is required only of bidders
which will be awarded the contract. In addition, the Directive provides that contracting
authorities are not obliged to require documents which are still valid, which they already have
from previous procurement procedures. In addition, the Commission provides and administers
an electronic system of e-Certis. It is an information system that allows the retrieval of various
certificates and attestations that are often required in public procurement procedures in 28 EU
member states, Turkey, Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein. It is a system that allows contracting
authorities and bidders to find out more easily which certificates and certificates are usually
required in public procurement procedures in individual Member States (as well as Turkey,
Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein).

It is enough to enter a description of the required document or search the database using e-
Certis search criteria, including word search. Information in the database are provided by
national authorities and are regularly updated.

                       g.) Delay in payment or non-payment for the work done

Non-payment for work done or the mere existence of a doubt that the payment will not go
through can also affect the SMEs to not participate in the public procurement procedure. If they
are not paid on time or not at all for the contracted delivery of goods, the services rendered or
works performed it may result in the bankruptcy of SMEs or job losses. Therefore, Article 4 of
the Law on Deadlines for the Settlement of Monetary Obligations ("Official Gazette of
Montenegro", no. 28/14 of 04/07/2014) stipulates: "The deadline for the settlement of monetary
obligations between the public sector and business entities is 30 days upon commencement of
the debtor-creditor relationship, and whereas a contract may stipulate a different deadline for
the fulfilment of obligations of the debtor, it cannot be longer than 60 days. If the contract
between the public sector and a business entity does not stipulate a deadline for the settlement
of monetary obligations, the debtor is obliged, without prior warning, to reconcile his financial
obligations within 30 days. If case the debtor is the Health Insurance Fund, or a beneficiary of
the Health Insurance Fund, the contract may provide a longer deadline for the settlement of
financial obligations, but it shall be longer than 90 days. A fine of 1,000 to 10,000 euros shall
be imposed on a legal entity if they fail to settle their financial obligations within the time limits
stipulated by this law (Articles 3 and 4). For a minor offense referred to in paragraph 1 of this
Article a fine ranging from 500 to 2,000 euros shall be imposed on the responsible person
within the legal entity. Supervision of the implementation of this Law shall be conducted by the
administration authority responsible for the identification, collection and control of taxes. The
manner and procedure of exercising control over authorities referred to in paragraph 1 of this
Article shall be stipulated by the Government of Montenegro, Article 9 of the Law".30

In order to protect business activities, especially that of SMEs, in 2011 the EU adopted a new
Directive 2011/7/EU in order to prevent delays in payment which stipulates stricter measures
than the previous one of 2000/35/EC. It is also an integral part of the "Small Business Act".
According to the Directive 2011/7/EU, a deadline for payment of the public sector towards
business entities is 30 days, and only exceptionally this deadline may be 60 days. The EU has
launched a campaign against late payments31 in order to protect jobs, promote growth and
prevent the bankruptcy of SMEs. It was found that the delay in payment or non-payment is the

may significantly affect competition.


     h. Ignorance of procedures on rights protection in public procurement procedures

An important segment for the efficiency of the public procurement system is the procedure of
protection of rights of participants in the procurement process and the public interest, which
can be achieved at all stages of the procurement procedure. The LPP stipulates active
legitimacy in the procurement process. The process of protecting the rights is exercised by
filing an appeal to the SC related to the tender documents and decisions of the contracting
authority32. The complaint may be submitted by a bidder or a stakeholder33.

For the purposes of this topic, practice has shown that SMEs are not able to employ persons
who will monitor the actions of the contracting authorities, prepare bids, monitor the deadlines
for the submission of bids, participate in the public opening of bids, the deadlines for filing
appeals, engage in the process of preparation and submission of complaints against the tender
documents of the contracting authority, or complaints which would repudiate the legality of the
decision of the contracting authority.

In cases when they have employees, they are not sufficiently well-trained to carry out the
mentioned tasks, so the SMEs are forced to engage external experts through legal services,
which increases the price of their product, and has an indirect impact on the amount of public
funds spent.


          i.) High banking costs of financial security in public procurement procedures
                                             (guarantees)

In order to protect itself from unserious bids and violations of public procurement contracts, the
LPP stipulates the duty of the contracting authority that the tender documentation should
establish the obligation of bidders and SMEs to submit bid guarantees, a performance guarantee
for the contract before the conclusion of the contract, advance payment guarantee and other
guarantees for public procurement whose estimated value exceeds 30,000 euros, as well as the
amount of guarantees34. In case of failure to supply a bid guarantee, the bud shall be declared
defective. In case of failure to submit the performance guarantee before the conclusion of the
contact it shall not be possible to conclude it, and in case of breach of contract by the selected
bidder the contracting authority is obliged to activate the given guarantees.

Since the bank guarantee is an instrument for proper execution of obligations under the
contract, i.e. the protection from the risk of default of such obligations, for the issuance thereof
by the bank, it is necessary that the bidder or the SME should previously conclude a contract
with the bank to issue a bank guarantee. The bank shall issue the bidders a bank guarantee to a
certain amount in euros with a term of validity of the tender documents or the contract for
which SMEs claim to have obtained all that is necessary for performance of the contract which
is the subject of guarantee, and that they have also provided the necessary authorizations from
the competent authorities. The guarantee shall be issued on the basis and at the discretion of the

throughout the text of this Guide - Tendering stage.

Bank's bodies. Through its guarantee the Bank undertakes that, in the case its debtor fails to
fulfil an obligation at the time of its maturity, it shall be settled from own funds if the
conditions of the issued guarantees are fulfilled. The benefactor of the bank guarantee is
obliged to duly and timely perform their obligations that make up the subject of the bank
guarantee and inform the Bank of any settled area and the final payment of the obligations for
which the guarantee has been issued. If the bidder fails to execute properly and timely their
obligations, the Bank shall be obliged to pay the issued guarantee to the benefactor. The
business enterprise (the principal), an SME in whose name the guarantee was issued, is
required to pay all the costs to the Bank and interest in accordance with applicable regulations.
When concluding the contract with the Bank, the bidder shall give the authorization to block its
assets in the Bank and with other banks in Montenegro, in order to collect the issued guarantee
which is the subject of the Contract. In case of any enforced collection and damage incurred on
the Bank, such business entities are obliged to settle the obligations. Business entities are
obliged to pay the Bank a fee for the issuance of guarantees and according to the Bank’s tariff
on the issuance of bank guarantees. The contract shall also govern other rights and obligations
of the contracting parties.

This legal requirement in public procurement represents an additional financial burden for
SMEs, and they themselves point out a problem of high costs of financial warranty in public
procurement procedures, they consider that contracting authorities do not need to require
financial guarantees for procurement under 30,000 euros. This would have an impact on the
reduction of their costs and the cost of procurement itself. By acting in that way, the contracting
authorities would provide financial relief to SMEs.


                                   j.) Other burdens for SMEs

The Directorate for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Montenegro point out other
burdens that may be or are a big obstacle to the participation in public procurement of these
entities, and are not directly related to the LPP:


    the complexity of the procedures themselves, the procedure for obtaining permits for
     business for certain activities;
    insufficient or poor services of business support and business consulting, through the
     strengthening of business infrastructure (business centers and incubators);
    lack of advisory information related to establishment and business operation;
    insufficient knowledge and skills to strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs;
    high liquidity and impossibility of debt collection;
    underground economy and unfair competition;
    slow state administration;
    barriers in legal regulations (administration, taxation, customs, issues related to licenses
       and permits);
    inflexible labour market;
    lack of harmonization of the education system and skills to labour market needs,
    long duration of commercial disputes;
    lack of knowledge and modern technology;
    insufficient export orientation;
    inadequate marketing activities and skills,
    insufficient application of international business standards,
    inefficiency in the execution of the contract,


                                                26
    low level of value added in manufacturing;
    barriers at the local level, a large number and the amount of municipal taxes and fees,
     high costs for obtaining authorizations, the complexity of the documents that depend on
     the type of business.

2.6. Analysis of obligations of contracting authorities and the bidders by stages of the public
                                    procurement procedure

Public procurement in the professional literature is not studied only on the basis of the
contract award procedure, but on the basis of the entire public procurement cycle. In this
respect, the public procurement cycle can be observed through three stages: pre-tender stage,
tender stage and post-tender stage.

Each stage of the procedure includes particular steps that the Contracting Authority needs to
follow in preparation and implementation of the public procurement procedure, and the
Bidders and SMEs in preparation of the Bid.

The steps of public procurement depend on the business activity of the contracting authority,
type of a subject of procurement and the type of public procurement procedure. A
comprehensive overview of the steps of public procurement is given on the scheme below.

Obligations of contracting authorities, bidders and SMEs can reviewed for the entire public
procurement cycle and by stages or steps of the public procurement procedure. For the
purpose of providing better information of all parties, introduction to the public procurement
procedure by stages, the text below offers an overview of obligations of contracting
authorities and business entities so that public procurement procedures can be completed
successfully35.




35
     Public Procurement Agency believes that this Guide will be useful to contracting authorities and bidders

                                                               29
                                                        a) Pre-tender stage

In the pre-tender stage of launching of a public procurement procedure, contracting authorities
are obliged to specify the goods, services or works that they intend to procure. The
contracting authorities are obliged to prepare a public procurement procedure which will
enable equality and active competition among potential bidders36. This is particularly
expressed in the preparation of tender documents, definition of technical specifications,
description of the subject of public procurement, eligibility conditions for bidders and the
criteria for the selection of the most advantageous bid37. The basic rule is that contracting
authorities are obliged to provide complete information about the public procurement
procedure and the conditions for awarding contracts, that they are obliged to ensure fair and
active competition among potential bidders so as to allow bidders to prepare their bids on a
competitive basis38.

In preparation of the procedure, contracting authorities choose public procurement procedures
under Article 20 of the Law on Public Procurement, which implies publication of tender
documents and an opportunity for any interested business entity to prepare and submit a bid39.
The contracting authority may choose, as an exception, a negotiated tender procedure without
prior publication of the Invitation to Tender40, which is not open because the tender
documents are provided to particular business entity(s), whereby the contracting authority is
allowed to negotiate financial, technical, administrative or any other aspect of the business
entity's bid. This procedure is applicable only in urgent cases caused by events that
contracting authorities could not influence and foresee41, and the contracting authorities may
implement the procurement procedure by direct agreement42.

   The new Law on Public Procurement will regulate new public procurement procedures and techniques and, thus, there is a possibility for
   direct agreement and shopping to be excluded or replaced by new procedures and techniques of procurement of goods, services or works.

                                                                  30
In this stage, contracting authorities should consider the solutions that exist on the market,
prepare tender documents and technical specification in a clear and precise manner, in
accordance with their objective needs. Unclear technical specifications most often can
discourage SMEs to participate in the specific procedure because they are not sure what the
contracting authority needs to procure exactly and whether they can respond to such needs.

                                                     b) Tender stage

The most advantageous bid is selected in the tender stage. It includes publication or
submission of the tender documents, collection of bids, assessment and evaluation of bids and
contract award. Contracting authorities publish the tender documents on the public
procurement portal of the Public Procurement Agency and in one of daily newspapers, except
for the negotiated procedure without prior publication of the Invitation to Bid. All interested
business entities can, without any compensation and without prior registration on the public
procurement portal44, download the necessary information about launched public procurement
procedures where they can search for:

- public procurement plans of all contracting authorities,
- tender documents, clarifications, changes and/or amendments to tender documents,
- decisions of contracting authorities in the public procurement procedure,
- public procurement contracts,
- individual reports on contracted public procurements by contracting authorities,
- report on contracted public procurements at annual level,
- other information which may be important for SMEs.

Special importance for participation in public procurement procedures for business entities
(SMEs) is attributed to tender documents45 which contain all information needed by SMEs to
decide whether or not they will participate in a public procurement procedure, prepare or not a
bid. The access to the public procurement portal is simple and presented in Figures 1, 2 and 3.

The Law on Public Procurement has regulated deadlines for submission of bids depending on
the type of procedure. The general rule is that the contracting authority sets deadlines in the
tender documents so as to make sure that business entities (SMEs) have enough time to take
all necessary actions, prepare and submit a valid bid.

The manner of preparation of bids, submission of bids by lots, what is considered to be
timely and untimely bid, a bid's validity period, whether it is permitted to submit alternative
bids, whether a bidder appears independently, independently with a sub-contractor, jointly or
jointly with a sub-contractor, the manner of collecting and presenting evidence of fulfilment
of mandatory and optional conditions, other evidence and the form of submission of evidence
is regulated by the Law on Public Procurement46 and, thus, the tender documents of
contracting authorities for a specific procedure and the subject of procurement. Business
entities (SMEs) prepare and submit bids accordingly, within the period set for submission of
bids, which they can, within the period identified for submission of bids, change or amend or
withdraw their bids in writing. Changes and amendments to bids or withdrawal of bids is
submitted in the same manner as the bids. A bid is returned unopened in case of its
withdrawal. For the purpose of better preparation of bids, interested parties (SMEs) have the
right to request from contracting authorities to provide clarification of the tender documents,
depending on the public procurement procedure, within the defined deadline 47, and the
contracting authorities are obliged to send the clarifications of the tender documents to the
applicant and publish them on the public procurement portal within three days from the day
when the request was received. Clarifications of tender documents cannot make changes
and/or amendments to the tender documents and they will make an integral part of the tender
documents.

Business entities (SMEs) can request assistance from the Public Procurement Agency in
relation to vagueness regarding application of the Law on Public Procurement by telephone,
e-mail or by a written request and via the established help-desk which provides advice and
thus encourage their greater involvement in public procurement procedures.

It is important to point out that the Law on Public Procurement does not prohibit a dialogue
between contracting authorities and bidders so as to determine what can be purchased on the
market, whether there are any alternative solutions and how the subject of the procurement
should be sufficiently and properly described. The reason for this is that often even
contracting authorities do not possess the necessary knowledge about the subject of the
procurement, and the most common consequence is that they receive unsuitable bids in the
procedure or contracting authorities do not receive any bids. When a dialogue is established
between a contracting authority and a bidder, it should be kept in mind that actions should be
compliant with the principle of equality and that this is not the way to adjust technical
specifications to an individual bidder. A limited dialogue is permitted if a procedure has been
initiated, but the deadline for submission of bids has not expired, in writing as indicated above
for the purpose of additional clarification of preparation of the bid. This type of
communication is permitted and needed. Very often this is how important clarifications and
assistance is provided to bidders in preparation of acceptable bids. Also, during assessment
and expert evaluation of bids, the contracting authority may ask bidders for certain
clarifications which will help them to evaluate the bids properly. The possibility of a dialogue

between contracting authorities and bidders in certain stages of the public procurement
procedure is permitted under the Law on Public Procurement in a way that the established
dialogue does not distort the main principles of public procurement.

Compared to the previous period, the expenditures incurred in preparation of Bids have been
reduced significantly through the opportunity for the evidence of fulfilment of the conditions
for participation in the public procurement procedure and other required evidence can be
submitted as originals, certified copies, uncertified copies or electronically together with other
requirements as laid down by the Law on Public Procurement48. Current expenditures will be
overcome by the implementation of the new Law on Public Procurement which will lay down
that bidders will submit a certified declaration proving that they fulfil the specified
requirements, and only the selected bidder will submit the required documents verifying
statements made in the declaration.

After submission of bids, within the period defined by tender documents, representatives of
the contracting authority (Commission for Opening and Evaluation of Bids or a public
procurement officer) will perform public opening of bids49, which may be attended by
authorized representatives of bidders. The bidder who revokes or withdraws the bids will not
have the right to attend public opening of bids. The procedure of opening of bids will start at
the indicated time and at the indicated location, not later than one hour upon expiry of the
period for submission of bids, and the contracting authority will prepare Minutes of the
Opening of Bids. The Minutes are made available for consideration, verification of contents
and signing by authorized representatives of bidders, who will be provided with a copy, and
by members of the Commission. The bidders who have not attended the opening will be
provided with the Minutes within three days following the day of opening. After finalization
of the procedure of opening of bids, the bids must not be available to unauthorized persons.

The contracting authority will review, assess, compare and evaluate50 the opened bids
against the conditions and requirements defined by tender documents, without bidders'
participation. Within the assessment procedure, the contracting authority may request from
bidders to provide clarifications so as to eliminate doubts concerning correctness of bids.
Accidental calculation mistakes up to 3%, spelling and typing errors are accepted as
clarifications, and explanations cannot change or amend bids. A bidder is obliged to provide
explanation of his bid within eight days from the day of submission of the request, otherwise
the bid will be rejected as improper. During assessment and evaluation of bids, the contracting
authority may request independent expert assistance, if needed, in accordance with the
requirements he had set. In this stage, the following is mandatory subject of control:
timeliness, form, content, completeness of bids, fulfilment of the conditions concerning
capability and calculation correctness of bids. A bid which is assessed as improper will be
rejected. After the review and assessment, bids are ranked on the basis of the criteria for
selection of the most advantageous bid. All actions in this stage of the procedure are secret
until the moment of disclosure of the decision on the selection of the most advantageous bid
or the decision on dismissal of the procedure. Minutes of the review, assessment and
evaluation of bids are prepared to include analytical overview of requested and submitted
evidence, correctness and admissibility of bids and reasons for exclusion of bids. The

procurement procedure will be issued by the authorized person of the contracting authority
and it will be submitted to bidders not later than three days following the day of issue and
publication on the public procurement portal.

The public procurement procedure will end on the day of effectiveness of the decision on the
most advantageous bid, the Decision on dismissal of the public procurement procedure or the
Decision on annulment of the public procurement procedure. The Decision on the selection of
the most advantageous bid will become enforceable resulting in a contract or a framework
agreement upon the expiry of the standstill period, if a complaint has not been filed, or by
announcement of the decision of the State Commission rejecting or denying the complaint. In
case that the bid validity period has expired, the contract or the framework agreement will be
concluded following a written statement of the bidder on the extension of the bid validity
period and by submission of extended bid guarantee if submission of the bid guarantee was a
condition for tendering. The bidder will be given a suitable period for submission of extended
bid validity period and the bid guarantee. If the selected bidder fails to submit the statement
on extension of the bid validity period and the bid guarantee, withdraws his bid, refuses to
sign the public procurement contract and the framework agreement or fails to submit
performance guarantee as required by tender documents, the contracting authority will repeat
ranking of bids against the selection criteria not taking into consideration the bid of the
selected bidder and decide on the selection of the new most advantageous bid or, if there the
reasons exist, dismiss the public procurement procedure. The Law on Public Procurement
allows bidders to review bids and the course of decision making process after the decision has
been made for the purpose of protection of own rights and public interest.

The contracting authority must not conclude the contract in the standstill period and while
deciding on a complaint unless otherwise regulated by the law, i.e. after the expiry of the
standstill period in case a complaint has not been filed with the State Commission or after the
State Commission has decided to reject the complaint and the decision on the selection of the
most advantageous bid will become final. The contracting authority will conclude a public
procurement contract or a framework agreement with the bidder(s) whose bid has been
selected as the most advantageous one in accordance with the conditions set by tender
documents and the selected bid. If the public procurement contract is concluded contrary to
provisions of the Law on Public Procurement (Article 15 paragraph 5 and Article 18
paragraph 1) regulating anti-corruption rule and the rule on prevention of conflict of interest,
it will be void. In addition to the Law on Public Procurement, provisions of the Act on
Obligations will apply appropriately to the responsibility of contractual parties in relation to
fulfilment of obligations under the public procurement contract.

The protection of the rights of participants in the public procurement procedure and the
public interest in all stages of public procurement will be ensured in a way and under
conditions laid down in the Law on Public Procurement. All interested persons and bidders
will have the right to appeal via the State Commission, in writing or by registered mail, and
electronically if the conditions for submission of electronic documents are met. An appeal is
initiated by the person having legal interest in winning the public procurement contract or the
framework agreement or who suffered or could suffer damage caused by alleged violation of
subjective rights. Appeal may be against: tender documents; decision on the selection of the
most advantageous bid; decision on dismissal of the public procurement procedure; decision
on annulment of the public procurement procedure51.

     Law on Public Procurement of Montenegro, Art. 120 to 143

                                                            35
If the appellant failed to appeal the tender documents in the right stage, he will lose the right
to request review of legality in the later stage for the previous stage.

The appeal will contain the following information and evidence52:

 Name and seat of the appellant, address and contact person
 Name and address, seat of the contracting authority
 Information about tender documents which are subject to the appeal ( number and date of
 publication or submission), or about the decision of the contracting authority (number and
 date of the decision on the selection of the most advantageous bid, dismissal or annulment
 of the public procurement procedure)
 Appeal statements (description of irregularities and explanation)
 Appeal request
 Evidence proving violations (proposed evidence)
 Appeal request
 Signature of the appellant's authorized person

The appeal is accompanied by the evidence that the fee for the implementation of the
procedure has been paid in the estimated amount of up to 1% of the estimated public
procurement value, whereby the amount of the fee must not exceed 8.000 EUR. The fee for
the implementation of the procedure is the income of the budget of Montenegro. If the
decision in the process based on a complaint was made in favour of the appellant, the
contracting authority is obliged to reimburse costs to the appellant within 15 days from the
day of effectiveness of the decision on the complaint. The appellant whose seat is not in the
territory of Montenegro is obliged to designate an attorney to receive notifications in the
territory of Montenegro or determine another way of serving notifications which will not
procrastinate the procedure.

A timely appeal stops any further activities of the contracting party in a public procurement
procedure until the appeal is decided upon. In case of an appeal, the contracting authority may
request approval of continuation of the public procurement procedure, concluding of a public
procurement contract or a framework agreement for the subject of the public procurement or a
part of the subject of public procurement for the reason of: possible persistence of the damage
which is disproportionally larger than the value of the public procurement, protection of
public interest, urgency of procurement and for possible threat to human life and health, or for
other serious hazards or possible damages. The contracting authority must prove or make
probable the circumstances which the request is based on. The request may be filed within
five days from the day of receipt of an appeal, and this request is decided upon by the State
Commission within three days from the day of filing of the request. If the State Commission
accepts the request, the contracting authority is obliged to notify all participants in the
procedure thereon within three days following the day of submission of the decision53.

In a procedure based on appeal, the State Commission decides by a decision and a
conclusion54. The decision of the Commission must be justified. The decisions of the State
Commission are final and the contracting authority is obliged to act in accordance with the

decision and notify the Commission thereon within the specified period. If the contracting
authority fails to implement the decision within a defined period, the State Commission
notifies the Government or the competent authority of the local self-government thereon and
proposes initiation of an accountability procedure. An administrative dispute, i.e. court
protection55, can be initiated against the decision of the State Commission before the
Administrative Court, whereby the legality of the State Commission's decision in the appeal
procedure will be assessed. The appeal to the Administrative Court does not stop concluding
of the public procurement contract. The procedure based on an administrative complaint in
the public procurement case is urgent by nature.

In the appellate procedure, the State Commission may by conclusion: reject an appeal due to
incompetence, inadmissibility, disorderliness, untimeliness, lack of legal interest and because
the appeal was filed by an unauthorized person; dismiss an appellate procedure upon
receiving a written notification from the appellant that he is withdrawing the appeal. By
decision, the State Commission: rejects an appeal as groundless, accepts an appeal and fully
or partially annuls the public procurement procedure and the decision made, indicates to the
contracting authority the irregularities and orders implementation of a new procedure and
decision or taking necessary measures to eliminate such irregularities56. Within the procedure,
the State Commission decides on the requests concerning the costs of procedure.

Although the implementation of the public procurement procedure is finalized by the contract
award, its implementation is an important segment of public procurement. The execution of a
contract concluded on the basis of a public procurement procedure is regulated by the Act on
Obligations. However, the Law on Public Procurement lays down that the inspection
supervision of the implementation of this Act and the secondary legislation adopted
thereunder is performed by a senior public procurement inspector with respect to actions of
contracting authorities, concluding and implementation of public procurement contracts 58. A
special role in monitoring of the implementation of contracts belongs to contracting
authorities which may regulate, in accordance with the organization of work, the procedure of
monitoring of contract implementation, control of instruments of financial security for good
execution of contracts, appeal procedures during contract execution, foreign trade and
customs affairs during the implementation of contracts with international suppliers,
submission of documents for accounting, keeping records on executed contract, archiving of
documents related to contract execution.

Contracting authorities may regulate the procedure which will be linked with other internal
documents and standards of the contracting authorities, and linked with external documents as
well (Law on Public Procurement, Law on Obligations, Law on Foreign Trade, Law on
Taxes, Law on Construction of Buildings and other provisions related to a subject of a public
procurement and standards), regulate accountability and powers to monitor execution of
public procurement contracts, rules of communication with the other contractual party
regarding contract execution, submission of concluded contracts and the required documents,
designating persons responsible for monitoring public procurement contracts, drafting of
decisions and notifications for establishing commissions for monitoring contract execution,
receiving goods, services and works, procedure of control and implementation of financial
security, objections concerning contract execution, actions taken in case that eliminating of
errors is needed within the warranty period, receiving and verification of invoices and other
documents for payment and accounting, and submission of complete documents to the
accounting and finance department/unit, register of public procurement contracts, keeping and
archiving documents concerning public procurements.

Execution of contracts is monitored by controlling invoices as an element of the "good
financial practice" and the system of registering of customers' complaints as an element of the
"good administrative practice".

        4.1. Documents of the European Commission facilitating SMEs in public procurements
                  and the role of the European Parliament in the development of SMEs
    Having in mind the importance of SMEs, the European Commission passed the act in 2008
    stipulating that public procurements should be more adjusted to the needs of SMEs.
    Contracting Authorities should be encouraged to use the Code of Best Practices from the
    Working Paper of the Commission of 25 June 2008 titled the "European Code of Best
    Practices Facilitating Access by SMEs to Public Procurement Contracts", which foresees a
    set of measures; in general, they are the following principles:

        1.                                                                                                 C
             reate an environment in which entrepreneurs and family businesses can thrive and
             entrepreneurship is rewarded;
        2.                                                                                                 E
             nsure that honest entrepreneurs who have faced bankruptcy quickly get a second
             chance;
        3.                                                                                                 D
             esign rules according to the "Think Small First" principle;
        4.                                                                                                 M
             ake public administrations responsive to SMEs' needs;
        5.                                                                                                 A
            dapt public policy tools to SME needs: facilitate SMEs' participation in public
            procurement and better use State Aid possibilities for SMEs;
        6. Facilitate SMEs' access to finance and develop a legal and business environment
            supportive to timely payments in commercial transactions;
        7. Help SMEs to benefit more from the opportunities offered by the Single Market;
        8. Promote the upgrading of skills in SMEs and all forms of innovation;
        9. Enable SMEs to turn environmental challenges into opportunities;
        10. Encourage and support SMEs to benefit from the growth of markets.

    Within the fifth principle, as one of important pillars, it is foreseen that countries should
    facilitate SMEs' participation in public procurement procedures by:

                                                      43
     a) setting up electronic portals to publish information on public procurement;
     b) encouraging contracting authorities to subdivide contracts into lots where it is
        appropriate and to make opportunities to participate in joint bids and bids with
        subcontractors visible;
     c) reminding contracting authorities of their obligation to avoid disproportionate
        qualification (economic and financial ability, professional and technical equipment and
        staffing);
     d) encourage dialogue and mutual understanding between SMEs and large contracting
        authorities (buyers) through activities such as information, training, monitoring and
        exchange of good practice.

Back in 1983, the European Parliament declared the "Year of Small and Medium Enterprises
and Turnover" and launched a number of initiatives to encourage their development. Since
then, the Parliament has been demonstrating its commitment to encouraging the SMEs
development in Europe, so a number of Resolutions have been adopted in the past period.59

In June 2010, the Parliament passed the Resolution on the Community Innovation Policy in a
Changing World. In this Resolution, the Parliament emphasizes the need to create conditions
in which risk capital will be more available to SMEs. It also invites to development of
instruments for financing of SMEs such as micro credits, entrepreneurship capital for those
who want to invest in innovative enterprises, and investments by "business angels" who are
interested in sponsoring business projects of young researchers. The Parliament also invites
Member States and the Commission to create tax, financial, business and administrative
incentives for investments.

In March 2011, the Parliament passed the Resolution on an Industrial Policy for the
Globalisation Era. This Resolution, inter alia, invites the Commission to continue
implementing the Small Business Act so as to alleviate administrative burden and ensure a
better access to funding opportunities for SMEs. It also invites to updating of the definition of
SMEs to allow broader flexibility in individual industrial sectors. Also, the Parliament appeals
to the Commission to increase SMEs' participation in the framework research and
development programmes.

In May 2011, the Parliament passed the Resolution on the Small Business Act Revision. In
this Resolution, the Parliament, inter alia, invites Member States to adopt the last remaining
proposal of the Statute of the European Private Trade Society. It highlights the concern due to
the fact that the test of influence of legislation on SMEs is applied properly and consistently
in all new legislative proposals, particularly at national level. In addition, the Parliament is
warning Member States of "excessively devoted" passing of regulations which go beyond the
requirements of the EU acquis in transposition of Directives into national legislation.

In October 2012, the Parliament passed the Resolution on "small and medium-sized
enterprises: competitiveness and business opportunities". This Resolution highlights a
number of areas including alleviation of administrative burden, supporting competitiveness
and job creation, starting new innovative enterprises (start-ups) and access to information and
financing.

In January 2014, the Parliament passed the Resolution on reindustrialization of Europe to
promote competitiveness and sustainability highlighting the importance of SMEs in the EU
economy and invites to provision of special support and assistance to SMEs.

               4.2. Strategic documents for the development of SMEs in Montenegro

The Strategy for Development of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises for the period 2010-
201560 establishes the framework, goals, priorities and measures for better development of
small and medium-sized enterprises. The European Code of Best Practice for facilitating
SMEs' access to public procurement contracts, which represents the framework of the policy
for the development of small enterprises in the EU is, to a large extent, included in the
Strategy.

As one of priority measures, this Strategy foresees improvement of conditions for the
participation of SMEs in public procurements, facilitating better access to SMEs, better
awareness of various aspects of participation in public procurement procedures and reduced
administrative barriers to their participation in public procurement procedures in the public
sector.

Also, improved transparency, efficiency, better flow of information and following up on
current trends related to green procurements, socially responsible procurements, innovative
procurements, e-procurements and support to SMEs are some of the objectives of the Strategy
for Development of the Public Procurement System of Montenegro for the period 2016-
202061.

The Action Plan implementing the Strategy for Development of the Public Procurement
System for the period 2016-2020, the Montenegro's Programme of Accession to the European
Union for the period 2017-2018 (MPAEU62), the Work Programme of the Public Procurement
Agency63 foresee activities with regard to management of environmental protection, energy
efficiency, social requirements and a wider access for SMEs. The following activities are
planned in that respect:

     1.   Harmonization of public procurement legislation with new Directives in this field
          from 2014, promotion of importance of use of green, social and innovative public
          procurement and access for SMEs;
     2.   Training of contracting authorities to create a subject of public procurement to
          facilitate better access by SMEs;
     3.   Establishing a platform for exchange of experiences, information and knowledge
          between contracting authorities;
     4.   Training of SMEs so as to improve their capabilities in public procurements;
     5.   Encouraging larger application of criteria of the most economically advantageous bid
          to create conditions for innovation in public procurement, higher employment and
          development of SMEs;
     6.   Reducing formalities for proving the fulfilment of conditions for participation in
          public procurements by submitting a statement instead of documents;

      7.    Setting up a register of suppliers to establish a single, central, electronic and public
            database of suppliers who meet the conditions for participation in public procurement
            procedures;
      8.    Analysis of effects of substantial reduction of the fee for implementation of the
            procedure in relation to the protection of the rights in order to create more favourable
            conditions for SMEs;
      9.    Encouragement to discontinue the obligation to pay fees for obtaining various
            confirmations, certificates, etc. in order to simplify business operations of SMEs in
            preparation of evidence documents regarding solvency for participation in tenders;
      10.   Encouraging contracting authorities to implement procurements by lots for easier
            access by SMEs;
      11.   Strengthening consultation process in preparation of procurements, "bottom-up"
            meetings with focus groups at local and regional levels;
      12.   Strengthening administrative capacities of contracting authorities, professionalism of
            members of the Commission for Opening and Evaluation of Bids and of public
            procurements officers and specialists for subjects of public procurements;
      13.   Strengthening of open access to information about tender documents, bids and
            contracts, etc.
      14.   Preparation of training materials, manuals, guidelines and other instructions for
            implementation of the new law and secondary legislation for contracting authorities
            and bidders, informing officers about the implementation of new Directives in the EU
            Member States;
      15.   Development of communication guidelines for business entities in order to understand
            the benefits that the national economy may have from participation of SMEs in public
            procurement procedures;
      16.   etc.

In June 2015, Montenegro became a full member of the WTO Agreement of Government
Procurement (GPA64) which improves market access through fair competition in tendering,
transparency of procedures and inclusion in the field of global procurement market. The
objective of this Agreement is the largest openness possible towards international market and
competition and, on the other hand, a guarantee of the necessary transparency and
commitment to good governance. Therefore, joining this Agreement is a solution for gaining a
safe and lawful access to public procurement market, the value of which is estimated at 1.7
trillion dollars a year, which will certainly grow over time. The Agreement is a very important
tool which facilitates SMEs' access to international market.
On the basis of the above strategic documents and programmes of Montenegro, it is obvious
that enhanced SMEs' access to public procurement market extends in two directions:

       1. Creating conditions for contracting authorities to implement procurements with
          minimum administrative efforts for the purpose of ensuring the best value for money
          and ensuring transparency and integrity of the process;
       2. Enhancing easy SMEs' access to public procurement market by providing them with a
          fair and equal treatment and promoting competition which is based on the quality and
          price at the level of Montenegro and the market of GPA members.

              4.3.    Institutional framework for public procurements in Montenegro

The Law on Public Procurement established institutions which are responsible for its
implementation in Montenegro. The public procurement system is under the competence of
the Ministry of Finance, which cooperates with other competent authorities in this field in
preparation of draft laws, other regulations and general acts, proposes to the Government
development strategies and other measures in the field of public procurements, supervises
implementation of the law.

The Public Procurement Agency performs administrative and related professional tasks in the
field of public procurements and it is competent for training and professional development in
public procurements; the State Commission ensures protection of rights of bidders and public
interest in public procurement procedure, and inspection supervision of the implementation of
the Law on Public Procurement and regulations adopted thereunder is performed by the
Administration for Inspection Affairs, which includes a public procurement inspector. The
state administration authorities which are indirectly linked to public procurements are: State
Audit Institution, Agency for Prevention of Corruption, Administrative Court, Misdemeanour
Court, Police Directorate, Judicial Council, Supreme State Prosecutor's Office and other
Government authorities.




At the beginning of 2016, the Government of Montenegro formed a Coordination Body for
continuous monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy for Development of the Public
Procurement System in Montenegro for the period 2016-2020 for the purpose of collecting,
monitoring and analyzing of data on measures undertaken in the field of public procurements,
and implementation of measures from the Action Plan.65

                                    4.4.1. Existing legislative framework

The regulations in the field of public procurements in Montenegro are based on the
Constitution and the Law on Public Procurement. The applicable Law on Public Procurement
(Official Gazette of Montenegro 42/11, 57/14 and 28/15) regulates public procurement
procedures in which contracting authorities and bidders conclude procurement contracts,
competences of the Public Procurement Agency, the State Commission and public
procurement inspectors and other matters. The Ministry of Finance has adopted a set of
rulebooks under the Law on Public Procurement for the purpose of its implementation.66
                                    Rulebook on the Records of Public Procurement Procedures;
 Law on Public                      Rulebook on the Manner of Keeping and the Content of Records on Violation of Anti-Corruption
                                     Rules;
 Procurement                        Rulebook on Forms in Public Procurement Procedures;
                                    Rulebook on the Methodology of Expression of Sub-criteria for the Selection of the Most
                                     Advantageous Bid in Public Procurement Procedure;
                                    Rulebook on the Methodology for Determining Computational Errors in Public Procurement
                                     Procedure;
                                    Rulebook on Detailed Criteria for Training of the Commission for Opening and Evaluation of Bids;
                                    Rulebook on the Risk Analysis Methodology in Performing Control in Public Procurement
                                     Procedures;
                                    Rulebook on the Methodology for Determining Energy Efficiency Level in Public Procurement
                                     Procedures;

The Law on Public Procurement of Montenegro is largely harmonized with Directive
2004/17/EC, Directive 2004/18/EC, Directive 2007/66/EC, Directive 2009/81/EC. Entry into
force of Directive 2014/23/EC, Directive 2014/24/EC, Directive 2014/25/EC repealed
Directives of 2004. The next obligation of Montenegro as the country aspiring to join the EU
is the implementation of new Directives into national legislation and implementation of
provisions relating to a common procurement vocabulary (CPV), standard forms for
publishing notices within public procurement procedures, decree concerning application of
price classes/limit values on contract award procedures. In that respect, the position of our
country will follow through drafting of the new Law on Public Procurement.67

In addition to harmonization of public procurement regulations with the EU acquis,
Montenegro needs to consider other regulations which directly or indirectly influence efficient
implementation of public procurement procedures (Law on General Administrative
Procedure, Law on Inspection Supervision, Law on the System of Internal Financial Controls
in Public Sector, Budget Law, Law on Business Organisations, Law on Public Services and
Utilities and other laws regulating water management, energy, transportation and postal
services, laws regulating defence and security, Law on Obligations, Law on Misdemeanours,
Criminal Code, Law on the Protection of Competition, Law on Internal Trade, Law on
Foreign Trade, Law on Electronic Signature, Law on Electronic Document, Law on E-Trade,
Law on Information Security, Law on Electronic Communications).

Montenegrin regulations governing confidential procurements, keeping confidential data,
initiating and implementation of bankruptcy and liquidation, implementation of technical
standards for accessibility for persons with disabilities, proving fulfilment of mandatory
conditions in public procurement procedures, proving fulfilment of optional conditions
concerning economic and financial ability of business entities, proving professional and
technical and staffing conditions in procurement procedures for goods, services and works,
proving the quality of the subject of procurement (certificates, licences and other evidence),
VAT and other taxes, keeping documents and other regulations should be considered as well.
Special importance for the public procurement process is attributed to special legislation
relating to the activity of subjects of the Law on Public Procurement and the legislation linked
to the subject of public procurement68.

                      4.4.2. Drafting of new public procurement regulations

For the purpose of strengthening of the national public procurement system, Montenegro will
work in the next period on drafting of the new Law on Public Procurement supported by the
EU Directives (2014) so as to ensure better performance for SMEs at the system level. This
document elaborates topics and thus presents how the European legal framework and the EU

5. MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE PUBLIC PROCUREMENT
    SYSTEM IN MONTENEGRO
By adopting two important documents (Strategy for Development of Small and Medium Sized
Enterprises and the Strategy for Development of the Public Procurement System) the
Government of Montenegro seeks to eliminate restrictions in SMEs' development, strengthen
regulations, eliminate administrative barriers, enhance access to available sources of funds,
sources of business and market information, raise the level of business knowledge, and greater
participation of SMEs in public procurement procedures. Clear measures and policies which
are considered to be the best practice for assistance, promotion, encouragement or facilitating
of SMEs' participation in public procurements in Montenegro have been identified.

The Strategy for Development of the Public Procurement System in Montenegro for the
period 2016-2020 offers a detailed overview of weaknesses and specific solutions have been
proposed to facilitate SMEs' participation, further establishment of the best practice at
national level, at the level of local self-government units and subjects of the Law on Public
Procurement.

 5.1.  Measures for improving the SMEs' participation in public procurements at
     national level

Specific measures which are proposed are general by nature (apply to all Bidders), while
some of them apply only on SMEs, are incorporated or will be incorporated into national
legislation in the near future. These measures include matters such as:

   A possibility to sub-divide the subject of public procurement into lots does not
    represent a barrier to SMEs (Directives - Bidders encourage subdivision of the subject
    of procurement into lots, and when that is not possible, bidders must highlight reasons
    why they are not doing so. Subdivision of public contracts into lots facilitates access to
    SMEs, both in quantitative (size of lots can be better suited to production capacities of
    SMEs) and qualitative terms (the content of lots can be more suitable to a specialized
    sector of SMEs). To avoid that subdivision is performed in order to or with the effect of
    avoiding of compliance with provisions on thresholds (subdivision of contracts into lots
    could determine that every lot is below applicable price classes or thresholds), it needs
    to be prescribed that the total estimated value of all lots is taken into account. When the
    aggregated value of lots is equal or above the threshold prescribed by legislation, the
    Law on Public Procurement will apply to every lot).
   Establishing a possibility of limitation of the size of contracts so that the contracts
    are subdivided into lots (Montenegro will consider the opportunity provided under
    Directives concerning the establishment of the policy to encourage opportunities for
    contracting authorities to reduce the size of contracts in a non-binding manner to
    ensure that SMEs have sufficient opportunities to participate in public procurements or
    to prohibit consolidation of contracts which would minimize opportunities for SMEs'
    participation, or to request from contracting authorities to conduct researches and
    analyses so as to ensure that local SMEs have sufficient opportunities).
   Possibilities of subcontracting, submission of Bids with subcontractors encourage
    SMEs to benefit from the contracts which are awarded to larger companies. (The Law
    on Public Procurement allows subcontracting of maximum 30% of the value of

                                              50
    contracts. Some countries have general provision on subcontracting which could result
    in a higher degree of subcontracting by SMEs. These provisions are aimed at, for
    example, guaranteeing that subcontractors are paid fully and timely, by prescribing that
    the Contracting Authority may transfer, on the request of the subcontractor and where
    permitted by the nature of the contract, received payments directly to subcontractors for
    the services provided, goods supplied or works executed for the Bidder who was
    awarded a public contract (main contractor). In general, Montenegro encourages
    subcontracting with SMEs, for example through the Directorate for Development of
    Small and Medium Sized Enterprises, UP, MBA and the Chamber of Commerce of
    Montenegro, but there are neither incentives nor specific goals have been set).
   A possibility to submit joint Bids allows and encourages joint competition in order
    to allow SMEs to cooperate with each other, with larger companies within a larger
    tender. (Some countries have general measures which facilitate participation of SMEs
    through joint tendering, which are not specifically designed for SMEs. This could be
    done, for example, by improved visibility of SMEs, broadening opportunities for
    networking of SMEs and by extending the scope of the market; provision of advisory
    assistance or training programmes for SMEs; simplification of qualification procedures.
    Also, the initiatives which offer early visibility of public procurement activities, such as
    publication of annual procurement plans, offer possibilities to SMEs to consider and
    discuss their options for joint tendering. Some countries encourage participation of
    SMEs in joint tendering by allowing them to rely on economic and financial capacities
    of other companies. Some countries request from their contracting authorities to seek to
    broaden opportunities for SMEs by taking into account joining in public procurements).
   Simplification of qualifications requirements (further improvement of legislative
    framework in accordance with new Directives will influence the reduction of
    unnecessary, or simplification of, qualification requirements, mandatory conditions or
    financial conditions so as to reduce administrative burden, which significantly hinders
    participation of SMEs. Some countries prescribe that minimum annual turnover which
    Bidder may be requested to present must not exceed double the estimated value, except
    in duly justified cases such as the cases relating to special risks concerning the nature of
    works, services or goods where the requested turnover may be set higher. The
    contracting authority must list the main reasons for such condition in the public
    procurement documents);
   Setting up timely payment of supplies so as to ensure financial sustainability of SMEs
    (most countries have requests concerning timely payment of deliveries of goods and
    services which apply either to contracts in general or specifically to contracts which
    include SMEs. These measures range from advance payment to payment within
    determined timeframes following the completion of either the whole contract or a part
    thereof, or the request that the contracting authority is informed about specific
    payments in case of subcontracting);
   Further advancement of transparency so as to facilitate SMEs' access to relevant
    information (transparency and access to information on public procurements are among
    the main objectives of procurement policies and such objectives are considered to
    benefit all bidders, including SMEs. In addition to the service for provision of general
    information, which has already been set up, some countries maintain special portals
    which either allow SMEs to seek procurement opportunities or facilitate contracting
    authorities to identify potential contractors from small business sector which are
    relevant for SMEs' participation in Government procurements. Some countries maintain
    the List of Interested Bidders which allows enterprises to add the name of their
    company and contact information to the publicly available list of bidders which have

                                             51
    expressed interest in a particular tender published on its e-portal for tenders. Other
    countries maintain the list of contractors such as the above list: in order to simplify the
    qualification procedure for tendering for public works, a party maintains and manages
    the approved list of contractors for selective tendering. Some countries offer free
    internet-based service which allows SMEs to view and respond to information about
    their current abilities to compete at Government tenders and promote open and fair
    competition in public sector. Other measures for enhancing transparency include
    publishing of annual procurement plans which allow businesses early visibility of
    procurement activities which authorities plan to implement in the next 12 months).
   Introduction of specific programmes or measures which offer advantage (mainly
    local) to SMEs in tendering procedures such as reserved contracts (some countries
    have legislation under which contracts are reserved for SMEs if:
   that is in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing full production capacities of the
    country,
   that is in the interest of war or national defence programmes,
   that is in the interest of making sure that a fair percentage of total procurements and
    contracts for assets or services for the Government in every industrial category assigned
    to small business concerns, or
   that is in the interest of making sure that a fair percentage of the total Government assets
    on sale sold to small business concerns.
   In such cases, procurements above simplified purchase thresholds will be reserved for
    small businesses when there are justified expectations that at least two responsible small
    businesses will submit their Bids in procurement and that the award will be conducted at
    fair market prices. In addition, legislation prescribes programmes targeted at specific
    small businesses – Programme for small business owned by women, Programme for
    concerns of small businesses owned by war veterans or persons with disabilities and the
    Programme for historically underused business zones. Some countries foresee that
    Contracting Authorities are obliged to provide SMEs with broader opportunities for
    receiving orders when such Authorities implement procurements. For this purpose, there
    is a list of particular products directly produced and supplied by SMEs and which needs
    expanding on the market as the products for competition among small and medium-
    sized enterprises. Contracting Authorities are obliged to conclude procurement contracts
    for competitive products through restricted tendering intended only for small and
    medium-sized enterprises or a particular competition between the invited SMEs. In
    addition, for the purpose of increasing direct purchase of construction material produced
    by SMEs, measures are taken to increase purchase of construction material designated
    as competitive products;
   Entrepreneurship education and training - the country must cherish entrepreneurship
    spirit and new skills from the early age. General knowledge of conducting business
    activities and entrepreneurship should be acquired at all levels of education. Specific
    educational models related to business should become an integral part of curricula in
    secondary and higher education. Entrepreneurship undertakings by the youngest should
    be encouraged and promoted and suitable training programmes for managers in small
    enterprises should be developed.
   Better legislation and regulations - national bankruptcy legislation should be
    reassessed in the light of good practice. Learning through setting benchmarks should
    result in improvement of the practice existing in Montenegro. New regulations at
    national level and the level of local communities should be analyzed with respect to
    their influence on small enterprises and entrepreneurs. Wherever possible, both national
    and local communities' rules should be simplified. Small enterprises should potentially

                                             52
      be spared from particular regulatory obligations. In this context, Montenegro should
      simplify the legislation concerning competition so as to cut down on the compliance
      obligation for small enterprises.
    Availability of skills - seek to make sure that the institutions which provide training
      allow, together with training programmes, adequate availability of skills which are
      adjusted to the needs of small enterprises and ensure permanent training and
      consultations.
    Better internet access - authorities should be appealed to increase the level of
      electronic communication with the sector of small enterprises. In this way, enterprises
      will be able to receive advice, file requests, tax returns or simply obtain information via
      the internet more quickly and more cheaply.
    Better use of advantages of a single market - small enterprises are already
      experiencing certain benefits of the reforms being implemented in the Montenegrin
      economy. Montenegro should continue the reforms it has initiated so as to establish a
      genuine internal market which is inclined to small enterprises in critical areas of the
      development of small enterprises, including e-trade, telecommunications, utilities,
      public procurements and transboundary payment system.
    Taxation and financial matters - the taxation system should be adjusted so that it
      rewards success, encourages setting-up and expanding of small enterprises and creating
      of new jobs, and facilitates creating and succession of small enterprises. Member States
      should apply the best practice in taxation and encouraging of personal performance.
      Entrepreneurs need funds to turn their ambitions into reality.
    Strengthening technological capacities of small enterprises - strengthen existing
      programmes for promotion of expanding of technologies towards small enterprises and
      capacities of small enterprises to identify, select and adjust technologies. Invest in
      cooperation and exchange in the field of technology between enterprises of varying size,
      and particularly between European small enterprises, develop more efficient research
      programmes for commercial application of knowledge and technologies, and develop
      and adjust systems of quality and certification for small enterprises.
    Successful models of e-business and the first-class support to small enterprises -
      Montenegro should encourage small enterprises to apply the best practice and adopt
      business models which allow them to truly thrive in the new economy.
    Developing a better and more efficient representation of interests of small
      enterprises at national and local level - review manners in which interests of small
      enterprises are represented at national level, including a social dialogue.
    Exchange of good practice - the EU Commission published the "Good Practice"
      guides aimed at dissemination of good practice and encouraging the exchange of
      experiences in Europe and this material is a good tool for SMEs.
Montenegro must adjust public policy instruments to the needs of SMEs. It also must use the
Code of Best Practice which provides guidelines to contractors as to how to apply the EU
public procurement framework in the way which will facilitate SMEs' participation in public
procurement procedures. For SMEs to address the market failure that follows them during
their existence, they must make a better use of opportunities offered to them by state aid
regulations for supporting start-ups and providing incentives for SMEs.

SMEs face barriers to participation on public procurement markets, which account for 16% of
GDP in Europe, while they account for around 13% of GDP in Montenegro often due to the
lack of awareness of small enterprises of opportunities and/or because they are discouraged by
procedures, and because state authorities feel safer to contract particular works with large
enterprises with certain experience than with young innovative enterprises. Besides this, 42%

                                               53
of the total value of public procurement above the EU threshold in 2015 were awarded to
small and medium-sized enterprises. However, further substantial efforts are needed to
eliminate the remaining obstacles to SMEs' access to public procurement markets, particularly
through reduction of the requirements set by contracting authorities in the contract award
procedure.

In addition to the above comparative practice which is partly represented in the national
legislation, Montenegro will seek in the forthcoming period to improve legislative framework
for public procurements and its consistent enforcement, improve electronic public
procurements, establish a register of qualified Bidders, establish a one-stop shop for collecting
the documents needed in public procurement procedure, improve legal and procedural
framework for higher participation of SMEs, identify higher responsibility of institutions -
contracting authorities, offer an opportunity to introduce joint ventures for the purpose of
higher participation of SMEs, encourage joint appearance of SMEs, introduce simpler
opportunities for procurements up to a certain value that the law does not apply to so as to
encourage SMEs at local level, introduce proportionality of conditions for qualification of
business entities, then standardized documents - Statement of Businesses, strengthen
cooperation between the Public Procurement Agency and other Government authorities aimed
at exchange of information, continuous monitoring of SMEs' participation in public
procurements and their reform.

In order to enhance participation of SMEs, Montenegro will strengthen administrative
capacities of institutions, work on collecting and disseminating information about
procurements, strengthen Help Desk of the Public Procurement Agency, study factors
influencing SMEs' participation, study reasons for bidders' failure, strengthen training of
contracting authorities and bidders, work on drafting of manuals, brochures and guidelines,
organize conferences, public procurement fairs with contracting authorities and SMEs so as to
encourage networking and better access to opportunities, develop a sustainable training
programme for bidders and training methodologies, influence building capacities of
institutions which control execution of contracts.

     5.2. Measures for enhancing SMEs' participation in public procurements at local level

The measures for enhancing SMEs' participation at the level of local self-government should
be adjusted to territorial division. Unlike other countries of the region, the system of local
self-government in Montenegro is a single-stage one, with the municipality as the main
territorial local self-government unit69, while the country is divided into three regions for the
purpose of regional development policy: coastal, central and northern. Montenegro has 23
municipalities (including the Capital and the Old Royal Capital), and two urban
municipalities are organized within the Capital Podgorica - Golubovci and Tuzi. All local
self-government units are subjects to the implementation of the Law on Public Procurement,
as well as the business established by local self-government units.

In accordance with such territorial division, the needs for procurement of particular goods,
works and services during one year and SMEs' development can be observed.

                                                  54
In 201670, the analysis of public procurement plans of local self-governments uploaded on the
public procurement portal showed that they planned procurement of goods, services and
works of the total value of 55.871.205,00 EUR.

In 2016, local self-government units contracted the total of 24.965.671,06 EUR or 44,68% of
the planned value whereby they implemented public procurement procedures under Article 20
of the Law on Public Procurement and concluded 540 contracts in total and received 1.195
Bids of which contracting authorities rejected 7 and refused 170 bids. Then they implemented
3.099 procurement procedures by direct agreement of the total value of 1.616.967,18 EUR.

Given the not so low contracted value of public procurements at local level, it can be
concluded that public procurements determine substantially the economic development and
employment, and constitute a source of further development of private sector, market
economy and the overall economic development at the level of local communities.

Therefore, local self-governments71 should stimulate SMEs to participate in public
procurements, particularly small family business which have no opportunities to compete in
remote areas, regulate public procurement system from their own budget and the budget of the
enterprises they established. It is also particularly important when it comes to the funds
supporting the programmes and projects funded by the European Funds and other
international organisations.

In relation to this, local self-governments need to implement certain activities in order to
promote SMEs sector and build a favourable business environment so as to:

      create a favourable regulatory environment (policy change?),
      ensure infrastructure that is "working" (drains/landfills/roads... etc.),
      strengthen vocational education and create skilled workforce to allow SMEs to reach
       workers with appropriate qualifications (cooperation with schools),
      support SMEs to obtain funds,
      plan, initiate and implement public procurements for local self-governments in a way to
       involve more SMEs.

Most local self-governments in Montenegro are developing cooperation with schools and
other professional centres, provide support to training programmes so that SMEs and
entrepreneurs are provided with available qualified workers in order to meet the market
requirements and improve competitiveness. Also, these need to be strengthened and adjusted
to the future demand for particular qualifications and occupations.

Local self-governments can encourage the development of sectors and clusters by:

      implementing the sector analysis - "learn what the sector wants" - learn what their
       challenges are,
      promoting cluster development,
      building of common centres (CFCs).

crisis


                                                        55
Furthermore, local self-governments should reassess ways of cooperation with national funds
and the relevant central government authorities when developing and implementing such
programmes. Harmonization of local, regional and national policy and plans for the
development of SMEs is itself the development and offer the local self-government an
opportunity to ensure additional resources.

Local self-governments, independently or in cooperation with national authorities or donors,
can influence the SMEs' development by:

    Obtaining funds: from private sector (for example, banks) by providing assistance in
     drafting business plans or a specific request for funds.
    Provision of construction land and business premises: at acceptable price (many
     offices for local economic development keep records of available construction land and
     business premises and market them to attract enterprises to conduct their business
     activities in their territories).
    Promoting products and services of SMEs: conduct market survey so as to assist
     SMEs in promoting products and adjusting to the requirements of customers (many
     local self-governments will promote local products and services outside their borders as
     well). Local self-governments often provide support to SMEs in the process of obtaining
     international certificates in accordance with international standards which allow them to
     access new markets.
    Promoting a municipality/town for incoming investments: marketing efforts and
     branding aimed at attracting investments and small and medium-sized enterprises to the
     local self-government; this is often done by local self-government in cooperation with
     small and medium-sized enterprises and other interested parties which represent the
     local area.
    Establishing a network of SMEs: industrial groups, associations and networks are
     valuable for the exchange of ideas and for group dissemination of improved procedures
     and technological advancement.
    Cooperation with regional and central authorities: local self-government may also
     lobby regional and central authorities to change policies, rules and regulations which are
     the competence of higher levels of the Government.

  5.3. Strengthening the public procurement system at the local self-government level

As already mentioned, local self-government units contracted public procurements in the
value of 24.965.671,06 EUR in 2016. Thereby, local self-government units, including local
public enterprises and institutions, are by default the most important buyers for local
suppliers, particularly in smaller municipalities where these contracting authorities constitute
dominant buyers for local enterprises. Therefore, procurements by local governments overall
(i.e. in terms of what is to be procured, in what way and at what prices) are often crucial for
determining economic development and employment in a given municipality.

Especially today, at the time of substantial general drop of demand which affects adversely
business operations of enterprises and employment, public procurements are particularly
important. Therefore, discrimination in public procurements may seriously endanger the
development of local enterprises, particularly small family businesses which have no
opportunities to compete in remote areas. Also, irregularities and "fixing" of tenders are easily
discovered in local environments which prevents building of a regulated system and deepens
social differences. In addition, the programmes and projects of assistance which are funded

                                               56
from the European funds are approved only to those local self-governments which have
established reliable systems of monitoring of public procurement expenditures, and modern
systems for management and control of project implementation.

Therefore, public procurements should be serve the implementation of strategic goals of local
self-governments such as economic development, employment, particularly in the segments
where incentives are common in highly developed countries as well, such as small and
medium-sized enterprises, for example. Enhancing of public procurements allows
implementation of other strategic goals of local self-governments such as:

      neutralizing adverse effects of the economic crisis,
      attracting of foreign investments,
      development of local economy,
      employment, etc.

For public procurements to become an effective instrument in the hands of local self-
governments which they use to encourage economic and social development, a defined goal
needs to be the "optimum combination of total costs of life cycle of procured products,
services and works and the total benefits of meeting the needs of contracting authorities". A
comprehensive definition of the goal allows including of any costs related to the subject of
procurement incurred during its exploitation (for instance, energy consumption,
malfunctioning and servicing costs, etc.) on the one hand, and any positive effects for local
self-government such as employment effects, strengthening of competitiveness of local
enterprises, etc. which bring benefits in the longer run. All of these factors must be taken into
account when deciding on a public procurement instead of using merely the simplest criterion,
which is the minimum bid price.

In terms of further development, specific goals of enhancing public procurements in local
self-governments would be:

      the services provided to citizens in local self-governments should be provided at lower
       prices and their quality should be higher;
      to create conditions for higher participation of SMEs in tenders in local self-
       governments and, at the same time, encourage economic development of local self-
       governments and strengthen competition;
      to increase the economy and efficiency of public procurements at local level by
       consolidating procurements where economically justified and strengthening of
       organisational and professional capacities of contracting authorities to implement
       procurements by putting in place organisational units for public procurements
       (procurement units) and public procurement officers;
      to reduce irregularities in implemented tenders by disseminating good practice;
      more efficient monitoring and controlling of public procurement procedures at the
       level of local self-governments; and
      to make use of advantages offered by information technologies in public
       procurements, such as public procurement portal, etc.

 5.4. Systematic approach to enhancing public procurements in local self-governments

Enhancing of public procurements in local self-governments should be approached
systematically, which implies coordination of the process throughout Montenegro. Some local
                                               57
self-governments have a more developed practice in the field of public procurements, while
others lag behind them. Good solutions are quickly disseminated in this way, which is
particularly important for smaller local self-governments which do not have sufficient
capacities to develop good public procurement practice. The exchange of experiences
between local self-governments facilitates arriving at good solutions which are then accepted
by the others as well. This rationalizes efforts in terms that everyone does not develop
independently and at the same time, for example, the tender documents for procurement of
security services, but a good solution that somebody has developed can be used by all
members of the network (system). This eliminates not only duplication of efforts, but a good
solution becomes a standard, i.e. standardization is implemented, which is one of the main
characteristics of a successful public procurement system.

The system of improvement of public procurements in local self-governments includes the
following aspects:

a) Organizational: the reform of public procurements was implemented at the following
three levels:

      local self-government (public procurement officer and public procurement units),
      regional centres, and
      central body.

b) Sectoral: development of SMEs in terms of specialization for particular activities, such as
health care, education, production, civil engineering, retail and wholesale, services, etc.

c) Communication:

      internal communication via internal network (e-mail, thematic meetings, regional and
       national workshops), and
      external communication - with public (citizens), other local self-government, regional
       associations, Union of Municipalities of Montenegro, Parliament, etc.

d) Resources:

      human - skilled and certified public procurement officers,
      material and IT (Public Procurement Portal, etc),
      professional literature - public procurement manuals, models of implementation acts
       and documents, procurement plans, etc.

      5.5. Criteria for measuring the success of public procurement reforms in local self-
                                           governments

Improvement of public procurements would be measured on the basis of the following
criteria:

   effectiveness which implies that public procurements serve the implementation of goals
    of acquiring the main function of the local self-government, which is provision of
    services to citizens as defined by the law and other regulations (what is to be procured);



                                             58
   efficiency which expresses the extent to which tasks are implemented properly and is
    measured by investments needed to achieve a particular goal (how procurement is
    implemented); and
   economy which shows whether the same goods, services and works are procured more
    cheaply or not (at what price the procurement is implemented).

    5.6. Persons responsible for the process of public procurement reforms in local self-
                                        governments

The persons responsible for the process of improvement of public procurements in local self-
governments are:

   decision makers (Mayor, president of the municipality);
   managers responsible for finances and disbursement of budget funds (heads of town and
    municipal administrations, secretaries for finances); and
   managers of public procurement units and public procurement officers.

     5.7. Measures for improvement of public procurements in local self-governments

The main activities which need to be implemented to improve public procurement in local
self-governments are:

   ensure support for public procurement reform from the top of the decision-making
    hierarchy (Mayor/president of the municipality);
   designate a person to be in charge of coordination and reporting to the Mayor, i.e. the
    president of the municipality, about the activities related to public procurement reforms
    and improvement;
   monitor public procurement procedures and check whether they have been implemented
    properly,
   monitor the success of public procurement implementation; and
   monitor competences of public procurement officers and their performance.

       5.8. Expected benefits from improvement of public procurement in local self-
                                        governments

Specific benefits for local self-governments from the improvement of public procurement
include:

      raising effectiveness, efficiency and economy which would mean that the procedure is
           shorter, smaller number of unsuccessful tenders, better quality of what is procured;
      a larger number of SMEs has an opportunity to win contracts which directly reflects
           on employment in local self-government;
      easier monitoring of public procurements by responsible persons, a higher level of
           regularity and lower risk of corruption.

                                  5.9. Info Desk for SMEs

In accordance with specified overall objectives concerning broader participation of SMEs in
public procurements, an Info Desk was established within the Chamber of Commerce of


                                             59
Montenegro in 2016, and INFO HELP DESK was created on their website 72. The objective of
the established is based on strengthening of environmental protection management, energy
efficiency, social requirements and SMEs' access to the public procurement system.

In that respect, activities and measures have been initiated towards further harmonization of
legislation with new Directives in the field of public procurements and related fields,
promoting the importance of the use of green, social and innovative public procurement,
exchange of good practice and experiences, elaboration of specific advice, criteria and
indicators which will be used in public tendering, training of SMEs so as to enhance their
abilities in public procurements and organizing workshops and seminars for SMEs. Topics
have been initiate towards strengthening SMEs and creating conditions for innovation in
public procurements, higher employment and development, and the need for further training
of contracting authorities in terms of facilitating a better access for SMEs.

The establishment of the INFO HELP DESK improves enhancement of transparency and
reduction of regulatory risk for business entities in a way that all information concerning
public procurement procedures are made even more accessible through the link with the
information published on the public procurement portal of the Public Procurement Agency
and decisions of the State Commission on their website.

Bidders, SMEs in direct communication with the Chamber of Commerce of Montenegro are
in a position to initiate improvement of particular solutions offered by regulatory framework
and to indicate possible shortcomings in the implementation of established public
procurement rules.

Strengthening of the established Info Desk should continue in the next period.

                      6.     TRAINING FOR BUSINESS ENTITIES AND SMEs

The Strategy for Development of the Public Procurement System specifies activities and
measures, and the Law on Public Procurement regulates the obligation concerning
professional development and training for employees of contracting authorities, and for
employees of bidders, SMEs and others.

The Public Procurement Agency has defined the training methodology through the
"Programme and method of professional training and development of Bidders in the field of
public procurements".73 This document includes the method of organizing and implementing
professional training and development and the manner of issuing and renewing of certificates
in the field of public procurements. The training objective is defined in terms of acquiring of
knowledge, skills and abilities of participants in public procurement processes for the purpose
of increasing the number of successfully implemented public procurement procedures at all
levels and generating larger benefits from procurements.

The Public Procurement Agency prepares and delivers training with fees for persons who are
not subject to the enforcement of public procurement regulations, in accordance with the
pricelist of services which is established by this authority with the consent from the
Government of Montenegro.

Upon completion of the training, the Public Procurement Agency issues certificates which can
be renewed, and a register which is continuously updated is maintained on the basis of issued
certificates. The State Commission also has access to the register for the purpose of
implementation of grievance procedures.

The training programme contains several levels: the basic level of training, specialized level
of training in the field of public procurements and training of trainers. Every level of training
has integral parts, duration measured in hours of training, manner of implementation, the
number of trainees, the level of knowledge, professionalism of persons delivering the training,
a possibility to sit a professional exam in the field of public procurements, and a possibility
for additional, subsequent training, etc.

The Action Plan which is an integral part of this Guide includes the plan of activities for the
next period.

Special attention should be paid to the overall organisational and process aspects so as to
strengthen training for SMEs.

7.   ESTABLISHING METHOD OF PAYMENT, REPORTING AND DEFINING OF
        MEASURES FOR INCREASING SMEs' PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC
                          PROCUREMENTS

The Public Procurement Agency has been recognized as the key institution which will work
in the forthcoming period on establishing the manner of monitoring of SMEs' participation in
public procurements, the manner of reporting for the purpose of creating the most reliable
data, learning about the validity of established monitoring procedures, then reviewing the
facts by employing the best established methodological principle and the best practice.

The first task in that direction is to define the goal to be measured and compared, to put
together a team for monitoring of the programme implementation. In time, when comparative
data and a clearer picture are obtained, strategic and organisational goals can be achieved.

                          9. BUDGET AND FINANCING PLAN


The Action Plan for strengthening of the business environment for SMEs in Montenegro is
particularly important because it includes activities, implementing agencies, deadlines,
success indicators and the source of funds.

This Plan includes actions with constitute a regular activity of competent Government
authorities, such as drafting of law and other regulations, and other activities funded from the
budget of Montenegro, regular funds of competent Government authorities and initiated
projects funded by international organisations and financial institutions. The competent
Government authorities have human resources, necessary premises, equipment which can be
used to implement planned activities. The Plan includes activities to be funded by SMEs
themselves at prices applicable on the market for such type of services, and for that reason
this document addresses projection of costs which will arise from such activities and includes
the budget itself.

In accordance with the practice for drafting budgets for projects, every activity has direct
costs (remuneration for staff members implementing activities, travel costs, costs for
organizing an event, etc.) and indirect costs (costs of renting work premises, telephone or
internet bills, various administrative costs).

According to a general estimation, all costs are acceptable and will not impose significant
problems for their financing; they are related to human resources - including fees for persons
who will be engaged in the project for implementation of particular activities, per diems for
those working within the project, travel expenses, costs of renting premises and offices.

All rules concerning payment of the above are determined by regulations of Montenegro.

               10. MONITORING AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES

For the purpose of implementation of activities under this Guide and the Action Plan, when
adopting them, the Government of Montenegro would preferably and at the same time issue
the Decision on the establishment of a team for continuous monitoring of the implementation
of the Guide, which would include representatives of Government authorities, representatives
of SMEs' associations and other interested parties involved in its implementation.

The Action Plan for the period 2017-2020 implementing the Guide is an integral part of this
document. As needed, it can be revised and amended annually according to the following
dynamics

      September-October: the Public Procurement Agency coordinates the analysis and, as
       needed, revision of the Action Plan for the following year with involvement of all
       relevant parties;
      December: if needed, the Government of Montenegro adopts the revised Action Plan
       for the following year;
      The team for monitoring of the implementation of measures under the Action Plan will
       report to the Government on the progress achieved in its implementation once a year;
      Ensure continuous communication with contracting authorities, business entities,
       SMEs, trade unions and non-governmental organisations;
      Organizing conferences, tribunes, round tables and public debates on the public
       procurement system, its institutional and legislative segments twice a year;
      Ensure participation of all interested parties for the purpose of implementation of
       planned activities.

To that end, this will be the way to monitor the progress of results that need to be achieved
and measure fulfilment of indicators as listed in the Action Plan of this document. In case of
delays or failure to fulfil measures of the Action Plan, the implementation monitoring team
will propose measures for overcoming or changes and amendments to the measures.

SMEs are fundamental pillars of the economy and employment in Montenegro and have a
great importance in the economy. It is small and medium enterprises that account for the most
part, 98.90% to be precise, of the overall economic structure of Montenegro, which makes
their role particularly important.

In the forthcoming period, Montenegro needs to provide considerable support to this sector
and set it as the backbone of the development of the economy. In that respect, it is important
to design programmes of support intended entirely to small and medium-sized enterprises in
terms of strengthening innovation, competitiveness of these entities on this and the EU
market.

Public procurement is an important segment of the economy, which is best reflected by the
volume of goods, services and works procured by contracting authorities, subjects of the
implementation of the Law on Public Procurement in the period 2011-2016. The public

legal certainty, prevention of corruption and crime, a positive influence on economic
development and employment, improvement of public finance management, environmental
protection, etc.
