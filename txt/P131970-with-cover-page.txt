Activity Performance
Development Objective
The Concept Note falls under the work program of WSP?s global business area ?Scaling up rural sanitation and hygiene?.
The program is developed based on multiple aspects of program design including the (i) needs of sanitation sector in
Pakistan, (ii) readiness and state of the government, (iii) resources and availability of skills in WSP, (iv) learnings from best
practices around the globe and (v) synergies available with partners and opportunities to deliver results. Considering the
size of the WSP operations in Pakistan and the 5 point development rationale provided above, WSP program has been
selective to focus on Punjab, Sindh and AJK in Pakistan.

The aim in Pakistan is to enable all tiers of the government and sector partners to move towards a common vision based on
sustainable and equitable service delivery in rural sanitation. This becomes possible through leveraging government to
develop and implement a program that is supported by WSP activities. Such partnership based program brings a huge
multiplier effect and enables results to go to large scale (province-wide). In such partnership, the role of government is to
focus on deploying human and capital resources and improving implementation through actually changing the results
on-ground. The role of WSP is to provide TA support (policy & strategies), build capacity of government, focus on localizing
learnings to link policy work to local level pilots, create and test innovations, create partnerships with like-minded
oranizations (eg UNICEF) and informs large donor investments to create multiplier effect for field level outcomes.

The Pakistan Rural Sanitation Scale up Program is expected to influence sector outcomes in three major
ways on different tiers (i.e. Government: federal, provincial & state; and Civil Society Organizations /
Key Stakeholders):
1)       Facilitate formulation of provincial scale-up rural sanitation implementation programs
2)       Advocate for strategies, guidelines and action plans that emphasize on behavior change through Community Led
Total Sanitation (CLTS) and incentives/rewards based on Pakistan Approach to Total Sanitation (PATS)
3)       Provide technical assistance and build capacity of the key stakeholders to implement provincial scale up rural
sanitation program that are aligned to CLTS / PATS approach to ensure outcomes and sustainability
4)       Connect the supply side through formative research in sanitation marketing providing affordable technology options
and micro-financing

Overall Development Objective
                                     Rating             Explanation

Overall Development Objective        9-Very Effective   The TA supported provincial and regional governments to
                                                        synergize on-going efforts by various actors for rural sanitation
                                                        services. Programmatically, this was expected to both have a
                                                        multiplier effect, and leverage larger scale investments, with results
                                                        manifesting at a provincial scale. With new partnerships coming
                                                        into place and the learning from local initiatives informing the
                                                        design and execution of larger scale programs, the role of
                                                        government was to incentivize and catalyze the adoption of
                                                        strategies which focus on behavior change. The TA worked with
                                                        governments at all tiers to ensure approaches were consistent and
                                                        aligned to the CLTS and PATS approaches embodied in the
                                                        national policy framework, while enabling local markets to respond
                                                        to the demand generated.

                                                        WSP played a key role by generating and documenting the learning
                                                        which would bring about the desired changes for up-scaling through
                                                        supporting: (i) policy and strategy formulation coherent with the
                                                        national policy framework; (ii) linking policies to local level pilots
                                                        (through upward and downward information flows); (iii) building the
                                                        requisite capacities in local governments and in the range of
                                                        actors/stakeholders for execution and replication at scale of these
                                                        new approaches; (iv) stimulating the supply side through formative
                                                        research and links with microfinance, to ensure it is responsive to
                                                        new demands; and (v) ensuring evidence based policy debate,
                                                        cross learning and exposure to international best practice to
                                                        leverage change.

                                                        The TA has culminated into the development of client demand and

                                                        whole district being declared ODF, are now being scaled up to all
                                                        10 districts of AJK; and (iv) in KP the demonstration of ODF status
                                                        in one district is being considered for scale up by PPAF, and the

                                                        considered for scale up, with the PHED also undertaking
                                                        responsibility in 3 districts. This indicates that efforts are gaining
                                                        momentum and critical mass- and it is hoped this will generate a

                                                           to Thailand resulted in the KP government committing to scaling up

                                                           Two key achievements have been the delegation of local

                                                           Another key achievement has been the leveraging of a cross sector

Success is evidenced in outcomes- from a position of struggling to meet the sanitation MDG in 2012 Pakistan was one of 95
countries who did meet the sanitation target, achieving 64% coverage compared to 24% in 1990. Rural sanitation access
improved to 51%, with a 10% increase since 2010. Open defecation in rural areas reduced to 21% (from 2012 JMP data
for 2010 of 32%), indicating some impact on the poorest communities. In numerical terms some 11 million people have
found alternatives to open defecation during the five year period since 2010. This exceeds the programmatic targets of
the TA, which expected to target a population of 3.62 million to be open defecation free.

The TA was executed through a difficult period of transition; in the wake of the 18th Amendment and a newly elected
national government in 2013. With no federal â€ ˜ driveâ€ ™factor, the impetus for pushing through policies and programs
for sanitation rested with the provinces, who themselves were in a state of flux. It was only towards the end of the TA period
that local government acts had been approved by provincial assemblies and local government elections held. Each unit
had to determine its own structures of local government, and until there was clarity on these, it was difficult to have clear
strategies and capacity building plans. There was a need to harmonize approaches across different structures and political
governments (where each unit had its own political leadership). It was also evident that the technical capacities needed to
execute CLTS/PATS based approaches resided outside of local government structures, in health departments and civil
society organizations for example. This necessitated working with partnership models, which were complex institutionally
and never easy to execute. Another factor which was germane was the level of volatility in the security environment,
particularly in working within KPK and FATA where a high degree of conflict was prevalent, and internal displacement an
additional factor. Further, realignment was needed in the federal government, with adaptation to its new role of guidance,
encouraging learning and best practice and representation on the international stage.

The TA amicambly attepted and succeeded in the overcoming the above challenges and delivering results to help the
country meet its MDGs.

Lessons Learned/Next Steps
1. Major Findings and Lessons Learned
A key lesson which emerges from this TA is that it is critical to adjust and align approaches with on-going reform processes,
leveraging emerging priorities and supporting different tiers of government as they adjust to the reform. While this is
complex; in the case of Pakistan reform shifted between modes of centralization and decentralization; it does in the long-run
bear dividends. Some of the other key findings from the TA are presented below:
Investing towards Common Goals: A broad set of agencies from government, non-government, national and international
background are investing in the sector on isolated and standalone programs with a variety of short and long term goals. Due
to a greater variability in the targets and objectives impact of such investments are either temporary or solitary. WSP during
the grant term attempted to bring together all the key stakeholders on single agenda and influenced them to invest on the
common goals. The efforts were materialized when all the key agencies adopted PATS as common strategy to achieve total
sanitation in the country.
Institutional Settings: The country needs an institutional home at federal as well as provincial level for water and sanitation
to better address the mandate, fiduciary and regulatory issues. Furthermore efforts are required to strategically align all the
provincial and state level programs and investments.
Institutional Capacity: Capacities at local government level to conceptualize, design and execute software based
approaches remains very limited, and a period of nurturing is essential. The TA successfully completed comprehensive
training program focusing CLTS and Sanitation Marketing to understand the recently adopted approaches by the
government client. In addition, the service delivery institutions from Federal down to the union level are geared more to
â€ œasset creationâ€ • and have a poor record and organizational orientation for service delivery. These institutions do not
have dedicated staff cadre, orientation or skills to address the behavior change challenge posed by poor sanitation and
open defecation practices. Investment is required to improve the institutional capacity of the service providers in all the
above mentioned areas for improved service delivery.
Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (PMER) System: At present the sector lacks standards on PMER and
efficient and independent mechanisms to monitor and verify sectoral outputs. While it is also important to consolidate data
and track progress both at the national and provincial levels. A serious effort to establish efficient PMER system is a basic
needed.
Investment priorities: The commitment of governments towards investing in sanitation and instituting the correct incentive
structures in the form of rewards for attaining ODF status has been variable and needs further dialogue to embed.
Private Sector Investments: Creative approaches are needed in stimulating the private sector to respond to the varying
supply/technology needs of different income groups and conditions.
Quality of Services: While progress in the quantum of access/coverage has been encouraging there is still some way to go
before universal coverage and further, emerging quality issues threaten to negate gains and urgently require a parallel focus
as the country progresses to the SDGs.
Improved Sanitation and Cost-effective options: To ensure public health gains, it is critical to also focus on ensuring the safe
disposal of excreta outside of the household and programmatic approaches need to now consider a more holistic approach
to sanitation. Furthermore, additional effort work is needed on low cost technologies, in the absence of which reaching ODF
status may take far longer in communities due to the poor and marginal who cannot afford currently available technologies.
Implementation Mechanisms: The process of ODF certification needs to be better conceived, and capacities built to ensure
adequate and technically sound fo

2. Next Steps (Describe expected follow-up)

While strong foundations have been established through the TA period, it is critical to sustain the momentum which has
been gained in the past years (resulting in attainment of the MDG target). Importantly, the lessons emerging from the TA
highlight gaps which if not addressed could negate the gains of the past years.

i)      Each policy and strategic framework needs to be revisited to ensure they are up to date and consistent with
provincial priorities. In particular strategies need to be reviewed to ensure they are actionable and being reflected in the
legal and programmatic landscape and financial allocations.
ii)     Development of a strong monitoring framework, provincially as well as nationally, as approaches scale up is now an
imperative.

                                                                                                                  Page 9 of 12
iii)      Creative approaches are needed to encourage the private sector to play a greater role in addressing technology
gaps, with appropriate linkages to research and development institutions.
iv)       Quality issues are gaining importance and must be addressed- this includes attention to the quality of household
investments, as well as ensuring better disposal outside of the household environment.
v)        New programs and management models are needed which focus on building capacities at all levels of government
(in particular synchronizing and building capacities with the new local governments), and also provide investments which
ensure safe excreta management outside of the household.
vi)       Donor investments in sanitation need to be coordinated and scaled up, as in the case of the SSS in Sindh.
vii)        Continuity institutional capacity building activities is mandatory to produce enduring impact. In addition, â€ œasset
creationâ€ • approach by the service delivery institutions should be substituted with â€ œimproved service delivery
approach leading to sustainable assetsâ€ • approach. The institutions should also have dedicated staff cadre, with capacity
and skills to address the behavior change challenge posed by poor sanitation and open defecation practices.
viii)      Ingenious Regulations: A set of regulations should be developed and adopted by all the service providers in the
country to improve the quality of services as well as consumer satisfaction and revenue generation.

Comments

All provincial ODF programs were demanded by their respective governments. WSP drafted the Policies and Strategies
which were amended and approved by the respective governments. Similarly, WSP only contributed to capacity
development of select government staff who at their own expense and time socially mobilized villages, union councils and
districts to make them open defecation free.
