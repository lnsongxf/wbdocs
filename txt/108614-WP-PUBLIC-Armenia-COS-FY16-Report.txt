I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Armenia perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    Background Information
    General Issues Facing Armenia
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Armenia
    Overall perceptions

II. Methodology
From August to September 2015, 203 stakeholders of the WBG in Armenia were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Office of the Prime Minister,
office of a minister; the National Assembly/Parliament; ministries/ministerial departments;
Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/ programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; the private foundation, the financial
sector/private banks; non-profit organizations/community based organizations; the media;
independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups, youth groups;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of
141 stakeholders participated in the survey (70% response rate).

Respondents received and responded to the questionnaires via the online platform Qualtrics.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Armenia; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s future role in Armenia; and the WBG’s
overall perceptions.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 90%, N=192). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, and C. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown
and year comparison results, please see appendix D (page 58).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of the President,
       Prime Minister were combined with those from the office of a minister; respondents from
       ministries/ ministerial departments/implementation agencies, PMUs, and consultants
       working on WBG projects were combined; respondents from the financial sector/private
       banks were combined with those from private sector organizations; respondents from
       non-profit organizations/community based organizations and private foundation were
       combined in the “CSO” category. Few respondents from local governments,
       bilateral/multilateral agencies, media, independent government institutions,
       academia/research institutes/think tanks, and other organizations were included in the
       “Other” category. There were no respondents from the National Assembly/Parliament,
       trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups, or the judiciary branch.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness and Results (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Armenia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the nine specific areas of
three clusters.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.
      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Armenia. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural economy sustainably improved (in particular,
               improve irrigation and agricultural productivity);
              The WBG’s effectiveness at improved efficiency, equitable access, and quality of
               education services;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at improved efficiency and equity of health services;
               and,
              The WBG’s effectiveness at improved efficiency of public administration and
               service delivery.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Armenia, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural economy sustainably improved (in particular,
               improve irrigation and agricultural productivity);

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year9
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means and percentages of the FY 2016 data and the total
number of respondents will be slightly different from those in other appendices in this report.

FY ’13 Number of comparable respondents = 160  FY ’16 Number of comparable respondents = 117

By weighting, FY 2013 and FY 2016 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group
interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated
annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

                            World Bank Group Country Survey in Armenia


The World Bank Group – specifically, the World Bank (International Bank of Reconstruction and Development, or
IBRD) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) – is interested in hearing the views of its partners who are
involved in development in Armenia, as we have reached the mid-point of the current country program.

In September 2012, several hundred Armenian stakeholders from many organizations were invited to participate
in a survey to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better understanding of how diverse stakeholders
in Armenia perceive us and how they view Armenia’s economic challenges.

Today, in 2015, we are approaching the mid-way point in our current Country Partnership Strategy, and we are
again reaching out to hear from you. This new survey will give us greater insight into how the WBG’s work is
perceived and help us be more effective as we support development in Armenia.

This short survey is specifically designed to pick up on key results from the 2012 WBG Armenia Survey. It should
take about fifteen minutes to complete. All responses are anonymous and confidential. Data will be sent to an
independent platform for analyses. We hope you’ll be candid.

When responding to the survey, please consider the area of the World Bank Group with which you are most
familiar.

To complete the survey, please select the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you
prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank. If you feel that you do not have an adequate
amount of information on a subject, please check “Don’t know”.

We know you are busy and we greatly appreciate the time you take to complete this survey.
