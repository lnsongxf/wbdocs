I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Malawi
       perceive the Bank;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Malawi regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Malawi;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Malawi;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
              work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Malawi;
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Malawi.
    Use data to help inform Malawi country team’s strategy.
II. Methodology
In April-May 2013, 600 stakeholders of the World Bank in Malawi were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President/Vice President; the
Cabinet, the office of a Parliamentarian; a ministry, ministerial department, or statutory
corporation; consultants/ contractors working on World Bank-supported projects/programs;
project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government
officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private
foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based organizations; the
media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research
institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 427 stakeholders
participated in the survey (71% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier, email and face to face and returned them
accordingly. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Malawi; their overall attitudes
toward the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and
activities; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Malawi; and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing in Malawi.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Malawi: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Malawi is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three development priorities in
   Malawi, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic
   growth, and what best illustrates how “shared prosperity” would be achieved in Malawi.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Malawi, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Malawi solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner.
   Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, greatest weaknesses, the most
   effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Malawi, with which stakeholder groups
   the Bank should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the Bank should focus most
   resources, to what extent the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda,
   and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.

II. Methodology (continued)
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results, the extent to which the Bank meets
   Malawi’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across twenty seven development areas, such as food security, education,
   agricultural development/commercialization, and poverty reduction.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its research efforts and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s
   knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes to
   development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Malawi’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Malawi: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Malawi in the near future and to indicate what the
   Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank,
   that the Bank’s websites are easy to navigate and useful, and that the Bank is responsive to
   information requests. Respondents were also asked to indicate whether they primarily use the
   Bank’s country website or the Bank’s main website and whether they primarily use high
   speed or dial-up Internet connection when visiting a World Bank website.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Malawi, and their geographic location.


When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from 347 respondents (58% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY 2006 and 372 respondents (62% response rate) who completed the country survey
in FY 2010. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

        received a mean rating of 6.4. This is significantly lower than the mean rating received in
        the FY ’10 survey (7.0) and statistically similar to the mean rating received in the FY ’06
        country survey (6.3).

        President/Cabinet, and employees of a ministry/ministerial department/statutory
        corporation gave the highest ratings for the World Bank’s overall effectiveness in
        Malawi, whereas respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks and
        academia/research institutes/think tanks gave significantly lower ratings.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness across many of these twenty-seven development areas. For the most part,
        respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies gave the highest ratings, whereas
        respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to give significantly
        lower ratings. Those areas with significant stakeholder differences were:
             Anti corruption;
             Information and communications technology;
             Accountability;
             Environmental sustainability
             Regulatory framework;
             Poverty reduction;
             Enhancing environment for private sector development and foreign direct
                investment;
             Trade and exports;
             Food security;
             Education;
             Social protection; and
             Agricultural development/commercialization

       There were significant differences across geographic locations in respondents’ ratings of
        the Bank’s effectiveness in three development areas. For the most part, respondents from
        “District-Southern region” gave significantly higher ratings than those from: “City
        (Blantyre, Zomba, Lilongwe, Mzuzu).” Those areas with significant differences were:
             Gender equity;
             Rural development; and
             Education.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Malawi, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the forty-one specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Malawi. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at education;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at food security;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at agricultural development/commercialization;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at job creation/employment

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Malawi, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at agricultural development/commercialization;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;

The World Bank’s Work in Malawi

       Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement
        that the World Bank supports programs and strategies that are realistic for Malawi
        compared to respondents in the FY ’06 survey.
       Respondents in this year’s country survey had statistically similar levels of agreement
        with two other statements (indicator questions) compared to respondents in the FY ’06
        and FY ’10 country surveys.
       There were significant differences across stakeholder groups in their levels of agreement
        with all three statements below. Respondents from the bilateral/multilateral agencies,
        PMUs, and consultants/contractors working on Bank projects tended to have the highest
        levels of agreement, whereas respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks
        had significantly lower levels of agreement.
       Respondents across all geographic locations had statistically similar levels of agreement
        with these three statements.
