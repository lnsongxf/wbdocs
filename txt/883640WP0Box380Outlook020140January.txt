After reaching $100/bbl in early 2011 for the first time
since the 2008 financial crisis, crude oil prices (World Bank
average) have fluctuated within a remarkably tight band
around $105/bbl, which is also OPEC’s “desired range”
(figure 3). In fact, 2011-13 has been one of the least vol-
atile 3-year periods of the recent history of the oil mar-
ket (Box 1 elaborates further on the nature and causes of
crude oil price volatility).

Fluctuations in oil prices have been driven mainly by geo-
political concerns (Egypt and Syria) and output disrup-
tions (Iraq and Libya) on the supply side, and macroeco-
nomic concerns, initially due to the European debt issues           Source: World Bank, International Energy Agency.
and more recently changing developing-country growth

Syrian conflict might spread to the Gulf and cause a major          Figure 4          Brent/WTI price differential
disruption in oil supplies have been replaced by cautious
optimism. While the interim deal between Western pow-
ers and Iran will relieve some sanctions, including lifting
the ban on insuring oil shippers, the bad on crude exports
remains in place. The relaxation in insurance provisions
within the current sanctions regime may lead to some
increases in Iranian crude exports to existing customers
in the short-term. However, Iran’s oil exports could be
further facilitated by through an oil-for-goods deal with
Russia worth $1.5 billion a month, the equivalent of 0.5
mb/d―that however may not be consistent with the
interim deal. On the positive news on the supply side, a

Recent Developments
Developments in the oil market have been dominated by
the rapid expansion of unconventional oil production.
Increased Canadian oil (from tar sands) to the United
States combined with rapidly rising U.S. shale liquids pro-
duction (from fracturing and horizontal drilling) have
contributed to a build-up of stocks at a time when U.S.
oil consumption is moderating and natural gas supplies
are increasing rapidly. The stock build-up caused West

2011—the spread reached a high of 30 percent late that
year. While the Brent-WTI spread narrowed in July 2013             Figure 6          OPEC spare capacity
to less than 5 percent, it widened again to reach almost
15 percent by the end of 2013 (figure 4). The spread is
expected to narrow upon completion of the Keystone
pipeline (perhaps late 2014).

The decline in non-OPEC oil output growth that began
in 2011 has been reversed. Non-OPEC producers
added some 0.7 mb/d to global supplies in 2012 and an
additional 1.3 mb/d during 2013, mainly reflecting ear-
lier large-scale investments. In the United States, hori -
zontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have added 1.4
mb/d to global crude oil supplies since the beginning
of 2012. Currently, the U.S. states of North Dakota
and Texas, where most of shale oil production takes
place, account for almost half of the total U.S. crude             Source: International Energy Agency.
oil supplies, up from 25 percent three years ago (fig -
ure 5). Indeed, the IEA projects that the surging North
America crude oil output could add close to almost 5               Figure 7          World oil demand growth
mb/d to the global oil supplies by 2018 2.3 mb/d from
the U.S. “light tight oil” and 1.3 mb/d from Canada’s oil
sands.) To keep this additional oil into perspective, con-
sider that biofuels added in 2012 the 1.5 mb/d of crude
oil equivalent to the global market, as much as North
Dakota and Texas added between December 2011 and
October 2013.

A significant reduction in oil supplies by Iraq and Libya
during the summer of 2013 (estimated at more than 1
mb/d each) was balanced by increases in Saudi output,
thus causing only a marginal reduction in OPEC output—
it averaged 36.1 mb/d in 2013Q4, down from 36.9 mb/d
in the previous quarter. For the entire year, OPEC’s output
declined by 0.7 mn/d. Yet, this production level is still 10       Source: World Bank, International Energy Agency.

quarter in recent history, and well above the Organiza-
tion’s 30 mb/d quota.                                              Figure 8          Global crude oil consumption

The downward trend of OPEC’s spare production
capacity that began in early 2010 has been reversed since
2012Q1 with spare capacity reaching almost 5.2 mb/d in
November 2013, the highest since March 2011, before
easing back slightly in December (figure 6). The Saudi
government has promised to keep the global market well
supplied. But, the Kingdom also deems the $100-110/bbl
range to be a fair price. Such range has been maintained
during the past three years despite various geopolitical
issues and supply disruptions as well as output growth in
North America. According to the IEA, spare capacity in
the global oil market may exceed 7 mb/d by the end 2014,
almost three times higher than the 1.5-3.0 mb/d range
during 2004-08. Spare capacity will begin declining by             Source: International Energy Agency.

World demand increased by 1.02 mb/d in 2013Q4 (y/y)
with nearly 2/3 of the growth coming from non-OECD                  Figure 9          Global crude oil production
countries, 0.67 mb/d vs. 0.35 mb/d (figure 7). Chinese
demand was a drag on growth for the first time since
the end-2011. Demand has increased in the 2013H2 in
OECD countries, in contrast with the patterns of the past
few years where demand has fallen by 4.5 mb/d, or 9.6
percent, from its 2005Q1 peak of 51 mb/d. Non-OECD
demand remains robust. In fact, during 2013Q4, non-O-
ECD economies consumed almost as much oil as OECD
ones, 45.5 versus 46.7 mb/d (figure 8).

Outlook and Risks
Nominal oil prices are expected to average $103/bbl dur-
ing 2014 (down from $104/bbl in 2013) and decline to
$100/bbl in 2015. In the longer term, prices in real terms          Source: International Energy Agency.
are expected to fall, due to growing supplies of unconven-
tional oil, efficiency gains, and (less so) substitution away
from oil. The key assumption underpinning these projec-             Figure 10         Energy prices
tions reflects the upper-end cost of developing additional
oil capacity from Canadian oil sands, currently estimated
at $80/bbl in constant 2014 dollars.

World demand for crude oil is expected to grow at less
than 1.5 percent annually over the projection period, with
all the growth coming from non-OECD countries, as has
been the case in recent years (figure 8). Consumption
growth in OECD economies will continue to be subdued
by slow economic growth and efficiency improvements
in vehicle transport induced by high prices—including
a switch to hybrid, natural gas, and electrically powered
transport. Pressure to reduce emissions due to environ-
mental concerns is expected to dampen demand growth
at the global level.                                                Source: World Bank.

On the supply side, non-OPEC oil production is expected
to continue its upward climb, as high prices have prompted          Figure 11         Natural gas prices
increased use of innovative exploration techniques
(including deep-water offshore drilling and extraction of
shale liquids) and the implementation of new extractive
technologies to increase the output from existing wells
(figure 9).

Last, prices of natural gas (in the U.S.) and coal are
expected to remain low relative to crude oil (figure 10) as
well as European and Japanese natural gas prices (figure
11). Some convergence in prices is expected to take place
but its speed will depend on several factors, including the
development of unconventional oil supplies outside the
U.S., the construction of LNG facilities and gas pipelines,
relocation of energy intensive industries to the U.S., sub-
stitution by coal, and policies.                                    Source: World Bank.

        Box 1           The nature and causes of oil price volatility

      The nominal price of Brent (the international marker of oil) averaged 111/bbl during 2011-13. This was the highest of any
      3-year period since 1860 in real terms. During 2011-13 oil price volatility dropped to historical lows, shortly after experi-
      encing a record high during the great recession of 2008/09. This box (which draws heavily from Baffes and Kshirsagar
      2014) examines the nature and causes of oil price volatility. It concludes that the recent spike in volatility—the second
      highest of the past 25 years—reflected uncertainty regarding the health of the global economy induced by the 2008
      financial crisis while a similar spike in 1990 was related to supply disruption concerns associated with the first Gulf war.
      The analysis also shows that high prices are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for elevated price volatility
      since both high and low volatility can take place under high and low prices. Last, concerns that oil prices have become
      more volatile after 2008 are inconsistent with the empirical evidence.

      During 2008, the price of oil changed by more than 5 percent in a single day in 27 out of 260 trading sessions. It ex-
      ceeded the 5 percent threshold only once in 2011 and once in 2012, while in no day oil prices changed more than 5
      percent during 2013 (Figure box 1.1). Thus, on the basis of this simple metric, 2008 has been the most volatile year in
      the recent history of the oil market while 2013 was one of the least volatile years.

      Next, the volatility of returns was calculated based on daily Brent prices from January 20, 1987 to December 31, 2013
      (6,643 observations.) Volatility of returns, a measure used frequently by the financial literature, is defined as vol(rt) =
      100*Std[log(pt) – log(pt-1)], where Std[.] denotes the standard deviation while pt and pt-1 represents the current and
      lagged price of oil. Figure box 1.2 depicts vol(rt) and pt since 1988. In order to smooth out outliers and also take into ac-
      count seasonality, both indices are presented as 250-day moving averages, roughly corresponding to a full year. Indeed,
      it becomes apparent that the last three years have been characterized by the highest oil price level and the lowest oil
      price volatility.

      Last, the kurtosis of rt for the five years 2008 to 2012 was calculated as well—kurtosis “measures” the proportion of
      extreme observations of a distribution; a normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. As shown in Figure box 1.3, every suc-
      cessive year after 2009 has experienced a reduction in the dispersion of the empirical oil price change distribution—the
      kurtosis of rt declined from 7.1 in 2008 and 2009 to just 3.7 in 2013. Therefore, returns have become much less dispersed
      after the 2008/09 financial crisis.

      Three messages emerge from this analysis. First, during the past 25 years the global oil market has been subjected to
      two distinct spikes in volatility: 1990 (first Gulf war) and 2008/09 (great recession); this finding has been confirmed econ-
      ometrically by numerous authors, including Salisu and Fasanya (2013) and Charles and Darné (2013). Second, while
      the 1990 spike was associated with a modest increase in oil prices, the 2008/09 spike emerged alongside the largest
      post-second World War commodity price boom. Third, despite oil prices remaining at historically high levels during 2011-
      13, price volatility dropped to record lows.

      What causes spikes in oil price volatility? In addition to supply disruptions, concerns about the health of the global
      economy, and hence demand, is the most frequently mentioned factor. The relationship between macroeconomic

         conditions and oil shocks has been studied extensively. Hamilton (2013) identified four major oil price shocks during
         the past 25 years and noted that two of them—1990 and 2002/03—were related to supply disruption concerns as-
         sociated with the Gulf wars while two—1999/2000 and 2007/08—were caused by demand changes. Bloom (2013)
         noted that macroeconomic shocks associated with recessions—a case in point being the 2008 financial crisis—are
         more uncertain than positive shocks. Moreover, because recessions are rare events with no clear consensus on their
         likely depth and duration, which are often amplified by policy uncertainty, they tend to cause greater market volatility
         than positive shocks. This is consistent with the fact that one of the two largest volatility spikes of the past 25 years
         coincided with the great recession.

         The next step is to examine the relationship between vol(rt) and the volatility of the S&P 500 index, vol(SPt). The S&P
         500 index, which consists of the largest 500 companies traded in U.S. equity markets, is often viewed as an indicator of
         expectations about overall macroeconomic conditions. Figure box 1.4 confirms a strong correlation between vol(rt) and
         vol(SPt) during the 2008/09 financial crisis but no correlation in 1990. Thus, visual inspection alone strongly suggests
         that the 2008/09 volatility episode was associated with the 2008 financial crisis (and therefore demand-driven) while the
         1990 episode reflected supply concerns induced by the first Gulf war (and, by induction, supply-driven).

         To validate this conjecture, a Granger causality test was applied to vol(rt) and vol(SPt). Specifically, vol(rt) was regressed
         on vol(rt-1) and vol(SPt-1) for each 250-day moving window during 1988-2013. Subsequently, White’s robust standard
         errors were calculated. A p-value of less than 0.01 associated with the parameter estimate of vol(SPt-1) would be con-
         sistent with a Granger-causal relation from vol(SPt) to vol(rt).

         Causality analysis results (not reported in this box) confirm that vol(SPt) began “Granger-causing” vol(rt) in 2007, albeit
         in a limited way. The strongest causation was detected in 2009 (i.e., as the regressions included more observations
         from 2009, the parameter estimate of vol(SPt-1) was becoming progressively more significant). The causation began
         dissipating in 2010 and more so in 2011, effectively disappearing by 2012. These Granger-causality results suggest that
         the 2008/09 spike in oil price volatility emanated from macroeconomic concerns and thus should be viewed as demand-
         driven. On the other hand, the absence of Granger-causality in 1990 leaves supply disruptions due to the Gulf war the
         likely explanation of the spike in volatility. The results are consistent with Hamilton’s (2013) finding that the 1990 and
         2007/08 volatility episodes are supply- and demand-driven, respectively.

         The three measures of volatility presented here (price changes in excess of 5 percent, standard deviation of returns,
         and within-year dispersion of returns) suggest that the view that oil price volatility will be permanently higher after
         2008 is not supported by the empirical evidence. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that high oil prices are neither
         a necessary nor a sufficient condition for elevated price volatility since both high and low price volatility can take place
         under high and low prices. Indeed, the 1990 spike in volatility was associated with only a moderate increase in oil
         prices. while elevated volatility during the late 1990s, coincided with the lowest price level in recent history (when oil
         prices dropped temporarily below $10/bbl). Last, volatility during 2008/09 spiked well after the collapse of oil prices
         in late 2008.

Following the collapse in metal prices in the wake of the
2008-09 global financial crisis, prices regained strength
and increased almost continuously, reaching a peak in early
2011 (figures 12 and 13). The World Bank metals price
index reached a new high of 126 (2010 = 100) in February
2011, up 164 percent from its December 2008 low. This
increase, together with the sustained increases prior to the
financial crisis, generated large investments which in turn
induced a strong supply response.

Most of the additional metal supplies went to meet
demand from China, whose consumption share of world
refined metals reached almost 45 percent at the end of              Source: World Bank.
2012, up from 42 percent in the previous year (figure 14).
China’s share of metal consumption in the early 1990s was
less than 5 percent.                                                Figure 13         Metal prices (Lead, Tin, and Zinc)

Real metal prices have fallen more than any other com-
modity group since their peaks in early 2011. For example,
real prices of internationally traded energy, food and met-
als prices, denominated in U.S. dollars, have declined by
9, 13 and 30 percent respectively, between their peaks in
early 2011 and November 2013. The declines in industrial
metals along with an equally precipitous declines in pre-
cious metal prices, has prompted economists and analysts
to argue that that the so-called commodity super cycle may
be coming to an end. Yet, even though metal prices have
eased recently, they are still twice as high compared to a
decade ago.

overall index averaged in 2013 almost 6 percent lower
than 2012. The price strengthening in some metals (albeit
marginal) during 2014Q4 reflects improving global man-
ufacturing activity and the rebound of imports by China.
For example, Chinese imports of aluminum and zinc—
and to lesser extent of copper and iron ore—have grown
over 100 percent in there months to November. Copper
imports peaked at 47 percent in August, and have since
moderated (figure 16).

The weakening in metals prices during 2013 has been
broad-based. Prices for zinc, copper, aluminum and nickel
declined 2, 8, 9, and 14 percent respectively. Exceptions to
this trend were lead and tin whose prices increased (up 3.6
percent and 5.5 percent, respectively).                             Source: World Bureau of Metals Statistics.

 Box 2          Monetary conditions and metal prices


The monetary easing of the past few years coincided with the longest and broadest commodity price boom since WWII
and, not surprisingly, led to the expectation that the impeding monetary tightening may reverse the price trend. This box
(which draws from Baffes and Savescu 2014a and 2014b) finds that the effect of short term interest rates on metal prices
is mixed and modest. But, changes in longer term rates have a positive and highly significant impact. It also concludes
that metal prices respond to industrial production, input prices, US dollar movements, and physical stocks of metals.

Between 1997-2004 and 2005-12 nominal metal increased more than 150 percent. Abundant global liquidity associated
with low interest rates and quantitative easing in major developed economies over the past few years figure prominently
as the commodity boom’s key causes. And not surprisingly, the impending normalization of monetary conditions has
created expectations that commodity prices will decline.

The relationship between interest rates and commodity prices goes back to Hotelling (1931) who argued that the price
of an exhaustible resource must grow at the rate of interest (see Devarajan and Fisher (1981) for a literature review).
Since then, this relationship has been examined extensively, especially during boom and bust cycles. See, for example,
Cooper and Lawrence (1975), Barsky and Kilian (2001) for the 1970s boom; Lamm (1980), Gardner (1981), Frankel
(1984) for the subsequent price declines; and Calvo (2008), Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2008), Medlock and Jaffe
(2009), McKinnon and Liu (2012) for the recent boom.

Low interest rates could exert upward pressure on commodity prices through several channels. First, they increase current
(and expectations about future) demand. Second, they alter stockholding behavior by reducing the cost of carrying stocks,
thus reducing availability of current supplies—for extractive commodities stocks could include recoverable reserves as
well. Third, they are associated with a depreciation of the US dollar—the currency of choice of most international com-
modity transactions. Fourth, they induce demand for futures contracts by portfolio managers of investment funds—the
so-called financialization of commodities. However, low interest rates reduce the cost of capital which is associated with
increasing investment and current (as well as expectations about future) supply, therefore lowering commodity prices. And,
they could signal lower expected inflation. Therefore, low interest rates could be consistent with higher or lower prices de-
pending on the dominant effect of the first four channels compared to the investment and inflation expectations channels.

To examine the relationship between interest rates and metal prices, a model that expresses the equilibrium price as
a function of fundamentals by equating aggregate demand and supply of a commodity is utilized. The theoretical un-
derpinnings of the model are explained in Turnovsky (1983), Stein (1986), Holtham (1988), and Deaton and Laroque
(1992). Empirical applications include Gilbert (1989) who looked at the effect of developing country debt on commodity
prices; Pindyck and Rotemberg (1990), who examined comovement among various commodity prices; Reinhart (1991)
and Borensztein and Reinhart (1994) who analyzed the factors behind the weakness of commodity prices during the
late 1980s and early 1990s; Baffes (1997) who examined the long term determinants of metal prices; Ai, Chatrath, and
Song (2006) who re-examined comovement among commodity prices; Baffes and Dennis (2013) who analyzed the key
drivers of the post-2004 food price increases.

The model takes the following form:

         log(Pt 
              i
                ) = β0 + β1 log(IRt 
                                  j
                                    ) + β2 log(IPt ) + β3 log(Sti ) + β4 log(MUVt ) + β5 log(XRt ) + εt.
P denotes the nominal price of metal i, i = aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc. IR denotes interest rate of matu-
rity j, j = 3 month, 1 year, 5 year, and 10 year US Treasury Bills. IPt, a demand proxy, denotes global industrial production,
S represents stock level of metal i, MUVt is the price index of manufacturing goods (a proxy for input prices), and XRt is
the U.S. exchange rate against a broad index of currencies. The βis is are parameters to be estimated and εt is the error
term.

To set the stage, each metal price was regressed on each interest rate by excluding the remaining fundamentals, i.e.,
log(P) = β0 + β1 log(IR) + εt. Results for the 24 bivariate regressions (reported in table B 2.1) reveal a strong negative
correlation between interest rates and metal prices, consistent with the prevailing view that the low interest rate environ-
ment of the past few years has been an instrumental force behind the commodity price boom.

The impact of interest rates on metal prices is assessed by accounting for the full set of fundamentals discussed in
equation (1). Results based on the 3m T-Bill are reported in table B 2.2. The impact of the 3-month T-Bill on metal prices
is mixed. The average elasticity for aluminum, nickel, and zinc is slightly below 0.1 (significant at the 5% level in all three



                                                              14
cases); it is positive and marginally significant for copper, negative and highly significant for tin, but not significantly dif-
ferent from zero for led. The mixed nature of the results echoes estimates from the literature. Gilbert (1989) based on an
error-correction model (1965:Q1-1986:Q2) concluded that high interest rates have a negative impact on the metal price
index, though with considerable lags. Baffes (1997), who used a reduced form price model for five metals (1971:Q1-
1988:Q4) estimated mostly negative but not significantly different from zero elasticities. Akram (2009), based on a VAR
model (1990:Q1-2007:Q4), concluded that commodity prices (including metals) increase significantly in response to a
reduction in real interest rates. Anzuini, Lombardi, and Pagano (2010), who applied a VAR on monthly data for 1970-
2009, did establish that easy monetary policy is associated with higher commodity prices (including a metals) but also
noted that the impact is modest. Frankel and Rose (2010), based on annual data for a number of commodities including
copper, platinum, and silver, found little support that easy monetary policy and low real interest rates are an important
source of upward pressure on real commodity prices.

Table B 2.3 reports results based on all 4 interest rates (only the interest rate parameter estimate is reported). Estimates
from the 1y T-Bill (second row) are similar to those of the 3m T-Bill—the size of the estimates increased marginally in 5
out of 6 metals. The longer term rates, however, give a different picture. For aluminum, copper, nickel, and zinc the pa-
rameter estimate for the 10y T-Bill averaged 0.57 and is significantly different from zero at the 1% level in all four cases.

It is marginally significant for lead (0.23, t-ratio = 1.89), and zero for tin. Thus, longer term interest rates appear to exert
a positive and highly significant impact on metal prices. These results are consistent with Scrimgeour (2010) who found
that a one percentage point increase in long term interest rates would raise metal prices by almost 10%. Similarly, the
2013 Spillover Report (IMF 2013, p. 14) noted that under a smooth growth-driven normalization of monetary policy (i.e.,
raising interest rates the “right time”) energy and non-energy commodity prices will increase by 7% and 5%, respectively.
To check robustness, the model was re-estimated as a panel (fixed effects). Results for all four rates are reported in
Box table 2.4. The small and not statistically different from zero parameter estimates for the short term rates (first two
columns) mirror the results reported earlier. And, as expected, the longer term rates confirm the positive impact on metal
prices established by the OLS regressions, with estimates 0.13 and 0.29.

The effect of the remaining fundamentals is consistent with microeconomic theory. The elasticity of industrial production
was significantly different from zero in all cases with estimates ranging from 1.45 (aluminum) to 3.47 (zinc); the average
from the panel estimates was 2.35, and highly significant. A similar strong impact has been confirmed by numerous
authors, including Baffes (1997), Labys, Achouch, and Terraza (1999), and Issler, Rodrigues, and Burjack, (2013). In
three metals (lead, nickel, and tin) stocks have a negative effect on prices, though the magnitude is relatively small (the
panel regressions average was 0.17, significant at the 1% level). Manufacturing prices have exerted the largest impact
after industrial production (except zinc) as evidenced by both the OLS and panel regressions—confirming the view that
high input prices have played a key role during the post-2004 run up in metal prices (e.g. Radetzki et al 2008, World
Bank 2009). Last, US dollar movements against a broad index of currencies have a strong and highly significant impact
as well, which is in line with earlier literature (Gardner 1981, Gilbert 1989, Baffes 1997, Akram 2009).

Most agricultural commodity prices (especially grains)
continued their weakness with the overall index down 1
percent from 2013Q3 and almost 9 percent lower than
a year ago (Figure 21). Grains have led the decline, more
than 27 percent down from 2013Q1 to 2013Q4, followed
by beverages (-6.9 percent), raw materials (-3.3 percent),
and edible oils and meals (-3.0 percent). The large decline
of the grain index reflects the free-fall of maize and rice
prices, 36 and 25 percent decline in just 9 months (from
March to December 2013).

Edible oil and meal prices, which declined sharply in late
2012 and early 2013, gained strength towards the end of
2013 (figure 24). The World Bank’s edible oil and meal
index increased 4.7 percent in 2013Q4, though it is still 3
percent than a year ago. The strengthening in the edible oil
prices was led by palm oil whose prices gained 8.5 percent
from 2013Q3 to 2013Q4 when it became apparent later
last year that world supplies will fall short of expectations.
Furthermore, the governments of Malaysia and Indo-
nesia (world’s top palm oil suppliers) are promoting the
diversion of palm oil to biodiesel. In fact, palm oil exports
are expected to decline to 43.7 million tons in 2013/14,
down from last season’s 44.2 million tons. Soybean prices

part due to a tight soybean balance in the U.S. and in part
due to concerns of the South American crop, including
logistical bottlenecks that reduced exports.                          Figure 25        Beverage prices

The beverage price index did not change much in 2013Q4
(1.1 percent up from the previous quarter), but still 7
percent than a year ago. Yet, individual prices moved in
opposite directions in response to different market fun-
damentals. Cocoa prices rallied 12 percent, coffee prices
declined 8 percent while tea prices remained virtually
unchanged (figure 25). The rally in cocoa prices (they
reached a 27-month high in December 2013) reflects fears
of a lower West Africa production and increased demand
(especially in Europe). Preliminary estimates indicate that
2013/14 will be a deficit year. The coffee market, which
had had a surplus of 2.4 million bags in 2012/13, is likely
to experience another surplus year with the Brazilian and

lion bags to the existing surplus—global coffee produc-

Sugar prices (not part of the World Bank’s beverage price
index), which had been remarkably stable until 2013Q3,
have come under pressure lately from a combination of
factors, including weakening of the Brazilian currency,
the real, increased net short position by investment funds,
and more importantly, surplus production. Production
in South and Central Brazil exceeded expectations while
other key producers of the Northern Hemisphere, includ-
ing India, Mexico, and Thailand are expected to have good
crops as well.

Raw material prices have been relatively stable recently;
they increased marginally in 2013Q4 (up 1 percent from

markets appear to be over-supplied. Global production of
natural rubber increased 5 percent in 2013 (from 3.77 to
3.96 million tons) mostly due to strong production growth
by Thailand and Indonesia. Moreover, the rubber market
may come under more pressure in the medium term as
new planting in several countries are entering the produc-
tion stage (including Thailand, Laos, India, and Cambo-
dia). On cotton, while global production is expected to
decline (25.6 million tons in 2013/14, down from last
season’s 26.9 million tons), weak demand will generate an
additional 2 million tons of stocks, most of which (1.8
million tons) will be absorbed by the Chinese govern-
ment—at the end of the current season, China is expected
to hold more than half of world’s stocks.                             Source: US Department of Agriculture, Jan 2014 update.


Outlook and Risks                                                     Figure 28        Global wheat supplies
Agricultural commodity prices are projected to decline
2.5 percent in 2014. Food commodities are expected to
decline by 3.7 percent, followed by (-2 percent). Raw
materials will increase marginally (+0.9 percent). The larg-
est declines among food commodities will be in the grain
group with maize, rice, and wheat down by 13, 9, and 4
percent. While edible oils and meals will change little at the
aggregate, palm oil and soybeans are expected to increase
by 4 and 2 percent while soybean oil and soybean meal will
decline by 3 percent each. Raw material prices will increase
marginally.

underpin the outlook for agricultural commodities. These
risks include crop conditions, energy prices, biofuels, mac-          Source: US Department of Agriculture, Jan 2014 update.
roeconomic environment, and trade policies. On crop
conditions, it is assumed that that the 2013/14 season’s
outlook will be along normal trends. In its January 2013              Figure 29        Global rice supplies
assessment, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated
the 2013/14 crop season’s grain supplies (production plus
stocks of maize, wheat, and rice) at 2.57 billion tons, up
5 percent from 2012/13. The level of supplies is deemed
adequate to replenish stocks (see figures 27, 28, and 29).
Since the crop year is well advanced, the probability of
adverse weather conditions altering the current outlook in
any significant way is very small.

The baseline forecast also assumes that oil prices will
remain elevated at $103/bbl in 2014, declining to
$100/bbl in 2015. More importantly, fertilizer prices
are assumed to decline considerably, almost 12 in 2014

2013. Given the high energy intensity of agriculture (it is           Source: US Department of Agriculture, Jan 2014 update.

 Box 3          Long term drivers of food prices and the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis

As incomes grow, people consume more food, including input-intensive products such as meat, dairy products, and pack-
aged foods. With population growth, the positive impact of income on food prices should not be surprising. Indeed, income
growth in emerging economies has been often mentioned as a key driver of past decade’s food price increases. Yet, the
relationship between income and food prices (along with its consequences) is a complex one. As early as the mid-1800s
the statistician Ernst Engel observed that as income grows, the proportion allocated to food expenditures declines (the so-
called Engel’s Law). A century later, Kindleberger (1942) emphasized a key consequence of Engel’s Law: Prices of primary
commodities will be declining relative to the prices of manufacturing goods; stated otherwise, terms-of-trade (ToT) decline
as income grows. Kindleberger’s thesis was empirically verified by Prebisch (1950) and Singer (1950) independently—thus
leading to what has been termed the Prebisch-Singer (P-S) hypothesis. By many accounts, these observations formed
the intellectual foundation on which the industrialization policies of the 1960s and 1970s were based upon, that is heavy
taxation of agricultural commodities in favor of manufacturing goods, especially in low income countries.

This box reconciles the (assumed) positive income-food prices relationship and the P-S hypothesis. Specifically, it sum-
marizes earlier (Baffes and Dennis 2013) and ongoing (Baffes and Etienne 2014) analysis and shows that income has a
negative and highly significant effect on ToT for food commodities, a result which is consistent with the P-S hypothesis
and, by extension, with Engel’s Law and Kindleberger’s thesis. While this finding sheds light on the negative relationship
between income and ToT, it is not clear whether the effect operates through the agricultural price channel (the numer-
ator of ToT), the manufacturing price channel (the denominator of ToT), or both. Next, a modified version of the model
was employed and showed that the impact operates through the manufacturing price channel. That, in turn, weakens
the view that income growth by emerging economies has played a major role during the past decade’s run up of food
prices. Other key findings include the importance of energy costs, followed by physical stocks, and monetary conditions.

Income growth by emerging economies has been often cited as a key driver to the post-2004 food price increases.
Krugman (2008) argued that the upward pressure on grain prices is due to the growing number of people in emerg-
ing economies, especially China, who are becoming wealthy enough to emulate Western diets. Likewise, Wolf (2008)
concluded that strong income growth by China, India, and other emerging economies, which boosted demand for food
commodities, was the key factor behind the post-2007 increases in food prices. Similarly, the June 2009 issue of Na-
tional Geographic noted that demand for grains has increased because people in countries like China and India have
prospered and moved up the food ladder. The role of demand by emerging economies has been highlighted by numer-
ous other authors including Hochman and others (2011) and Roberts and Schlenker (2013).

To better understand the food price-income relationship, a reduced-form price-determination model is utilized (similar to the
one described in box 2). Specifically, annual prices (1960-2013) for 6 agricultural commodities (maize, soybeans, wheat, rice,
palm oil, and cotton) adjusted by manufacturing prices (i.e., commodity-specific ToT) were regressed on two macroeconomic
indicators (the US$ exchange rate against a broad index of currencies and the interest rate), the stock-to-use ratio, crude oil
prices as a proxy for energy costs, and income (global GDP). These six commodities account for most of world’s arable land.

The six equations were estimated as seemingly unrelated regressions (Table B 3.1). The fundamentals explain more
than two thirds of the commodity price trends, while 23 out of 30 parameter estimates (excluding the constant terms)
were significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level of significance. The effect of income on the ToT is negative
and highly significant for all commodities, with the parameter estimates ranging within a very tight band, from -0.56 for
soybeans and wheat (t-ratios = 5.56 & 6.23) to -0.75 for cotton (t-ratio = 5.56).

To examine the sensitivity of results with respect to the measure of income used, the model was re-estimated by utilizing
income measured in market and Purchasing Power Parity terms for global, Low and Middle Income countries, and just
China and India both in aggregate and per capita terms, giving a total of 12 income measures. Table B 3.2 reports pa-
rameters estimates of these 12 income measures (only the income parameter estimate is reported). The results confirm
the income-ToT negative relationship for all commodities and income measures at the 1 percent level of significance.

Next, to identify the channel through which income affects ToT, the model was modified by expressing the price variables
in nominal terms and including manufacturing prices in the set of explanatory variables. This version of the model is
similar to the one discussed in box 2 (see also Baffes and Dennis (2011) for more details). The results regarding the ef-
fect of income on ToT (reported in Table B 3.3) are quite revealing. With the single exception of soybeans the parameter
estimates of income are not significantly different from zero. Replicating the model by utilizing all six income measures
evaluated at market prices and PPP terms, shows that, with the exception of soybeans, income exerts an impact on
nominal prices on only a few occasions (Table B 3.4).

The results for the remaining fundamentals are as expected. The parameter estimate of the stocks-to-use (S/U) ratio is
negative and highly significant in all 6 commodities, implying that a low S/U ratio (consistent with scarcity) is associated with
high prices and vice-versa. The S/U ratio elasticities are remarkably similar across the two models (Tables B 3.1 and 3.3).



                                                               24
They are also similar to findings reported elsewhere. For example, Bobenrieth, Wright, and Zeng (2012) estimated correlation
coefficients between S/U ratios and real de-trended prices for wheat, maize, and rice of -0.40, -0.50, and -0.17    , respectively
(compared to -0.61, -0.50, and -0.21, respectively, in the present study.) Similarly, FAO (2008, p. 6, figure 3) reported correla-
tion coefficients between the cereals price index and various measures of S/U ratios ranging from -0.47 and -0.65.

The oil price parameter estimate was significantly different from zero in all cases; its average across all 6 commodities
is 0.20, implying that a 10 percent increase in energy costs increases the ToT by 5 percent. This is an important finding
because oil prices tripled during the recent boom, implying that energy costs account for half of past decade’s price

increases. The strong relationship between energy and non-energy prices has been established long before the recent
boom. Gilbert (1989), for example, using quarterly data between 1965 and 1986, estimated transmission elasticity
from energy to non-energy commodities of 0.12 and from energy to food commodities of 0.25. Hanson, Robinson, and
Schluter (1993) based on a General Equilibrium Model found a significant effect of oil price changes to agricultural pro-
ducer prices in the United States. Borensztein and Reinhart (1994), using quarterly data from 1970 to 1992, estimated
transmission elasticity to non-energy commodities of 0.11. Baffes (2007), using annual data from 1960 to 2005 estimated
elasticities of 0.16 and 0.18 for non-energy and food commodities, respectively. A strong relationship between energy
and non-energy prices was found by Chaudhuri (2001) as well.
