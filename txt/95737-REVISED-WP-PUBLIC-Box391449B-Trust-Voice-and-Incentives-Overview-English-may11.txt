T    his book examines the role of incentives, trust, and engagement as critical determinants of service
     delivery performance in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region. Focusing on
education and health, the report illustrates how weak external and internal accountability undermines
policy implementation, service delivery performance, and citizens’ trust and how such a cycle of poor
performance can be counteracted. Case studies of local success reveal the importance of both formal and
informal accountability relationships and the role of local leadership in inspiring and institutionalizing
incentives toward better service delivery performance.
Enhancing services for MENA citizens requires forging a stronger social contract among public
servants, citizens, and service providers while empowering communities and local leaders to find “best
fit” solutions. Lessons learned from the variations within countries, especially the outstanding local
successes, can serve as a solid basis for new ideas and inspiration for improving service delivery. Such
lessons may help the World Bank Group and other donors, as well as national and local leaders and
civil society, to develop ways to enhance the trust, voice, and incentives for service delivery to meet
citizens’ needs and expectations.



“This magnificent work is a model of multidisciplinary research and judicious harvesting of multiple
 sources of relevant data to assess why many MENA countries lag on vital education and health outcomes.
 In opening our eyes to the causes of failure, the book breaks new ground in pointing to how
 improvements in public services can uplift citizens and bolster the prospect for democratic governance.”

“This report highlights innovative social accountability as a crucial element in improving the quality,
 efficiency, and equity of educational and health provision services in the MENA Region. It looks at
 how innovative engagement of citizens as an entry point to monitor and evaluate education and
 health services can create pressure on leaders, government officials, and service providers to improve
 their performance.”

“This book makes valuable contributions by highlighting the importance of ‘soft’ inputs, notably
 multiple dimensions of governance, in driving the improvement of service delivery and by emphasizing
 the importance of the quality and not just the supply of social services. At the same time, the report
 delves into some of the deeper underlying social and political issues that stymie efforts to improve the
 quality of services in the ‘cycle of performance.’ The report homes in on the roots of service delivery
 problems, such as provider absenteeism, poor quality of teaching or medical care, and shortages of
 medicines and textbooks. Together, the theoretical and empirical chapters show that these problems
 require more than technical or financial solutions. Rather, these kinds of issues can often be addressed
 by devoting attention to cross-cutting components of governance such as transparency, public sector
 management and institutions such as the civil service or courts, and social environments that promote
 citizen action. Attending to bottlenecks in governance processes is necessary to solve a variety of service
 delivery problems.”
