   The most important drivers of agricultural growth—facilitated by
   policy reforms since the 1980s and strategic investments in research
   and infrastructure—have been irrigation expansion, modern
   technology (high-yielding varieties), better road connectivity, more
   efficient markets, and increased mechanization. High real prices have
   helped farmers in recent years, but only by preventing a further
   deterioration of the terms of trade, which remain well below the levels                                                                                               The time is opportune to explore the most effective and efficient ways
