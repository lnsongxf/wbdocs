         Key Water and Sanitation Sector Challenges
         XXSecuring   stable and long-term financing for compliance investments. To achieve long-term
            compliance with the requirements of European Union legislation in the water sector, as stated in
            the Kosovo Water Strategy, €1.1 billion will have to be invested in the water sector over the next
            20 years. This represents an annual capital expenditure of €55 million, or at least twice the current
            funds dedicated to investments.
         XXIncreasing  water utility billing collection. An improvement in the cash collection ratio of water
            companies would increase revenues by 50%. Moreover the current tariff levels burden the budgets of
            disadvantaged social categories. This threatens the financial sustainability of water utilities which are
            unable to collect payments from 15% of residential customers belonging to those social categories.
         XXImproving    the efficiency of utilities to enhance their sustainability. Water utility efficiency is
            currently limited by reduced revenues and increased operational expenses. Improving efficiency
            could significantly improve the sustainability of utilities by decreasing operational expenditures
            and providing additional funds for asset renewal and investment.

Economy. Kosovo is a lower-middle-income country and among the poorest in Europe, with a poverty headcount ratio of
6.8% (KAS 2011b). Kosovo is, however, among the few countries that have shown resilience since the 2008 economic crisis,
with sustained economic growth of around 3% (Gov. KS 2014). This growth is due to the country’s macrofiscal stability
and to the implementation of ambitious capital infrastructure spending programs. Kosovo is a small country (10,908 km2),
with 1.8 million inhabitants (World Bank 2015), among which Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptian minorities face many difficulties.
Remittances from the diaspora have played an important role in maintaining a sustainable economic environment by
supporting household incomes and domestic demand. However, with a reported unemployment rate of 30% and a youth
unemployment rate of 55.9%, the economic climate has not proved sufficient to improve the overall socioeconomic situation
(Gov. KS 2014). Despite declared policy aspirations of the Government of Kosovo, the country is not yet an EU candidate.
Five EU member states still have not recognized the independence of Kosovo, which is one of the stumbling blocks to
further EU integration. The integration process officially began in March 2003, when the Stabilization and Association
Tracking Mechanism (STM) between Kosovo and the EU was signed. Negotiations on the Stabilization and Association
Agreement between the EU and Kosovo started in October 2013, and were completed in May 2014 (MMPH 2014).

Governance. Kosovo is a parliamentary republic defined under a constitution adopted in 2008, after the country
declared independence. Its administration is organized at the national and local levels. The country is divided into 7
districts and 38 municipalities (KAS 2014). The municipalities are responsible for local public services, and the responsibility
for the provision of water supply and sanitation services is shared between the central and local governments (Law
2012/04-L-147 on Kosovo Waters).

Water resources. With 1,600 m3/capita/year, Kosovo has limited renewable internal freshwater resources (MMPH
2004). To partly address hydrologic constraints, Kosovo has developed five large reservoirs (Badovci, Batllava, Gazivoda,
Përlepnica, and Radoniqi), which are used for water supply, irrigation, industry, and hydropower generation. Groundwater
reserves are limited and are located mainly in western Kosovo. Climate change projections indicate that climate variability
will increase, with warmer temperatures and increasingly irregular precipitation, giving rise to an increase in water demand,
droughts, floods, and forest fires. The recent precipitation deficit, with less than 50% of the baseline inflow, has already
caused a dramatic drop in accumulations in the Batllava, Badovci, and Përlepnica reservoirs, seriously endangering the
water supply for the central and eastern parts of Kosovo. Climate change factors are causing increased concern about
adequate flood protection in Kosovo. According to the assessment contained in the Water Master Plan of 1983, a 1,000-
year flood event could have profound impacts on river basins (the Drini i Bardhë River basin, the Ibri River basin, the Lepenci

Basin, and the Morava e Binçës basin). This assessment concludes that about 491 km of rivers are threatened by flooding
in Kosovo, but only 28% is regulated (MMPH 2014).

Water supply sources. Sixty percent of the drinking water in Kosovo comes from surface water (ICPDR 2015). The
five reservoirs in use have a current total capacity of 500 Mm3. The quality of raw water from surface water in Kosovo is
generally moderate, since the water is abstracted from artificial reservoirs. Some water sources are reportedly polluted
or potentially endangered by organic contamination due to lack of wastewater treatment, neglected maintenance of the
sewerage system, intensive deforestation, or agriculture. The main rivers downstream of big municipalities and industry,
especially downstream of Priština, the capital, are so polluted that the water cannot be used as a source of water supply,
and in some places, not even for irrigation. The main polluters of the surface waters are municipalities and industries.
Municipalities and communities discharge their wastewater without treatment. There is no precise information on
groundwater extraction capacity. As a result of unfavorable hydrological conditions, underdeveloped water resources, and
increasing service demand, the country faces quantitative shortages (MMPH 2014).

Service provision. Provision of water and wastewater service is the                                  Figure 1: Water services provider

Policy-making and sector institutions. The water sector in Kosovo is regulated at the national level. The Kosovo
water sector is organized following river basin management principles, and the country has developed a consistent
strategy and master plan. The Kosovo water sector involves relationships among various actors at the national level
(Figure 2), the most important of which are::

XX The  Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, which is responsible for management and administration of Kosovar
    water resources, which include drafting laws and sublegal acts, development of policies and strategy, issuing and
    monitoring water rights, protection of water resources, and inspection (MMPH 2015).
XX The   Ministry of Economic Development, through its Policy and Monitoring Unit and the Board of Directors of water
    companies, is responsible for administration of Regional Water Companies. Whereas Policy and Monitoring Unit staff
    are ministerial staff, the Board of Directors is composed of experts appointed by the ministry for a three-year period
    following a competitive process, with applications and interviews. Half of the members, including the chairman,
    represent the ministry, and the rest represent serviced municipalities (MZHE 2015).
XXThe   Water and Wastewater Regulatory Office, which is responsible for the economic regulation of the water sector.
    Regulation includes licensing of water companies, tariff setting, setting minimum service standards, and monitoring
    of customer protection. The director and his or her deputy are appointed by Parliament, whereas the rest of the staff
    involved in sector regulation are permanent personnel (WWRO 2015).
XX The   Inter-ministerial Council for Waters, which is composed of seven members from four line ministries2 and is chaired by
    the prime minister of Kosovo. The council provides opinions on and recommendations for laws and other sublegal acts
    relating to water management and their implementation, drafting and approval of the National Water Strategy, and policy
    development in the field of water (KNMU 2015).
XX The  National Institute for Public Health (NIPH), which is responsible for monitoring drinking water quality. NIPH is part of
    University Clinical Center of Kosovo and has contractual arrangements with water companies for monitoring drinking
    water quality (NIPH 2015).

Capacity and training. Stakeholder capacity has improved significantly, but further enhancement is needed,
especially in technical areas. In recent years, stakeholders have gained competence and expertise in areas such as
operational management, corporate governance, economic regulation, policy planning, and service compliance. Despite
evident progress, further enhancement of capacities is needed, especially with respect to service providers and in the
fields of efficiency improvement, capital investment planning, and service compliance. According to the 2013 Household
Budget Survey published by the Statistical Agency of Kosovo, the average monthly wage in Kosovo is €336, which is
considerably less than the average monthly wage of employees in RWCs (€517) (KAS 2013). A high remuneration level
combined with a high unemployment rate makes employment in water utilities attractive. The workforce reluctance
to leave water utilities, and the limitations on new staff recruitment for efficiency reasons, considerably reduce staff
turnover. Despite positive developments in recruiting qualified personnel, a majority of staff have only secondary
education3. Given the need to address imminent efficiency challenges, such as nonrevenue water (NRW) reduction, cost
efficiency improvement, and sustainable asset management, enhancing the qualifications of utility staff is a necessity.
For now, donor projects play the main role in capacity building of utility staff.4 The water and wastewater association of
Kosovo, SHUKOS, established in 2001, also aims at developing more structured training and capacity-building programs.

Economic regulation. Since 2002, economic regulation has been under the umbrella of a dedicated Regulator for Water
and Wastewater Services. Tariffs for water and wastewater service are regulated by the Water and Wastewater Regulatory
Office. The tariff-setting process is carried out once every three years according to the Regulator’s guidance. The approved
tariffs cover a three-year period and are reviewed in the second and third year. Service providers estimate tariffs and
investment plans following a specific process, and submit their request for approval to the Board of Directors. Following
the board’s endorsement, these tariffs are submitted for final approval to the regulator. The tariff-setting process is carried
out among service providers, the regulator, and customer consultative committees. In principle, tariffs should provide
adequate recovery of operating expenses and investments on the one hand, and remain affordable for serviced customers,

Equity of access to services. Compared to urban inhabitants, rural inhabitants have lesser access to public water
and sewerage services, and poor households encounter hardships paying water bills. Access to public service
in Kosovo is unequal between urban and rural areas due to historical reasons, though the situation is continuously
improving thanks to sizable infrastructure investment. Moreover, 84% of the poorest segment of the population (living
on less than $2.50/day) has access to piped water supply and 76% to flush toilets (Authors’ elaboration). Affordability
remains a serious concern for the poorest segment of the population, however, especially since there is no water bill
exemption or assistance scheme in place for these populations. There is no statistical information available regarding
access to water and sanitation for marginalized minorities.

Service infrastructure. The water infrastructure is relatively well developed, yet the situation for wastewater is not
satisfactory. Thanks to persistent investments, the old and obsolete water network infrastructure is being replaced,
with continuous improvements in that respect. The wastewater network is half the length of the water network,
and substantial investment is needed to improve it. The most critical situation, though, relates to the wastewater
treatment service, for which the infrastructure is inadequate (WWRO 2013).

Quality of service. Water service quality is relatively good, with further possible improvement. Yet the lack of wastewater
collection, and especially treatment infrastructure, affects the quality of wastewater service. According to the 2013
performance report, microbiological compliance for the whole water sector was 98.4%, and physical-chemical compliance
rose to 97% (WWRO 2013). In most cases of breach, bacteriological water quality has been downgraded by the presence of
coliform and e-coli. Service continuity in 2013 was 22 hours/day (WWRO 2013).

Customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction surveys are conducted yearly. It is mandatory for each public water company
to conduct an annual customer satisfaction survey and to report the outcomes to the Ministry of Economic Development.
The results of the 2013 survey show 40% of customers are very satisfied with service, 43% are satisfied, 14% are moderately
satisfied, and only 4% are not satisfied (MZHE 2015). According to the Gallup international poll, 60% of the Kosovar population
is satisfied with the water service provided. This rate is lower than other countries in the Danube region (Gallup 2013).

Overall efficiency. The efficiency of service providers is moderate, with significant room for improvement.
Despite steady improvements in recent years, efficiency gains can still be made. For instance, nonrevenue water
levels in 2013 reached 57%, negatively affecting service costs and service level (WWRO 2013). This high level
of NRW is due to a combination of factors including outdated infrastructure, outdated metering devices, data-

handling errors, and water misuse. Staff productivity in 2013 was 6.6 employees per 1,000 connections (WWRO
2013). The billing collection rate was 71%, revealing internal utility inefficiencies and unresolved affordability
issues with customers (WWRO 2013).

Recent trends. Efficiency of water and wastewater utilities is improving, but at a modest pace. Implementation
of a performance monitoring platform in Kosovo in 2005 has enabled tracking and monitoring performance
development of water and wastewater utilities. During 2005–2013, the billing collection ratio and the metering
level increased steadily, allowing better measurement of water consumption and generation of more revenues
for utilities. However, other indicators, such as NRW, showed no efficiency gains (Figure 4). The staffing level
and operating ratio remained stable, with limited improvement. As a result, operations costs still prevent further
efficiency gains (WWRO 2013).

Overall sector financing. Tariffs fully cover O&M expenses but the sector relies on external funding for capital
investment. Water and wastewater utilities are organized according to self-financing principles (application of
cost recovery tariffs). Yet due to inefficiency, service providers cannot recover O&M expenses, which must be
complemented by subsidies. The municipal service Mitrovica receives local subsidies to cover its O&M expenses.
Investments represent 77% total sector spending and are funded through transfers and national taxes fund (Figure 5).
Figure 6 graphically displays the main sources of funding of water and wastewater utilities, using the OECD’s three Ts
methodology (tariffs, transfers, and taxes).

meet demand. In the Kosovo Water Strategy, investments needed are estimated to exceed €1 billion over the next
20 years, which represents a total effort of 17.3% of GDP and a yearly effort of 0.86% of GDP. Investment needed for

water amounts to €350 million—€128 million for extension of water supply, €93 million for drinking water treatment,
and €143 million for rehabilitation of the existing network. Investments needed for wastewater amount to €740
million, including €300 million for sewerage extension, €220 million for wastewater treatment, and €220 million for
rehabilitation of existing sewers. To meet these needs, investment needs to be doubled over the projected period to
€29/capita/year (Gov. KS 2014).

Investments. The main funding for investments comes from donors, international financial institutions, and the
government, with modest contributions from utilities. Since the end of the conflict in 1999, more than €250 million
has been invested in the water and wastewater sector, representing €17/capita/year and 0.3% of GDP per year.
Seventy-four percent of those investments were funded by international donor institutions and 26% by the central
government budget through taxes. Since 2009, the funding scheme has been more balanced, with a noticeable
increase in the government’s contribution to 54%, a decline in donor grants to 42%, and water company funding of 4%
of all investments (Figure 7).

Cost recovery. Water and wastewater service providers fall short of funding for investment projects. Kosovo’s
legal framework requires application of full cost recovery principles for water tariff setting. Service tariffs foresee the
achievement of several targets, implying improvement in billing and cash collection efficiency, reduction of water
losses, optimization of costs, and implementation of investment plans. Yet these targets are not achieved, causing
reduced available cash and increased O&M expenses. As a consequence, water companies hardly meet running
operating expenses and have to limit capital investment. To a large extent, this gap is covered through government
funding and donor grants. Some operational subsidies are provided to the Mitrovica Water Company to cover costs
incurred for water provision for the northern part of the city5. (Gov. KS 2014)

customer type (residential, commercial, or institutional). For instance, the standing fee amounts to €1/month for
residential customers and €3/month for commercial and institutional customers. Tariffs as set by the regulator are
supposed to cover running and capital costs. In practice, however, due to problems in billing collection and low cost
efficiency of utilities, they hardly cover O&M costs, falling short of securing adequate capital funds (WWRO 2013).

Affordability. Water and sanitation services are affordable for a majority of the Kosovar population, except for poor
households. The mean water and sanitation invoice potentially represents 2.3% of household average income. But this ratio
amounts to 3.4% for households in the bottom 40% of monthly income connected to public service (Figure 8). The situation
is further aggravated for social categories that are not exempt from water bills and receive no supporting subsidies.

The main sector challenges are:

XXSecuring    stable and long-term financing for compliance investments. Kosovo Water Strategy Objective No.
   2.5 “Approximation of National Legislation with EU Directives” establishes the principle of “Achiev[ing] long-term
   compliance with the requirements of European Union legislation in the water sector.” To achieve this objective,
   €1.1 billion will have to be invested in the water sector over the next 20 years. This represents an annual capital
   expenditure of €55 million, or at least twice the current funds dedicated to investments (Gov. KS 2014). This
   will require an increase in utility internal funding sources and in government grants. Another option might lay in
   borrowing soft loans and attracting private investment.

XXIncreasing   water utility billing collection. The Kosovo regulatory framework requires water companies to charge
  full-cost tariffs and that no customer is exempt from water bill payment regardless of their social category. An
  improvement in the cash collection ratio of water companies would increase revenues by 50%. The current level of
  tariffs burdens the budget of disadvantaged social categories, which receive no assistance in paying their water
  bills. This situation threatens the financial sustainability of water utilities, since revenues from tariffs are used
  to recover operational costs. Indeed, water companies indicate that it is almost impossible to collect water bill
  payments from 15% of customers in the socially disadvantaged categories (Gov. KS 2014).

XXImproving  the efficiency of utilities to enhance their sustainability. Performance improvement of key indicators
  remains modest compared to historical trends. The existing level of efficiency is limited by reduced revenues and
  increased operational expenses. As a consequence, most utility cash is spent in recovering recurrent costs, with
  minimal O&M efforts, which adversely affects service quality. There is great potential associated with efficiency
  improvement, since nonrevenue water and energy cost reduction could decrease operating costs by 25%. This
  would result in a significant improvement of utility sustainability, with greater O&M efforts and additional available
  funds for asset renewal and investment (Gov. KS 2014).
