Serving the Needs of
Indonesian SMEs
main findings
IFC’s SME Banking Indonesia Project aims to address the gap in SME banking by supporting a small number of
strategically placed banks to more fully and deeply penetrate the SME banking market. As part of the program
activities, the SME Banking survey was conducted to create information for commercial banks and other stakeholders
to 1) identify SME market segments that might be effective to target; 2) determine appropriate products, channels
and marketing strategies, and 3) make informed decision to expand SME lending. This survey was conducted
jointly by: NORC and Yayasan Inovasi Pemerintahan Daerah (YIPD).

SME Banking Indonesia Project is funded by IFC Advisory Services in Indonesia, and the governments of Australia,
Japan, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Switzerland.

Executive Summary
Small and medium firms48 in Indonesia and elsewhere consistently report problems in obtaining access to credit,
and there are some indicators of bank reluctance to move strongly into this market. Current pressures are pushing
commercial banks in the direction of this market, however, at least in part because of tough competition and margin
erosion in the corporate market. Banks have responded by competing to serve mostly the strongest “medium size”
firms. But margins here have also sharply tightened, pressuring banks to serve smaller-size firms. What is the real
story?

This report addresses this question using hard information obtained through three related surveys:

      1.	 An in-depth survey of a representative sample of 602 small-medium firms in large cities.
      2.	 A survey of 20 commercial banks and other financial institutions and 3 informal lenders, which gathered
          information on the full array of loan products and bank operations in the credit market for small-medium
          businesses.
      3.	 Visits to two branches of each of 26 commercial banks and other lenders by a ‘mystery shopper’ posing as a small
          business owner inquiring about taking a loan.



Small and Medium Firms’ Use of Financial Services
Our survey of small-medium firms inquired about use of 14 different financial services, yielding the following
information:

      •	 Three services dominate: a savings or deposit account (88 percent of firms), ATM cards (60 percent), and
         sending and receiving transfers (28 percent).
      •	 Only two other services are used by as many as 10 percent of firms: demand accounts (13 percent) and business
         loans (13 percent).
      •	 Six services -- credit cards, personal loans, factoring, telephone banking, internet banking, and bank payroll
         services -- are used by 3-7 percent of firms.
      •	 Fewer than 1 percent use the remaining three service possibilities: international transfers, letters of credit, and
         leasing.

Future borrowing estimates by firms. Ten percent of small-medium firms took out loans in the 12 months prior to the
interviews, with the value of all loans totaling IDR 10.5 trillion. Their borrowing plans for the next year indicate a
substantial increase in activity. Eighteen percent of firms plan to borrow—20 percent of small and 11 percent of
medium firms—for a total of IDR 35.9 trillion.

Significant shares of small-medium firms (15 percent or more) expressed interest in additional internet-based financial
products, property insurance, and some transaction products.




48	   Micro firms are explicitly excluded.  These are small and medium firms as defined by BPS.  For convenience, we refer to them as SMEs in the text.

What do these firms want in financial services providers? Of ten characteristics listed in the survey, four got a positive
response from 55 percent or more of the owners/managers interviewed:

   •	 low fees,
   •	 speed in making loan decisions,

   •	 flexible lending policies,
   •	 limited documentation requirements.



Lenders’ Views of the Small-Medium Business Market
The financial institutions surveyed see lending to small-medium businesses as an important part of their business
plans.

   •	 Ninety percent rated such lending as “very important.”
   •	 All of the 14 respondents who provided a prediction for 2010 said loan volume to this market will top 2009;
      their predictions average out to a 20 percent rise.

Indonesian financial institutions, despite some commentary to the contrary, strongly focus services on loans and
savings/demand accounts. Nineteen of the 20 lending institutions, in response to a direct question, said they would
take actions to expand their share of the small-medium business market. At least four out of five who responded to a
more detailed question said they were taking nine direct action to do so:

   •	 Two actions are increasing training of loan and other bank officers.
   •	 Three are expanding delivery channels through (1) adding to branch networks,(2) opening special branches for
      SME banking, and/or (3) upgrading on-line banking particularly for bill paying and other transactions.
   •	 Three are strengthening the loan origination process: two are streamlining and speeding loan processing,
      and giving more authority to branch managers to make decisions. The third is improving loan underwriting,
      including more site visits to firms.

 One is expanding product promotion of SME products, particularly through the availability of brochures in branch
offices.



The Mystery Shopper’s Experience
Mystery shopping, the process in which someone poses as a client to learn how clients are being treated, is commonly
used by retail firms, including banks, to monitor service quality. In each visit, our mystery shopper inquired about the
same hypothetical loan for a small commercial laundry firm and learned the following:

   •	 Banks, as institutions, vary substantially in products offered and loan requirements. But most individual branch
      banks offered just one. Thus, although there is product variation in the overall small-medium business loan
      market, particular businesses can only find out about that variation by shopping around themselves.
   •	 Bank officers’ service quality is often quite poor. 
   •	 Very little cross-selling of other products is done even when a client is in the office.

Why the Disconnect between Lenders’ Expressed Intent and Client Experience?
Since (1) a substantial share of the small-medium size firms expressed interest in a range of products beyond loans
and basic transactions accounts, and (2) senior bank managers affirmed strong interest in that market and described
a long list of initiatives being taken to expand market share, we might expect a firm owner visiting a branch office to
be offered a range of additional products and receive excellent service. Why is this not happening? Two possibilities
come to mind.

First, perhaps financial institutions are not as strongly committed to expanding their small-medium firm client base and
deepening their banking relations with existing clients as they say they are. This would be surprising, however, because
bank executives clearly see this market as profitable and as sharply expanding.

Second, and more likely, is that even though senior managers may be committed to expansion, their small-medium
firm initiatives may be implemented poorly. The explanation is plausible, given the steady increase in the number
branch offices, whose staff may be poorly trained or motivated. In either case, efforts to build banking relations with
small-medium firms need to be rejuvenated if they are to succeed.

Acknowledgements
A major survey project like the one described here is dependent on the goodwill and generosity of potential respondents.
We have been fortunate that so many owners and managers of small-medium size businesses and senior bank officers
were willing to take the time to answer questions we put to them. Since the questionnaires were long and in some
places complex, our respondents’ contributions were far greater than for the usual survey.

The authors especially thank Kabul Sarwoto, who directed the surveys and other YIPD activities. In addition, we
gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the interviewers, their supervisors, the data input specialists, and all the
other “behind the scenes” staff that did such a fine job.

Roger Thomas Moyes, Neil Philip Ramsden, and Nyoman Gde Satrya Wibawa at the IFC office have been particularly
helpful. They helped the project access Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) data and contacted lenders to encourage them to
participate in the bankers’ survey. They also provided useful previous Indonesian SME studies and gave thoughtful
advice along the way.

Dr. Satwiko Darmesto and Mrs. Yayah at BPS cooperated efficiently with the project to provide us with data from the
2006 Economic Census, which was essential for drawing a representative sample of small and medium firms.
Finally, we wish to thank Felicity Skidmore for an excellent editing of the final draft report and Imelda Demus at
NORC for managing report production.

1.	 Introduction
In Indonesia’s economy, as in many other developing nations, micro, small, and medium enterprises (SMEs) play an
important role. BPS estimates that in 2006 they constituted 99 percent of all businesses in the country, employed 97
percent of the work force, and accounted for 54 percent of that year’s GDP. The great majority of all Indonesian firms
are micro enterprises—about 82 percent. Small and medium firms account for a significant but much smaller share of
all firms, 15.8 and 0.6 percent, respectively.

The focus of this analysis is on the comparatively small share of firms in the small-medium group (16.4 percent
together). These are the firms that have the potential for sustained growth. Their potential for growth is evident because
they have already cleared the hurdle of transitioning from micro to small firm size, which is quite large in Indonesia .
Compared with other South East Asian developing countries, for example, as the Asia Foundation states: “this middle
sector failed to develop as it should because government policies favored large enterprises while creating, via high
regulatory hurdles, incentives for firms to remain small.”48,49

SMEs in Indonesia and elsewhere consistently report problems in obtaining access to credit. Consultants to KfW note
that finance shortages are more problematic among small and medium firms than micro firms in Indonesia because of
ready lending sources for small loans.50 On the other hand, contemporary pressures are pushing commercial banks in
this direction. One factor is the tough competition and margin erosion in the corporate market. Banks have responded
to this by competing to serve the strongest “medium size” firms. But margins here have also sharply tightened, creating
pressure to move further down the size spectrum.

But can the banks be actually doing this effectively, given the continuing complaints of the firms in this market that
they lack access to credit? This study seeks to shed light on this seeming paradox by addressing a series of questions:

      •	 Although access to credit is the traditional vantage point from which bankers consider the SME market, the
         more appropriate target is the potential for marketing the full array of banking services, including deposit
         accounts, insurance, and transactions services. To what extent are Indonesian banks providing a range of
         services for the small-medium size group?
      •	 Designing a strategy to serve this market requires detailed information on market size and composition. Can
         distinct markets be defined by firm size, location, industry or other attributes for which products can be defined
         and marketed?
      •	 What do firms most want in dealing with financial institutions? Is it only price? How important is service
         quality? What are firms’ preferences for different distribution channels?


Our analysis provides hard information on (1) small-medium firms’ banking services requirements and their current
use of services; and (2) the supply of banking services to them. This information was obtained through three related
surveys:

      •	 An in-depth survey of a representative sample of 602 small-medium firms conducted in large cities (over 250,000
         population). (This choice was driven by the strong lender coverage in such cities and the project’s budget
         constraints on interviewer travel to more widely dispersed sites.)

49	   Of course, a significant number of micro firms do grow to be small firms.  A 2005 study of small and medium firms in East Java found that 53 percent of the firms then rated as small
      had started out as micro enterprises (DAI, 2005, p.64).

      •	 A survey of 20 commercial banks, other formal financial institutions, and 3 informal lenders (“loan sharks”) that
         gathered information on the volume of SME deposit products, type of liability and transactional products
         offered to SMEs, loan volumes, loan terms, and similar data. Respondents were also questioned about delivery
         channels and initiatives being undertaken to reach the small-medium firm market.
      •	 Visits to two branches of each of 26 commercial banks and other lenders by a ‘mystery shopper’ posing as a small
         business owner inquiring about the possibility of taking a loan. These visits provide concrete information on the
         actual interest of commercial banks in extending loans and cross selling products to such borrowers.

The presentation is organized as follows. Chapter 2 presents findings from the survey of 602 firms. Chapter 3 presents
findings on registered institutions and informal lenders’ relations with small and medium firms. Chapter 4 presents the
results of the investigation of service quality provided to small-medium loan applicants and the extent of competition
among lenders to provide loans, as documented through ‘mystery shopping’ at 52 commercial banks and non-bank
financial institutions. Highlights of findings are presented at the ends of chapters 2-4. Chapter 5 provides our major
conclusions.51

2. 	Small-Medium Firms’ Use of Financial
	 Services
This chapter examines the demand for financial services for small-medium firms. Data from the 602 completed firm
interviews are the foundation of the analysis.

The discussion is organized as follows. Section 2.A gives an overview of the sample firms’ characteristics. Section 2.B
provides details on the small-medium firms’ use of 14 different banking services. Section 2.C provides details on the
firms’ experience in taking loans—both successful and unsuccessful cases. Plans for borrowing in the year after the
survey are summarized and Sharia-compliant loan use is examined. Section 2.D provides additional detail on the
modalities for payments from customers and to suppliers, liquidity management practices, property insurance coverage
and sources, and internet use. Section 2.E presents small-medium firms’ expressed preferences for banking services.
Section F examines differences with gender of the ownere/manager in the patterns reviewed. Section 2.G highlights
the main findings.

In all tabulations each observation has been weighted so that the combined sample gives a valid representation of small-
medium firms in cities of 250,000 population or more. Where underlying sample size is small enough to constitute a
reliability concern, this is noted.52



2.A Overview of Sample Firms
Basic information on small-medium firms is given in Table 2.1.53 The great majority of firms are small (86 percent),
with 64 percent of firms having monthly revenues of IDR 50 million or less. Only 4 percent have monthly revenues
of over IDR 400 million.

      •	 Most owners or managers are in the 25-59 age group, 72 percent are men, and 70 percent have more than five years
         management experience.54 Only 30 percent of owners/managers joined the firm within the past five years.
         Combined with the fact that 32 percent of firms were created since 2001, this suggests that most of the owners/
         managers with short tenures are with new firms. Thus, the overall picture is one of a cadre of owners/managers
         with significant experience in running the firm.
      •	 Nearly 70 percent are sole proprietorships. The next most important legal form is a limited corporation, which
         accounts for about 9 percent of firms.
      •	 The great majority of firms (over 80 percent) used the owner’s savings for start-up capital, with loans from the
         extended family and friends accounting for most of the rest.

Information more specifically on business operations is given in Table 2.2. About 64 percent of firms have 100 or
fewer customers per year. Somewhat surprisingly, 17 percent have over 500. The overall average number of customers
for small firms is 148 and for medium firms 298. As one would expect, the average number of customers varies widely
by industry type: construction firms and manufacturers average 27 and 76 customers, respectively; health services and
social activities services average 464; education services average 402. Wholesale and retail trade average 159, which
seems an understatement unless the same client is counted only once even if he/she makes multiple purchases.



52	   Another report presents additional tabulations for the more important SM industries and for certain sub-populations of particular interest to the IFC, such as the location of firms by
      city size, the gender of the owner, and size of firm.
53	   Additional detail on the points in the paragraph is available in Annex D, especially Table D.3.
54	   The respondent was either the owner or the manager and the survey obtained information about this person’s age, gender, and education.
          4                Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




Firms average just under 10 employees. Over 80 percent have fewer than 10 workers; 17 percent have between 10 and
49 workers; only the remaining 1.2 percent are larger.


When asked which of a list of multiple factors were key for development of his/her business (respondents could choose
as many as they liked), financial considerations dominated:
    •	 The need for more capital was the most frequent response (59 percent); closely related was gaining access to
       loans (19 percent).
    •	 The second most important response was stronger marketing and promotion of their products (31 percent).

When asked about constraints (respondents could only choose one), finance was again dominant (Figure 1).

      •	 Just over a quarter (26 percent) named insufficient finance as the main constraint. Interestingly, another 9
         percent said that financial management was their greatest challenge, suggesting a significant opportunity for
         financial institutions to provide financial management services.
      •	 Insufficient demand, although expected to be a prominent constraint, was named by only 19 percent.
      •	 The only other factor named by as many 10 percent was a shortage of inputs and raw materials.55


Figure 1: Most Important Problem/Obstacle Faced by SMEs




The prominence of finance in the responses to both the key positive factors for development and the key constraints
is notable and points to an underserved market. This pattern is somewhat different from that observed in past studies
-- suggesting that the severity of financial constraints has either increased over time or become more binding on firms
operating in large cities.




55	   We know from other studies that it is likely that the materials’ shortages primarily affect manufacturers (Susilo and Sutarta, 2004).
                                                                       Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings   5




The average values and percent distributions of three financial ratios are reported in the table.

      •	 Revenue to assets is a standard ratio that indicates how effectively assets are being used. (A revenue to assets
         value of 10, the average value for the included firms, indicates that assets are being well-used.) However, within
         this satisfactory average, 30 percent of firms report values of 3 or under, indicating very poor capital use. About
         38 percent report values greater than 6, and 24 percent have a value of over 12.
      •	 The average amount of assets per employee is IDR 34 million.56 There is wide variation, however, as is expected
         given the diverse industries included, with over half having under IDR 16 million per worker and 22 percent
         over IDR 40 million.
      •	 Revenue per worker is a standard metric of business efficiency. On average, each worker is associated with IDR
         167 million in revenue. Most (53 percent) have values in the IDR 60-70 million range, but 26 percent have
         values of over IDR 300 million.

Regarding profit and revenue changes in the past two years, the most frequently reported monthly profit as a percent of
revenues at the time of the survey (i.e., 2009) was in the 9 to18 percent range (Table 2.2). Hardly any (2 percent) firms
reported a loss; 16 percent reported low profits (1 to 8 percent of revenues). At the other end of the range, 19 percent
reported 2009 profits of over 35 percent. Overall, 80 percent of firms said they were doing well enough to provide
a reasonable return on equity (i.e., profits over 9 percent, on the assumption that the firm’s equity is only modestly
leveraged).

These profit figures must be treated with caution, however, because they are hard to reconcile with revenue changes
reported by the same firms for the previous two years. From 2007 to 2008, for example, 43 percent of firms reported
a revenue increase averaging out to about 19 percent. Another 27 percent reported a revenue loss averaging out to
23 percent. The remaining 30 percent reported revenues that stagnated. The reported situation for the previous year
(2006-2007) was broadly the same. This leads to the suspicion that more firms actually suffered a revenue loss during
2009 than reported one -- unless revenue-losing firms were able to cut expenses as quickly as revenues declined.

International, and even regional trade for these firms’ operations is, according to their own reports, unimportant.

      •	 Over 90 percent of sales are local; only 3 percent are within Indonesia but outside the locality.
      •	 International clients account for less than one-half of one percent of the market share. Interestingly, a much
         larger share of firms (9 percent) have some foreign language competence, divided between English and Chinese.
         At the very least, this suggests some potential for increasing their international activities.



2.B Use of Financial Services
A wealth of information on 14 financial services that small-medium firms could be using was collected in our survey
(Table 2.3) In interpreting the information, the reader should keep in mind that many entries are based on a small
number of observations. Six percent of firms in a category means about 36 respondent firms, for example, even though
the weighted number of firms is much greater.

Clear patterns emerge (Figure 2):

      •	 Three services dominate: a savings or deposit account (used by 88 percent of firms), ATM cards (60 percent),
         and sending and receiving transfers (28 percent).
      •	 Only two other services are used by more than 10 percent of firms: checking accounts (13 percent) and business
         loans (13 percent).


56	   In January 2010 the exchange rate was about 1 USD = IDR 9,300.
      6          Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




   •	 Each of six other services is used by only 3 to7 percent of firms): credit cards, personal loans, factoring, telephone
      banking, internet banking, and bank payroll services.
   •	 The remaining three services are used by less than one percent of firms: international transfers, letters of credit,
      and leasing.


Figure 2: SMEs’ Use of Financial Products and Services




Personal loans were included elsewhere in the survey because analysts wanted to explore the frequency with which
firm owners used the proceeds of personal loans for business purposes. We asked, for example, whether the owner
maintained separate business and personal accounts.

   •	 Sixty percent reported mixed business-personal accounts, and 28 percent reported taking a personal loan for
      business purposes. The main reasons given for taking the personal loan for business was that they needed the
      money quickly (61 percent) and a personal loan is a lot easier to get (22 percent). The latter is certainly credible
      given the requirements listed to the mystery shopper (as reviewed in Chapter 4).

Use of particular products depends, of course, not only on their availability but also on firms’ demand for them. For
example, Indonesian textile and garment manufacturers complain of problems getting letters of credit (LOC) to finance
production (La Inggi, 2008). And as shown below (Chapter 3), not many banks are offering LOCs to small-medium
firms. On the other hand, although business loans are readily available from licensed lenders, a substantial share of
small-medium firms does not take loans from them.

We can illustrate the value of these data by reviewing the information on two services in detail—ATM cards and
business loans. These are selected because they are a frequently purchased service and have quite different response
patterns from each other.

ATM Cards
  •	 Commercial banks almost totally dominate this market (Figure 3), reportedly issuing 97 percent of the cards;
     rural banks are second, with only 2 percent.
  •	 Card holders report two primary reasons for having ATM cards: the transaction process is smooth and simple
     (54 percent) and using cards is cheaper than using other transaction means (32 percent).
  •	 Major reasons why a particular institution was chosen for this service (respondents could give more than one
     reason) include: convenience of the service point (49 percent), having another account at the bank (30 percent),
     and believing the service is very good (17 percent).
  •	 Only 23 percent of respondents reported comparison shopping for their ATM card.
  •	 Satisfaction with the card services is very high. Major reasons driving the satisfaction (respondents could give
     multiple responses) are: (1) security of the transaction (45 percent), (2) ease of the transaction (32 percent), and
     (3) breadth of the distribution system (31 percent).


Business Loans
   •	 Commercial banks are the largest player in this market as well (Figure 4), although less dominant (named by 60
      percent of respondents) than in the ATM market. The other main providers of business loans are cooperatives
      (20 percent), suppliers (11 percent), and Sharia banks (5.4 percent).
   •	 To acquire working or investment capital was the main reason given (by 49 percent) for taking a loan (respondents
      could give multiple reasons). About 17 percent said they used the loan for liquidity management.
   •	 About 13 percent reported taking loans from informal sources.


Figure 3: Finance Institutions Selected for ATM Cards
       8         Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




   •	 Only 19 percent of comparison shopped—suggesting that many applicants may have applied once, been
      rejected and not applied again.
   •	 The most frequent “principal reason” given for selecting a particular institution was past experience with that
      lender (39 percent of firms). A related principal reason was having other accounts at the institution (19 percent).
      This kind of loyalty indicates the payoff to good services and cross selling. The next most frequent primary
      reasons were a convenient location (25 percent) and the best interest rate (18 percent).
   •	 A surprisingly high proportion of firms reported their financial institution as their source of information about
      business loans -- general information (30 percent), a brochure from the institutions (22 percent). Family
      members/friends were reported as the most important source of information by 48 percent.
   •	 Reported satisfaction with their loan experience was very high, with only 4 percent being less than fully satisfied.
      Speedy service was given as a prime reason for satisfaction, along with the procedure being viewed as being
      simple, and perceived security.
   •	 The dominant delivery channel was a bank branch officer (reported by 83 percent of respondents); 13 percent
      reported being able to arrange their loan with telephone banking. The same factors that influence borrower
      satisfaction with the loan application process are also those influencing the delivery channel choice. These
      factors appear to be very important, as they are given as the primary reasons for making the change by all
      borrowers who switched providers (4.5 percent of the total).

Experience with Sharia-Compliant Products
About 5 percent of SME firms reported having taken a Sharia compliant loan in the past (Table 2.3). Here we explore
owners/managers’ knowledge of Sharia products more generally and their experience with these products.

      •	 Only 15 percent of respondents said they knew about Sharia products and services (Table 2.4).
      •	 Those who are informed learned about the products from brochures they picked up, from friends and family
         members, and from television shows.
      •	 Of those who said they did not know about these products, 29 percent said they planned to learn about them.
      •	 When asked if their firms used such products, only 2 percent of respondents said yes.57

Of the lenders with whom respondents had Sharia product experience, three are relatively dominant: Bank Muamalat
Indonesia, Bank Syariah Mandiri and Bank Bukopin Syariah. In reviewing the findings immediately below, keep in
mind that they are based only on about a dozen observations.

      •	 Most (90 percent) said they were satisfied with the products. Interestingly, the qualities respondents reported on
         positively are the same as the main reasons given by respondents for loans and other services: simple procedures
         (65 percent), fast processing (33 percent), and a good relationship with the bank officer (44 percent).



57	   This is not inconsistent with the 5 percent of loans being Sharia compliant.  Recall that only 13 percent of firms reported taking a loan.
           10               Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




      •	 Main complaints, the same as for loans and services, were inconvenience of the Sharia banks’ locations and,
         related to this, their limited branch networks.



2.C Focus on Loans
This section presents information on small-medium firms’ experiences in applying for their last two loans. The
information presented above on borrowing is based on more general questions about the use of financial services. The
first part presents an overview of firms’ experiences in being approved and/or declared not qualified. The second part
examines what plans these firms have for taking loans in the next year.


Overview of Firms’ Experiences
It is important to note that only about one-quarter of these small-medium firms has applied to a financial institution
for a loan. Respondents were asked a series of questions about their experience in obtaining their last two loans and
in being rejected for two loans, if they had such an experience.58 (Detailed information on these loan application
experiences and associated loan products is presented in Table 2.5.)

Commercial banks are the most frequent credit source, accounting for 76 percent of the loans issued. Cooperatives are
in second position (11 percent) followed by Sharia banks (3.1 percent). Commercial banks also have the distinction
of most often rejecting applicants (90 percent of total rejections), followed by suppliers denying credit to firms (5.7
percent of total denials).

      •	 Factors determining choice of lender follow the pattern seen above for loans and other financial services. The
         main points are convenience of location, ease of the application process, and a relationship with the financial
         institution or a particular bank officer.
      •	 Loan amounts are modest, averaging IDR 354 million for loans issued. Fully 24 percent are under IDR 15
         million and only 21 percent are over IDR 200 million.59 The purpose for taking the loan is spread over a half-
         dozen categories with the largest, purchase of raw materials, accounting for only about 30 percent of all loans
         made. Loan terms are short, with over 39 percent being for a single year and 50 percent for 2-3 years.
      •	 Three-fourths of loans issued had flat interest calculation contracts.60
      •	 Only 1.1 percent of loans are structured as Sharia products, although 3.1 percent of loans were originated by
         Sharia banks. This is consistent with statements to the team by those making “Sharia-compliant” loans that they
         seldom enter into loan contracts where profit sharing determines the amount of repayment.61

Three major points emerge from the responses of those who were refused loans.

Those who were refused had to produce documentation (legal documents, a company profile, and audited financial
statements) much more often than did successful loan applicants. A positive interpretation of this might be that the
lender wanted to make the loan and requested additional information to develop a case for doing so.

Nearly half of the rejected applicants did not know why they were rejected! If lenders are indeed not providing the
reasons for rejection, this is very poor practice. Borrowers are unlikely to improve a particular operational element to



58	   The recall period is not limited to any specific time but loan applications actually submitted are the subject of this analysis. The entries in this table may not correspond closely to the
      responses under business loans in Table 2.3, because the questions in this case are about specific loans while those for the previous table were more general.
59	   The mean value of loans not originated, IDR 969 million, is correct.  The sample included one very large loan and that observation received a large weight in the weighting procedure.
60	   The figures on interest rates and the basis on which interest is computed, i.e., flat, annuity with declining balance, etc., are difficult to interpret in the tabular format in the table.  These
      features, and collateral requirements, come in packages defined by each lender.  We review several such packages in Chapter 4 (Table 4.9).
61	   The information in the table on collateral requirements, which is similar to that in reviewed in Chapter 4, is not summarized here because it is not plausible as stated.   The statistic
      that only 29 percent of those successful in obtaining a loan had to produce collateral for the loan, combined with Table 2.3’s statistic that only 13 percent of those taking business
      loans said they used an informal lender, suggest that a number of regulated financial institutions are originating loans without collateral.  This is quite at odds with the practices
      financial institutions reported, as reviewed in Chapter 3.  We suspect some misunderstanding on the part of firm owners or managers.
                                                                                  Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings                              11




overcome an obstacle to obtaining credit if they do not know the problem.

The principal reason given (to 40 percent of those rejected) was insufficient collateral. This is consistent with the
observation in the previous chapter that lenders rely heavily on adequate collateral to make most loans.


Borrowing Plan for the Next 12 Months
Here are the major findings about the loan plans of small-medium firms for the next 12 months (Table 2.6).

      •	 In the next 12 months, firms plan to take loans for a total of IDR 35.9 trillion, compared with the prior year’s
         total of IDR 10.5 trillion.
      •	 In the next 12 months 18 percent of these firms plan to borrow—20 percent of small firms and 11 percent of
         medium firms. As one would expect, medium size firms are planning on much larger loans than their small
         counterparts. Fully 66 percent of medium firms plan loans over IDR 250 million, compared to only 18 percent
         of small firms.62
      •	 When asked if they would be interested in taking a loan without having to pledge collateral, about half said
         they would (regardless of firm size). When asked if they would be willing to pay an extra 1 percentage point in
         interest for such a loan, 53 percent of small firms said “yes,” in contrast to only 20 percent of medium firms.



2.D Use of Selected Other Services

Payments to Suppliers and Staff
Provision of payment services to firms—both payroll and payments to suppliers--is a potential growth area for financial
institutions. This section examines current payment practices of small-medium firms.

Payments To Suppliers. In the survey responses on these payments, respondents reported the three most important
payment methods (Table 2.7). Knowing the number of suppliers firms pay each month should be key to understanding
the choice of payment method. That number is not large.

      •	 Over 80 percent of firms pay 10 or fewer suppliers each month, 54 percent 5 or fewer. Only 8 percent pay more
         than 20 suppliers.
      •	 Over 90 percent of firms make cash payments to at least some suppliers, not suprisingly given the small number
         of payments made. In second place as a means for paying suppliers is a cash transfer (35 percent). In contrast,
         telephone banking and internet banking are used hardly at all (by 1.2 and 0.6 percent of firms, respectively).

Methods of paying suppliers differ significantly by the number of suppliers being paid, with the change point at firms
paying more than 20 suppliers a month.63

      •	 Firms with 20+ suppliers make payments by cheque 25 percent of the time (versus less than 8 percent for all
         firms), cash transfers 17 percent of the time (versus 35 percent), standing orders 7 percent of the time (versus 1
         percent), and wire transfer 6 percent of the time (versus 4 percent).

In selecting payment method for suppliers three reasons clearly dominate: speed of the transaction (79 percent),
security of the transaction (46), and simplicity of the transaction (46 percent). A simple cash payment made at the
firm has all these characteristics.


62	   These firms say they plan to borrow from loan sharks and cooperatives with about 88 percent coming from loan sharks.  This distribution of lenders is very hard to reconcile with the
      figures on financial services utilization given by the same respondents, where the dominate source among licensed lenders was commercial banks.
63	   The data cited in this paragraph are not in the table.
      12          Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




Other findings:

   •	 Only 2 percent of firms reported making international payments. Somewhat surprisingly, 40 percent of firms
      making international payments make them in cash. Another 39 percent make them with a cash transfer.

   •	 Most make only a few payments a year. But nearly one-quarter make payments a minimum of four times per
      month and another 14 percent twice a month. All firms use their “first choice” bank for transactions where an
      intermediary is needed.
   •	 A good exchange rate and a wide network (presumably of correspondent banks) are the most important
      consideration reported selecting the bank, with 77 and 83 percent of respondents naming them, respectively.
      The emphasis on a good exchange rate corresponds to unstable exchange rates being the biggest problem with
      making international payments (cited by 45 percent of those making such payments).

Payments To Staff. The great majority of firms (90 percent) use cash for this purpose, with some variation by number
of employees. Middle-size firms (20-100 staff) use wire transfers to a comparatively large extent (about 16 percent of
such firms) and payroll services (30 percent). Firms with very large staffs strongly favor wire transfers (87 percent of
firms—but based on only four unweighted observations).

The reasons for selecting a particular payment method for staff are similar to those for supplier payments: quick, secure,
easy.

To reimburse staff for business expenses the dominant method is again cash (90 percent of firms). Cash transfers are a
distant second (3.2 percent). Reasons for the choice are again quickness, security, and ease.


Payments from Customers
Small-medium firms are not particularly flexible in the type of payments they accept from customers.

   •	 Virtually all accept cash payment, but only 30 percent accept bank transfers to the company’s account, the
      second most frequently accepted payment form (Table 2.8). Cheques and credit cards are accepted by only 10
      and 6 percent of firms, respectively. Cash may be preferred to facilitate tax avoidance.
   •	 About half offer extended terms for payment, with most (88 percent), surprisingly, charging no fee. Perhaps
      interest charges are frequently built into the price. The remaining 12 percent charge a fee if installments extend
      over three months.

With such a narrow range of current payment options, there would seem to be room to introduce small-medium firms
to the idea of offering a broader array, if they are willing to have records that could be reviewed by the authorities.


Property Insurance
Only 12 percent of small-medium firms carry property insurance (Table 2.9). Of the 12 percent, 29 percent report
purchasing it from banks, Thus, banks have less than 4 percent of this potential market. Among those not having
insurance, 80 percent have no plans to acquire such coverage. Of the 20 percent who do, most plan to seek it from
insurance firms rather than banks.

Firm size matters a great deal here. While only 7 percent of small firms carry property insurance, 42 percent of medium
size firms do. Medium size firms may well be a good target for property insurance products, particularly if approached
through cross selling.
                                                                                    Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings                              13




Internet Banking
Only about 17 percent of firms currently use computers and the internet (59 percent of medium versus only 10
percent of small firms). Only 3.5 percent engage in internet banking, suggesting that this should be a service ripe for
expansion.

When respondents who now use computers and the internet were asked if they would be interested in purchasing an
internet-based tool for purchasing and payment management, a surprisingly large share (23 percent) said they already
do (18 percent of small, 29 percent of medium firms). Another 4 percent said they were “very interested” and 25
percent expressed some interest in acquiring such a tool.64 Some said they would even pay small amounts to do so.


Liquidity Management
Avoiding liquidity crises is particularly important for small firms, who may otherwise have to go to informal lenders to
secure emergency funds, the high cost of which may aggravate an already difficult situation.

      •	 Only 9 percent characterized their current cash flow over the past year as illiquid (Table 2.10). Another 46
         percent said they were “in balance” and 44 percent reported a surplus.
      •	 Most (70 percent) forecast future cash needs based simply on their past cash flow experience. Only 9 percent
         actually make revenue and expenditure projections to inform their cash needs. Those making projections,
         however, exhibit the same pattern of being in surplus and deficit (illiquid) as firms using other techniques.
      •	 Nearly one-third of firms are “somewhat dissatisfied” or “very dissatisfied” with their liquidity management.
         This is not surprising given the above statistics that about half are doing a poor job in managing liquidity (i.e.,
         they are in surplus or deficit).
      •	 Medium-size firms are no more satisfied with their cash management than smaller ones -- suggests a financial
         services opening for medium firms, who are presumably more willing to pay for them.
      •	 By far the most common cash position management is to hold ready cash, rather than marketable securities. No
         firm reported having an overdraft facility and less than 1 percent has a line of credit arranged.

Of those not satisfied with their liquidity management, 15 percent stated that they would be interested in help from
a bank. Their interests are broader than simple cash management, being better characterized as “general financial
management” and “strategic business planning.” Marketing products in this direction may well be warranted, especially
if existing clients can be approached.



2.E Expressed Banking Preferences and Sources of Advice
Up to now we have examined the products small-medium firms select as a way of determining their preferences for
different types of financial services. An alternative approach, and possibly an indicator of where the market may be
going, is to ask these same owners/managers directly about their preferences.

When asked what they considered the most important bank (financial) services characteristics, respondents could
choose up to five (Table 2.11). Four garnered a positive response by more than 50 percent of respondents (Figure 6).

      •	 The most frequently cited characteristic is the size of fees charged (68 percent); lower is better.
      •	 The other three leading reasons are loan decision speed, flexible lending policies, and limited documentation
         requirements.




64	   In this case small firms are more progressive.  A larger share of small firms than medium size (39 versus 18 percent) said they were “very interested” or “interested.”
       14         Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




Respondent views of lender service preferences were solicited by asking them to score four statements using a scale from
1 (=really disagree) to 5 (=strongly agree).

   •	 Over half gave a 5 rating to “the biggest factor in selecting a lender is the interest rate.”

All other three statements --which address whether the borrower would pay a 1 percent incremental interest charge for,
respectively, a better loan product, a highly efficient loan origination process, and better staff attitude and knowledge
-- received ratings of only 1 and 2 from at least 40 percent of respondents, and none scored 4 and 5 from more than
30 percent of respondents.

Price is king according to these responses. But they should be treated with caution because they do not match some
others in the survey. For example, when asked about why they selected the specific institution to make them a loan
(Table 2.3), convenience of location and past experience with the institution came before interest rate. Second, only
19 percent of respondents to the earlier questions said they had comparison shopped for loan terms. Lastly, the large
differentials in current loan terms documented in the “mystery shopping’ exercise (described in Chapter 4) indicate that
price competition among lenders is fairly weak.

The overall conclusion is that price, though important, clearly interacts substantially with location convenience.


Figure 6: Most Important Characteristics for Bank Service




When owners/managers were asked to name the “best lender” based on the qualities they had named in earlier responses,
BRI and BCA were tied for first (with 18 percent of all nominations). BNI (with 6 percent) was a distant third.
                                                    Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings   15




An important question for financial service institutions concerns client attitudes toward charges for certain services.
We asked if it was reasonable for institutions to charge more for in-branch service than for ATM or on-line services.
Only 20 percent of respondents agreed. Of those willing to pay extra, virtually no one would pay over IDR 15,000.

Asked whether their firms need external business or financial advice, only 15 percent of owner/managers said yes. For
those who needed help three areas were cited by over half the respondents: strategic business planning, marketing, and
general financial management. But they were not willing to spend much for such services (80 percent citing a figure
of IDR 250,000 or less). This suggests that guide books, other materials, and occasional seminars to which strong or
potentially strong clients could be invited for a modest fee could resonate in this market.

Only 9 percent of the relatively small group saying they need help have purchased help in the past (most commonly
a university or other course). Interestingly, they were well-satisfied with their experience, even though they spent
significant sums for the training (54 percent spending more that IDR 1 million).



2.F Differences Associated with the Gender of the Owner/Manager
It is easy to hypothesize that women owners or managers of SMEs behave differently from their male counterparts.
Women may have less formal training in finance and less experience making financial transactions. On the other hand,
men may be less risk averse and be using a wider variety of financial services.

This section highlights major differences between the firms and financial services used by male and female SME owners/
managers. Full tables showing these differences are included in the project’s “Market Segments” report (Struyk et al.,
2009b).

With respect to basic firm characteristics, the data show that women-headed firms are:

   •	 Smaller when measured by monthly revenue: 82 percent have turnover of IDR 50 million or under versus 56
      percent for male-headed firms;
   •	 More concentrated in wholesale and retail trade: 63 versus 46 percent; and more likely to be a sole proprietorship—
      77 versus 62 percent.
   •	 Less concentrated in Jakarta compared with other big cities: only 13 percent of female-headed firms in large
      cities are in Jakarta versus 30 percent for the male-headed.

When asked about the most important problem facing their firms, male respondents cited financial management or
insufficient finance 41 percent of the time, while only 23 percent of female respondents did.

Regards use of financial services, female-headed firms are

   •	 Less likely to have a savings or deposit account (79 versus 92 percent for male headed firms);
   •	 Less likely to have taken a business loan sometime in the past (6 percent for women and 16 percent for men);
   •	 Use other services at about the same rate as men.

When asked about the last two loans the firm had taken,

   •	 Borrowers of both genders get loans from commercial banks three-fourths of the time; but while the second
      source of loans for male-headed firm was cooperatives, it was informal sources for women-headed firms;
   •	 12 percent of women owner/managers borrowed from informal sources versus 7 percent for men.
   •	 Asked why the borrower selected a particular institution, male-headed firms cited convenience of the branch
      location and recommendation from the friend as the top two reasons, but women respondents cited having
       16         Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




       another account at the financial organization and an easy application process as the most important.

Women-head firms are less likely to have property insurance (13 percent for men vs. 5 percent for women) or use the
computer and internet in their business (18 for men versus 8 percent for women).

In making financial transactions, such as paying suppliers and employees, both types of owners rely heavily on cash
payments; but male-headed firms more often use wire transfers for these transactions than women. On the other hand,
women-headed firms have a much higher incidence of standing orders from customers (68 versus 10 percent).


Lastly, regarding Sharia-compliant products,

   •	 Female owner/managers less often said they knew about such products (10 percent vs 18 percent for men); only
      2 percent of male-headed and 1 percent of female-headed firms actually use these products;
   •	 Women owner/managers most often (49 percent) cited bank officers as their source of information about these
      products; but men get their information most often from brochures and from family members and friends (45
      percent in both cases).

The overall picture that emerges is that women owners/managers generally have a lower level of interactions with
financial intermediaries than their male counterparts and women tend to use informal mechanisms more often than
rely on formal financial institutions.



2.G Chapter Summary
The key factors small-medium businesses gave for developing their businesses (multiple responses were allowed) are financial:
the need for more capital (59 percent) and, closely related, gaining access to loans (19 percent). Stronger marketing
and promotion of their products was also important (31 percent).

The main constraints they face (only the most important was recorded) were again dominated by financial considerations:
insufficient finance (26 percent) and, closely connected, financial management (9 percent). The latter constraint
suggests a significant opportunity for financial management services expansion. The key nonfinancial factors named
were insufficient demand (19 percent) shortage of inputs and raw materials (10 percent).


Financial Services Used
Three services (out of a possible 14) are dominant: a savings or deposit account (88 percent of firms), ATM cards (60 percent),
and sending and receiving transfers (28 percent).

   •	 Only two other services are used by as much as 10 percent of firms: demand account (13 percent) and business
      loans (13 percent).
   •	 Credit cards, personal loans, factoring, telephone banking, internet banking, and bank payroll services are used
      by 2-7 percent of firms.
   •	 Almost no firms (less than one percent) use international transfers, letters of credit, or leasing.

Most small-medium firms rely at least partly on personal loans: mixed business-personal accounts (60 percent), a personal
loan taken for business purposes (28 percent). The main reasons given are needing the money quickly (61 percent) and
that it is much easier to get (22 percent).

Most firms concentrate their financial services in a single financial institution (68 percent). Only 2 percent have 3 or more
accounts at a single institution, mostly reflecting that firms typically have only 1 or 2 accounts.

Loan Experience
Only 30 percent of small-medium firms have ever tried to obtain a loan from a licensed lender; of these 77 percent were
successful.

For the specific loan transactions discussed, commercial banks are the most frequent credit source for small-medium firms,
accounting for 76 percent of the loans issued. Cooperatives are in second position (11 percent) followed by Sharia banks
(3.1 percent). Informal lenders were not asked about in this question.


Factors determining the choice of lender are convenience of location, ease of the application process, and a relationship with
the financial institution or a particular bank officer.

Loan amounts are modest, averaging IDR 354 million for loans issued. About a quarter (24 percent) are under IDR 15
million; only 21 percent are over IDR 200 million. Loan terms are short, with over 39 percent being for a single year
and 50 percent being for 2-3 years.

Three-fourths of loans issued had flat interest contracts – a particularly striking finding.


Plans for Borrowing in the Next 12 Months
In the next year such firms plan to borrow IDR 35.9 trillion, compared with 10.5 trillion reported for the year before the
interview. Eighteen percent of firms plan to borrow next year—20 percent of small firms and 11 percent of medium
firms.

Medium firms are planning on much larger loans than their small counterparts, as one would expect. Fully 66 percent of
medium firms plan to take loans over IDR 250 million, compared to only 18 percent of small firms.


Making Payments
     Suppliers. Most suppliers of small-medium firms get paid in cash, but larger firms use other methods more often
     than smaller firms do. Larger firms (20+ suppliers) make payments by cheque 25 percent of the time (versus less
     than 8 percent for all firms), cash transfers 17 percent (versus 35 percent), standing orders 7 percent (versus 1
     percent), and wire transfer 6 percent (versus 4 percent).

        Staff. The great majority of these firms (90 percent) use cash to pay staff, but the larger the firms the more likely they
        are to use other methods. Middle-size firms (20-100 staff) use wire transfers (about 16 percent of such firms)
        and payroll services (30 percent) to a comparatively large extent. Firms with very large staffs strongly favor wire
        transfers (87 percent of firms, based, it should be noted, on only four responses).

        Payments from Customers. Virtually all small-medium firms accept cash payment, but only a minority accept other
        forms of payment. No more than 30 percent accept bank transfers to the company’s account, the second most
        frequently accepted payment form. Cheques and credit cards are accepted by only 10 and 6 percent of firms,
        respectively.

Internet Banking
Only about 17 percent of firms reported currently using computers and the internet, with larger firms more likely to do so.
Almost 60 percent of medium firms do, versus 10 percent of small firms.

Only 3.5 percent engage in internet banking, suggesting that this should be a service ripe for expansion.


Liquidity Management
By far the most common cash position management is to hold ready cash.

Nearly one-third of firms are “somewhat dissatisfied” or “very dissatisfied” with their liquidity management. Given that about
half are doing a poor job in managing liquidity (i.e., they are in surplus or deficit), this dissatisfaction is unsurprising.

No firm reported having an overdraft facility and less than 1 percent has arranged a line of credit.


What Small-Medium FirmsWant in Financial Services
Respondents were asked about the most important characteristics (for obtaining financial services). Respondents could
name up to five characteristics. Four responses garnered a positive response from 55 percent or more of the owners/
managers interviewed.

Out of five possible characteristics, the most frequently cited as most important is the fee (68 percent); lower is better. Three
other commonly cited characteristics (each by about 50 percent), are speed of making loan decisions, flexible lending
policies, and limited documentation requirements.

3. 	Financial Institutions’ Views about and
	 Practices in Lending to Small-Medium
	 Enterprises

3.A Introduction
This section provides a comprehensive look at the views of commercial banks and other financial institutions about
providing financial services to small-medium firms and documents their experience in doing so. The data are based on
responses from the 23 institutions listed in Table 3.165 -- 9 commercial banks, 3 rural banks, 3 cooperatives, 3 multi-
finance companies, 3 informal lenders, and 2 regional development banks.

The rest of this section provides some clarifications about the data in this section. Section 3.B reviews financial
institutions’ opinions about the prospects for the financial services market for small-medium firms. Section 3.C
presents information on financial institutions’ approach to working with these firms. Section 3.D discusses the range
of non-loan products offered to small-medium firms. Section 3.E details financial institutions’ loan products, terms,
and conditions. Section 3.F describes the actions financial institutions are taking to expand the volume of their
business with small-medium firms. Section 3.G contrasts the products, actions, and opinions of informal lenders
(“loan sharks”) with those of commercial banks and other financial institutions reviewed up to this point. Section 3.H
highlights the major findings of this chapter.


Small and Medium Firm Definitions
Financial institutions were asked to report on their operations with small and medium firms, as each defines such firms.66
Hence the data presented in this chapter combine figures that may be based on somewhat different definitions of small-
medium firm (shown in Annex B).

Firm size is nearly always defined by banks on the basis of loan size (so in this chapter we use firm size and loan size
interchangeably). Most, but certainly not all, define micro loans as those with values of under IDR 50 million. A
couple of banks define them as those with values under IDR 5 million. For small firms, the “standard” minimum value
is IDR 50 million; but the maximum loan size defining the category is highly variable, ranging from IDR 100 million
to 5 billion. Several banks have much higher standards in general, including BNI, BD, and HSBC. Informal lenders
(loan sharks) define firm size using much smaller loan amounts; for this reason they are excluded from the tables.


Note on Missing Data
The survey instrument consisted of two parts. The first requested certain hard information, such as the bank’s definition
of SMEs, the volume of small-medium firm lending and its share of the commercial bank’s total loan book, the
size distribution of small-medium firm loans, aged small-medium delinquent loans, the volume of demand and time
deposits that are from SMEs, and a substantial bloc on secured lending added at the IFC’s request. It is likely that
completion required some special tabulations and that someone in the accounting or finance department completed
the survey.




65	   The basis on which financial institutions were selected, response rates and other  topics are discussed in Struyk et al. (2009a).
66	   Elsewhere in the report the 2008 BPS definitions for small and medium firms are followed.  These are shown in Annex B.

The second part inquired about services and loan products offered to small-medium firms and about how the financial
institution sees lending to them in its overall business strategy. There are parallel questions on their attempts and
success in attracting deposits and marketing other products to these firms. Respondents were promised that individual
banks would not be identified.

Completion of Part 1 was very patchy overall. Either many firms do not keep records for different size firms/loans,
or they have the data available in principle but were unable to devote the resources necessary to prepare the special
tabulations required to fill in the requested data items. For a number of tabulations of interest to the project we need to
use data from several different survey tables. Very often only one or two, or sometimes no, financial institutions filled
in all the tables needed for a computation of interest to the study. The result is that not much “hard” information is
available on loan volumes and similar areas (although some of these gaps are covered by information gathered in the
“mystery shopping” interviews, discussed in Chapter 4.

Respondents filled in Part 2 much more thoroughly; so we are generally able to report results for these questions despite
many missing answers. (Since the number of responses generally varies within the tables presented, the number of
respondents (n) is typically reported.)



3.B Views of the SME Market
How do commercial banks and other lenders see the potential of the small-medium firm loan market? What are the
positives and negatives of lending, of attracting liabilities? This section addresses these questions.

The great majority of financial institutions (90 percent) see lending as a “very important” part of their business plans
(Figure 7, Table 3.2). It may well be that the other 10 percent have made a conscious decision not to compete in this
market. This positive tone is also present in responses to questions about the increasing importance of lending to small-
medium firms compared to larger businesses (Figure 8).

   •	 Some 83 percent said lending to small-medium firms is definitely increasing in importance; 89 percent said the
      market is “big and its prospects are good.”



Figure 7: Importance of Lending to SMEs

Figure 8: Banks’ Views of SME Market




What is drawing financial institutions to the small-medium loan market? When asked directly about what attracted
them, both pull and push factors were cited by half or more of respondents (see Table 3.3).

   •	 The pull factor (90 percent agreeing) is the profitability of the small-medium segment.
   •	 The main push factors are: the intense competition for retail customers and large corporate clients, and excessive
      exposure to retail customer sector.
   •	 Strong competition in the market, challenges in the legal and contractual environment, and specific factors
      for individual lenders were all cited as significant difficulties by at least 40 percent of those responding to the
      question.
   •	 Loan underwriting was tagged as more costly for the small-medium market than for other businesses.

About the regulatory environment, respondents overall did not perceive the regulations to be burdensome (Table 3.4).
Only 7 percent rated documentation requirements as excessive and only 12 percent said that the prudential regulations
have a negative effect on commercial banks’ involvement in the market.

About the role of credit bureaus in this market (also Table 3.4), half said they facilitate lending -- perhaps a larger share
than one might have expected since in many countries credit bureau coverage of smaller firms is fairly weak.

The foregoing are positive views expressed by financial institutions that small-medium firms constitute a growing loan
market. Are such firms also a potential source of liabilities through demand and savings accounts? The answer is “yes”
(Table 3.5).

   •	 Small-medium firms are rated by 77 percent of respondents as a “very important” source of funds currently; 77
      percent also rates their importance as definitely increasing” compared to larger businesses.
   •	 A large majority saw small-business liability volume expanding in 2009, with an average estimate of 21
      percent.
   •	 All institutions foresee an expansion in 2010, with an average estimate of 18 percent.

3.C Approaches to Working with SME Firms
This section explores how financial institutions have organized themselves to attract and serve the clients of small-
medium firms. We present information on the products offered and the channels for delivering services. We begin
with some indicators on the way financial institutions approach service provision to small-medium firms.


Overall Approach
The degree of priority a financial institution assigns to a market segment is often reflected in the way it organizes its
operations. There are usually revealing indicators of the attention actually given to a particular segment, as is the case
with the branch organization data we collected:

      •	 Three-quarters said that most of their branches are “plain retail branches,” suggesting that the majority of
         respondents either think capturing market share of SME firms is not terribly important or have a different
         business plan for doing so than providing special services at branch offices.
      •	 33 percent said that most of their branches have special counters for SMEs.
      •	 25 percent said they have branches that are fully dedicated business centers.

The survey explored this area further by asking three types of questions (Table 3.6): (1) the extent to which products
and strategies are designed specifically for the small- medium firm segment, (2) whether there is specially trained staff
for that segment, and (3) whether a specific bank divisions is dedicated to serving that segment.

Product and Strategy – Nearly half (44 percent) said they make the distinction between small and medium firms
“pretty consistently.” But another 31 percent said they view the two as the same market—and there is evidence from
the mystery shopping results to support this view. The remainder says they address the question as the need arises.

Training -- Almost half the responding institutions said they have trained specialists to work with SME clients, with
over 60 percent of those reporting a specialist in every branch. This is consistent with the mystery shopper’s experience
(reported in Chapter 4) that over 40 percent of the time the “shopper’ met with an SME specialist.

      •	 The statistics also show that some institutions are deploying more resources of this type to compete in this
         market than other banks.67

A Separate Division? -- Half of the 14 respondents who answered this question said they did have a separate division.


Delivery Channels
Information from the survey of small-medium firms presented in Chapter 2 documents the importance to these firms of
having convenient access to financial services. Financial institutions have responded to this preference, and presumably
that of retail clients, by creating large branch and ATM networks. They report that they have made large investments
in these facilities (Tables 3.7 and 3.8).

      •	 The average number of branches among the institutions reporting this information is 221. Thirty-five percent
         have 50 or fewer branches, but 15 percent have over 500.

      •	 For the 10 respondents to the ATM question, the average is 1,194 ATMs in operation; 20 percent report more
         than 1,000 machines, with the largest network having over 5,000.




67	   Further discussion of respondents’ activities to increase market share are presented below.
                                                                                   Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings                              23




It needs to be noted in this connection, however, that Indonesia is a very big country. So these large numbers of
branches and machines are unlikely to provide comprehensive coverage, even in large cities.

Do financial institutions set quarterly or annual goals for each branch on loan volumes and demand and savings
account volumes (Table 3.6)? Yes. Setting goals is a common practice, with between two-thirds and three-quarters of
respondents saying they do so.

Do they set separate goals for SMEs? An encouraging sign for the importance of that market to financial institutions
is that essentially the same share of respondents set separate goals for SMEs as set overall goals.

What about using brochures as a channel for interesting clients in additional products? Brochures are certainly viewed
as an effective marketing tool (Table 3.9). All financial institutions who responded to the question (18) produce and
distribute brochures targeted at SMEs. The majority of those reporting the number of brochures produced say they
produce five or fewer; 8 percent produce between 11 and 15.

The survey did not ask about how/where they are distributed (e.g., through branch offices, as handouts at meetings
of cooperatives business meetings). But we know from the responses of the small-medium firms themselves that
brochures are certainly available in branch offices, because the owners and managers frequently cite them as the source
of information about a particular service.

 Financial institutions were asked in five specific topics were covered in each of a maximum of five brochures (see lower
panel of Table 3.9). Nine respondents answered. The most frequent topic is specific loan products, followed closely by
ease of doing business with the bank, special SME services, and the advantages of having demand and savings accounts
with the bank. Almost none of the respondents gave any attention to the fifth brochure topic, payroll and bill paying
services.68


3.D Non-credit Products Offered
In considering the patterns reviewed in this section, keep in mind that NBFIs are not permitted to take deposits or are
restricted in the type they can take. One consequence is that ATM and transfer services are not offered.

Questions about non-credit product offerings (15 responded) found that the product most frequently offered to small-
medium business firms is savings accounts (offered by 80 percent). Demand accounts are in second place (59 percent).
No other product on the list is offered by as much 50 percent, including factoring, payroll services, and property
insurance (Table 3.10).

Overdraft facilities are offered to small-medium firms by only 35 percent of the 17 respondents answering. Only 28
percent offer credit cards in the name of a firm and half of these do so only for better clients.69 None of those offering
credit cards requires the business to keep a balance in a blocked account with the bank to guarantee payment.70

How capable are financial institutions in cross-selling and becoming the banker to a small-medium firm? The findings
are encouraging (Figure 9). Although 7 percent sell only one product and half sell only two or three to a particular
business, 29 percent report selling 4-6 products and 14 percent sell as many as 10. Thus, a significant share of financial
institutions appears to have succeeded in being the regular banker to a small-medium firm. There is a caveat, however:
these figures are surprisingly high given the data reviewed above on the incidence of services used by SMEs. They are
also much higher than the number of accounts small-medium firms report having with a single bank.


68	   Given the consistency of the responses across the first four brochure topics, it is possible that this part of the questionnaire was completed by respondents without much thought.
69	   Cards in the name of the owner/manager are being offered in addition.
70	   The survey included questions on how many credit cards the bank had outstanding in 2008 and the increase between 2008 and 2009.  Only three banks responded to the question.
          24            Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




A final question asked about product line-up is the extent to which three specified transaction services are viewed as
successful in generating business for other products: payroll services, bill paying services, and international transfers.
Respondents were asked to provide a score from 1 to 5 giving the extent of their agreement with the two “importance
questions” shown in Table 3.11. A score of 5 indicates strong agreement.

      •	 The strong view (86-90 percent) among the seven respondents to these questions was that payroll services
         and bill paying services are important for attracting customers. Opinion was more divided on the role of
         international transfers in this respect.
      •	 Asked about the importance of each separately as a revenue source, however, a large majority (71 percent) were
         positive for international transfers, compared with about 40 percent for payroll and bill paying services.

The overall picture is striking: Indonesian financial institutions, despite some commentary to the contrary, strongly
focus services narrowly on loans and savings and demand accounts. In part this may be because profits are reported to
be more likely with loans and savings accounts.71 It is also true that introducing new products is seldom profitable at
the beginning, making the narrowness of the non-credit product range at least somewhat understandable.

3.E Lending Activity
This section explores loan terms and conditions governing lending to small-medium firms. We begin with a review of
selected loan terms.




71	   See Table 3.26.
                                                                                    Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings                              25




Loan Terms. The data (Table 3.12) are based on information provided by three banks (selected from the five that
fully completed the loan terms table) on the range of terms they would propose to: a large firm (proxy for a “prime
borrower”), a small firm, and a medium firm.72 Firm size definitions are those used by the lenders. The banks were
deliberately selected to illustrate a range of loan book values (one small, one medium, one large).73 Here are the points
that stand out:

      •	 Interest rates. Interest rates vary substantially, with the small bank reporting clearly the highest. This variation
         may be misleading, however, because the effective interest rate depends on the type of interest rate structure,
         e.g., flat or some form of annuity regime. (For a more complete discussion of interest rates in this connection
         see Chapter 4.)
      •	 Application fee. The two larger banks have an origination fee equivalent to 1 percent of the loan principal; the
         small bank does not charge a fee.
      •	 Loan term. Maximum loan length is shortest for the small lender, at only 3 years. The mid-sized lender extends
         loans of up to 10 years to all three client types. The largest lender sets its maximum at 5 years. Apparently the
         mid-sized bank is better equipped to manage interest rate risk.
      •	 Loan amount. The maximum and minimum loan amounts offered by the small bank are the same for all client
         types. Both the mid-sized and large banks vary the maximum loan amount substantially. For example, the mid-
         sized bank will extend a maximum loan of IDR 10 billion to a large firm but only half as much to a medium
         size firm.
      •	 Collateral required. Survey responses on this issue by the small and medium lenders confirm that Indonesian
         lenders are generally asset-based rather than cash-flow lenders (i.e., they base their decisions on being able
         to recover borrower assets if a loan fails rather than whether the borrower’s project will generate a cash flow
         sufficient to pay off the loan). The small lender requires collateral the equivalent of 125 percent of the loan
         principal, and the mid-size lender 100 percent. The large bank, in contrast, requires lower collateral as a
         percentage of loan principal, indicating cash-flow lending with more sophisticated loan underwriting.74 All
         three lenders accept collateral in the form of movables, real estate, and/or land titles.

Accepted collateral and documentation. It has often been pointed out that micro and some small firms have difficulty
meeting these requirements. In expanding on the collateral topic by exploring the type of collateral that lenders take
for loans to small-medium firms and the documentation required, the survey asked respondents to select among four
answers, ranging from “standard practice” to “we do not use/accept this type” (Table 3.13).

Four types of collateral are generally used for loans to both small (9 respondents) and medium firms (8 respondents);
percentages indicate share of respondents rating the item as “standard practice”:

      •	   motor vehicles, for both size firms (78 percent of respondents for small, 75 percent for medium);
      •	   land with clear title, for both size firms (56 percent for small, 50 percent for medium);
      •	   buildings with clear title, for medium firms (50 percent);
      •	   buildings without clear title, for small firms (56 percent).

Rarely accepted are forms of movable property other than motor vehicles, or bank or personal guarantees.

Substantial documentation is required from would-be small-medium borrowers (Table 3.14), but with little difference
in the requirements between small firms and medium firms, as reported by lenders. There are considerable differences



72	   The loan terms a bank offers to a borrower depends in part on the size and purpose of the loan.  The questionnaire asked lenders to provide terms for a IDR 500 million loan for the
      purchase of equipment.  This controls for some variation in the terms that the lender would quote but actual terms will depend on its risk assessment and other factors.  In practice,
      respondents ignored this statement and provided terms of different types of clients.
73	   Presenting average values for the 5 banks that provided answers to this question is not very informative because of the wide range of values provided for each term.
74	   This pattern was the same for the other large banks that supplied information.
          26               Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




in the project and firm information the two groups of firms are required to submit, however.

      •	 Only 27 percent of lenders require small firms to submit a project proposal, compared with 64 percent for
         medium firms. That the latter percentage is not larger further reinforces the view that asset-based lending is
         more frequent.
      •	 Twice as many lenders require a projected cash flow for a medium company as for a small one.

Examination of the factors given the most weight in the underwriting decision is another perspective on lenders’
funding practices (Table 3.15). Respondents were asked to score the weight assigned to each of eight factors, with the
score ranging from 1 (not at all) to 10 (maximum weight).

      •	 Collateral receives the greatest weight, with 92 percent of respondents assigning it a value in the 8-10 range.

            Four additional factors scored in the 8-10 percent range for at least half the responding lenders (50 percent of
            small firms, 58-66 percent of medium firms): strong business record, the firm’s credit history with the lender,
            loan size, and loan purpose.

Loan principal patterns. We now turn to the distribution of actual loan amounts for small- medium firms. Again
information for three different-size banks is presented (Table 3.16).75 (These are not the same banks as featured in the
previous table.)

The client orientation of each bank class is immediately evident, with the average size of the loan for the banks increasing
with the overall size of their loan book. The small bank had no loans over IDR 400 million outstanding at the end
of 2008. The large bank, in contrast, has no loans this small outstanding and one-third of its outstanding loans with
principal amounts over IDR 5 billion.76

There is strikingly little difference in the loan size distributions for small and medium firms/loans, as reported by these
three banks, as compared with the case for large firms/loans (Table 3.17).

      •	 Loan lengths for both small and medium firms have tenors bunched in comparatively short-term loans: 60
         percent are 2 years or less.
      •	 Nearly 40 percent of loans to large firms are for 4 years or more, with only 35 percent for two years or less.

Clearly, large firms are viewed as less likely to experience severe difficulty as time passes.

Interest rate variation. Only a few banks responded to the survey question on whether they vary interest rates by
estimated risk and firm/loan size in the SME market.77 Hence, again we present illustrative figures from three banks—
small, medium, and large, as assessed by the size of their outstanding loans (Table 3.18).

None of these lenders vary interest rates with firm/loan size. Where there is variation, it is with estimated risk. In other
words, these lenders are not systematically using firm size as a risk indicator. Even more surprising, only the small bank
varies interest rates with estimated risk, and here the variation is large—from 22 to 36 percent for the best and worst
clients.78




75	   In this case taking the average of the percentage values in each loan size class produces percentage distributions whose sum differs substantially from 100.  Weighting the distributions
      by the size of loans shifts the distribution to the higher value loans.  We did not obtain data on the number of loans in each class or the total number of loans; so this type of weighting
      is precluded.
76	   Note that the large loan amounts to small and medium firms by the large bank are consistent with its definitions of such firms.
77	   The heading for this question was “Interest rates charged in 2009 on SME loans by quality of creditworthiness.”
78	   Even though these figures are not necessarily representative of Indonesian lenders to SMEs, one would still expect systematic variation in interest rates with estimated risk.
                                                                                    Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings               27




This difference from the pattern of lenders worldwide, in which lenders vary interest rates with the degree of risk
identified in the loan underwriting process, can perhaps be better understand by remembering that lending in this
market in Indonesia is substantially asset-based, making risk inherently less sensitive to the loan terms.

Loan volumes. Although all the financial institutions included in the survey do originate loans to small-medium firms,
few provided information on loan volumes. (For interested readers, Table 3.25 presents the data on the few financial
institutions that respond.)

Delinquencies. Five financial institutions provided information on delinquent loans, defined as payments being 30
days or more past due. At the end of 2008, these lenders had an average delinquency rate of 3.1 percent on all loans
and 4.0 percent on loans to SMEs (Table 3.25).

Loan approval speed. Since smaller firms often need to obtain loans quickly -- to take advantage of sudden opportunities
or make up for poor planning -- a major advantage of informal lenders (loan sharks) is their extreme speed in approving
and disbursing loans. Hence, the loan approval process is of considerable importance in serving the small-medium
market (Table 3.19). An impressive 39 percent of respondents said the typical time for underwriting and approving a
loan is one week or less.79 Another 56 percent said 1-2 weeks, still respectable.

A key ingredient to speedy approval is delegation of approval authority to branch office managers. Among respondents,
only 18 percent delegate no approval authority to branches, although there is considerable variation in the lowest
type of branch to which authority is delegated. Limits are generally placed on the amount that can be delegated, as
confirmed by 70 percent of those granting limited authority, with an average maximum of IDR 146 million and an
overall maximum of IDR 500 million.

The shortest approval times, not surprisingly, are when all branches have some degree of approval authority. Interestingly,
lenders with partial decentralization seem to have longer times than those with no decentralization (Table 3.27),
although this tabulation is based on a very limited sample.


Sharia-compliant Products
Questions were asked in both Parts 1 and 2 of the survey about Sharia-compliant products. In Part 1 the question was
about loan products—which products were offered and the loan volume for each type. Part 2 contained a more general
question about the products offered. Since different people likely filled in the two parts of the form and the number of
financial institutions filling in either part was under 10, the data differ between the two sets of answers.

According to Part 1 (Table 3.20): Only 8 of the 20 licensed lenders reported offering any type of Sharia-compliant loan
and only 1 offers such loans to SMEs. The most popular product is the Murabahah, which is offered by 6 lenders. No
bank that provided information on Sharia-compliant products offers compliant demand or saving accounts.

According to Part 2 (Table 3.21): Respondents were asked to rate how popular the Sharia-compliant product was
compared to a regular product -- on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is very low client interest and 5 is at least as popular
(i.e., as much volume) as a comparable non-Sharia product. Five (5) financial institutions said they offer Sharia-
compliant loans; all 5 offer at least one deposit account; two offer time deposits. When asked about the popularity of
such loans, respondents said there is moderate interest in the loan and demand deposit products but very little in time
deposits.

3.F Actions to Expand Market Share and Views of the Competition
Expanding Market Share. Section 3.B makes the case that financial institutions see the small-medium firm market as
valuable and one where they should expand their activities. The survey’s direct question about whether these institutions
“are trying to increase your competitive position in the small and medium firm banking market” confirms this view.
Nineteen of 20 institutions responded affirmatively, of which 11 filled in a table of possible actions they could be taking
in this direction (Table 3.22) .

Of the 16 listed actions, 9 are being undertaken by the vast majority (at least 80 percent of respondents) (Figure 10).

   •	 Two are increased training of loan and other bank officers to address this market.
   •	 Three involve expanding delivery channels: adding to branch networks, opening special branches for SME
      banking, and upgrading on-line banking (particularly for bill paying and other transactions).
   •	 Three strengthen the loan origination process: two concern streamlining and speeding loan processing, and
      giving more authority to branch managers to make decisions; the third aims to improve loan underwriting by
      including more site visits to firms.
   •	 One is expanding the promotion of SME products, particularly through the availability of brochures in branch
      offices.

The initiative to strengthen loan underwriting may be especially important in qualifying a larger share of small-medium
applicants for loans.

The activities NOT being undertaken by at least half the responding financial institutions are equally telling, and correspond
well to issue areas identified as problematic in the literature: establishing rural/community banks to expand coverage
(a complement to more branches); offering special fee-for-service arrangements to firms that have demand and savings
accounts with a bank (e.g., lower fees for ATM services); and offering payroll and bill paying services.

Promotion of cross selling was not on the list just reviewed, but the survey did include a question about it.
Nearly 90 percent of the 16 responding financial institutions said that staff is instructed to cross sell products (Table
3.23).

   •	 Two products are essentially recommended for promotion by all respondents: advisory services and saving/time
      deposits. Advisory services are often thought of as a way of gaining a client’s confidence and opening the door
      to selling the full range of services. Hence, the emphasis on this service is understandable.
   •	 Demand accounts are cited by over half of respondents (56 percent).

Interestingly, three products little used to date by small-medium firms are being promoted in principle by staff at
around 40 percent of responding institutions: payroll services, bill paying services, and life insurance.

The Competition. These financial institutions are expanding their services because they must compete to capture a
greater market share. In this context, financial institutions’ ratings of the extent of competition in various market
segments are informative, because these are what is driving the upgrading of investment decisions.

The survey asked about the competition for making loans to different market segments and the competition for selling
other products. In each case respondents rated the degree of competition on a four-point scale, ranging from “very
strong” to “not strong at all” (Table 3.24). As before, a different number responded to each panel, making it impossible
to compare the answers rigorously.

For competition to make loans to firms of different sizes, the variation is somewhat less than might have been anticipated.
At the high end of the range, large majorities of raters chose the two highest levels of competition for both loans to
medium firms (90 percent) and loans to micro firms (75 percent), with small firms in the middle. At the low end, no
one gave the “not strong at all rating” for medium firms; 17 percent did for micro firms, again with small firms in the
middle. For competition by loan feature, the price of the loan (interest rate) is clearly seen as the most competitive
element. Second is structuring loans for this market segment -- meaning the package of loan terms, documentation
requirements, underwriting, and processing speed.

Important patterns in the estimated degree of competition in selling other products:

   •	 The sharpest competition is for demand accounts.
   •	 For two rapidly growing products -- telephone banking and internet banking -- 60 to 70 percent of respondents
      rate them in the highest two competitiveness categories.
   •	 Little competition is seen for international payments, factoring, and leasing. As we saw in Chapter 2, use of
      these services by small and medium firms is in fact very low.



3.G Differences between Licensed and Informal Lenders
Informal lenders (loan sharks) differ in many ways from regulated financial institutions, based on the information
obtained from interviews with three such lenders. One clear distinction is the simplicity of their operations: the only
product they offer is loans, each has a single office (no branches), and none of the three distribute brochures.

Two of the three join with the other financial institutions in rating the small-medium loan market as big and the
prospects as good; none expressed a negative view on prospects. All said that loan volume increased in 2009 over 2008
and that they are attracted to such lending because of its profitability.

In reviewing lending operations, it is important to recall that the definitions of the size of small and medium loans
used by loan sharks are much smaller than those used by other financial institutions. The most conservative definition
          30              Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




(lowest volumes) uses a range of IDR 0.5 to 5 million for small and IDR 5 to 25 million for medium firms.80

Interesting aspects of the loans made include:

      •	 The effective all-in annual interest rate is 120 percent for small-medium firms and 60 percent for larger clients.
         Two loan sharks said varying the interest rate with the degree of risk is standard practice, something not many
         regulated financial institutions report doing.
      •	 For lending to small firms collateral does not matter much to loan sharks; all three make non-collateralized loans
         to this group. For medium size firms they do take collateral, however; the types most often rated as “standard
         practice” are: land with clear title, buildings with clear title, and motor vehicles.
      •	 The only administrative document required is the owner’s ID number.
      •	 Little loan underwriting per se is done by loan sharks for loans to small firms. For medium firms, the main
         considerations are collateral quality and loan purpose.

As expected, all reported that they could underwrite and approve a loan at most.
Finally, all three of these loan sharks see the market for their loans as very competitive. Competition is centered on the
price of money and the structure of the loan offered.

Overall, as often stated, these institutions are distinctly less interested than regulated financial institutions in building a
diversified and broad platform to provide financial services to a wide range of clients. This difference is clearly reflected
in their operations.



3.H Chapter Highlights
Surveyed financial institutions see lending to small-medium firms as an important part of their business plans. Ninety
percent rated small-medium lending as “very important.” All of the 14 respondents who provided a prediction for
2010 said loan volume will top 2009, with the average estimate a 20 percent rise.

What is drawing financial institutions to the small-medium loan market? Both pull and push factors were cited by half or
more of the respondents. The pull factor (90 percent agreeing) was the profitability of making such loans. The main push
factors were: intense competition for retail customers and large corporate clients, and excessive exposure to the retail
customer sector. Two additional factors cited by at least 40 percent of respondents as significant difficulties were: strong
competition in the small-medium market and challenges in the legal and contractual environment.

Are small-medium firms also a potential source of liabilities through demand and savings accounts? The answer is “yes.” Three-
quarters (77 percent) rate small-medium firms as a “very important” source of funds currently; the same proportion say
their importance s “definitely increasing” compared to larger businesses. All institutions foresee an expansion in 2010,
by an average estimate of 18 percent.


Outreach
Information from the survey of small-medium firms, as noted, documents the importance to these firms of having
convenient access to financial services.

Financial institutions report that they have responded to this preference, and presumably that of retail clients, by
creating large branch and ATM networks in which they have made large investments. The average number of branches
among the institutions reporting this information is 221. While 35 percent of respondents have 50 or fewer branches,


80	   See columns 21-23 in the table in Annex B.
                                                        Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings   31




15 percent have over 500.       Brochures are an important element in their strategy for introducing clients to other
products offered.


Products Offered
The products on offer, other than loans, vary substantially. Among the 15 financial institutions responding to product
questions, 80 percent say they offer savings accounts. Demand accounts are a distant second, at 59 percent. No other
product is offered by as much as 50 percent, including factoring, payroll services, overdraft facilities and property
insurance.

The narrowness of the non-credit product range is striking. Indonesian financial institutions, despite some commentary to
the contrary, strongly focus services on loans and on savings and demand accounts. In part this may be because profits
are reported to be more likely with loans and savings accounts, as reported by some institutions, and in part because
introducing new products is seldom profitable at the beginning.

Only one financial institution reported offering Sharia-compliant loan products to SMEs, although at least 5 offer such a
loan product to other clients. Sharia-compliant deposit accounts are very rarely offered.

Lending Activity
Looking at loan terms first, we focus on responses of three lenders differentiated by the size of their overall loan book
to a question about loan terms for a large (prime borrower), a small, and a medium firm.

    •	 Application fee. The small bank does not charge a fee; the larger banks have an origination fee equivalent to 1
       percent of the loan principal.
    •	 Loan term. Maximum loan length is shortest for the small lender, at only 3 years. The mid-sized bank extends
       loans of up to 10 years to all three client types. The large lender draws the line at 5 years. Apparently the mid-
       sized bank is better equipped to manage interest rate risk.
    •	 Loan amount. For the small bank the maximum and minimum loan amounts are the same for all client types.
       Both the mid-sized and the large bank vary the maximum loan amount substantially. For example, the mid-size
       bank will extend a maximum loan of IDR 10 billion to a large firm but only IDR 500 million to a small firm.
    •	 Collateral required. Indonesian lenders are generally asset-based rather than cash-flow lenders (i.e., they base
       their decisions on being able to recover borrower assets if a loan fails rather than studying the purpose of the
       loan and estimating whether the borrower’s project will generate a cash flow sufficient to pay off the loan).
       This point is certainly supported by the survey evidence for the small and medium lenders. The small lender
       requires collateral the equivalent of 125 percent of the loan principal, and the mid-size lender 100 percent. The large
       bank, in contrast, requires lower collateral as a percentage of loan principal, indicating project lending with more
       sophisticated loan underwriting. All three lenders accept collateral in the form of movables, real estate, and
       land titles.

Another perspective on the funding decision, in addition to the availability of collateral, is the underwriting process
(i.e., the factors given the most weight in the underwriting decision). Respondents were asked to score the weight
assigned to each of eight factors, with the score ranging from 1 (not at all) to 10 (maximum weight).

Collateral receives the greatest weight, as expected, with 92 percent of respondents assigning it a value in the 8-10 range. Four
other factors are important for both for small and medium firms: strong business record, the firm’s credit history with
the lender, loan size, and loan purpose. For small firms, around 50 percent of respondents assigned these factors values
in the 8-10 range; for medium firms, 58-66 scored these factors in the 8-10 range.

Interest rates are hard to interpret without knowing how they are structured (i.e., flat rate or annuity loan). Most loans
to small-medium firms are extended on a flat rate basis. There is little variation in interest rates with the extent of
       32        Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




perceived risk; in other words, lenders are not explicitly pricing risk.

An impressive 39 percent of respondents said the typical time for underwriting and approving a loan is one week or less.
Another 56 percent said 1-2 weeks, which is still respectable. This is important because smaller firms often need to obtain
loans quickly to take advantage of sudden opportunities or to make up for poor planning. One of the major advantages
of informal lenders or loan sharks is their extremely speedy loan approval and disbursement. Hence, the loan approval
process is of considerable importance in serving the small-medium market.

A key ingredient to speedy approval is delegation of approval authority to branch office managers. Among respondents,
lenders with full delegation report shorter approval times than others. Only 18 percent delegate no approval authority
to branches; another 24 percent do so to some branches.


Expanding Market Share
The survey asked directly whether these institutions “are trying to increase your competitive position in the small and
medium firm banking market.” Nineteen of 20 institutions responded affirmatively. Nine actions are being undertaken
by 80 percent or more of respondents who answered a more detailed question.

   •	 Two actions are increasing training of loan and other bank officers to address this market.
   •	 Three involve expanding delivery channels: adding to branch networks, opening special branches for SME banking,
      and upgrading on-line banking particularly for bill paying and other transactions.
   •	 Three strengthen the loan origination process: two concern streamlining and speeding loan processing, and giving
      more authority to branch managers to make decisions, and the third aims to improve loan underwriting
      including more site visits to firms.
   •	 One is expanding promotion of SME products, particularly through the availability of brochures in branch
      offices.

Additional activities being undertaken by about half of the respondents include: establishing rural/community banks
to expand coverage (a complement to more branches); offering special fee-for-service arrangements to firms that have
demand and savings accounts with a bank, e.g., lower fees for ATM services; and offering payroll and bill paying
services.

4.	Results of ‘Mystery Shopping’
Mystery shopping is when someone poses as a client to learn how real clients are being treated by the firm being
investigated. The technique is commonly used by retail firms, including banks, to monitor the quality of their services.
Mystery shopping has been used in two quite different forms in retail banking. One has been the straightforward
use of mystery shoppers to measure the quality of services provided to customers seeking different banking service
types.81 The other compares differences in treatment. It uses paired shoppers of different races or other characteristics
to determine if commercial banks discriminate against some types of customers. For example, a black person inquires
about a loan and receives information, and then a white person with the same profile (except for race) and behavior does
the same. After the interview, each independently completes a form detailing what he/she was told and how he was
treated. The information on the two forms is compared to determine differences in treatment. A statistically sufficient
number of paired tests can provide reliable evidence of discrimination.82

In the survey of commercial banks and NBFIs conducted as part of this project, 19 of 20 respondents reported that they
were undertaking a series of initiatives to expand their business with small-medium firms. The list of actions cited is
impressive, explainable in part by the emphasis the Indonesian government has placed on expanding credit availability
to SMEs.83

An important question is the extent to which this emphasis has filtered down to front line bank officers. The objective
of the mystery shopping conducted as part of this study was to shed light on this question by gathering information in
three areas of Indonesian financial institutions’ branches:

      1.	 the quality of service provided by loan officers and other staff at commercial bank branches,
      2.	 the relative competitiveness of banks in offering loan products to a particular type of borrower for the same
          purpose, and
      3.	 the extent to which the loan officer or other staff meeting with the client tries to cross-sell other products to the
          client.

Tests were conducted at 26 financial institutions (Table 4.1). One test was conducted at each of two branches for each
included institution, for a total of 52 tests. Two tests were done for each to provide a more reliable service profile. The
tested financial institutions consist of 20 commercial banks, 2 cooperatives, 2 rural banks (BPRs), and 2 multi-finance
companies.

Section 4.A describes the client ‘shopper firm’ and the loan the firm was seeking at each bank; it also outlines how the
visits to lenders were organized. Section 4.B outlines how the three service dimension listed above were operationalized.
Section 4.C presents the results, and the final section highlights the findings.



4.A Firm and Loan Profile
A single scenario was developed and a single shopper performed all bank visits. In running tests on comparable banks,
it is critical to minimize the sources of variation in the people doing the shopping and the product sought, so one
can be confident that the differences among banks are attributable strictly to the loan or other officer with whom the
shopper met and the bank’s policies -- not distorted due to differences in how the shopper presents him/herself. While



81	   See, for example, Roberts and Campbell (2006) and Schrader (2006).
82	   An example of paired tests measuring discrimination in mortgage lending is Turner et al. (2002).
83	   Godau et al. (2004), chapter 3.
          34              Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




strong training can minimize the differences arising from interviewer variance, use of a single interviewer has the clear
advantage of transparent consistency.


The ‘Firm’s’ Profile
The scenario is of a small laundry with a dozen employees whose owner is seeking a loan to expand its operations
by acquiring an additional washing machine, dryer, and delivery vehicle. A laundry was selected because they are
ubiquitous in urban Indonesia.

The firm is classified as “small” using current BPS definitions (i.e., in the year preceding the loan inquiry turnover was
said to be just over IDR 300 million). The profile developed includes financial statements, staff listing by position,
its banking relations, a list of licenses and documents possessed by the firm, among other information. This detailed
information was not provided or even shown to the loan officer during the interview; but it formed a deep basis for the
shopper to draw upon in responding to loan officer questions. Because this was an initial inquiry about a loan, such
detailed information would not, in any case, be essential.84

The cost of the business expansion and the loan amount were tailored to the laundry’s financial profile so that it would
qualify for a loan following standard lending practices. This was done to increase the likelihood that a full interview
would be completed. More specifically, the cost of the equipment to enlarge operations was estimated at IDR 92
million, 80 percent of which (just under IDR 60 million) was requested as a loan.

The team member who prepared the scenario and did the interviews has his own small enterprises. He has taken out
loans for a micro business and for his personal car and home purchases. He was also given extensive training on the
need for consistency across interviews and in completing the post-interview form.85


Reporting Form
A form was developed to capture the information provided by the loan officer and others with whom the shopper dealt;
which information was volunteered and which had to be requested; the details of the various loan products offered
and which, if any, was recommended; where the interview took place (particularly whether it was private); whether
there was any follow-up by the loan officer following the interview; and the extent to which the shopper was offered
additional products and services. This form was completed immediately after the interview in a private place away
from the bank just visited.



4.B Measuring Service Quality
As noted, the ‘mystery shopping’ tests were organized to learn about lender branch staff behavior in three areas: the
quality of services provided, the competitiveness of the bank’s loan offer, and the extent of cross-selling that occurred.

The most widespread approach to measuring service quality in a retail environment is SERVQUAL.86 It has the five
dimensions listed below and there is a set of indicators defined for each dimension.

      1.	 assurance – knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to convey trust and confidence
      2.	 tangibles – appearance of physical facilities, equipment, personnel and communications materials
      3.	 empathy – level of caring, individual attention provided to customers




84	   The firm’s profile and the reporting form discussed below both are included in R. Struyk et al. (2009).
85	   The training is described in Struyk and Sarwoto (2009).
86	   The original development of the procedure was by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1988).  An overview discussion of the validity of the technique is in Newman (2001).
                                                                                  Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings                              35




      4.	 responsiveness – willingness to help customers and provide prompt service
      5.	 reliability – ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately

This structure has been used successfully in analyses of retail banking operations, as well as retail trade and service
providers, in both industrial and developing countries.87

We use the SERVQUAL paradigm as a general structure for conceptually organizing the service element of the mystery
shopping study. Because these dimensions have been demonstrated to be important in measuring client satisfaction, we
used them as a check list of topics to cover both in developing the scenario the shopper followed during the interviews
and in defining the content of the post-interview report he completed. We did not include the reliability dimension
because there was no opportunity to observe actual behavior.88 The operationalization of each of these concepts is
clarified in the findings presentation.



4.C Findings
The findings presentation follows the same three-part topic structure as the previous discussion. Because this is the
first study of its type, we do not have benchmarks from other studies to compare the experience identified here. Our
interpretation relies primarily on expectations formed through both discussions with knowledgeable Indonesians and
informed views about good business practices.


Service quality
The basic data are displayed in Tables 4.2-4.5. The first column of figures shows the average values for all indicators
with 0 or 1 scores and the percentage distributions for continuous measures. Recall that “1” always indicates better
service. These are computed with the sample of 52 tests. In principle, the values for the 0/1 indicators should be very
near 1.00, i.e., good service should be essentially universal.

With respect to assurance (Table 4.2), somewhat surprisingly, the client/tester met a specialized SME loan officer
only 40 percent of the time. It is possible that many of the banks did not have SME specialists on hand for walk-in
applicants, but we expected the value to be higher.

      •	 Only 75 percent of the loan officers impressed the tester as having a strong knowledge of the loan products he
         was discussing.
      •	 The low share of tests involving an SME expert (40 percent) suggests an opportune area for increased
         competitiveness in branch services provided; the apparent lack of knowledge on loan products is troubling and
         may point to deficiencies in training programs.

There are some issues in terms of the ‘tangibles’ measured (Table 4.3).

      •	 In 12 percent of cases the tester did not meet in a private space with the bank officer—thereby requiring the
         tester to discuss the specifics of his business where the conversation could be monitored by others. This could
         easily discourage a borrower from returning to apply for the loan.
      •	 In a similar share of cases the bank officer did not offer the tester a loan brochure without being prompted. This
         is surprising, since it is a cheap and easy service to perform.



87	   Applications in the U.K. and the U.S. include: Newman and Cowling (1996), Newman (2001) and Marshall and Smith (1999).  See Angur et al. (1999) for an application in India.
88	   SERVQUAL has each respondent fill in form about his or her expectations regarding service (answering yes or no to a set of questions) and then filling in a second form about the
      actual experience (again usually with yes and no questions).  An analysis of the gap between the response sets is then undertaken.  Our analysis differs in that where appropriate
      scoring scales are prepared for the shoppers to guide, with high and low scores definitions given by the project team to ensure consistency in scoring.
          36               Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




      •	 Only 13 percent of bank officers provided a copy of the loan application without the tester asking for it. This
         is hard to understand, since giving a client specific knowledge of the information required in the application
         would permit him to return more ready to make his application, making the process much more efficient for
         both bank and borrower.

The branches visited by the tester differ sharply in the number of loan counters present.

      •	 One branch has none, and the officer met the tester (client) at a desk. Twenty-five percent have only one
         counter, suggesting either that waiting may be a problem for clients or that there are not many clients. Another
         quarter of branches have four or more, indicating stronger service, holding other factors constant. (See further
         discussion below.)

Waiting time and time spent with the bank officer yield more favorable results (Table 4.4).

      •	 In half the branches the time waiting to see a bank officer on a “walk in” basis was 5 minutes or less. In only 17
         percent of the cases did the tester wait over 10 minutes. These figures indicate that the small number of loan
         counters in many branches may not be a serious problem. (Note, however, that we have not controlled for the
         time of day when the tester visited the branch.)89

The ‘empathy’ section indicates room for improvement (Table 4.4).

      •	 Only about 80 percent provided a business card or contact information in another form without being asked.
         Absence of this contact information clearly makes it harder for the client to continue a discussion with the same
         bank officer and works against establishing a banking relationship.
      •	 Only about 70 percent of officers were rated as being really friendly, even though virtually all bank staff welcomed
         the tester in a reasonable way.
      •	 Essentially no one offered to help the tester complete the loan application.

Time spent by the bank officer with the tester was always reasonable—a minimum of 18 minutes and in a few cases
more than 45 minutes. The majority spent a half hour or more. But the variance in time spent is large, and a borrower
doing comparative shopping might feel rushed with an interview lasting under 20 minutes, given that the shopper’s e
shopper’ point was lost.been lost in the course of editing. first half, but I think the second half may have been better as
interviews typically lasted at least 30 minutes.

The indicators of loan officers’ ‘responsiveness’ also raise concern (Table 4.5).

      •	 One out of five bank officers did not even ask about the amount of the loan being sought and its purpose!
      •	 A mere 20 percent asked basic questions about the applicant’s firm. In only one case did the bank officer show
         initiative in asking the tester to complete the application, (i.e., to move ahead with the transaction); in no case
         did the bank officer try to arrange for a follow-up contact.

Two-thirds of bank officers did convey a genuine interest in making the loan, however, with about 75 percent strongly
recommending a specific product, and 10 percent taking the trouble to steer the tester away from a product.




89	   We did estimate a simple regression model in which the dependent variable is the number of minutes waiting and the independent variables are the number of counters and a dummy
      variable indicating that the test visited the bank during the peak business period.  The result for the visiting-at-peak-times variable is highly significant statistically and indicates that
      the tester had to wait an additional 6 minutes on average to see a loan officer when he arrived at such a time.  The number of counters in the branch was not significant, presumably
      because there are offsetting effects:  there are more counters (less wait time other things equal), but counters are there because there is more business at the bank (more wait time).
                                                                                    Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings   37




We can examine the quality of service from a bank’s perspective by asking in how many cases both branches scored
well on these service items. The last two columns in the four tables just discussed show the number of lenders out of
26 with strong or poor service ratings.90 Recall that the mystery shopper went to two branches of each lender. “Strong
service” means that at both branches staff met the standard set by the indicators; “poor service” means that service on
an item was poor in both branches.

A number of areas showed strength, where at least a simple majority of banks offered strong service. For the ‘assurance’
indicators, for example, performance is generally moderately strong, with over 15 banks showing strong service for 3-4
indicators. Other strong areas include:

      •	    meeting with the bank officer in a private space (21 banks),
      •	    tester receiving brochures (18) and the bank officer’s business card (19) without asking,
      •	    bank officer requesting the purpose (19) and the amount (14) of the loan sought, and
      •	    bank officer strongly recommending a particular product (19) and conveying a strong interest in making the
            loan (14).

Against these are areas of consistently poor service:

      •	    no bank’s officer provided a loan application to the tester without being asked,
      •	    no officer offered to help the client complete the loan application,
      •	    at only two banks did the bank officer ask basic questions about the tester’s business,
      •	    no bank’s officer tried to make arrangements for a follow-up contact,
      •	    cross selling was extremely weak (discussed further below).


Competition
This section looks at two broad areas: requirements for taking out a loan, including documentation, credit checks, and
the like; followed by differences in the loan products offered.

Loan requirements. The first competition area concerns actions by the bank officer that could discourage a client from
applying for a loan. In Table 4.6 we show three sets of results.

      1.	 Was the tester told he did not qualify for a loan or that the lender would have to check the firm’s credit rating
          before an application could be taken?
          •	 In no case was the tester told that he did not qualify for a loan. In 6 percent of the cases the bank officer told
             the tester that an application could not be submitted until after the credit report was obtained.

      2.	 What specific information was the applicant told to provide? Lenders may believe it prudent to require
          documentation for numerous aspects of a business and its operations, but there is certainly a substantial range
          among lenders in the number of documents required. Lenders requiring fewer items may be exposing themselves
          to greater risk but they are clearly making it easier for applicants.
          •	 The range is remarkable—from none to seven pieces of documentation discussed.

      3.	 Was a loan size estimate requested?
          •	 No bank officer gave an estimate of the loan size for which the tester would likely qualify. Since the tester
             was fully prepared to provide the information necessary for the bank officer to do this, the finding indicates
             a lack of follow-up on the officer’s part.


90	   In a couple of cases the total number of banks is less than the 26 included in the study because data was missing for a specific data item.
          38               Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




Number of loan products offered (Figure 11). A primary competition indicator is the number of products the bank officer
described to the tester.

      •	 About half the time, a single loan product was described to the tester. In another 35 percent of cases, two
         products were discussed. In 10 percent of cases three products were discussed. Since the shopper was instructed
         to ask about a range of products if they were not volunteered by the bank officer, the evidence suggests that half
         the branches did not have many alternative products to offer (rather than that the officer was offering a very
         limited set because he really thought they were best for the customer).

Range of loan products offered (Table 4.7). The range of interest rate structures is particularly striking, with the structure
varying along three dimensions: flat interest calculation versus annuity loans; among annuity loans, those with constant
payments and those with declining payments; and fixed versus variable interest rates.

Annuity loans were somewhat more commonly offered as the primary product.91 Annuity interest rate loans offered
generally have variable rates, in contrast to flat rate loans that rarely have variable rates.

The degree of variation in the interest rates stated to the tester for the same interest rate structure was surprisingly
high.

      •	 Among flat rate loans, 15 percent carried rates of 10 percent or less, while the same percentage had rates of 30
         percent or higher. Some of the variation may depend on whether rates were quoted in nominal or effective
         terms.
      •	 The spread for annuity loans was tighter, with all rates quoted falling in a 10 to 20 percent range for both
         products.

These figures strongly indicate price competition among lenders in the small loan market.

Other loan characteristics. Forty percent of the products offered met the tester’s request for a 5-year loan term (Figure
12). Surprisingly, 16 percent of the loans offered had terms of only 1 to 2 years. Given the impact of the loan term on
the size of monthly payments with an annuity loan, the shorter-term products were clearly inferior for our borrower.
An important unanswered question is whether the short term offered reflects bank policy or a lack of responsiveness
by the bank officers.

The amount of collateral bank officers indicated would be needed also varies widely. The most common value quoted
is between IDR 100 and 150 million for the requested IDR 92 million loan (62 and 89 percent of products A and
B, respectively). But 24 percent of bank officers stated requirements would be under IDR 100 million for product
A. Overall, lenders are asset-based lenders rather than cash-flow lenders. This is borne out both by the high collateral
requirements and by the fact that only about 3 percent of bank officers told the shopper that cash flow projections
would be required as part of the loan application (Table 4.6). From Chapter 2 we also know that insufficient collateral
was the reason given to 40 percent of rejcted loan applicants who were told the reason for the rejection.

It is difficult to picture clearly different loan products based on the kinds of figures presented in Table 4.7. To provide
greater clarity, Table 4.8 shows the terms of six specific products discussed with the tester, each offered by a different
bank. Displayed for three annuity loans and three flat interest rate loans are the interest rate quoted, the loan term
(maturity), and collateral the tester was told would be needed.

One expects higher interest rates for loans with lower collateral requirements, a fixed versus variable interest rate, and a
longer loan term for fixed rate loans. These expectations are generally confirmed by our survey data.


Figure 12: Length of Loan Product Offered
          40               Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




The range on the three loan attributes in Table 4.8 is wide.

      •	 For flat interest rate structure loans interest rates vary from 14 to 24 percent; the 24 percent rate loan has the
         lowest collateral requirement. For annuity loans, the loan term ranges from 2 to 5 years, and the required
         collateral goes from 100 to 160 percent of the requested loan amount.
      •	 The highest collateral loan carries the lowest interest rate and the short loan length.
      •	 The variable interest rate loan carries a lower interest rate than a fixed rate loan of the same five year maturity
         among annuity loans.

The overall picture is one where a borrower could meet his loan preferences with some comparative shopping.92

As we saw in Chapter 2, small-medium borrowers give significant weight to lenders’ location, their relations with
lender’s staff, and the speed and ease of the transaction. These apparently offset the importance of the interest rate
charged, although price remains an important consideration.93

Loan processing speed is a real issue for smaller firms. Other studies of SME lending have cited micro and small firms
as placing high value on very quick service, even loan dispersal on the day of application. The industry standard appears
to be two weeks, named in about half of all cases (Table 4.7). Interestingly, however, in nearly a quarter of cases, times
of 0 to 5 days were offered for product A; and in another quarter of the cases 6-10 days. Again, borrowers have genuine
opportunity to tailor a loan package to match their preferences.


Cross Selling
Although an important way to expand business is by deepening a lender’s relationship with clients through inducing
clients to use more of its products, the lenders tested are doing a poor job in this area. Only 24 percent of bank officers
made a serious try to interest the shopper in another product (i.e., to cross sell); only 10 percent made a strong effort
to cross-sell two or more products (last rows in Table 4.5).

The form completed by the shopper after his visit to a lender asked him to distinguish between cases where another
product was mentioned or talked about and those where the bank officer made a strong effort to interest him in a
specific product.

Savings accounts are the product most often discussed, but even then only 21 percent of officers talked about them
and only 16 percent really tried to interest the tester (Table 4.9). The parallel figures for credit cards, the second most
often discussed product, are 12 and 8 percent, respectively. At the lender level, in half the cases there was no attempt
at cross selling at both branches of any of the banks. Among bank officers, 71 percent made no attempt to cross sell
(Figure 13).

 In short, there appears to be a complete breakdown in the implementation of banks’ policies for a strong cross-selling
effort.




92	   Another element of price competition is the fees charged that are associated with loan origination.  The survey did not gather information on this as part of the ‘mystery shopping.’  
      However, the team did make inquiries at four commercial banks about these fees.  Consistently, five fees are charged and these are for loan administration, loan provision, notary
      charge, survey of collateral pledged if needed, and insurance.  As a percentage of the IDR 92 million loan applied for, charges for the first four fees ranged among the four banks
      surveyed from 2.6 to 3.3 percent of the loan amount.  Insurance charges depend on the age of the borrower and the quality of the collateral and could not be readily determined.   See
      Annex A for additional information.
93	   Sharif (2007) makes this point.

4.D Chapter Highlights

Service Quality
While there are some bright spots, there is generally room for improvement.  Many, like meeting in a private space or
handing out brochures and business cards, could be very easily accomplished. These are already standard practice for
most branches but should be done by all.  They are generally not specific to SME customers and require very little time
and effort to fix.  Other possible improvements are more difficult to make, such as having SME specialists on hand, but
would measurably increase the ability of banks to cater to SMEs specifically.


Competition
Banks varied substantially in terms of products offered and loan requirements, but there was very little variation within a
bank branch (i.e., most banks offered just one product to the customer).  Would-be borrowers in principle have a wide range
of products available to them, but they must visit or otherwise research the offerings of many banks before they can get
a clear picture of possible offers available. Since this requires time and effort that is in addition to the time it takes to
wait for a loan to be disbursed, it might lead small-medium owners to borrow from informal institutions (loan sharks)
that can provide very quick service. One response by lenders could be to offer more products at each branch to save
clients time.


Cross-Selling
Very little cross-selling is done, indicating a real opportunity for improvements in service.  When banks offered a loan to
our mystery shopper, they often did not provide information on possible alternative loan products.  Nor did they
offer information on other types of products.  The pattern appears to be that either 1) bank officers do not think it
       42        Serving The Financial Needs Of Indonesian SMEs – Main Findings




worthwhile to provide small business customers with good service and tailored products, or 2) they are offering bad
service in general.


Overall
While small-medium loan shoppers can probably find what they are looking for if they are willing to do research, the banks do
not make the research easy.  A great deal of effort is required to be an informed consumer and to find the specific product
for which he/she is searching. For small firm owners, being absent from his business premises for an extended period
is problematic because they are usually the active operations center. This, again, creates an incentive to seek financial
services elsewhere.

Clearly opportunity exists for banks to improve their service to small-medium firms.  If a bank were to offer several products
to each small-medium owner consistent with the owner’s general requirements, it might be able to convince the shopper
that it has what he/ she needs.  The shopper could then immediately purchase products, rather than spending additional
time shopping around at other banks and informal institutions. 

Obviously banks are capable of offering small-medium owners a wide range of products, because collectively they did
offer a range to our shopper.  But small-medium owners might feel more compelled to go to a specific branch if they
knew it would offer a similar range of products at possibly better prices.  Banks will only be willing to expand their
product lines and fully train their staff in each alternative, of course, if they perceive small-medium owners as profitable
customers. The bankers’ survey documents that small-medium firm loans are profitable.

It is difficult to match the findings from the mystery shopping exercise with the pro-SME policies enunciated by financial
institutions who participated in our survey (detailed in Chapter 3). Either the policies essentially exist only on paper and
little attempt has been made to implement them, or there are very serious problems with management follow-through
in their implementation.

5. 	Conclusions
We end the report by focusing in this chapter on a selected set of points on which the information from the project’s
three data bases can be combined to make confident value statements. The chapter highlights at the ends of Chapter
2-4 provide conclusions for each individual study.

Financial institutions do not appear to have a very accurate idea of what the small-medium market segment wants.
A fundamental requirement for financial institutions to meet SME firms’ financial service needs is that they have an
accurate picture of these firms. The preferences examined in the Section 2.E are quite informative on this point: price
is very important but strong factors are also loan decision speed, flexible lending policies, and limited documentation
requirements.

Another useful comparison is between the degree of agreement expressed with a series of statements about SME firm’s
financial needs by the senior bank officers who completed Part 2 of the financial institutions survey and the reality
documented by the data from the SME survey discussed in Chapter 2. The financial institutions’ survey included nine
statements with which the respondents, senior officers, were asked to score their agreement on a scale from 1 to 10. Ten
indicated the strongest degree of agreement.

Table 5.1 presents the statements, the average of bank officers’ ratings, and the facts from the SME survey for each of
the nine statements. Importantly, there is considerable uncertainty on the part of bank officers. The average scores
are generally in the 5-6 range, indicating there is no strong agreement which would be reflected in an average of 8 or
10. Only the score for the first statement, on how SME firms pay bills and accept payments, is the score over 8. An
examination of the distribution of scores (Table 3.28 ) shows that typically 25-30 percent disagreed with the statement
to a certain degree, while generally 50 to 65 percent of respondents gave a score in the 7-10 range indicating substantial
or strong agreement.

To take a concrete example, consider the statement that small-medium firms prefer to use branch offices for their
transactions but could be shifted if the pricing were correct. Financial institution responses are clearly mixed, with 27
percent disagreeing with the statement (scores in the 1-3 range), 64 percent agreeing quite strongly (8-10 range), and
balance in between. The overall score is 6.6. The facts are that ATM usage is very high with 60 percent of SME firms
using them. Current pricing may be consistent with shifting utilization.

A primary result of the analysis presented in this report is to provide quite detailed information about SME firms’ financial
practices and thereby give financial institutions a stronger factual basis on which to design products and services for this
clientele. The nine statements are a good starting point.

What senior bank officers said were their policies and practices diverges significantly from what was found by the
mystery shopper. Two examples will make the point.

   •	 Officers indicated that cross selling was important and that staff were instructed to do so. The data from the
      visits to 52 branches show very weak efforts at cross selling.
   •	 Respondents to the financial institutions’ survey gave very positive time intervals for the underwriting and
      approving a loan an informing the applicant: 39 percent said it takes a week or less and only 6 percent over two
      weeks. The mystery shopper was told it would be 23 percent within a week, two weeks 50 percent of the time;
      and longer for the balance.

Our point does not concern the specific examples. Rather, it is about the necessity of management following through to make
certain that policies are indeed being implemented. The rapid expansion of branch networks makes this type of quality control
particularly challenging. The mystery shopping technology may well be worth adoption by Indonesian financial institutions
as a means to monitor how their policies are implemented.

A change in small-medium firm’s banking patterns may emerge. One can speculate that the way Indonesian SME firms’
access financial services may be on the edge of a major shift towards telephone and internet banking and more intensive
use of ATMs. The owners and managers of these firms have the very strong incentive of making the best use of their
work time; being absent from the firm is very costly because often there is no one else to provide direction to the staff or
answer more challenging questions from customers. Visiting even efficient branch offices is time consuming. Consider
the following facts.

   •	 SME firms are already embracing new technology. Presently 60 percent of SME firms are using ATM
      machines.
   •	 Ten percent of Small and 59 percent of medium firms report using the internet in their work; and of these 18 and
      29 percent, respectively, are already employing internet systems for purchasing and payment management.

Momentum appears to be building even while telephone banking and internet banking are at low levels—4.5 and 3.4
percent of SME firms are using these services, respectively.

Importantly, financial institutions seem not to be making a major push to promote the use of these channels. When
managers at financial institutions were asked about the extent of competition in providing telephone and internet
services, only 20 percent said they thought competition was very strong. Larger shares—30 and 40 percent, respectively-
-said there was essentially no competition for telephone and internet banking services, respectively.

Wide distribution of this report’s information on the actual conditions and potential of the small-medium market could be
very effective in helping financial institutions make changes to meet the evolving demand more effectively.

Annex D. Context of the Study
We begin with a quick overview of SMEs overall during the 1996-2006 period, relying on data from the latest two
Economic Censuses. We then look more closely at the 2006 firm profile and contrast the national profile of SMEs with
that of SME firms in large cities. Following this, the discussion turns to finance. Generally, there is little information
on the wider question of the demand for and supply of other banking services, including demand and time deposits and
transactions services. We consider both the broad experience in developing countries and the situation in Indonesia.



D.1	SME Profiles

Developments during 1996-2006
According to Economic Census figures, during this period the SME sector grew 38 percent in terms of firms and 46
percent measured by employment, resulting in an increase in average firm size from about 2.1 to 2.2 employees. In
2006, there were nearly 23 million firms in the country with nearly 50 million workers. The distribution of firms
among the micro, small, medium and large categories was 83.7, 15.8, 0.7 and 0.2 percent, respectively, based primarily
on firms’ turnover.48

Industries with growing importance over the period as measured by the number of firms include real estate and other
services; transport, storage, and communications; and, trade, restaurants, and accommodation (Table D.1). However,
in terms of employment growth only real estate and other services and mining and quarrying had growth above the
average. Financial institutions were below average by both measures.

2006 National Profile
Key information on Indonesian firms as of 2006 is given in Table D.2. Figures are presented for firms grouped into
Micro-Small (MS) and Medium-Large (ML) categories because this is the basis on which the Economic Census data
are published. Some highlights from the table include:

      •	 Sharp differences in firm size between the two groups—1.9 versus 53 workers.
      •	 Female ownership is fairly common—39 percent of MS and 18 percent of ML firms are owned by a woman.
      •	 84 percent of MS firms have relied exclusively on family funds for finance; of those turning to other sources, 27
         percent obtained funds from banks. For heavily equity ML firms relied heavily (85 percent) on private, rather
         than government, sources.
      •	 In 2006, computer utilization of exceptional: only 2 and 48 percent of MS and ML firms, respectively, had
         computers; and of these only 13 and 49 percent, respectively, used the internet. In others words, only 1 in 4
         ML firms used the internet.
      •	 Half of all firms reported making plans to expand the firm’s operations in the next year.




48	   In the manufacturing sector, the definition is based on the number of workers.  The definitions used in the 1996 Census are all employment based and therefore the distribution of
      firms among different size categories over time cannot be computed.

Small-Medium Firms in Large Cities
The sample of SMEs for this study is drawn from the population of small and medium (SME) firms in large cities, i.e.,
those over 250,000 populations. The restriction to cities of this size was made primarily because the cost of travel to
more cities was prohibitive within the available budget.

It is useful to examine how the profile of the population of SME firms compares with the profile of all firms in the
country. (Contrasting the SME firms in large cities with all SME firms in the country was not possible because the
published reports do not make these data available.) The basic information is provided in Table D.3. A few points
stand out when the distributions for the two groups of firms are contrasted.

    •	 SME firms are present in the large numbers outside major cities, emphasizing the importance of micro firms
       outside big cities.
    •	 Big city firms are larger than their national counterparts: 5.05 versus 2.18 employees.

There are major differences in the industrial make-up of big cities. Big cities have a much larger share of wholesale and
retail trade among their firms (59 vs. 45 percent); they also have significantly higher shares in real estate (5.8 vs. 3.5
percent), education services (2.4 vs. 1.5 percent), financial intermediaries (1.0 vs. 0.4 percent) and health services (1.5
vs. 0.8 percent).

   •	 On the other hand, they have lower shares of their firms in the manufacturing sector (7.1 vs. 14.2 percent), food
      and beverages (4.3 vs. 11.9 percent), and transportation and communication (4.3 vs. 11.9).

D.2	SME Finance and Banking

The Need for Banking Services
Several cross-country studies employing firm level data have documented that SMEs perceive the lack of access to
finance and the cost of loans to be greater obstacles to development and high profits than do large firms. They also show
that finance shortages restrict development of small firms more than large firms.49 These general findings indicate an
unmet demand for finance. That said, information on the specific loan products and financial services preferences of
SMEs is scarce and there is little research reported on the specific situation of small and medium firms.

Some earlier studies of Indonesian SME sector have relevant findings on the need for finance. Key attributes of the
major studies, and those of this one, are shown in Table D.4 for reference.

The 2006 Economic Census for Indonesia included a question on constraints that firms faced and which they had not
been able to resolve. Lack of finance was rated as the single greatest impediment. Among micro-small firms 17 percent
gave this response, and the rate for medium and large firms was 12 percent. Numerous other studies confirm access-to-
finance as a significant constraint.50 Interestingly, among finance-constrained ML firms nearly 60 percent has sought
a bank loan (Table D.2). The large Bank Indonesia study completed in 2005 found that 65 percent of SMEs reported
needing additional credit and 74 percent of this group was interested in approaching banks for a loan.

Most relevant for our purposes is the DAI study completed in 2004 that focused on small and medium firms in East
Java. The survey found that 19 percent of SME firms rated finance as a “principal problem” and another 16 percent as
a secondary problem. While substantial, these are in a distant second place behind “market problems,” i.e., insufficient
demand or too much competition, which half of all respondents cited in both categories.

 




49	   Beck and Demirguc-Kunt (2006) and Beck et al. (2006).  Schiffer and Weder (2001) show the same broad pattern using observations on over 10,000 firms in 80 countries.  Simple
      differences in the mean ratings of the problem (rated 1-to-4) are highly significant, with small firms having the highest deficit.  But when they use ordered-probit analysis of each
      firm’s rating of financial access severity, the result is no longer significant when the age of the firm and some equity participation by the government or foreign firms is controlled.
	     Interestingly, The Economist reports similar constraints on European SMEs in its May 21, 2009 issue.  In the article, “Humble but Nimble,” it states “It is young, innovative SMEs
      that are most threatened by the credit crunch and recession…Banks have long been wary of lending to them, preventing most innovators from growing into giants.”

The same survey inquired about wider banking services. Table D.5 shows the percentage of surveyed firms using
different services. Eighty-one percent reported having a savings or deposit account, 58 percent using the bank to send
or receive funds, and 57 percent an ATM card. The incidence of business loans was only 34 percent. Respondents
were also asked to identify the “most helpful” banking services. The top four services were: a savings or deposit account
(rated most helpful by 30 percent of respondents), an ATM card (24 percent), sending and receiving transfers (21
percent), and business loans (12 percent). The priority of non credit services is striking.




When SME firm respondents were asked for the reasons why they were satisfied with their relationship with their
primary financial institution, cost of funds was not prominent. “Good services and complete product” was cited by 87
percent as the reason for being satisfied. On the other hand, high interest rates and complicated procedures were both
had the highest scores for dissatisfaction (31 percent) from respondents; third was poor service.51

The Supply of Financial Services
In contrast to the research on the firm side, there has been comparatively little analysis of the supply side of the market
across countries. However, recent analysis by Beck et al. (2008) uses data for 91 banks from 45 countries, both
developed and developing, to document bank lending practices to SMEs and their attitudes toward such lending. The
authors reach the following general conclusions:52

1.	 Banks perceive SME lending as very profitable.
2.	 Foreign banks perceive macroeconomic instability in developing countries and competition among banks to make
    loans to larger firms in developed countries as the main obstacles impeding SME finance.
3.	 To serve SMEs banks have set up dedicated departments and have decentralized the sale of financial products to
    branches, although loan approval, risk management, and loan recovery functions remain centralized.
4.	 Banks are less exposed to small firms than large firms and charge small firms higher interest rates, fees, and experience
    higher loan delinquency rates.
5.	 Foreign banks rely more on scoring and make loan decisions based on quantifiable information, and rely more on
    real estate as collateral than local banks.

These observations on both the demand and supply sides of the market provide a rich set of hypotheses to carry over
into the analysis.

A second relevant study explores the effect of competition among financial institutions on the availability of finance
for SMEs (Beck et al., 2004). The study employs data from 74 developed and developing countries, including firm-
level ratings of problems in obtaining finance.53 Table D.6 shows values for several key data items for Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Singapore as well as overall averages and ranges. Values are for about 2001 and may not be valid today.54
The figures show that Indonesia is about average in terms of finance being reported by firms as an obstacle to firm
development. It also has values about the average for all countries for the ratio of private credit to GDP (column 7).
Its banking sector is rated as having relatively large number of restrictions imposed on bank activities (col. 4 and 5) and
a relatively greater importance of state banks and lower importance of foreign banks.

These data are important because the analysis shows that the greater the degree of banking concentration the lower
is the relative access of firms, especially smaller firms, to credit. Greater problems in the regulatory area and certain
institutional characteristics like those in Indonesia are also associated with firms citing a higher level of credit obstacles,
but the effect diminishes in countries with higher GDP levels. In short, some attributes of the Indonesian banking
system around 2001 were broadly working against access to finance, according to these findings.

With respect to SME lending in Indonesia, a 2005 Bank Indonesia study (Table 2.4) reported that banks were motivated
to expand their lending to SMEs by the profitability of the activity. A series of actions were cited that banks were
undertaking to expand their lending. Keys to successful expansion included stronger underwriting, streamlining the
lending process, and rigorous collections systems.

Today banks are extending a substantial volume of credit to SMEs. Indeed, about half of commercial bank loans
went to micro, small and medium firms in the last quarter of 2008. At the same time, the SME loan volume was
divided such that 35 percent when to micro, 34 percent to small, and 31 percent to medium size firms (Table D.7)—a
surprisingly flat distribution. But compared to the number of firms loan volume is very unevenly distributed. The
“loan intensity index” in Table 2.6’s last column (the ratio of the percent of bank loans to the firm group to the percent
of firms in the group) ranges from 0.5 for micro firms to over 50 for medium firms. So loan volume per 1 percent of
medium firms is 100 times the loan volume per 1 percent of micro firms and much higher on a per firm basis.

There is also a wide variance among bank types in the importance of SME lending in their total loan book. Table
D.8 shows that three bank groups—state banks, foreign exchange private banks, and regional development banks
(BPDs)—account for 88 percent of the loan volume to SMEs. While the first two groups extend about half of their
loans to SMEs, BPDs extend 85 percent of their loans to them. Non foreign exchange private banks also are highly
concentrated in this market with 89 percent of their loans going to SMEs. One anticipates those with big SME loan
programs to be leaders in extending banking services to these firms as well.
