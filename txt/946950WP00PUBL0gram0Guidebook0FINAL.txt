    The Low Carbon City Development Program (LCCDP) Guidebook was developed
    by the World Bank and DNV KEMA Energy & Sustainability. An LCCDP is a systems
    approach to low carbon development, including a framework and comprehensive
    set of requirements, that helps cities to plan, implement, monitor, and account for low
    carbon investments and climate change mitigation actions across all sectors over time.
    Based on interest received following the launch of the Rio de Janeiro Low Carbon
    City Development Program in June 2012, the ﬁrst LCCDP to be certiﬁed according to
    the LCCDP Assessment Protocol (including ISO 14064, ISO 14001, and the GHG
    Protocol), this Guidebook was developed to provide cities and urban practitioners with
    a roadmap for designing and implementing an LCCDP that complies with the LCCDP
    Assessment Protocol.

    The Guidebook was prepared by a core team led by Sebastian M. Scholz (Senior
    Environmental Economist, World Bank) and Miguel Rescalvo (Director of Sustainable
    Use, Emerging Markets Latin America, DNV KEMA), and included Lorraine Sugar
    (Climate Change Specialist, World Bank), Maite Lasa (Senior Consultant, Emerging
    Markets Latin America, DNV KEMA), Natasha D’Silva (Consultant, Emerging Markets
    Latin America, DNV KEMA), Ramiro Barrios (Coordinator of Consulting Services,
    Emerging Markets Latin America, DNV KEMA), and Juan Mata (Director of Consulting
    Services, Emerging Markets Latin America, DNV KEMA). In addition, Julianne Baker
    Gallegos (Junior Professional Associate, World Bank) and Jonathan Perry (Junior
    Professional Associate, World Bank) contributed to the case studies.

    The team would like to thank the following World Bank colleagues for guidance
    and input along the way: Karin Erika Kemper (Director of Climate Policy and Finance,
    World Bank) and Neeraj Prasad (Manager of the Climate Change Practice, World
    Bank Institute).

                          Executive Summary

                          As urban populations rise exponentially, cities are
                          increasingly facing challenges related to socioeconomic
                          development and environmental issues—especially
                          cities in low- and middle-income countries. By taking
The systematic approach   the lead on low carbon development, cities have the
offered by an LCCDP
enables a city to
                          opportunity to engage in an important dialogue about
pursue an integrated      sustainable development, directly address local issues,
low carbon pathway
                          and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas
                          (GHG) emissions. Low carbon development strategies
                          allow cities to position themselves as major players in
                          climate change mitigation, as well as set an example for
                          the development of national emission reduction policies.

                          The systematic approach offered by a Low Carbon City
                          Development Program (LCCDP) enables a city to over-
                          come the barriers faced in single project implementation
                          and pursue an integrated low carbon pathway. It provides
                          a common framework to identify, implement, and
                          measure low carbon interventions (that is, projects and
                          policies) that will not only contribute to lower emissions,
                          but will also address urban development needs.
                          Accordingly, LCCDPs are ﬂexible and can be designed
                          in a manner that accommodates different cities’ contexts,
                          priorities, and visions of low carbon development.

The LCCDP Guidebook helps orient cities to design and
implement an LCCDP that complies with the LCCDP
Assessment Protocol, which is a new protocol based on
existing, internationally recognized standards for systems
design and GHG accounting. The LCCDP Assessment
Protocol consists of a set of standardized requirements
developed to ensure that LCCDPs will achieve their
targets and objectives when implemented. Yet every
city is different and so a whole range of interventions
is available; the LCCDP and the LCCDP Assessment
Protocol are designed to be ﬂexible and accommodating
in a variety of city contexts.

stages of systems design, which also correspond to
the four stages of LCCDP development:

INITIATION
Municipalities need to consider important elements
when ﬁrst deciding to embark on a low carbon city
development pathway. An LCCDP must be designed
with a long-term view to achieving the city’s overall
development goals. A robust initiation process that
clearly deﬁnes the Program’s mission, scope, and
boundaries will help avoid having to make big changes
to the LCCDP during its implementation. The LCCDP
should be undertaken in tandem with other municipal
policies that support socioeconomic growth and,
therefore, the involvement and explicit commitment
from all levels of local government and stakeholder
groups is required. Whenever possible, the city should
develop policy and/or legislative mechanisms that
protect the Program from administrative and political
changes in order to safeguard the Program’s continuity.
Lastly, a GHG emissions inventory, while not a
prerequisite, will provide very useful information for
setting realistic and accurate targets and objectives
in the LCCDP planning phase.

the municipality must identify the appropriate entity to
adopt each Program Role and be clear about their
respective responsibilities. The other four roles in addition
to the CME are: the Information Management Entity
(IME), the Technical Advisory Entity (TAE), a Multi-Sector
Working Group (MWG), and the Validation/Veriﬁcation
Entity (VVE). The exact relationship between the entities
holding the Program Roles will depend on the size
and resources of the municipality in question; however,
to a certain extent, responsibilities will be consistent
across all LCCDPs. Regardless of the way in which the
roles are structured within a municipality, it is critical that
they be appropriately documented and communicated
both within the municipal administration and to
external stakeholders.

                             According to the United Nations Population Fund, the world is undergoing the
                             largest wave of urban growth in history, with more people now living in cities than in

                             This projected growth is unprecedented and poses great challenges for cities to
                             provide a high quality of life to their residents—now and in the future. In fact, in many
                             cases, rapid urbanization is concentrating socioeconomic poverty and environmental
                             degradation in cities. Today, cities face increasing development needs in infrastructure,
                             land use, social cohesion, and basic service provisions. Consequently, sectors
                             such as transportation, water and sanitation, education, food systems, energy supply,
                             and health services, are under severe pressure from increasing population and
                             limited resources.

                             Despite the magnitude of the current challenges, cities must also incorporate a long-
                             term component into their planning processes, as future pressures will increase in
                             severity due to further population growth and additional environmental degradation.
                             A sustainable development approach will ensure that the needs of citizens today are
                             met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Such

                          an approach implies that, in addition to the efﬁcient management of available resources,
                          cities must take into consideration additional risks posed by climate change. For
                          example, sea level rise and more frequent extreme meteorological events may affect
                          coastal cities, while severe drought and desertiﬁcation may impact landlocked cities.

                          Cities are also responsible for a high proportion of global carbon emissions, which
                          are the main driver of anthropogenic climate change. A recent United Nations Human
                          Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) report showed that the world’s cities cover
                          only two percent of the total land area, but account for a staggering 70 percent of GHG
                          emissions (UN-Habitat, 2011). Emissions in cities come mainly from fossil fuel combus-
                          tion for power generation, transport, industrial activities, municipal waste, and water
                          and sewage treatment. In addition, if urban expansion is not appropriately planned,
                          land-use change and deforestation can lead to the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) from
                          natural carbon stocks, such as forest cover. Thus, cities will have to consider both miti-
                          gation measures that lower their carbon emissions, as well as adaptation measures that
                          improve their resilience to climate impacts.

for business              The current lack of national and international consensus on climate change action
                          presents an opportunity for cities to assume a leadership role in climate change
                          mitigation, and to link climate change to local development priorities. By doing so, a
                          city can reduce its carbon footprint while also providing a better quality of life for its
                          citizens and a more attractive environment for business. Well-planned, compact cities
                          can be highly resource-efﬁcient and lead to lower per capita GHG emissions. Cities
                          can invest in green economic sectors, such as transport, buildings, and waste manage-
                          ment, thereby creating jobs and supporting long-term economic growth, which can

                          residents can be leaders in creating demand for environmentally-friendly products and
                          sustainable consumption (World Bank, 2012).

                          An increasing number of cities and regions have begun taking action to address
                          GHG emissions. In recent years, urban political leaders have been more involved in
                          climate change policy making, with many pledging action beyond or even acting
                          in the absence of national commitments. For example, London called for a 60 percent
                          reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2025 (Mayor of London, 2007), New York

                         City is aiming for a 30 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 (City of New York,
                         2007), and Tokyo’s Climate Change Strategy called for a 25 percent reduction from
                         2000 levels by 2020 (Tokyo Metropolitan Government, 2007). Through the US Mayors’

                         exceed Kyoto Protocol targets, even though the US has not ratiﬁed the Protocol. The

                         and global sustainability issues.



                         1.1.2     The Low Carbon Development Approach in Cities
                         Cities can engage in sustainable development and lead on climate change mitigation
                         by considering a low carbon development approach. While no universal deﬁnition
                         for low carbon development exists, “using less carbon for growth” and “decoupling
                         carbon emissions from growth” are common features among low carbon development
                         initiatives. These approaches also remain faithful to the principles of sustainable
                         development, which aim to reconcile ecological limits with the goals of economic
                         development and social justice.

                         Low carbon development in cities—or low carbon city development—allows
                         municipalities to take advantage of integrated planning in a manner that ensures ER
                         strategies and socioeconomic growth are not mutually exclusive. Similarly, mitigation

by climate change        vision can be created where economic goals across sectors align and balance with
                         carbon reduction goals. Such an integrated approach not only makes planning more
                         efﬁcient, but also offers an opportunity to bring together multiple stakeholders and
                         raise awareness of the beneﬁts of simultaneously pursuing socioeconomic growth and
                         carbon reduction. An integrated approach to planning that considers climate change
                         can also be an opportunity to attract new investments and businesses to a city.

                           (WRI), and others. The LCCDP is a new approach that builds upon and complements
                           existing efforts in low carbon development and harnesses environmental markets for

                                         An LCCDP offers an alternative to individual, project-based approaches to low carbon
                                         development, which are not generally well suited for cross-sectoral situations in
                                         complex environments across the large geographic areas that are typical of cities.

                                         and interventions are more appropriate. Thus, low carbon city development must
                                         be part of the broader municipal planning process. An integrated plan can also help
                                         overcome barriers that are common in urban projects, especially in developing

growth and brings socioeconomic co-beneﬁts. Community building within a city
reduces insecurity, crime, and violence, and increases the value of municipal land
and private property (see Case Study 1-2). Sustainable urban planning that considers
urban expansion can prevent land-use change and deforestation as well.

Rapid population growth and transformation of urban form need not be an obstacle for
designing and implementing an LCCDP. Many general urban policies can be designed
in such a way that they also lead to reduced carbon emissions. For example, new
building codes can be developed in a manner that promotes energy efﬁciency. Similarly,
incentives that promote public transportation not only improve trafﬁc conditions, but
also reduce carbon emissions and urban air pollution.

Politicians and policymakers make strategic use of these co-beneﬁts in different ways.
Some countries, such as China (Lockwood and Cameron, 2012), are focusing on
green growth, which emphasizes the co-beneﬁts of a low carbon growth path and the
necessity of moving towards a low carbon economy. Green growth strategies take
countries’ economic growth ambitions as their starting point and seek to ﬁnd low
carbon or less resource-intensive paths to that growth (Bai, 2009). The global impacts
of reducing emissions may not be immediately felt by stakeholders; however, by
emphasizing co-beneﬁts and the broader goals of promoting a green economy, a city
can effectively communicate the local beneﬁts and importance of its LCCDP.

An LCCDP provides a systems approach to developing and achieving a municipality’s
goals for sustainable development and green, low carbon growth. The LCCDP must
operate in tandem with the city’s other socioeconomic development goals, thereby
requiring an integrated effort at various municipal government levels, as well as
integration with other municipal systems and planning practices. For example, the
LCCDP can be integrated into existing strategic and master planning processes, or
linked to budgetary reporting, service delivery metrics, or other tools the city
government uses to manage its operations.

The LCCDP documentation outlines the entities responsible for planning, implemen-
tation, day-to-day activities, and evaluation, as well as establishes the processes and
strategies to ensure the municipality’s goals are met. When designed and evaluated in
accordance with the LCCDP Assessment Protocol, the LCCDP will have the necessary
components in place to be successfully launched and implemented.

Co-beneﬁts of Low Carbon Development:
Bogota and Urban Happiness




A former Mayor of Bogotá, Enrique Peñalosa, is well
known for driving radical urban improvements with far-
reaching beneﬁts. During his tenure as mayor from 1998
to 2001, he promoted a citizen-centric model of urban
development, supported projects that restricted private
car use, and built bicycle pathways, pedestrian paths,
and parks. Also during this period, construction began
on Bogotá’s internationally renowned bus rapid transit
(BRT) system, TransMilenio, and more than 100,000 trees
were planted through urban greening efforts. However,
while these projects and policies are environmentally
sustainable and low carbon in nature, this was not the
primary motivation.

“His policies may resemble environmentalism, but
they are no such thing. Rather, they were driven by his
conversion to hedonics, an economic philosophy whose
proponents focus on fostering not economic growth but
human happiness.” (Montgomery, 2007)

Bogotá’s demonstration of achieving co-beneﬁts of
urban projects and policies—improved security, human
happiness, and urban livability, to name a few—has
helped shape the paradigm of sustainable, low carbon
development for cities around the world.

1.3 The LCCDP Assessment Protocol

The LCCDP Assessment Protocol (the Protocol; shown in full in the Annex) is a
checklist that outlines all the requirements an LCCDP should fulﬁll, which ensures that
the appropriate steps have been taken and relevant risks managed in preparation for
the Program’s launch.

The Protocol was ﬁrst used by DNV KEMA to validate the Rio de Janeiro LCCDP
(see Case Study 1-1). It was based on DNV KEMA’s experience in developing climate
action plans and LEDS, implementing and evaluating energy efﬁciency programs in
municipalities, and working in carbon markets. The Protocol consists of 44 predeﬁned
requirements that an LCCDP should comply with before its implementation, and
ensures that the LCCDP is well designed, consistent in its strategy, and relevant to the
municipality’s development objectives and targets.

The 44 requirements of the Protocol are grouped into eight categories—among others,
program policy, roles and responsibilities, and documentation—where the municipality
should spend considerable time establishing city-wide policies and processes to
prevent potential pitfalls when implementing an LCCDP. The requirements are considered
critical to successful implementation as they cover important aspects of planning,
implementation, and evaluation.

The Protocol is the standard against which a third party will validate the design of an
LCCDP prior to implementation. The validation process is a transparent, independent
assessment where the audit team documents the Program’s compliance, or




                                                                                          27

                         A central tenant of the Protocol is its ﬂexibility and applicability to as many low carbon
                         city development initiatives as possible. The Protocol considers the variety of strategies
                         and philosophies that exist behind sustainable development and green growth
                         programs pursued by different municipalities—irrespective of the context, priorities
                         or resources that different cities may have. Protocol requirements are described in
                         a how-to format throughout this Guidebook, and the full list of Protocol requirements
                         may be found in the Annex.

                           This Guidebook aims to assist the reader through the process of designing and
                           implementing an LCCDP. By following this Guidebook, municipalities can ensure their
                           LCCDP will comply with all necessary requirements to achieve validation in accordance
                           with the Protocol before implementation, which will contribute to the Program’s
                           success in reaching its targets in an efﬁcient and transparent manner. The Guidebook
                           has been designed to provide a clear and concise roadmap to take the reader through
                           the main LCCDP components and processes.

                           Regardless of a municipality’s previous experience in undertaking a similar process, the
                           Guidebook serves as a step-by-step guide to Program development; helps identify key
                           actors and roles in LCCDP development; and describes how to coordinate the activities
                           of these entities at each stage of Program design and implementation. The Guidebook
                           will help link the reader to the necessary design and implementation elements required
                           for an LCCDP, as well as provide case study examples and suggestions for success.



                           1.4.1     Target Audience of this Guidebook
                           This Guidebook is intended to support those interested in promoting low carbon
                           development and urban sustainability, including:

          Donors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) interested in supporting the
          design and implementation of LCCDPs;

          Financing organizations and private companies interested in learning about potential
          investment opportunities within low carbon development plans in cities; and

          Consultants who will support LCCDP planning, implementation, and evaluation, as
          well as third parties who will conduct the assessment of the Program against the
          LCCDP Assessment Protocol.

     Those who use this Guidebook and the Protocol will bring very diverse expertise and
     knowledge in developing and implementing a low carbon city development framework
     at the municipal level. Therefore, the Guidebook has been designed with the greatest
     ﬂexibility possible to support a wide range of cities in designing and implementing
     their LCCDPs. These guidelines are not intended to constrain the participation of cities
     based on their development level, access to resources or strength of local institutions.
     The Guidebook allows municipalities to begin from different starting points and develop
     Programs with varying levels of sophistication. For example, a city may approach the
     LCCDP development from a top-down perspective, where the strategy for city-wide
     carbon mitigation cascades from the policy and/or legislative level to the project level.
     Another city may have previously initiated several offset projects on a sector-by-sector
     basis, and then decided to implement a city-wide program to ensure a cohesive carbon
     mitigation strategy. Thus, the Guidebook serves as a roadmap for any city that wishes
     to initiate a low carbon development effort.

     Nevertheless, cities must be aware of the barriers they might face when implementing
     an LCCDP, such as difﬁculties reaching economies of scale due to city size, high
     transaction costs, limited access to start-up capital, or limited institutional capacity of
     the local administration. The requirements for the LCCDP described in this Guidebook
     and the LCCDP Assessment Protocol can help a city navigate and address these barriers.



     1.4.2 Structure of the Guidebook
     The structure of this Guidebook follows the same systems approach framework as an
     LCCDP. It goes through each step of the design and implementation process, and helps
     prepare the reader to meet the Protocol requirements speciﬁed at each step. Each
     section corresponds to an LCCDP step and includes the following subsections detailing
     relevant concepts and elements to be developed:

          Initiation discusses all elements that a municipality needs to consider when ﬁrst
          embarking on low carbon development, including aspects required when initiating
          the speciﬁc LCCDP design, such as mission, scope, and stakeholder input.

          Planning details the steps and elements required to plan Program implementation,

                                interventions that will ensure objectives and targets are met.

                                Execution describes the day-to-day operations and systems of Program implemen-

                                the Program as a whole, as well as the individual interventions, must go through
                                to ensure targets and objectives are met. This phase also allows for adjusting
                                the Program in response to the results of the assessment/evaluation, if needed.

                            Figure 1-1 appears throughout the Guidebook at the start of each section, to provide

     Achieving maximum carbon reduction potential in a
     city requires aligning municipal carbon reduction
     interventions with the mitigation activities to be
     implemented. Establishing the right framework for an
     LCCDP early on ensures a coherent program design
     and can help avoid the need to alter the Program once
     implementation has begun. This chapter will discuss
     the groundwork that precedes and supports a
     successful LCCDP design when it is ﬁrst initiated.

     The success of an LCCDP relies heavily on integrating
     the Program’s mission and scope with the broader
     socioeconomic development goals of the city. A
     common understanding of these elements at the
     municipal level, particularly among the agencies that
     will be involved in implementation, supports clarity
     on the types of interventions that can be included
     under the Program.

     Certain elements, such as an emissions inventory, can
     help provide a clearer picture of the distribution of
     emissions in the city, the highest emitting sectors, and
     future emissions scenarios. This information can be
     particularly useful in later stages of Program design,
     such as when planning objectives and targets.

                             2.1 Mission

                             The Program mission establishes three important characteristics of an LCCDP: (1) it
                             communicates the Program’s purpose; (2) it designates the timeframe in which the
                             municipality will seek to achieve its sustainable/low carbon development goals; and
                             (3) it serves as an opportunity for the municipality to identify itself as the “owner”
                             of the Program. By providing the Program’s long-term strategic direction, the mission
                             establishes the framework within which the objectives, targets, and implementation
                             plan are discussed and deﬁned.

The mission should           When determining the mission, it is important not only to articulate the overall
describe the city’s vision   purpose of the LCCDP, but also to place sustainable/low carbon development goals
for the role carbon          in the context of the city’s broader socioeconomic growth policies. The mission should
mitigation will play         describe the city’s vision for the role carbon mitigation will play in short- and long-term
in short- and long-term      social and economic development plans, as well as for how sustainable/low carbon
social and economic          development can be an avenue for green and inclusive economic growth. The LCCDP
development plans            mission must be complementary to city-wide and cross-sectoral development goals in
                             order to promote the sustainability and longevity of the Program.

     2.2 Scope

     While the LCCDP mission describes purpose and context, the scope details how the
     municipality will develop the Program and its strategy to realize sustainable/low carbon
     development beneﬁts. A city-wide GHG inventory can help the municipality deﬁne
     its Program scope. For some cities, the scope will focus on ER strategies for the top
     emitting municipal sectors. For other cities, the focus will remain on city-wide carbon
     mitigation strategies. Therefore, the scope should: (1) elaborate on the sustainable/low
     carbon development strategy that the Program will undertake; and (2) identify the
     inclusion date, that is, the date from which interventions can be included under the
     Program (see Box 2-1).

An inclusion date that has been set too early (that is,         mitigation actions, which can also be important to

these interventions are a result of extra efforts, or whether
the Program is attempting to capture past ERs from
measures that would have been adopted even had there
not been a low carbon development strategy in place.

On the other hand, an inclusion date can be set too late
(that is, after the municipal government started to take
action towards low carbon development). An inclusion
date that falls too late may disqualify ERs from activities
that derive from the municipal government’s focus on a
low carbon development strategy, and should therefore
be included under the LCCDP and counted towards
fulﬁlling the city’s ER target.

Often, deﬁning boundaries   Clearly deﬁned Program boundaries help avoid the risk of inaccurately counting

considered carefully        considered carefully.

                            The boundaries that should be established as part of Program initiation can be
                            separated into the following three categories:

                            1.   Geographic Boundaries, the spatial extent of the Program boundary, which in
                                 most instances is conﬁned to the governing boundaries of the municipality.
                                 However, there are occasions when deﬁning the geographic boundary warrants
                                 further scrutiny. For example, a Program that includes a mass transit system that
                                 spans multiple cities may be considered in one of the following three ways.
                                 One, the intervention may fall under a municipal alliance that fulﬁlls the mission
                                 and scope of the Program, and, therefore, the Program’s geographical boundary
                                 is beyond that of the municipality. Two, the ERs may be split among the
                                 municipalities, but the Program would only count those that occur within the city’s
                                 boundary. Three, a determination may be made that the intervention should be
                                 excluded from the Program; however, this should be the last option and considered
                                 only if the other two alternatives are not applicable. Further guidance on managing
                                 boundary issues can be found in publications such as the GHG Protocol Policy
                                 and Action Accounting and Reporting Standard (WRI, 2013b).

Examples of Double Counting

                                                              have developed methodologies that apply this

                             2.   Emission Sources and Gases, the sources and types of emissions foreseen within
                                  the geographic boundary. Emission sources and gases may be deﬁned at the
                                  intervention level, on an intervention-by-intervention basis (particularly in the case
                                  of a city-wide Program scope). However, if the municipality has focused the
                                  Program scope on key emitting sectors, it may be beneﬁcial to identify the speciﬁc
                                  gases that will be considered. For example, a Program scope focused on the
                                  transport sector would likely include CO2 and methane (if natural gas is a transport
                                  fuel). Nitrous oxide, on the other hand, may not be included, as it is a minor source
                                  of total emissions in road transport and depends greatly on vehicle technology,
                                  fuel, and operating characteristics.

                             3.   Operational Timeline, the period in which the Program is considered to be active
                                  and under implementation. The operational timeline should correspond with
                                  the designated timeline of the Program mission. When setting the timeline, it is
                                  important to consider that ERs from interventions included under the municipality’s
                                  LCCDP, and therefore counted towards its targets, should materialize within the
                                  timeline that the municipality has identiﬁed to achieve its overall sustainability/low

2.4 Strategies to Promote Long-term
Program Continuity

One of the biggest challenges for the long-term implementation of an LCCDP is
ensuring continuity through changes in leadership and shifting municipal priorities. One
strategy to promote continuity is to enact legislation that speciﬁcally states that the
highest priority objectives and targets of the Program are independent from any changes
to the municipal administration. Even with a law to support the continuity of Program
implementation, mitigating all risks of an administration change with legislation alone
is not possible. Gaining broad support and “buy-in” for sustainable development
initiatives from stakeholders and political forces in the municipality can serve as an
additional safeguard for the Program (and its interventions already underway) from the
impacts of an administration change.

                            2.5 Stakeholder Consultations

                            Municipalities often have local laws or regulations that require a stakeholder comment
                            period prior to implementation of certain programs and projects. However, cross-sectoral
                            municipal efforts, such as an LCCDP, require a high level of cooperation and coordination
                            across a municipality. Therefore, going beyond the legal requirements and also
                            inviting stakeholder involvement in developing the Program and providing comments
                            on its design and interventions is good practice.

                            Seeking input from a variety of stakeholders when establishing an LCCDP, including
                            from community members, the private sector, NGOs, and municipal authorities, helps
                            to ensure that both the populations affected by the Program and the institutions
                            responsible for planning and implementation are involved in the decision-making
                            process. In this context, stakeholders could be from entities external to the municipal
                            government, from agencies or departments within the municipal government, and from
                            state and national agencies (to ensure coordination with initiatives at different levels
                            of government). Early and structured stakeholder engagement will offer insight into
                            LCCDP feasibility, as well as help align the Program mission, scope, and boundaries
                            with existing conditions in the municipality. In particular, stakeholder engagement can
                            help identify potential synergies and overcome implementation barriers. Case Study 2-2
                            describes a community-driven development program in Indonesia, where stakeholder
                            involvement has resulted in particularly successful development outcomes.

                            If no existing requirements are in place, various models for stakeholder consultations
                            can offer guidance, including requirements for environmental impact assessments, CDM

                               registration, and registration with a socially-oriented carbon registry, such as the
                               Gold Standard or the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard.
                               Typically, stakeholder consultations include:

                                    At least one public hearing or meeting, announced through both local media
                                    and targeted invitations to ensure stakeholders without media access are
                                    appropriately informed.

                                    A 30–90 day public comment period for Program documents, which are
                                    available online.

                                    Interviews and/or focus groups with speciﬁc stakeholders.

                               After stakeholder consultations, along with the Program documents, the following
                               should be prepared: a brief description of the stakeholder consultation process; a
                               summary of the comments received; and a report describing how comments were
                               taken into consideration in the LCCDP’s design. Stakeholder consultations can also
                               be conducted periodically as part of the ongoing improvement of the LCCDP.

     2.6 Municipal Commitment

     Once the LCCDP mission and scope have been deﬁned, the municipality’s formal
     commitment to Program delivery must be established, which provides an opportunity
     for the municipality to reafﬁrm its pursuit of a sustainable development strategy, as well
     as promote long-term program continuity. In addition to committing to the Program’s
     goals, the municipality should formalize its commitment to continually reviewing and
     evaluating the Program’s progress towards its objectives and targets.

     Municipal commitment may be established through a variety of means, such as a
     legal instrument, a signed agreement, or a public declaration. Examples of legal
     instruments include a local environmental law, a speciﬁc climate change law, or a
     municipal planning law that elicits stakeholder participation in the design and planning
     processes. Commitment can also include a signed agreement with other stakeholders,
     such as the private sector and civil society organizations, who make a voluntary
     commitment to the Program. A public declaration that supports sustainable development
     is the most basic form of municipal commitment and is best accompanied by a legal
     instrument and/or signed agreement.

     As with stakeholder consultations, documenting approval towards the municipal
     commitment is important, as is the process to gain approval from the various municipal
     entities involved in developing and implementing the LCCDP. To achieve broader
     support, the municipality’s commitment to low carbon city development should be
     communicated to all stakeholders, especially those who participated in earlier
     stakeholder engagement processes, and the public.

                          The municipality will have to assess what constitutes a sufﬁcient level of commitment to
                          achieve the Program’s mission and scope. Other considerations and tips for establishing
                          municipal commitment to an LCCDP include:

The municipality’s            Creating a cross-department team – This could include departments that will fulﬁll
commitment to low             future Program Roles (discussed later in the Guidebook), which can help garner
carbon city development       consensus and commitment from the municipal entities that will be involved in
should be communicated        Program implementation. This cross-department team can also serve as a mechanism
to all stakeholders           to enhance resilience to changes in the municipal government.

                              Clarifying resources and timelines – The municipality should clarify the amount
                              of human and ﬁscal resources dedicated to the Program in the near and long term,
                              to demonstrate the operational commitment to the Program’s design and
                              implementation. The level of involvement required by various local government
                              entities should also be clear. The municipality should establish a timeline by which
                              Program implementation should begin (the timeline should allow for a thorough
                              implementation planning process) and ensure that the responsible municipal
                              entities are sufﬁciently supported and held accountable for achieving the timeline.

                              Abiding by existing laws – When declaring its commitment towards low carbon
                              city development, the municipality should ensure that its commitment reﬂects
                              its primary environmental, social, and economic context. The commitment must
                              comply with all applicable legal requirements to which the municipality subscribes
                              (local, federal, international, etc.), but particularly those that relate to ERs.

                                                                       INITIATION




     2.7 Emissions Inventory

     During LCCDP design, the municipality will need to set objectives and targets,
     including measuring success and progress in terms of emissions reduced (as well as
     co-beneﬁts achieved, which can be an additional way to measure success, described
     further in Section 3.1.2). An emissions inventory can signiﬁcantly contribute to setting
     adequate objectives and targets, as well as help to identify high-emitting sectors on
     which to focus intervention efforts.

     A municipality’s emissions inventory can be a central tool in the design and evaluation
     of an LCCDP that aims to systematically reduce carbon emissions, and provide details
     on the sources and magnitude of a city’s emissions. Sophisticated emissions inventories,
     with high data quality and preparation resources, can also include the timeframe and
     geographical distribution of emissions. Forecasting future emissions—that is, emissions
     that would occur in the absence of the LCCDP—is also useful because it represents a
     business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Based on this scenario, assessing potential ERs from
     Program interventions in a targeted manner is possible.

     While an emissions inventory is extremely valuable during Program design, the LCCDP
     Assessment Protocol does not require a city to have an emissions inventory prior to
     launching the Program, principally because embarking on a low carbon development
     path should not be constrained or delayed. However, the Protocol requires that the
     municipality outline future steps to build an emissions inventory to help evaluate
     progress towards low carbon city development.

                               Some considerations and tips for conducting a city-wide emissions inventory include
                               the following:

                                    Using an internationally recognized methodology, such as the Global Protocol
                                    for Community-Scale GHG Emissions (GPC; C40/ICLEI/WRI, 2012), which follows
                                    a standardized approach to city-level GHG inventories. The GPC was developed
                                    jointly by the WRI, C40, ICLEI, the World Bank, the UN Environment Programme,
                                    and UN-Habitat to harmonize GHG emissions’ measurement and reporting
                                    processes for cities. This ensures that inventories meet a high credibility standard,
                                    are comparable across cities, and are calculated consistently over time (see Case
                                    Study 2-3). A standardized approach to GHG inventory calculation also makes it
                                    possible to determine the absolute ERs achieved by the city (described further in
                                    Section 3.1.2), gauge city-wide GHG impacts of policy actions, and participate
                                    in any new market mechanisms based on city-wide ERs that may emerge. Technical
                                    resources are available to help guide cities through the process of developing an
                                    inventory that complies with the GPC, including ICLEI’s U.S. Community Protocol
                                    for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI, 2013) for US
                                    cities, and WRI’s Greenhouse Gas Accounting Tool for Chinese Cities (WRI, 2013c).




Case Study 2-3:
New York City’s GHG Emissions Inventory
and Scenario Modeling




NEW YORK CITY provides an exemplary model for
city-led emissions inventories. The Mayor’s ofﬁce of
Long-term Planning and Sustainability compiles and
reports an annual GHG inventory, comparing it to the
city’s 2005 emission levels published in their ﬁrst climate
action plan, PlaNYC, in 2007. By monitoring against
the initial inventory, the city has been able to inform
its policymaking and actions, as well as report and
demonstrate performance in a transparent and engaging
manner for external stakeholders and the general public.

                                                                  INITIATION




     Building on previous inventories, such as the national GHG emissions inventory
     and ongoing emissions inventory efforts. Countries that are parties to the United
     Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have committed
     to submit periodic updates that include national emissions. Emissions inventories
     prepared for the UNFCCC are consistent among countries, and while they
     may not be detailed at the municipal or state level, they can often provide basic
     information and trends, as well as data proxies if local data is not available
     (UNFCCC, 2013). Past local emissions inventories may be helpful for designing
     the LCCDP, but they should generally not be more than 5 years old.

     Identifying resources for inventory development – While developing an emissions
     inventory can be intensive in terms of time, money, and data, it is extremely
     valuable. When conducting an inventory for the ﬁrst time, assistance from a third
     party with previous experience, such as a local university or consultancy, is
     beneﬁcial. During the process, government ofﬁcials can also undergo inventory
     training so they can be responsible for future periodic updates.

     Periodically updating the inventory – By deﬁnition, an emissions inventory
     quantiﬁes emissions that have occurred in the past; they can only be calculated
     once the input data is available. These inventories are commonly updated every
     2 years, which can help reduce calculation time. City-level GHG inventory-
     monitoring systems can also be vertically layered with inventory systems at the
     regional or national level to share data and promote harmonization. When the
     most recent update includes any change to methodologies or data sources, it is
     best practice to go back and recalculate past inventories to ensure consistency
     in baselines and emission trends over time.

     Identifying key sectors – The emissions inventory can be used to identify key
     emitting sectors. Further exploring these sectors can help identify the factors
     contributing to city-wide emissions or provide background for further analysis,
     such as marginal cost abatement curves, which show the potential for reducing
     emissions and associated costs.

     Establishing future scenarios – Once a baseline emissions level has been
     established, preparing scenarios of emissions over time is possible by considering
     the potential impacts of various interventions. For example, a scenario can be
     developed by choosing feasible interventions within a priority sector with good ER
     potential, and estimating emissions and implementation costs. The scenario can
     then be compared with the baseline to assess potential reductions, as well as with
     other scenarios to understand which combination of interventions will yield the
     best results in terms of mitigation and costs (see Case Study 2-3). Building scenarios
     often requires sound technical, ﬁnancial, and legal knowledge.

     PLANNING




                Following the decision to develop an LCCDP and the
                successful determination of its mission and scope,
                planning must be undertaken. The planning phase
                focuses on moving the LCCDP from a concept towards
                implementation, and requires setting objectives and
                targets, assigning roles and responsibilities, and building
                a feasible strategy and portfolio of interventions to meet
                the objectives and targets. As with many programs,
                the LCCDP’s success depends greatly on robust planning
                at the outset.

                In this section of the Guidebook, how to set adequate
                objectives and targets will be clariﬁed, including
                developing a strategy and timeline for achieving them.
                This section will also discuss assigning and communicating
                responsibilities to municipal agencies or third-party
                entities for effective Program management. Several
                stages and associated responsibilities need to be
                managed in planning and implementing an LCCDP, which
                requires not only technical and ﬁnancial capabilities,
                but also a clear distribution of roles and responsibilities.
                The planning process is best initiated by selecting
                the entity that will coordinate and manage the LCCDP
                (called the Coordination and Management Entity,
                described further in Section 3.2), and should be well
                documented in a Program Document (see Box 3-1).

                This section will also elaborate on the two types of
                interventions that can be developed under an LCCDP:
                policy and project interventions. Planning an effective

                              portfolio of interventions will help the Program reach
                              its targets. Prospective interventions should initially be
                              screened to ensure they fulﬁll certain eligibility criteria,
                              as well as undergo a feasibility assessment and a
                              risk assessment.

                              As interventions start being implemented, relevant
                              information will be generated that will grow in complexity
                              and quantity as the Program develops. The ﬁnal part
                              of this section describes the Program Implementation
                              Plan, which will provide the roadmap and structure
                              for implementation, and ensure that the appropriate
                              information and documentation procedures are in
                              place. This Plan is a “live” document that should stay
                              relevant by reﬂecting the most up-to-date status of the
                              municipality’s LCCDP.

a whole                      and best practices. This assessment can serve to orient the objectives and targets by
                             identifying priority sectors that will require more attention and additional resources
                             to achieve ERs in a cost-effective way. Sectors that have already adopted advances in
                             technology and other best practices may not require capacity building or support:
                             achieving a greater leap in ERs may require extensive investments, which may not
                             meet the municipality’s preferred cost-beneﬁt ratio for the Program.



                             3.1.1 Objectives
                             The Program objectives should be linked to the Program mission, and should provide
                             further details on what the Program is designed to accomplish once it is implemented.
                             Program objectives differ from Program targets, which identify speciﬁc ER goals.




54
                            For example, Program objectives can address the following questions:

                                Why is it important to quantify ERs for the municipality?

                                How will the Program support green and inclusive growth in the municipality?

                                What role does carbon mitigation have in future municipal plans and initiatives?

                                Which interventions can be included under the Program and when can ERs be
                                counted towards the Program target?



                            3.1.2 Targets
                            Program targets identify speciﬁc ER goals. Clear and speciﬁc targets help to measure
                            the success of an LCCDP, and can set city-wide ER goals, sector-based ER goals, or
                            a combination of the two. It is recommended that short-, medium- and longer-term
                            targets be set (for example, targets to be reached in 2 years, 5 years, and 15 years,
                            respectively), to serve as a mechanism for continuous evaluation of the Program and
                            its effectiveness. The targets, at a minimum, should comply with all applicable legal
                            requirements, particularly in cities that are subject to mandatory national or regional ER
                            targets. Targets can be set in absolute or relative terms.

                                Absolute ER targets involve a commitment to reduce GHG emissions by a speciﬁed
                                amount. The municipality identiﬁes a base year and quantiﬁes its emissions levels
                                through a city-wide GHG inventory, and can then use the base year as a reference
                                point for its carbon reduction goals. In this context, a standardized methodology
                                for calculating the GHG inventory is essential. An example of an absolute ER target
                                is the target set by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Japan (Case Study 3-1).

                                Relative ER targets frame ERs in terms of the amount of emissions relative to a
                                certain factor, such as ERs “per unit of output” or “per unit of input.” This is a
                                good alternative for municipalities with limited resources or limited capacity that
                                may not be able to develop a city-wide emissions inventory prior to implementing
                                an LCCDP—relative targets can help kick-start climate change actions in such
                                circumstances. Identifying a base year when developing relative targets is not

Case Study 3-1:
Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s GHG
Reduction Target




                                                         IN DECEMBER 2006, THE TOKYO METROPOLITAN
                                                         GOVERNMENT set the target to reduce its GHG
                                                         emissions by 25 percent from 2000 levels by the year
                                                         2020. It then adopted the Tokyo Climate Change
                                                         Strategy and the Tokyo Metropolitan Environmental
                                                         Master Plan to build on existing programs and chart
                                                         a path towards achieving the target. Tokyo has
                                                         experienced success with a variety of low-carbon
                                                         initiatives, including mandatory GHG reporting, the
                                                         Tokyo Green Building Program, and Tokyo’s ﬁrst of its
                                                         kind urban Cap-and-Trade Program.

                         The municipality must be clear about whether it is setting an absolute or relative target
                         so that appropriate interventions can be developed and implemented. The municipality
                         should avoid using both kinds of targets, as this may lead to confusion. The GHG
                         Protocol Mitigation Goals Accounting and Reporting Standard (WRI, 2013a) is a good
                         resource for other important considerations and examples for setting targets, including
                         types, level, length, and boundaries of targets (for example, 50 percent reduction
                         relative to 2010 emissions; total ERs of 200 tCO2e; or 50 tCO2e reduced from a
                         baseline scenario).

                         Programs that include emissions-trading schemes and offset generation, which involve
                         buying and selling ER units, require quantiﬁcation in absolute terms in order to track the
                         destination of ERs in a clear and transparent manner. If ERs are retired, they can count
                         towards meeting the LCCDP targets. However, if they are sold, they will be accounted
                         for by the buyer and therefore cannot count towards the LCCDP targets. Clarity on the
                         destination of each ER unit will avoid double counting and dual ownership, which is
                         essential for the Program’s credibility.

                         In addition to speciﬁc ER targets, targets can also be set for measurable socio-economic
                         co-beneﬁts. For instance, a city may set targets related to improving quality of life,
                         transport connectivity, or energy access. As with ER targets, it is best practice to have a
                         strong methodology for quantiﬁcation, a baseline, and a monitoring system in place to
                         track the progress of any additional target that is set.

                         3.2 Program Roles and Responsibilities

                         A successful LCCDP will have clearly deﬁned roles and responsibilities that reﬂect the
                         needs, objectives and targets of the Program. A general description of the main roles
                         is provided below, and other assignments and responsibilities may be speciﬁed as
                         the Program evolves and complexity increases. The coordination and management
                         role should be assigned as soon as possible so that the entity is involved in Program
                         development from the onset.

                         When identifying the actors and agencies that will fulﬁll each of the Program Roles, no
                         conﬂict of interest should prevent the agency from effectively carrying out its role. The
                         agencies that take on the Program Roles should have sufﬁcient authority to carry out
                         their responsibilities, but should not have the authority to undermine the role of other
                         agencies involved in Program implementation. The institutional architecture of the
                         Program Roles is ﬂexible, as long as the process for assigning responsibility is clear.



                         3.2.1 Roles and Responsibilities
                         This Guidebook identiﬁes ﬁve roles (outlined below and shown in Table 3-1) that are
                         critical to the successful implementation and efﬁcient coordination of an LCCDP.
                         These roles and responsibilities can be assigned in a variety of ways among municipal
                         agencies, as outlined below. More details on how these roles function during program
                         implementation are given in Section 4. The responsibilities of each of these roles are




                                                                                                                  57
     PLANNING




                intertwined; therefore, communication and accurate information ﬂow between these
                roles is necessary for the Program’s success.

                    Coordination and Management Entity (CME) – This is the central body that will
                    oversee Program coordination and management, and should be assigned ﬁrst. It
                    plays a crucial role, as it will manage the execution of every phase of the Program
                    (design, planning, implementation, and evaluation).

                    The CME should be invested with the authority to manage the Program’s political,
                    institutional, and administrative coordination, and, therefore, must be an agency
                    positioned at a sufﬁciently high level to ensure it has coordinating authority across
                    all municipal departments. This entity should be authorized to make requests of
                    municipal departments, as well as enforce and monitor compliance. It should also
                    coordinate reports on Program performance, and make recommendations for
                    improvement. The CME also has a responsibility to engage stakeholders and gain
                    their feedback on the Program and its interventions.

                    Some of the CME’s key responsibilities are to ensure double counting of ERs does
                    not occur and to establish an operation and management system, including appro-
                    priate documented procedures for Program implementation. Other responsibilities
                    include determining new interventions to be included under the Program and the
                    ﬁnal destination of the ERs (that is, whether ERs will be retired internally against
                    the municipality’s ER target or sold externally). In addition, the CME is responsible
                    for coordinating all carbon sales and transactions, coordinating with state- and
                    national-level registries, integrating local government actions across sectors during
                    the implementation of interventions, and monitoring and enforcing compliance
                    of other entities involved in the Program. Depending on the capacity, resources,
                    and structure of the government administration, the CME may take on additional
                    responsibilities or, conversely, delegate responsibilities to other entities as needed.

                    Multi-Sector Working Group (MWG) – This working group is comprised of
                    representatives from across sectors that advise the CME on crucial input during
                    the planning and implementation phases. The MWG deliberates and assesses
                    the eligibility of potential interventions to be included under the Program, and
                    advises on whether to include the intervention under the Program—based
                    on sector expertise, knowledge of existing municipal activities and institutional
                    arrangements, and an understanding of on-the-ground realities within the
                    municipality. Therefore, the MWG should consist of representatives from
                    different sectors to ensure a broad range of perspectives and criteria are
                    considered in the assessment process. The MWG can also provide input on
                    what methodology should be applied to an intervention, as well as recommend
                    whether to retire or sell the ERs.

                    The MWG is closely linked to the CME and multiple possibilities exist for a
                    structured relationship between the two. The entity designated as the CME could

possibly have the resources and capacity to also fulﬁll the MWG responsibilities.
Another possibility is that the CME serves as a Secretariat to the MWG to
coordinate meetings. The MWG can also consider input, or have members, from
other stakeholder groups outside the municipal government. In any case,
MWG opinions, recommendations, and decisions must be reported to the CME,
which should then be held accountable for efﬁcient follow-up.

Technical Advisory Entity (TAE) – This entity provides technical input to help the
proposed interventions move forward through the Program process. Interventions
are chosen by the CME, based on MWG recommendations. The TAE then
identiﬁes and recommends an appropriate methodology to quantify ERs and the
appropriate asset class to pursue (that is, CDM, VCS, Gold Standard, if applicable),
and estimates the ﬁnancial information needed to evaluate cost-effectiveness. In
this process, the TAE can gather input from the MWG, the Information Management
Entity (IME), and the Validation and Veriﬁcation Entity (VVE; see IME and VVE
descriptions below) to ensure that the selected methodologies are aligned with
the objectives, data availability, and any monitoring requirements of the Program.
The TAE is responsible for making the initial estimate of potential ERs to be
generated by the intervention and reporting this information back to the CME for
input into its decision-making process.

Since the TAE is responsible for providing recommendations on the technical
aspects of Program implementation, the designated entity should be separate from
the CME and have staff with a high level of technical expertise. Furthermore, by
separating the Program’s political and technical coordination, the municipality can
prevent the technical recommendations from being perceived as political actions.

Information Management Entity (IME) – This entity coordinates and manages
all Program-related information and data. It houses the Program’s MRV system and
should be allocated strategically within the municipality’s existing data collection
structure. The IME must have the necessary mandate to access data; for example,
one alternative is to use existing reporting obligations of public agencies, such
as those for the national communications to the UNFCCC. The IME should
establish clear information and documentation management systems that track
the individuals responsible for implementing procedures, as well as ensure that all
involved in the LCCDP are aware of procedures. Among its other tasks, the IME
should keep track of the interventions developed, ERs achieved, and transactions
involving the retirement or sale of reductions. If required by speciﬁc methodologies
or regulatory systems, the IME will generate annual monitoring reports that a
VVE can use to verify ERs. The IME reports to the CME on data results and data
input compliance of the respective municipal departments.

What entity should be designed IME will depend greatly on existing municipal
data collection practices and capacity within the municipality. The IME role can also

                                    departments and report to the CME, or to the CME, provided it has the necessary
                                    capacity and capability.

                                    Validation and Veriﬁcation Entity (VVE) – This external body carries out essential
                                    quality control measures to ensure that each ER generated under the Program is
                                    real and properly counted. The VVE validates/veriﬁes the ERs generated by inter-
                                    ventions according to its assigned methodology, and evaluates the appropriateness
                                    of new methodologies under the Program. The VVE can also certify ERs according
                                    to the regulatory standard of a chosen asset class (that is, CDM, VCS, Gold
                                    Standard, if applicable). To avoid any conﬂicts of interest, the VVE must operate
                                    externally and independently of the CME and any of the other Program Roles.



                               3.2.2 Guidelines for Assigning Roles and Responsibilities
                               Determining which municipal entities will take on each Program Role requires insight
                               into the specialized skills, infrastructure, and resources that will be required to fulﬁll the
                               responsibilities. Once Program implementation has begun, each municipal entity that
                               has taken on a Program Role will need to fully understand its new responsibilities and
                               corresponding expectations, as well as how to interact with other municipal entities
                               during each step of the process.

Each municipality must         It is not necessary for each role to be taken by a separate municipal entity. Fulﬁlling

structure of its LCCDP         the various roles is maintained and the responsibilities are clear. For example, one
in a way that is both          municipal entity, which is strategically located within the local administration and has
appropriate for its resource   sufﬁcient capacity and expertise, could possibly take on more than one role (or all
availability and capacity,     roles aside from the VVE). Each municipality must organize the responsibility structure

existing expertise             as well as for leveraging existing expertise or political positioning.
or political positioning
                               However, some considerations and guidelines must be taken into account to
                               avoid potential conﬂicts of interest stemming from assigning incompatible roles to
                               the same entity. In this regard, the assignment of each role should be subject to the
                               following guidelines:

                                    The responsibilities and requirements of each role must be completed or delegated
                                    by the designated entity.

                                    The CME and IME assignments are ﬁxed in the short term to maintain
                                    Program continuity.

                                    The composition and attendance of the MWG may vary from intervention
                                    to intervention, but the MWG will always report to the CME.




62
     The TAE and VVE assignments may change from intervention to intervention,
     and must be clearly stated every time a new intervention enters the Program.
     For any intervention, TAE and VVE roles must be assigned to different entities to
     ensure integrity in the audit process and avoid conﬂicts of interest. The VVE must
     always be external to the CME.

While the responsibilities and requirements of each role are ﬁxed, the speciﬁc assignments
of each role may vary over time to reﬂect changes in the municipal administration and/
or structures (that is, with CME or IME) or on an intervention-by-intervention basis (that
is, TAE and VVE). Municipalities have a diversity of departments and political economies
that can inﬂuence the assignment of Program Roles. Some examples for how roles may
be organized are outlined in Table 3-2, which can evolve and improve over the lifetime
of the Program as capacity increases in the municipality.



3.2.3 Identifying Characteristics of Municipal Agencies to
      Adopt Program Roles
3.2.3.1   IDENTIFYING THE CME

The most effective CMEs will be located within the Ofﬁces of the Mayor, and assigned
through the Chief of Staff and advisory team. Another good choice for a CME is an
existing ofﬁce that advises and implements actions related to climate change mitigation
or adaptation. If such an entity does not exist, the CME’s role can be assigned to
another ofﬁce or a new ofﬁce can be created. In all cases, it is advisable to conﬁrm that
the chosen entity fulﬁlls a series of characteristics that will help it succeed. For example,
does the agency have:

     A high standing in local government, so others will follow its leadership?

     Legal authority for planning and executing strategic interventions, as well as for
     managing municipal resources?

     A sufﬁcient budget to accomplish the necessary LCCDP tasks (either from its own
     budget or through other agencies involved in the LCCDP)?

     Political support from high-level ofﬁcials to design and implement the LCCDP?

     Trust from the public and other agencies within the local administration?

3.2.3.2   IDENTIFYING THE MWG

In most cases, a new group will need to be created to fulﬁll the MWG responsibilities
and advise the CME. Its membership should include representatives from the different
sectors in the municipality, to ensure that a broad range of perspectives and insights
are considered. Speciﬁc people should also be appointed to the MWG to promote
continued commitment to the working group. The following questions may help
conﬁrm the capacity of the MWG. Does the MWG have:

    Members representing different urban sectors that will be the target of mitigation
    and adaptation actions?

    Members that are appointed and supported by the sector or entity they represent?

    Members that can make decisions and commitments on behalf of their represented
    entity or sector?

    Access to the technical and socioeconomic information that will enhance
    understanding of the challenges and provide the best advice?

    Internal rules of organization and procedures for documenting its work?

3.2.3.3   IDENTIFYING THE TAE

The TAE should have staff with the technical capabilities needed to identify and
recommend methodologies, estimate ERs, and conduct cost-beneﬁt and risk assessments
of the proposed interventions. Entities that may be suitable for this role include
consultants, universities, research institutions, or non-governmental think tanks. Engaging
multiple TAEs through the course of the Program can be beneﬁcial, as it engages
diverse capabilities and promotes multidisciplinary analysis. Answering the following
questions can help determine whether the selected entity is appropriate for the role.
Does the TAE have:

    A sufﬁcient number of well-trained technical personnel who are available to
    accomplish the necessary duties?

    The necessary infrastructure, in terms of access to information and information
    management (computing facilities, software, etc.)?

    Trust from the public and from the entities participating in the LCCDP?

    The legal authority to participate in this role?

3.2.3.4   IDENTIFYING THE IME

The IME coordinates and manages all Program information and data, and existing
organizations may be able to accomplish these tasks, either within the municipal structure
or externally. The LCCDP will introduce new and unique duties, such as managing the
MRV system, and the selected entity may need to adjust its internal capabilities and




                                                                                        65
     PLANNING




                resources accordingly. The IME will also collaborate with the VVE during validation/
                veriﬁcation, and should oversee the management of data and information generated
                as part of the LCCDP. When selecting the IME, the municipality should address whether
                the IME has:

                     The mandate to collect data from various municipal departments, as well as to
                     collaborate with external stakeholders.

                     The necessary staff, in terms of availability and capabilities, to carry out the IME
                     responsibilities.

                     The necessary infrastructure, in terms of access to information and information
                     management systems (computing facilities, software, etc.).

                     Trust from the public and from the entities participating in the LCCDP.

                     A sufﬁcient budget to accomplish the IME tasks.

                3.2.3.5   IDENTIFYING THE VVE

                The VVE is the accredited third party that will verify ERs from the interventions under
                the Program. In most cases, accreditation is received through national accreditation
                bodies, but other means of accrediting do exist. The situation may differ across
                countries, which is why the municipality should deﬁne who can be considered a third
                party and what should be demonstrated in order to receive accreditation. For example,
                a municipality might specify that a VVE may be any entity that is certiﬁed under an
                existing carbon ﬁnance program, such as the CDM, VCS, or Gold Standard.



                3.2.4 Assessing Agency Capabilities and Availability
                      of Resources
                Designing and implementing an LCCDP requires certain capabilities and local
                resources. Each case may vary, depending on the Program scope, but the general
                requirements to consider when undertaking an LCCDP are described below.

                1.   Human resources – The entities involved in the Program must have sufﬁcient
                     capacity in terms of quantity, qualiﬁcation, training, and availability. Well-trained
                     personnel are necessary to undertake the Program’s daily operations, and the
                     municipality is advised to create a matrix to match tasks with the required
                     personnel and skill sets. A training program can help develop skills and transfer
                     knowledge among Program staff.

                2.   Sufﬁcient budget – The municipal budget should be sufﬁcient to accomplish all
                     the necessary management and operational tasks of the LCCDP. Information on




66
     the available and allocated budget can be provided to the IME on a regular basis
     to help track costs.

3.   A documentation system – A documentation system will ensure Program personnel
     are aware of procedures and who holds responsibility. The system should establish
     the duties related to record keeping, data collection, and the MRV system, which
     are fundamental to the Program’s success.

4.   Legal mandates and terms of reference – The existing responsibilities of entities
     participating in the Program should be reviewed, and legal mandates and terms of
     reference should be prepared if they do not exist for the new LCCDP responsibilities.

5.   Sufﬁcient infrastructure – The entity must have sufﬁcient infrastructure and
     equipment to complete tasks, particularly in terms of computing capacity, data
     access, and information dissemination. An LCCDP requires large quantities of
     data, and produces information that should be provided to different stakeholders
     through, for example, the Internet and other media.

In some cases, the capacity required for certain Program Roles already exists within the
municipality. Case Study 3-2 provides an example from Buenos Aires, where a municipal
department was tasked with undertaking actions related to climate change, which was
an area of work initially unrelated to its primary sector/area of expertise.




                                                                                       67

3.3 Intervention Planning

Policy Interventions and Project Interventions are two types of interventions that can be
developed under an LCCDP.

    Policy interventions are top-down municipal carbon mitigation actions implemented
    at the municipality’s administrative level. For example, policies can be economic,
    ﬁscal, or regulatory, and the intervention boundary is typically the municipality’s
    geographic boundary, as this is often the reach of municipality’s administrative
    inﬂuence. Policy interventions are dependent on a number of administrative and
    political processes. Depending on the municipal administration, coordinating
    political processes and gaining support for policies may lengthen the intervention
    registration process, which may lead to delays or unpredictable yearly ER rates.
    Monitoring and attribution of ERs can also be complex with policy interventions,
    but technical guidance is available (described further in Section 4.1.2.2).

    Project interventions are bottom-up carbon mitigation activities that reduce GHG
    emissions from speciﬁc sources within a designated sector and geographical
    area. Project interventions may be implemented throughout the city or fall within
    a geographic subsection of the city. In general, when compared to policy
    interventions, projects tend to have a clearer and more easily quantiﬁable BAU
    emissions proﬁle that is reduced as a result of project activities.

Municipal priorities, stakeholder input, and local political and economic contexts play
a role in determining the intervention options that could be pursued under an LCCDP.
Numerous studies have been written for speciﬁc countries and regions about the most




                                                                                       69
           PLANNING




                              effective project and policy options to achieve low carbon city development, particularly
                              considering the local political and economic contexts. One example, the book
                              Sustainable Low-Carbon City Development in China, is described in Case Study 3-3.

                              A policy intervention may lead to various project interventions. For example, a city-
                              wide energy efﬁciency policy that includes regulations (for example, building codes,
                              household energy efﬁciency, etc.) provides the impetus for a city-wide project to
                              replace outdated household appliances with more energy-efﬁcient ones. In such cases,
                              exercising caution when counting ERs towards the LCCDP targets is important. For
                              example, ERs from the appliance replacement project may be attributed either to the
                              project or to the overall energy efﬁciency policy, but not both (which would constitute
                              double counting ERs). For a carbon reduction project that has the necessary ﬁnancial

                              to determine an intervention’s potential contribution to the Program’s objectives and

                              Intervention Feasibility Assessment, and the Intervention Risk Assessment.

                              These assessments support the development of a diverse and balanced Portfolio of
                              Interventions with a high probability of achieving the Program’s full ER potential.
                              Through this three-tiered assessment process, the municipality can identify a set of
                              suitable interventions and develop a comprehensive strategy to manage risks in the
                              short and long term. It also serves as a preventive measure against double counting
                              and dual ownership, and can help municipalities take advantage of any synergies that
                              may exist across interventions and sectors (for example, doing construction on a new
                              dedicated BRT lane while installing energy-efﬁcient street lights along the corridor).
                              Overall, an optimal Portfolio of Interventions will include interventions with different
                              levels of implementation risks, different starting dates, and both policy and project
                              interventions in different sectors.

                              The Intervention Feasibility Assessment and the Intervention Risk Assessment are
                              useful to do both ex-ante (that is, before implementation) to determine adequacy and
                              potential of proposed interventions, as well as ex-post (that is, after implementation) to
                              determine portfolio performance as part of the periodic control and evaluation process
                              (described in Section 5).

If the intervention            The Eligibility Criteria are a set of requirements an intervention must meet in order
does not fulﬁll or is not      to be registered under the municipality’s LCCDP, which should be developed in the

should not be included         Through this mechanism, the municipality can ensure that interventions fulﬁll certain
under the Program              requirements of the LCCDP Assessment Protocol, particularly those pertaining to
                               preventing double counting and dual ownership of an intervention and its ERs.

                               While the speciﬁc eligibility criteria may change depending on unique conditions in
                               the municipality, in general each intervention must be:

                               1.   Within the pre-deﬁned intervention inclusion parameters, which are criteria (in
                                    addition to those outlined below) that the municipality sets in advance to determine
                                    whether an intervention can be included under the Program. Examples include
                                    ﬁnancial commitment secured on or after the Program inclusion date (deﬁned as
                                    part of the LCCDP scope), the intervention’s inclusion in the municipality’s long-
                                    term plan, the existence of a formalized contract (for interventions implemented
                                    by an external organization), a well-deﬁned mechanism for implementation, and
                                    intervention targets that align with Program objectives and targets. The intervention
                                    inclusion parameters should be determined based on existing conditions in the city
                                    and municipal processes, and help the municipality clarify for stakeholders which
                                    interventions may be included under the Program and why.

                               2.   Transparent about registration with carbon ﬁnance or carbon offset programs
                                    (VCS, Gold Standard, CDM, etc.), which may affect the ownership of the intervention’s
                                    ERs. Disclosure of an intervention’s registration, or intention to register, with such
                                    programs will inform the ownership criteria (see #4 below), as well as the decision
                                    to retire or sell ERs. This proactively prevents double ownership and double
                                    counting by disclosing if the ERs produced are already allocated to another program
                                    or entity.

                               3.   Located within the city’s geographical boundaries, which ensures that laws and
                                    regulations of the municipality apply to the intervention.

                               4.   Under the ownership and/or control of the municipality, even partially, through
                                    either direct implementation or agreement. For example, the intervention may
                                    be implemented:
                                    a)    directly by a municipal department;
                                    b)    by a municipal department through a sub-contractor;
                                    c)    by a municipal department through a public-private partnership;
                                    d)    by a civil society organization in cooperation with a municipal department; or




                                                                                                                        73
     PLANNING




                     e)   through ﬁnancial or other incentives introduced by the municipality to
                          encourage behavior change (the intervention, in this case, does not include
                          a physical activity).

                     This helps ensure that the municipality owns the ERs from the intervention. If there
                     are multiple parties involved in implementation or ﬁnancing, an agreement must
                     be produced that speciﬁes the transfer of ER ownership to the municipality or
                     speciﬁes the terms of shared ownership, including any revenue-sharing arrangement.
                     The terms must reﬂect that, while ERs from an intervention may be owned by
                     multiple parties in various shares, each individual ER is owned exclusively by only
                     one party. In this sense, it is also good practice to be transparent about sources of
                     ﬁnancing for interventions.

                5.   In a sector governed by the municipality, which can often vary from city to city.
                     Some examples, based on the sectoral scopes permitted under the CDM and
                     other mechanisms, are:

                          Energy industries (renewable/non-renewable)
                          Energy distribution
                          Energy demand
                          Manufacturing industries
                          Chemical industries
                          Construction
                          Transport
                          Mining/Mineral production
                          Metal production
                          Fugitive emissions from fuel (solid, oil, and gas)
                          Fugitive emissions from production and consumption
                          of halocarbons and sulfur hexaﬂuoride
                          Solvents use
                          Waste handling and disposal
                          Afforestation and reforestation
                          Agriculture
                          Forest conservation/REDD+

                6.   Not legally mandated by higher levels of government, such as state or federal
                     governments. If a legal mandate does exist, evidence should be presented to
                     show it has not been enforced to date and that enforcement will improve as a
                     result of the LCCDP. This is to ensure that the ERs are under ownership and/or
                     control of the municipality, and are not double counted by higher levels of
                     government. Good coordination with higher levels of government is important
                     in this regard, as in some cases an agreement may be needed for shared ER
                     ownership (as described above in #4). This is particularly pertinent for countries
                     with international ER pledges and domestic climate change policies.

                               7.   Shown to result in ERs, of any quantity, that go beyond what would occur in a
                                    baseline scenario, that is, it must add carbon reduction value. The LCCDP aims
                                    to develop interventions that add carbon reduction value, which is demonstrated
                                    as follows.

All interventions must add          When, in the absence of the Program,
carbon reduction value                  the proposed voluntary measure would not be implemented; or
                                        the mandatory policy or regulation would not be enforced systematically and
                                        non-compliance with those requirements is widespread in the municipality.

                                    —OR—

                                    When the Program:
                                        leads to a greater level of enforcement of the existing mandatory policy or
                                        regulation; or
                                        allows for the reduction of emissions exceeding the mandatory reductions
                                        required under existing policy or regulations.

                                    Accordingly, the BAU and baseline emissions are not necessarily the emissions
                                    scenario that would have occurred without the existence of the LCCDP. In some
                                    cases, interventions that may have been initiated prior to the ofﬁcial adoption
                                    of the LCCDP may also add carbon reduction value. It is important to note that
                                    interventions that seek to comply with different carbon or climate ﬁnance
                                    mechanisms, such as the CDM or VCS, will also be required to fulﬁll the criteria
                                    imposed by the relevant regulatory body.

                               8.   In compliance with all environmental and legal requirements of the city, state
                                    and national governments, which ensures that the intervention embodies
                                    environmental and legal due diligence.

                               to continue to expand throughout the Program’s lifetime. The municipality should
                               determine in the Planning stage how frequently potential interventions under the
                               Program will be assessed (quarterly, bi-annually, or otherwise).

            PLANNING




                               The Intervention Feasibility Assessment will give the municipality a better picture of
                               the resources required to implement the interventions, particularly to help create
                               balance in the Portfolio of Interventions. A balanced Portfolio will include interventions
                               that are easy to implement, as well as those that require a considerable investment
                               in terms of human resources, time, ﬁnances, and/or technology. An initial Intervention
                               Feasibility Assessment can help to avoid portfolios that are unrealistically capital-intensive
                               or will not generate enough ERs. In addition, examining the Portfolio in terms of its
                               contribution to green and inclusive growth (that is, environmentally sustainable and
                               socially inclusive economic development) can help overcome political barriers to
                               implementation by leveraging co-beneﬁts (see Case Study 3-5 for an example of
                               co-beneﬁts of bike-sharing programs). Positive and negative interactions of the various
                               policies and actions should also be considered in an examination of the Portfolio,
                               which can help optimize and improve robustness of its implementation. A balanced
                               Portfolio of Interventions allows the municipality to move forward with a number of
                               its planned interventions, even if it is unable to immediately acquire sufﬁcient resources
                               for the more ambitious options.

In the Planning stage, the initial Intervention Feasibility Assessment is a high-level
scoping of the potential interventions under the Program, and it can take the form of
a simple table (for an example, see Table 3-3). The information available at this stage
is unlikely to be detailed, highly accurate, and/or precise, which is appropriate for the
initial scoping exercise. As the Program goes through the Execution and Assessment/
Evaluation stages, each intervention will be subject to more extensive processes of data
collection and analysis (such as the Intervention Registration Process described in Section
4.1.2) that will feed into future iterations of the Intervention Feasibility Assessment.

In the ﬁrst Intervention Feasibility Assessment, the following information should be
assessed for each potential intervention:

1.   Estimated annual ER potential – The potential volume of ERs per year should
     be estimated based on ex-ante calculations, that is, before the intervention is
     implemented (ex-post calculations will verify whether the ERs have in fact been
     achieved). In the Planning stage, this can be a general estimate and categorized
     into low, medium, or high volumes (for example, less than 15,000 tCO2e/year,
     15,000–50,000 tCO2e/year and 50,000 tCO2e/year, respectively), based on
     comparable mitigation activities as points of reference. In the Execution stage,
     each intervention will undergo more rigorous calculations to estimate ERs, which
     involve using an appropriate methodology to determine baselines and emission
     reductions. Periodic updates of the Intervention Feasibility Assessment with
     more precise ER estimates will provide the municipality with better information to
     help determine whether it is implementing an appropriate mix of interventions.

     It is important to remember that at the time of conducting the Intervention
     Feasibility Assessment, these values are expected to be estimates meant to assist
     with planning an appropriate Portfolio of Interventions that is likely to achieve
     the Program’s targets. They are not intended to be a conﬁrmation of actual ERs
     achieved by the intervention (which is calculated ex-post).

2.   A risk rating that reﬂects the intervention’s ability to achieve ERs – Uncertainty
     related to whether an intervention will be successfully implemented and achieve
     all of its estimated ERs will always exist. The Intervention Risk Assessment (Section
     3.3.1.3) should be used to determine the intervention’s risk rating, and guide the
     municipality through identifying and evaluating the potential risks faced during
     the design and implementation of the intervention. In subsequent iterations of the
     Intervention Feasibility Assessment, percentage risk discount rates could be used
     to provide a better picture of the impact of risk on ER potential.

3.   An indication of whether ERs will be retired or sold – Each unit of ER generated
     by the intervention has only one ﬁnal destination: the sum of units retired and units
     sold must equal 100 percent of the ERs generated by the intervention. ERs that are
     sold may not be double counted towards the Program’s ER targets. Therefore, an
     early indication of the percentage of ERs that will be retired toward the targets is
     essential to estimate an intervention’s contribution to the Program targets.



                                                                                        77

                            4.   The estimated contribution to the Program targets – An intervention’s estimated
                                 contribution to the Program’s targets is calculated using the following three
                                 factors: the estimated ER potential; the risk rating; and the percentage of ERs
                                 that will be retired. The initial Intervention Feasibility Assessment may include a
                                 qualitative estimated contribution (that is, low, medium, or high) based on the less
                                 detailed/precise data that is available. In the subsequent iterations, however, the
                                 contribution can be calculated as the product of the ERs/year, the risk discount
                                 rate, and the percentage of ERs retired. It may also include targeted milestones for
                                 the short-, medium- and long-term implementation periods.

                            The Intervention Feasibility Assessment can also be customized based on the munici-
                            pality’s needs and interests. For example, a column with implementation cost could be
                            added to help more explicitly evaluate resource needs. If any socio-economic targets
                            have been set for the Program, an additional column could be added with an estimate
                            of the intervention’s contribution towards these targets. The Intervention Feasibility
                            Assessment can be adjusted and modiﬁed over time so that it is a useful scoping tool
                            for Program planning purposes.

                              3.3.1.3    INTERVENTION RISK ASSESSMENT

                              The Intervention Risk Assessment helps municipalities to identify and evaluate the risks
                              that may hinder the successful implementation of an intervention, thereby affecting its
                              ability to reach its ER potential. When completed for all interventions, the Intervention
                              Risk Assessment provides a snapshot of the overall level of risk for the entire Portfolio
                              of Interventions. It enables the municipality to create a risk matrix that can be used to
                              track interventions and actions needed to address and manage the identiﬁed risks. The
                              municipality can then balance the Portfolio of Interventions against its risk management
                              strategy and risk appetite.

                              The Risk Types that are assessed during the Intervention Risk Assessment will vary from
                              municipality to municipality, as each municipality should identify risk types that are
                              speciﬁc to the on-the-ground context for implementing its LCCDP (some guiding
                              examples are shown in Table 3-4). Each intervention is then evaluated according to

and inclusive growth
                              the municipality. Project interventions are less likely to face the same administrative
                              and political barriers; therefore, they may experience a more straightforward path to
                              implementation. Risk types, such as management or delay risk, will have different
                              impacts on policy and project interventions, as well as on the portfolio as a whole.

                              Upon completion of the Intervention Risk Assessment, the municipality will have a
                              matrix with risk types and risk levels for all interventions, as well as an overall risk rating
                              for each intervention that can then be inputted into the Intervention Feasibility Assessment.
                              It is good practice to develop a Portfolio of Interventions that distributes and diversiﬁes
                              the risk among all of the identiﬁed risk types. This ensures that some interventions can
                              still be implemented should certain risks come to fruition.

                              The Intervention Feasibility Assessment and Intervention Risk Assessment are examples
                              of low-cost, data-minimal methods to help assess and prioritize interventions. These
                              Assessments represent the minimum number of studies a city should conduct when
                              developing an LCCDP. Beyond these assessments, more detailed cost-beneﬁt analyses
                              and intervention prioritization exercises during the Planning stage can also help develop
                              an effective Portfolio of Interventions, and many planning tools designed for cities can
                              be useful. Two examples of planning tools are shown in Case Study 3-6 and Case Study
                              3-7. In addition, quantiﬁcation of socio-economic co-beneﬁts can help link the LCCDP’s
                              interventions to low-carbon and inclusive growth. Numerous resources exist that can
                              assist cities with quantifying co-beneﬁts for different sectors, such as the US Forest
                              Service tool for calculating the beneﬁts of urban trees, i-Tree (US Forest Service, 2013),
                              as well as the tools outlined in the World Health Organization Health co-beneﬁts of
                              climate change mitigation – Transport sector report (World Health Organization, 2011).

                              3.4 Program Implementation Plan

                              The LCCDP requires that a number of procedures and systems be in place in order to
                              operate efﬁciently in the long term, especially as the Program expands and grows in
                              complexity. A Program Implementation Plan helps facilitate the implementation of these
                              procedures and systems, sets timelines, and provides a framework for evaluating the
                              success of Program implementation.

of each municipality
                              The Program Implementation Plan should outline the municipality’s overall strategy to
                              implement the LCCDP, including the following:

                              1.   Designating authority and work ﬂow between Program Roles – The level of
                                   authority, communication channels, and reporting lines associated with each
                                   Program Role should be explicit in order to facilitate effective management of
                                   the Program. This structure should be documented within the Program
                                   Implementation Plan and revisited during the established evaluation periods to
                                   ensure that the information and work ﬂows are functioning as intended and
                                   meeting the Program needs of the municipality.




                                                                                                                    83
     PLANNING




                2.   Method and timeframe to achieve objectives and targets – The municipality
                     should determine its short-term (0–5 years), medium-term (5–10 years), and
                     long-term (10+ years) goals for achieving Program objectives and targets. These
                     goals can be reﬁned by modeling ER potential in different scenarios, ranging from
                     not implementing additional mitigation actions to implementing a very aggressive
                     Portfolio of Interventions. Alternatively, the municipality can work backwards from
                     the ultimate Program targets, setting short-, medium-, and long-term targets in a
                     phased manner (for this method, it is important to note that often achieving GHG
                     reductions at exponential levels in the short term is possible, with the reduction
                     potential tapering off in the long term). The stepwise goals for achieving targets
                     can be set through a sector-by-sector approach, an intervention-by-intervention
                     approach, or a combination of the two.

                3.   Benchmarks for the Program interventions – The Program interventions should
                     have short-, medium-, and long-term benchmarks, which will feed into the goals
                     for achieving the Program objectives and targets. During the evaluation process,
                     these benchmarks will allow the municipality to determine whether the intervention
                     is having its intended effect in terms of achieving ERs. Ahead of the Program
                     launch, benchmarks should be established for those interventions that will be
                     implemented immediately (not necessarily for the entire Portfolio of Interventions).

                4.   Timeline for stakeholder engagement, including a reasonable comment period
                     – The municipality should outline its timeline for stakeholder engagement. Each
                     intervention should undergo a stakeholder consultation process prior to its design
                     to provide additional assurance that the municipality has selected an appropriate
                     range of intervention types. The municipality will have the opportunity to improve
                     the intervention design through this feedback process. Stakeholder engagement
                     can also increase public awareness of the LCCDP itself.

                In addition to clarifying the strategic elements above, the Program Implementation Plan
                should include a short- and long-term timeline for deﬁning speciﬁc procedures related to:

                          Documentation

     Two main components will require active management
     once the Program is up and running: the registration
     of interventions and the management of information
     generated within the Program. The Execution section
     describes the principles and processes for intervention
     registration, as well as the MRV of interventions.
     Finally, this section provides an overview of the Program
     Registry’s characteristics.

     The “project cycle” of each intervention, including its
     development, approval, implementation, and evaluation,
     can be divided into two key sub-processes: the
     Intervention Registration Process and the Intervention
     MRV Process. These processes are interrelated and ﬂow
     as shown in Figure 4-1.

     During the Intervention Registration Process, every new
     intervention will undergo an in-depth assessment to
     determine whether it fulﬁlls the eligibility criteria, select
     an appropriate methodology to measure ERs, and
     establish whether the ERs will be retired or sold. The
     Intervention MRV Process outlines how information and
     data are managed and then veriﬁed to determine the
     intervention’s contribution to the Program targets and
     objectives. The Program Registry serves as the “bank
     account” of ERs generated under the Program.

     4.1 Intervention Design and Registration

     4.1.1 Principles of Intervention Design

     Several critical principles must be taken into consideration when designing a Program
     intervention, such as:

         Interventions must be aligned with Program objectives – Knowing where an
         intervention stands in relation to targets and objectives (such as whether ERs are
         retired or sold) will indicate the level of accuracy and detail needed in its design.

         The scope of the intervention must be clearly set – The scope includes elements,
         such as geographical boundaries and type of GHGs to be reduced.

         ER assumptions should be conservative – Maintaining conservativeness avoids
         overstating the intervention’s impact and ensures that ERs are not overestimated
         (Climate Action Reserve, 2011; UNFCCC, 2012).

         A baseline should be developed for each intervention – The baseline or a BAU
         emissions scenario will be the starting point from which ERs are calculated. In
         general, the baseline or BAU scenario represents the emissions that would have

                           4.1.2 The Intervention Registration Process
                           The Intervention Registration Process, shown in Figure 4-2, consists of four stages:
                           Conﬁrm Eligibility; Quantify ERs; Decision Making (Retire or Sell); and Validation/
                           Veriﬁcation (also repeated during the Intervention MRV Process). Advancing from one
                           stage to the next requires satisfactory fulﬁllment of the corresponding criteria, which
Figure 4-2:                must be captured in appropriate documentation, such as criteria checklists, and
The Intervention           approved by the CME. The speciﬁc criteria for each stage are deﬁned during the design

                           4.1.2.1    CONFIRM ELIGIBILITY

                           This step of the Intervention Registration Process revisits the initial intervention
                           planning and Intervention Feasibility Assessment that was completed during the
                           development of the Portfolio of Interventions. In this more rigorous process, eligibility
                           is established by the CME based on input by the MWG, which assesses intervention
                           eligibility based on the Eligibility Criteria. As described in Section 3.3.1.1, the Eligibility
                           Criteria are a set of requirements an intervention must meet in order to be registered
                           under the municipality’s LCCDP. If the intervention does not fulﬁll or is not transparent
                           about all the eligibility criteria, it should not be included under the Program. Through
                           this mechanism, the municipality can ensure the interventions fulﬁll certain requirements
                           of the LCCDP Assessment Protocol, particularly those related to prevention of double
                           counting and dual ownership of an intervention and its ERs. All interventions must
                           be assessed against the LCCDP’s Eligibility Criteria during this step of the Intervention
                           Registration Process.

                                The initial estimate of ERs to be generated is provided and available data
                                and/or reasonable estimates are used.

                                A monitoring plan is provided.

                                A recommendation is provided as to which asset class to pursue for the ERs.
                                If the recommendation includes carbon assets, such as certiﬁed emissions
                                reductions (CERs) or veriﬁed carbon units (VCUs), an assessment of the feasibility
                                and fulﬁllment of the criteria imposed by the relevant regulatory body is provided.

                           A methodology establishes the baseline scenario and the requirements for quantifying
                           the ERs of the intervention over time. The Methodology Assessment Criteria are used
                           to determine whether a particular methodology should be included under the LCCDP.
                           For example, the following set of criteria is based on international best practices:

                                Integrity and avoidance of politically and ethically contentious issues

such as CERs or VCUs, will            avoid double counting by making attribution of ERs clear and transparent, as well as

                                      are real, veriﬁable, and conservative in nature. Standardized calculations and consistency
                                      also provide the technical backbone that makes carbon pricing frameworks possible.

                                      According to these criteria, methodologies developed for and approved by the Boards
                                      of carbon ﬁnance programs, such as the CDM, Gold Standard, and VCS, can be
                                      accepted under the LCCDP. When assessing these methodologies, it is necessary to
                                      be conﬁdent that the assumptions, values, and procedures used to determine the ERs
                                      in the methodology are in sync with the Program guidelines on conservativeness.
                                      Interventions that seek to generate carbon assets, such as CERs or VCUs, will be required
                                      to fulﬁll all of the criteria imposed by the relevant regulatory body; for example, the

                                      is often included along with the baseline methodology. The monitoring requirements
                                      and metrics of these methodologies should be aligned with the Program’s monitoring
                                      requirements. This ensures that performance evaluation of individual interventions can
                                      be aggregated to assess overall Program performance.

                                      Establishing a baseline for a policy can be more complex than for project interventions,
                                      and the GHG Protocol Policy and Action Accounting and Reporting Standard (WRI,
                                      2013b) is a good source of recommendations and guidelines in this regard. Alternatively,
                                      the baseline may be estimated from similar mitigation policies or projects that have
                                      been implemented in other cities or countries with similar conditions.

                                      If an applicable methodology for a particular intervention does not exist, the TAE can
                                      identify or develop an alternate one based on global best practices. The new method-
                                      ology must be assessed according to the principles of the Methodology Assessment
                                      Criteria described above, and must receive recommendations from both the MWG
                                      and a VVE. In the case of new methodologies, some guiding principles for setting
                                      baselines can be found in resources such as the WRI and World Business Council for
                                      Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol for Project Accounting (WRI and
                                      WBCSD, 2005) and the technical notes produced by the GHG Baselines Working
                                      Group of the Partnership for Market Readiness (for example: PMR, 2013).

                          4.1.2.3   DECISION MAKING: RETIRE OR SELL ERS

A decision must be        Following an initial assessment of the expected amount and asset class of the
made to either retire     intervention, a decision must be made to either retire the ERs towards the municipality’s
the ERs towards the       self-set ER target or sell the ERs to an outside buyer. The decision to retire or sell
municipality’s self-set   follows the Retire or Sell Decision Criteria, which include:
ER target or sell the
ERs to an outside buyer        Specifying the amount of ERs generated by the intervention that will be retired
                               and counted towards the municipality’s self-set target;

                               Specifying the amount of ERs generated by the intervention that will be sold;

                               Ensuring the sum of ERs retired and ERs sold equals 100 percent; and

                               Conﬁrming that each ER unit generated by the intervention has only ONE ﬁnal
                               destination—it will either be retired or sold.

                          It is good practice to also include information about why a particular retire/sell decision
                          was taken, to contribute to the transparency of the LCCDP. This information, as well
                          as the asset type if the ER will be sold, could be of interest for different types of project
                          investors and funders as well.

                          4.1.2.4   VALIDATE/VERIFY

                          Before registration, the intervention should undergo validation to ensure quality and
                          integrity. Validation/veriﬁcation may be conducted at a frequency determined by the
                          CME or the relevant carbon asset regulatory body, if applicable, depending on the
                          methodology used and the chosen asset class. In some cases, validation and
                          veriﬁcation will be a one-time assessment, while in other cases, a validation process will
                          evaluate the design of a speciﬁc procedure and a later veriﬁcation process will assess
                          whether the results are accurately measured according to that design (veriﬁcation is
                          described further in Section 4.2). Veriﬁcations and/or validations related to ER accounting
                          will always be done by an independent third party, which will check the following
                          Validation/Veriﬁcation Criteria:

                               The intervention must comply with the Eligibility Criteria.

                               The intervention must comply with the ER Assessment Criteria.

                               The intervention must comply with the Retire or Sell Decision Criteria.

                               The intervention must be on track to produce/be producing ERs as planned.

                               The intervention must fulﬁll all criteria imposed by the relevant carbon
                               asset regulatory body (if applicable).

                           Information and documentation management are keys to demonstrating success of
                           both the Program as a whole and each intervention individually. It is therefore very
                           important that the information generated under the Program be accurate, adequately
                           stored, and accessible. Information and documentation systems can be supported
                           by software tools and can ensure that all metrics are consistent and comparable across
                           interventions as necessary.

                           MRV has taken an increasingly prominent role in mitigation programs, including national-
                           level LEDS. MRV frameworks provide assurance to stakeholders that the Program meets
                           clear standards and that its implementation is carefully monitored, progress is reported,
                           and results are veriﬁed. An effective MRV framework for an LCCDP should be developed
                           in accordance with the municipality’s resources and capabilities, while maintaining the
                           high standards necessary for ensuring real mitigation is achieved. Numerous resources
                           are available with guidance about how to establish effective MRV systems, such as the
                           report Measuring, Reporting, Verifying: A Primer on MRV for Nationally Appropriate
                           Mitigation Actions (Hinostroza, 2011), the GHG Protocol Mitigation Goals Accounting
                           and Reporting Standard (WRI, 2013a), and the GHG Protocol Policy and Action

                           The LCCDP’s MRV system should provide a platform for documenting and reporting
                           information needed to monitor and report, on a regular basis, the key characteristics

                          this sense, the MRV system is used to track the implementation of interventions,
                          monitor ERs produced by the interventions, enable veriﬁcation of ERs and issuance
                          of carbon assets to the registry, as well as measure progress towards Program targets.
                          Other metrics related to co-beneﬁts or the Program’s implementation, such as
                          ﬁnancing commitments and disbursements, may also require monitoring.

                          4.2.1.1   PRINCIPLES OF MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT

                          The Program’s MRV process serves to evaluate each intervention’s performance, as well
                          as the Program’s performance as a whole. Each intervention is monitored to quantify
                          ERs generated, as well as any other co-beneﬁts that are tracked as part of the Program
                          targets. The intervention’s methodology, established in the “quantify ERs” stage of
                          the Intervention Registration Process, provides the formula for ex-ante ER estimates,
                          which is validated by a third party prior to implementing the intervention. ERs are then
                          veriﬁed; depending on the asset class pursued, validation and veriﬁcation may be
                          merged into one independent evaluation. By comparing ex-ante estimates with actual
                          ERs produced, the municipality can determine whether the intervention is on track to
                          meet the expected ERs over its lifetime.

                          While it can be relatively easy to quantify ERs for project interventions, quantiﬁcation
                          can be more challenging for policy interventions, as the causal links between policies
                          and resulting emissions are not always clear. As mentioned above, the GHG Protocol
                          Policy and Action Accounting and Reporting Standard (WRI, 2013b) provides
                          recommendations and guidelines for quantifying ERs from policies. Different sets of
                          indicators can also be considered in order to monitor the impacts of policies, as well
                          as co-beneﬁts of interventions.

                          The MRV structure should be ﬂexible to accommodate a broad set of indicators and
                          metrics that are relevant and applicable to all interventions under the Program. Generally,
                          there are two primary categories of metrics that could be considered in monitoring:

                             relationship between an intervention and the reduction of emissions, for example, the
                             amount of diesel fuel replaced by natural gas in a public transport intervention, from
                             which it is possible to calculate actual ERs. The range of metrics applied to a Program
                             can, and in many instances should, include quantitative and qualitative, as well as input
                             and output metric types. An example of performance metrics used in implementing
                             a climate action plan in Solano County, California, is described in Case Study 4-1 on
                             the left.

                             The metrics and indicators for monitoring each intervention should mimic the metrics
                             for evaluating performance at the Program level. This will allow for easy data aggregation
                             for all interventions, which is particularly important since different methodologies
                             often require the MRV process to be implemented in a speciﬁc manner. Hence, the IME
                             must ensure that the MRV processes of individual interventions are structured in such
                             a way that data aggregation at the Program level is possible. Data collection systems
                             that are applicable across intervention types and sectors facilitate comparison and
                             results aggregation, and should therefore be developed as part of the Program’s design
                             and implementation.

                             4.2.1.2   PRINCIPLES OF REPORTING

                             The progress on the monitored metrics and indicators should be reported to the
                             CME at regular intervals. In that sense, reporting systems can be anchored in the CME,
                             and potentially be part of open access databases and other transparency initiatives.
                             At the Program level, reporting should focus on delivering an analysis of the results and
                             aggregated progress towards the objectives and targets, as well as other indicators. For
                             example, the reporting process could include the status of elements such as the level
                             of objective achievement, capacity-building efforts related to Program planning and
                             implementation, technical assistance and ﬁnance ﬂowing to the municipality from
                             the national level, public funding and private ﬁnancing, summaries of intervention
Reporting requires
                             proposals, and requests for funding. At the intervention level, information related to
systems and resources for
                             the implementation of interventions can be reported; for example, links between
data analysis and transfer
                             funding and disbursement for interventions and ERs achieved. Reporting and tracking
                             progress can help the CME avoid duplication of activities in different municipal agencies,
                             as well as obtain the information that needs to be transferred to the Program Registry.

                             Reporting requires systems and resources for data analysis and transfer, which may
                             be a stretch for some municipalities with insufﬁcient resources. Capacity shortfalls can
                             be addressed by either linking reporting to internal systems, such as ﬁnancial reporting,
                             or by seeking external assistance within existing administrative structures. For example,
                             the city of Palo Alto in California has its GHG monitoring and reporting electronically
                             tapped into data stored in the city’s enterprise management and billing system (Case

4.2.1.3   PRINCIPLES OF VERIFICATION

Once monitoring and reporting activities have been completed, it must be determined
whether the ERs generated have met the compliance criteria set out in the methodology
(or standard, etc.) by conducting veriﬁcation of the ERs. As described above in the
Intervention Registration Process (Section 4.1.2), validation evaluates the design of an
intervention and its monitoring plan, while veriﬁcation evaluates the results that are
measured (for some carbon ﬁnance programs, validation and veriﬁcation are combined
into a single assessment). The MRV process should include provisions for veriﬁcation of
ERs by a third party. In addition, monitoring and reporting activities should themselves
be veriﬁed, by either an external third party or an entity from within the city government
that is independent from the CME and IME. Veriﬁcation conﬁrms that monitoring and
reporting practices are in line with the requirements and needs of the Program, as well
as the methodologies used for interventions under the Program. Financial ﬂows relevant
to the Program could also undergo veriﬁcation to promote transparency and prevent
corruption. For the LCCDP’s MRV system, the verifying body (that is, the VVE) should
remain independent from the body that is coordinating and managing the Program
(that is, the CME). Many GHG mitigation programs clearly separate the role of veriﬁcation
of the intervention ERs from the actual issuance of the ER assets to the Registry, which
provides an opportunity for an additional control check.

4.2.1.4   GOVERNANCE OF MRV SYSTEMS

Every municipality develops policies and legislation in its own way, which will be reﬂected
in the planning and design of its LCCDP, as well as in the implementation of its MRV
systems. The legal framework regulating the operation and control of the Program, as
well as its ability to interact with other mitigation programs (for example, interventions
applying CDM or VCS), will vary from city to city. However, the municipality can begin to
create a governance framework for a successful MRV system by considering some key
elements, such as:

    Which municipal entities have authority and control over the MRV system and what
    does that entail?

    Which municipal entities are responsible for implementing which parts of the
    MRV system?

    Under which system should third parties be accredited (will a municipal entity
    award accreditation?) and what needs to be demonstrated in order to
    achieve accreditation?

    Which municipal entity will endorse compliance with the requirements?

    When and with what frequency must reporting be submitted and/or veriﬁed?

    What are the consequences of non-compliance with MRV requirements and
    which municipal entity enforces compliance?




                                                                                       101
                            Municipalities will have differing abilities and capacities for establishing the entities and
                            systems needed to perform the MRV tasks. Three levels of institutional maturity should
                            be considered regarding the implementation of MRV systems for an LCCDP:

                                 Full capacity: MRV systems in place (or to be put in place) that are sufﬁcient for
                                 reporting and immediately support both the Program and its interventions.

                                 Good capacity: capacity exists, but still requires capacity building to support
                                 monitoring and reporting of Program activities and intervention implementation.

                                 Limited capacity: signiﬁcant capacity building is needed both for the Program
                                 and intervention MRV processes.

Developing MRV capacity     Developing MRV capacity may require institutional development, education, training,
may require institutional   and capacity building for the designated municipal departments that will be undertaking
development, education,     evaluation/MRV. Additionally, in order to have an effective MRV system that is taken
training, and capacity      seriously by all stakeholders, the municipality should consider instituting penalties,
building                    which would be imposed when a department does not follow the Program rules and
                            has failed its MRV. These penalties can include payment of a ﬁne for non-compliance, or
                            not recognizing the ERs generated. A penalty system will normally allow the penalized
                            entity to seek recourse on decisions that it believes are incorrect.



                            4.2.2 The Intervention MRV Process
                            The Intervention MRV Process captures the MRV principles described above in a
                            process and assigns tasks to the various Program Roles. There are ﬁve steps in the
                            process, shown in Figure 4-3: Top-down Regulatory Mandate to Deliver Data; Data
                            Delivery; Data Analysis; Results and Compliance Reporting; and Veriﬁcation of ERs.

                            4.2.2.1   TOP-DOWN REGULATORY MANDATE TO DELIVER DATA

                            The CME provides a top-down regulatory mandate to the municipal departments to
                            deliver requested data to the IME. The CME also monitors and enforces compliance.

                            4.2.2.2   DATA DELIVERY

                            The IME works with the municipal departments to ensure the necessary data is delivered
                            to quantify ERs and fulﬁll monitoring plans for the interventions. When fed into the
                            Program MRV, this raw data should provide an early picture of how the overall Portfolio
                            of Interventions is performing. This will give the municipality a sense of the progress
                            made towards objectives and targets, as well as offer an opportunity to recalibrate the
                            portfolio in order to meet the desired goals by adding new interventions.

                        4.2.2.3   DATA ANALYSIS

                        The IME conducts analyses according to the chosen methodology to quantify the ERs
                        generated by the interventions, which will enable the municipality to determine whether
                        the intervention is being implemented successfully. If the intervention is not meeting
                        expectations, the municipality will have to review implementation barriers to see whether
                        any adjustments are needed in order to promote behavior change or further support
                        the introduction of new technology, etc.

                        4.2.2.4   RESULTS AND COMPLIANCE REPORTING

                        Once data has been delivered and analyzed, the IME reports back to the CME on
                        results and compliance. This report should document both expected and unexpected
                        impacts on the environment, society, and economy of the municipality, as well as
                        include any transboundary ER impacts. This occurs at predeﬁned, regular intervals.

                        4.2.2.5   VERIFICATION OF ERS

                        Prior to credit issuance, the ERs must undergo veriﬁcation to ensure quality and integrity.

                           4.3 Program Registry

                           A Program Registry provides a platform to create, verify, track, and trade/retire ER units,
                           and serves as the bank account of ERs produced by the Program. The Registry helps
                           prevent double counting and dual ownership, and ensures that each ER has only one
                           ﬁnal destination: retired, and counted toward the Program’s ER targets; or sold, and
                           therefore not counted towards the Program targets.

                           The Program Registry should have a consistent method of identifying each ER unit, such
                           as a serial number or other tagging system, which also identiﬁes the ER’s asset class. ER
                           transactions will be tracked in the Program Registry as well, and the Registry should also
                           be integrated with regional- or federal-level registries. Again, coordination with higher
                           levels of government is important in this regard: if there is a national crediting program
                           or international pledges exist, approval may be required prior to any issuing of credits
                           for international use.

                           The information tracked in the Registry must be credible and trustworthy, and the
                           municipality should consider how to support transparency. The level of scrutiny, or
                           precision, of data supporting the veriﬁcation of ERs required in the registration process
                           will depend on the ER’s asset class. For project interventions, this is likely to be more
                           clearly deﬁned through the methodology used to quantify the ERs. However, policy
                           interventions may not have as clear requirements for data precision and detail. The
                           municipality should consider a detail/precision threshold, or benchmark, for including
                           ER units in the Registry to maintain consistency and credibility.

Once Program implementation is under way, the Registry may also serve as the
repository of the results of the periodic, city-wide GHG inventory. The Registry could
be housed in the inventory in a separate database, and could become an even more
powerful tool in informing periodic Program improvements.

The municipality can structure the Registry to be public, partly public, or private. For
the purposes of the LCCDP, municipalities should consider a public or partly public
Registry so that interested stakeholders can access the information.

In addition to determining the Registry’s characteristics, the municipality should clarify
which entity will be responsible for maintaining and governing the Registry (that is,
where it will be housed). Placing the Registry with an independent institution that has
experience with documentation and record keeping will be beneﬁcial—either within the
municipality, with another level of government (particularly if ERs are traded as part
of a national program), or with an external entity. References such as The GHG Protocol:
Measuring to Manage report (WRI, 2007) provide good guidance on registry design
for corporate GHG management programs, which can also be applicable to the city
context. Also, as highlighted in the Planning section, the municipality should determine
the timeline for implementing the documentation procedures and for making the
Registry operational.

      This section describes the feedback mechanisms that
      ensure continual Program improvement over time in order
      to best meet objectives and targets. This stage allows
      the municipality to assess and learn from the information
      generated during the previous sections, and is an
      important part of the systems approach that helps ensure
      that LCCDP planning and implementation produce
      successful results.

      In this Guidebook, an assessment is conducted to
      determine the feasibility of implementing the LCCDP
      and the initial Portfolio of Interventions, prior to execution.
      On the other hand, evaluation is an ongoing process
      that happens during or after implementation and consists
      of a review of the Program and its stages to determine
      whether these elements are meeting, or are on track to
      meet, the Program’s established objectives and targets.
      The relationship between assessment and evaluation is
      shown in Figure 5-1.

      Opportunities for feedback provide insight into whether
      LCCDP implementation will be or has been successful,
      and can therefore proceed as planned, or whether
      any changes are required to ensure that the Program will
      eventually reach its objectives and targets within the
      established timeframe.

                             components to be successfully launched and implemented. This Guidebook outlines
                             the necessary steps and considerations needed to design and implement an LCCDP
                             that fulﬁlls all requirements of the Assessment Protocol. Once the municipality has
                             developed the LCCDP, an independent and objective assessment of the Program
                             design against Protocol requirements provides an opportunity to improve the Program,
                             as well as to show transparency and obtain stakeholder buy-in.

                             In 2012, the City of Rio de Janeiro and the World Bank requested an independent
                             third-party review of the design of the Rio de Janeiro Low Carbon City Development
                             Program to assess whether, as documented, it was technically sound and likely to
                             contribute to the achievement of its objectives and targets. Leveraging its expertise
                             in LEDS, working in carbon markets, and designing climate action plans for cities
                             and counties, DNV KEMA developed a protocol with 44 requirements customized
                             for LCCDPs.

                             The LCCDP Assessment Protocol is aligned with ISO 14064-2, ISO 14001, and the
                             WRI and WBCSD GHG Protocol. Through a review of the Program documents and
                             other information relevant to Program design, the assessment determines whether the
                             Program meets the requirements related to the following aspects: scope and boundary;

                             objectives and targets; eligibility criteria; roles, responsibilities and authorities; control
                             of records; monitoring and reporting of performance; and compliance with relevant
                             regulations. Flexibility is core to the Protocol design in order to meet the needs of cities
                             globally, regardless of their scale, in developing city-wide, low-emission strategies.
                             The LCCDP Assessment Protocol was created to be an international standard applicable
                             to any LCCDP. As described throughout the Guidebook, the Protocol’s requirements
                             help ensure that the Program developers are aware of the key elements that contribute
                             to meeting Program objectives and targets. By including elements such as stakeholder
                             engagement, compliance with regulations, and assessment and evaluation processes,
                             the municipality can overcome some of the barriers to implementation and potentially
                             gain access to new ﬁnancing sources.

                             The Protocol is the standard against which a third party will validate a municipality’s
                             LCCDP. Third-party validation occurs after LCCDP design, but prior to implementation,
                             thus setting the Program up for success. The validation process is a transparent
                             assessment process in which the audit team documents how each requirement has
                             been fulﬁlled, or, alternatively, if improvement is needed. Validation ensures that the
                             Program design adequately addresses the 44 requirements of the Protocol.

                             Commissioning a third-party assessment of the Program supports increased transparency
                             and creates additional value by gaining the perspective of external experts on the
                             design, implementation, and potential barriers to success. This external perspective
                             can help identify new opportunities not previously explored by the Program design
                             team, as well as add credibility to the Program design, objectives and targets, and
                             garner greater support from the municipality’s stakeholders.

                             The typical third-party assessment of an LCCDP will include:

                             1.   Desk Review of the Program Documentation
                                  a)   Design documents provided by the municipality (that is, the Program
                                       Document and any supplementary information) – The Program Document
                                       provides an overview of the Program design, including elements such as
                                       the mission, scope, objectives, targets, implementation plan, and roles and
                                       responsibilities. Supplementary information may be provided to offer further
                                       insight into those aspects not covered in the Program Document.

Gaining the perspective           b)   Standards, methodologies and tools for assessment (that is, the LCCDP
of external experts on the             Assessment Protocol) – An LCCDP should be assessed against the LCCDP
design, implementation,                Assessment Protocol, which is the standard to be used for this type of
and potential barriers to              program. The Protocol is based on relevant norms, such as: ISO 14064-2:2006

                                       developers should use the Protocol to inform the technical design of the




                                                                                                                       111
                LCCDP (as described in this Guidebook). As new norms appear and new
                challenges arise, the Protocol may be updated or expanded. For example,
                GHG inventories can be assessed according to the GPC, and policies can
                be evaluated using the GHG Protocol Policy and Action Accounting and
                Reporting Standard (WRI, 2013b).

           c)   Documentation used to validate/cross-check the information provided
                by the municipality – This can include the municipality’s strategic plan,
                regulations affecting the Program, modeling of ER scenarios, and the
                city-wide GHG inventory.

      2.   Follow-Up Interviews with Program Stakeholders – Follow-up interviews should
           be conducted during a site visit to the municipality. The number of days for
           stakeholder interviews will depend on the size of the municipality, as well as on the
           complexity of the LCCDP. Stakeholders can conﬁrm or clarify the information in
           the Program Document and provide further information as needed. The interviews
           should reﬂect a broad representation of stakeholders (NGOs, government ofﬁcials,
           community members, etc.).

      3.   Resolution of Outstanding Issues – Once the assessment has been conducted,
           the municipality should resolve any outstanding issues that require either clariﬁcation
           or action. This provides an opportunity for improvement prior to the third party
           reaching its ﬁnal conclusion. The third party should indicate non-conformity if the
           Program does not fulﬁll a requirement of the LCCDP Assessment Protocol, or if
           there is a risk that the provisions proposed in the Program Document cannot be
           implemented as designed.

      4.   Final Conclusion – A positive conclusion conﬁrms that the LCCDP has fulﬁlled all
           44 requirements satisfactorily. A negative opinion indicates that at least one issue
           could not be resolved, with potentially negative implications for the Program’s
           ability to meet its objectives and targets.

ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION




                   5.2 Intervention and Program Evaluation
                       and Adjustment

                   The evaluation process of an LCCDP is carried out in two steps: (1) an ongoing evaluation
                   of the Portfolio of Interventions, which includes a review of the results of the Intervention
                   Feasibility Assessment; and (2) a periodic evaluation and adjustment of the Program,
                   based on the Program’s performance.

                   The evaluation of the Portfolio of Interventions compares updated data generated during
                   the MRV process with the original estimates made during the Intervention Feasibility
                   Assessment, which will demonstrate whether the Portfolio has performed as expected
                   and, if not, will identify areas where adjustments are needed. During the ﬁrst years of
                   implementation, the Portfolio of Interventions may need to be reviewed more often (for
                   instance, every six months) in order to reﬂect any changes to the Program Implementation
                   Plan. However, as Program implementation continues, the municipality can change this
                   frequency in order to meet its planning needs.

                   The second step is an evaluation and adjustment of the overall Program. The aggregated
                   performance of the Portfolio of Interventions can provide an overall understanding
                   of the Program’s performance against its targets and objectives. Program evaluation
                   should dive deeper and explore the suitability of the Program design for meeting
                   the municipality’s needs. This will allow for the Program to be revised and adjusted as
                   needed. Program evaluation and adjustment should be done considering results
                   against scope, objectives, targets, relevance to evolving market conditions and incentive

                               consultations again at this stage can be a useful way to gather valuable suggestions for
                               Program improvement.

      Annex
      LCCDP Assessment Protocol
      The LCCDP Assessment Protocol is aligned with ISO 14064-2, ISO 14001, and the WRI
      and WBCSD GHG Protocol. Flexibility is core to the Protocol design and its application,
      in order to meet the needs of cities globally in developing city-wide, low-emission
      strategies, regardless of their scale. The 44 requirements of the LCCDP Assessment
      Protocol are as follows:

      PARTICIPATING MUNICIPALITIES AND SCOPE OF THE LOW CARBON CITY
      DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

      1.   The Low Carbon City Development Program (LCCDP) shall assist the Municipality
           in achieving sustainable development through the implementation of an LCCDP
           that includes speciﬁc reduction targets based on a municipal-wide emissions
           inventory that upon implementation allows for periodic evaluation.

           The Municipality has deﬁned the scope of the LCCDP within the possible
           contributions to sustainable development and the development of a low carbon
           Municipality, including the start date and length of the Program.

      3.   The boundary for the LCCDP, in terms of a geographical area within which the
           Program will be implemented, is deﬁned.

      4.   The LCCDP shall have been developed and implemented with the approval of
           the Municipal authorities.

      5.   The LCCDP shall include provisions to ensure that future political changes will
           not affect the existence of the Program.

      6.   The LCCDP includes a process for involving local stakeholders in developing
           policies and projects under the Program, including a public comment period.

      7.   The LCCDP aims to develop measures for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
           emissions that add carbon reduction value, which is demonstrated as
           outlined below.

           When in the absence of the Program:
           a)  the proposed voluntary measure would not be implemented; or
           b)  the mandatory policy/regulation would not be enforced systematically and
               non-compliance with those requirements is widespread in the Municipality.

           —OR—




118
     When the Program:
     a)  leads to a greater level of enforcement of the existing mandatory policy/
         regulation; or
     b)  allows for emission reductions (ERs) exceeding the mandatory reductions
         required under existing policy or regulations.

8.   The Municipality has taken into account an initial GHG emissions level, which is
     deﬁned in either absolute or relative terms and serves as the baseline for
     implementation of the GHG ER objectives and targets to contribute to low carbon
     city development.

     The Municipality has developed, or over time intends to develop, a municipality-
     wide GHG inventory to evaluate the effectiveness of the actions implemented
     towards real low carbon city development. The GHG inventory shall provide
     sectoral data, including the most representative sectors present in the Municipality.
     The GHG inventory includes data allowing for the reasonable calculation of a
     business-as-usual (BAU) emissions growth.

9.   The Municipality has established a process for calculating the GHG emissions
     inventory and updating it periodically. This process includes: deﬁnition of
     responsibilities and authorities; data collection and consolidation; quality control;
     and periodic review. The GHG inventory shall be third-party veriﬁed.

PROGRAM POLICY, OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS

10. The Program identiﬁes the responsibility for deﬁning the Municipality policy,
    objectives and targets for low carbon city development.

11. The Program deﬁnes a Municipality commitment declaration towards low-carbon
    city development and, within the scope of the Program, that:
    a)    is appropriate to the Municipality and its main environmental,
          social and economic impacts;
    b)    includes a commitment to continued improvement;
    c)    considers strategies for decoupling GHG emissions from economic
          growth within the largest emitting economic sectors as deﬁned within
          the Municipal city inventory;
    d)    includes a commitment to comply with applicable legal and
          other requirements;
    e)    subscribes to its own ER commitments;
    f)    provides the framework for setting and reviewing low carbon city
          development objectives and targets;
    g)    ensures ERs are not double counted;
    h)    is documented, implemented and maintained;
    i)    is communicated to all stakeholders; and
    j)    is available to the public.




                                                                                        119
W




          12. The Municipality shall establish, implement and maintain documented low carbon
              city development objectives and targets.

          13. Objectives and targets shall be measurable, where practicable, and consistent with
              the low carbon city development declaration, including commitments to:
              a)    reduce GHG emissions;
              b)    comply with applicable legal requirements related to GHG emissions, and
                    with other requirements to which the Municipality subscribes; and
              c)    continual improvement.

          14. The Program’s objectives and targets shall cover different major emitting
              sectors as deﬁned by the Municipality’s GHG inventory. The ﬁnal decision process
              to establish the objectives and targets shall consider, among other things, a
              cost-beneﬁt analysis of the potential achievement through interventions in different
              sectors, technological options, ﬁnancial, sectorial development goals and business
              requirements, and views of interested parties.

              Upon developing policies or projects outside of the top emitting sectors, the
              Municipality should execute a cost-beneﬁt analysis of the potential achievement
              through interventions in lower-emitting sectors compared to higher-emitting
              sectors. This analysis shall include:
              a)   technological options;
              b)   ﬁnancial considerations;
              c)   potential contribution to sustainable economic development; and
              d)   stakeholder input.

          15. The achievement of the Program objectives and targets is planned through the
              implementation of a portfolio of policies and projects over a deﬁned time period.
              The portfolio shall represent a combination of cost-effective, implementable

      22. A Program Registry, which tracks offsets that are either cancelled or sold, is
          periodically updated, and serves as the record of all transactions of ERs from
          interventions included in the Program.

      POLICIES DEVELOPED UNDER THE PROGRAM

      23. The Program includes the implementation of Policy interventions that contribute
          to the objectives and targets agreed to in line with the LCCDP of the Municipality.

          Policy interventions, including the deﬁnition of responsibilities and authorities.

      25. The Program objectives and targets include conservative ER estimates from
          Program policies.

      26. A baseline shall be established for each of the policy interventions implemented,
          in a transparent manner and taking into account relevant, national/local and/or
          sectoral policies and circumstances.

      27. The ERs achieved through policy intervention implementation shall be additional
          to those in the baseline scenario, real and measurable, and provide long-term
          beneﬁts related to climate change mitigation.

      EMISSION REDUCTION OFFSET PROJECTS DEVELOPED UNDER
      THE PROGRAM

      28. The Program includes the implementation of project types that contribute to
          the objectives and targets developed in line with the Municipality’s LCCDP.

      29. A documented procedure to develop, approve, implement and periodically
          evaluate those projects participating in the Program was developed.

      30. Eligibility criteria for each project type allowed under the Program are deﬁned,
          which shall address the demonstration of additionality, and the type and/or extent
          of information (e.g., criteria, indicators, variables, parameters or measurements)
          that shall be provided by each project to ensure its eligibility.

      31. The Program establishes the ER methodologies, which can be applied to offset
          projects under the Program.

      32. In the case of ER methodologies approved by other programs, the LCCDP docu-
          mentation established an evaluation procedure of other programs/methodologies
          to ensure that those accepted under the LCCDP are cohesive with respect to:




122
     a)   additionality;
     b)   conservativeness of the ER estimation/calculation; and
     c)   monitoring requirements.

33. The Program deﬁnes the level of accuracy/precision accepted for the ERs
    calculated with the approved methodologies.

34. In the case of methodologies not approved by an accepted program, the LCCDP
    documentation establishes a process for approving a methodology, which includes
    the minimum criteria that all methodologies shall comply with so that ERs claimed
    using those methodologies are additional, real, veriﬁable and conservatively
    calculated with a reasonable level of assurance.

35. The Program objectives and targets include ER estimates from projects under the
    Program that are conservatively calculated.

36. The ERs achieved through offset projects shall be additional, real and measurable,
    and have long-term beneﬁts related to the mitigation of climate change.

37. The Program includes provisions to ensure that ER projects under the Program are
    in compliance with ISO 14064-2.

38. Additionality of a speciﬁc project is demonstrated using the procedure provided in
    the baseline and monitoring methodology applied.

39. A baseline shall be established on a project basis, in a transparent manner and
    taking into account relevant national/local and/or sectoral policies and circumstances.

40. The Program shall ensure that the evaluation of environmental impacts of the
    projects, including transboundary impacts, is undertaken, when applicable, and
    is in accordance with the applicable regulations.

MONITORING AND REPORTING ON PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

41. The Municipality shall establish, implement and maintain a procedure or
    procedures to monitor, on a regular basis, the key characteristics of its activities
    that can have a signiﬁcant impact on low carbon city development, including:
    a)    city-wide GHG inventories; and
    b)    policies and projects implemented under the Program

     The procedure(s) shall include the documenting of information to monitor
     performance and conformity with the Program objectives and targets.




                                                                                           123
      42. Consistent with its commitment to compliance, the Municipality shall establish,
          implement and maintain a procedure or procedures for periodically evaluating
          compliance, when applicable, with legal requirements for GHG ERs. The
          Municipality shall evaluate compliance with other voluntary requirements to
          which it subscribes.

      43. The Municipality shall review Program performance at planned intervals, to
          ensure continued suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. Reviews shall include
          assessing opportunities for improvement and the need for changes to the
          LCCDP, including policy, objectives and targets.

      VERIFICATION OF POLICIES AND PROJECTS UNDER THE PROGRAM

      44. The Program includes provisions for the assessment and veriﬁcation of ERs from
