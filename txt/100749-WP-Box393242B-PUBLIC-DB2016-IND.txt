THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in this year’s economy

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

                    India eased business start-up by establishing an online VAT
DB2011              registration system and replacing the physical stamp
                    previously required with an online version.
                    India made starting a business easier by considerably reducing
                    the registration fees, but also made it more difficult by
DB2015              introducing a requirement to file a declaration before the
                    commencement of business operations. These changes apply
                    to both Delhi and Mumbai.
                    India made starting a business easier by eliminating the

      Obtain Intimation of Disapproval and pay fees

      After the site inspection, the application file returns to the
      Building Proposal Office to receive an intimation of disapproval
      (authorization). The concerned Sub Engineer reviews the
      proposal and forwards the report to the Assistant Engineer and
      Executive Engineer. The proposal is approved at the Executive
      Engineer’s level if no concessions are involved. There are 3
      executive engineers in the main Municipal Corporation of
      Greater Mumbai (MCGM) office and 2 in the Andhuri office (the
18    latter is the office considered for the purposes of this study).     29 days      INR 42,000

      Complete applications that do not require concessions (i.e.
      claiming of areas free of FSI as per provision in DCR 1991,
      deficiency in open spaces etc.) can be approved within a week.
      However, the majority of applications require some concessions
      and further scrutiny so they must be forwarded to the competent
      authorities. This latter process may take 30 -- 90 days to
      complete.

      The intimation of disapproval is issued with a list of NOC’s which

      the applicant must obtain separately from various departments
      and government authorities. Final clearance to build will only be
      given once BuildCo obtains all NOC’s. The NOC’s assigned to
      the intimation of disapproval are case specific. For the purpose
      of this study, Doing Business has determined 7 basic NOC’s that
      are required of almost all projects:
      • Tree Authority
      • Storm Water and Drain Department
      • Sewerage Department
      • Hydraulic Department
      • Environmental Department (concerned with debris
      management)
      • Traffic and Coordination Department
      • CFO (fire clearance)

      BuildCo’s architect must take the Intimation of Disapproval and
      the design plans to each clearance office separately. NOCs can
      be applied for simultaneously, but NOC offices are spread out so
      the submission for these 7 NOC’s is likely to take some time.

      The cost for this procedure is INR 66 per square meter for
      commercial buildings + development charges of INR 700 per
      square meter for commercial buildings.

      Obtain plinth commencement certificate from sub-engineer
      and pay development charges

      Upon submission of all required NOCs mentioned in the IOD and
      on compliance of the IOD conditions, the applicant may submit a
      request for the commencement certificate. The documents and
      NOC submitted by the applicants are verified by the staff and the
      necessary commencement certificate is approved. After payment
      of development charges and other applicable premium the
      commencement certificate is issued within 7 to 15 days.

      The commencement certificate is valid for four years in the
      aggregate, but must be renewed before the expiry of one year        10 days      INR 969,249
19
      from the date it was issued if the work has not yet commenced.
      Such renewal shall be for three consecutive terms of one year
      each, after which the proposal would need to re-obtain
      development permission.

      The cost for the commencement certificate is INR 200.00 per sq.
      m. of land + INR 500.00 per sq. m. of building area.

      The building permit is done in 2 steps. First, BuildCo must obtain
      the permit up to the plinth level. Once the plinth level has been
      completed, there is an inspection to verify that is in compliance
      with approved plans. It is only after this inspection has been
      done and approval obtained that the BuildCo can move on with
21    the construction and start the superstructure of the warehouse.       7 days       no charge
      But in order to do so, it is necessary to obtain a permit to start
      building the superstructure.

      Upon receiving the application of industrial, institutional, and multi-
      storey buildings, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi will forwards 2
      copies of the building plans and 2 copies of the layout plans to the Fire
      Service Department of Government NCT of Delhi. The Fire Service
      Department reviews the drawings and checks the fire and safety
      arrangement on the plans against the National Building Code of India
      2005. It takes 3 weeks to issue a Provisional No Objection Certificate
      (no site inspection at the time of sanctioning the building plans). The
      drawings can only be approved by Municipal Corporation of Delhi and
      Building Permit issued after receiving the Provisional No Objection
      Certificate.

      As of December 2013, the cost for building permits are INR 5 per
      square meter for buildings less than 50 square meters, and INR 10 per
      square meter for buildings greater than 50 square meters. BuildCo must
      also pay cess charges of 1% of the cost of construction. Cess charges
      are paid to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, who will transfer the
      charges to the Labor Welfare Department of Government of NCT Delhi.

      The Municipal Corporation of Delhi santions building plans without site
      inspection but randomly selects about 20% of the buildings and
      inspects them after the issuance of Building Permits.

      A single window concept has been introduced for approval of building-
      plan applications. Online approval is available for residential plots and
      sanction is generally given within 1 week if all documents are complete.
      The Engineering Department of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi has
      also issued a detailed guide, "Build Your House With a Valid Building
      Permit" which is available online (MCD website at no charge) or in print

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business
taxpayer service centers or allowing for more deductions          recorded in India (table 8.1)?

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                             To enforce its security interest, Bizbank would file a petition to the

                                            The reason why BizBank initiates the insolvency process is that the
                Mumbai,                     hotel is unable to pay its debts and the hotel expects operating losses

                 Delhi                      in 2015 as well as 2016. Hence, in order to pay the debts, the hotel
                                            assets will be sold piecemeal and the hotel will stop operating.

                                             Bizbank will apply to the Debt Recovery Tribunal to enforce its security.
                                             This will take a couple of months. But other creditors (including tax
                                             authorities) and Mirage itself will file objections in front of the High

                                             The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 9%

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
