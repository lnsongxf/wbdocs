THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        Request and obtain cadastre certificate

        To request the cadastre certificate, a form must be picked up at the
        Municipality (where stamps must be purchased) for a fee of BOB 70.00).
        The form must be completed by an architect recognized by the
        Municipality (the architect is assumed to be a BuildCo employee).
        Typically, such an architect would charge about BOB 200.00 to BOB
        500.00. Finally, a topographic plot plan must be acquired and attached
        to the form. Such a plan costs about BOB 1,620.00.                          60 days         BOB 1,690

        Thus, the fees to be paid at the Municipality amount to BOB 1,620.00 +
        BOB 70.00 = BOB 1,690.00.

        The royal folio indicates the land’s location, surface and limits, and
        ownership history. To obtain this folio, BuildCo must present an
   2    application letter, attaching two copies of the testimony of property       42 days           BOB 53

      Submit and obtain approval of plans by the Architects Association

      The actual cost is based on a table of fees determined by the Architects
      Association. Given the characteristics of the warehouse, the following
      cost formula applies: A * B * C = R, where
      A = Area of the terrain (expressed in square meters).
4     B = USD 2.76 (may vary, depending on the actual area of the terrain).       30 days      BOB 1,522
      C = 0.055 (a percentage given by the Architects Association).
      R = The real cost (assumed to be USD 197.43 or its equivalent in BOB).

      Request construction permit

      To request a construction permit, BuildCo must submit the following
      documentation:
      • Written letter to the Municipality
      • Single registration form (formulario único de administración predial)
      (downloadable on the Municipality's website)
      • Cadastre certificate (Procedure 3)
      • Property title (copy)
      • Royal folio (Procedure 5)
      • Receipt of last five property tax payments
      • Identification card (copy)
      • Plans (original and copy)

      The municipality reviews the documents and enters the application            1 day        no charge

      data into the electronic system SITR@M. After 5 business days, the
      architect in charge returns to the Municipality to arrange a date for the
      on-site inspection (preferably scheduled more than 2 business days
      later). In case of objections or observations, all documents are returned
      to the architect, and the rejection is documented on the single form
      (FUAP). After the inspection, the Municipality informs BuildCo of the fee
      assessed and fills out the single municipal form (formulario unico
      municipal). After the inspection, GENISIS (the computerized system)
      calculates the overall fees and produces the single municipal form
      (formulario unico municipal).
