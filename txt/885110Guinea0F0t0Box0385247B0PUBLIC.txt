II. Methodology
In February 2013, 513 stakeholders of the World Bank in Guinea were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the
judiciary branch. A total of 383 stakeholders participated in the country survey (75% response
rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier, email or face to face and returned them
accordingly. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Guinea; their overall attitudes
toward the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working
with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Guinea; and the Bank’s communication and
information sharing in Guinea.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Guinea: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Guinea is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas of development would contribute most to reducing
   poverty and generating economic growth in Guinea.

   productive for t he Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in
   Guinea, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.

   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Guinea, the extent to which the Bank
   meets Guinea’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level
   of effectiveness across thirty six development areas, such as poverty reduction, agricultural
   development, transport, education and communicable/non-communicable diseases.

   consult Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the Bank should focus its
   research efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge work and
   activities, including how significant of a contribution they make to development results in
   Guinea and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Guinea’ institutional capacity,
   providing effective implementation support, and the World Bank is adequately staffed in
   Guinea.

   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to their information requests.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
   Respondents across all stakeholder groups had statistically similar level of familiarity with
    the World Bank.
   Respondents from Mid-Guinea and Upper Guinea indicated the highest levels of familiarity
    with the Bank, whereas respondents from Forested Guinea indicated significantly lower
    levels.
   It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were significantly,
    strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Guinea, and
    significantly, moderately correlated with the Bank’s ability to help achieve development
    results, and the Bank’s relevance to Guinea’s development.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Specific Areas of Effectiveness

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness across many of these thirty-six development areas. For the most part,
        respondents from CSOs tended to have the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness
        across these areas, whereas respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private
        banks tended to have significantly lower ratings. (See the Appendix for full details.)
        Those areas with significant stakeholder differences were:

           Information and communications technology
           Basic infrastructure
           Local governance and institutions
           Job creation/employment
           Rural development
           Social protection
           Natural resource management

       There were significant differences between geographic locations across eleven of these
        thirty-six areas. In almost all eleven instances, respondents from Maritime Guinea had
        significantly lower ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas than
        respondents from other locations. Those areas with significant differences were:

           Basic infrastructure
           Communicable/non-communicable diseases
           Water and sanitation
           Trade and exports
           Economic growth and diversification
           Energy

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Guinea, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty six specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one sp ecific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Guinea. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                Law and justice;
                Poverty reduction;
                Health;
                Domestic private sector development; and
                Anti corruption.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Guinea, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                Poverty reduction;
                Rural development;
                Economic growth and diversification;
                Anti corruption; and
                Agricultural development.

              the most frequently, from a few times a year to weekly.

             Employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies and
              respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks indicated that
              they consult the World Bank knowledge work and activities much less frequently,
              from never to a few times a year.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates
The World Bank’s Work in Guinea
       Respondents across all stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of agreement on
        the World Bank’s work in Guinea in the following aspects.
       There were significant differences between geographic locations in the respondents’
        levels of agreement regarding two aspects of the Bank’s work in Guinea: The World
        Bank supporting realistic programs/strategies and playing a relevant role in development
        in the country. Respondents from Upper Guinea tended to have the highest levels of
        agreement with these statements, whereas respondents from Mid-Guinea tended to have
        significant lower levels of agreement.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
Overall Perceptions
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in the respondents’ levels of
        agreement that the World Bank ensures consistency and continuity through staff changes.
        Employees of the local governments, ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
        agencies and CSOs had the highest levels of agreement, whereas the consultants working
        on Bank-supported projects, PMUs, and respondents from the private sector/financial
        sector/private banks tended to have significant lower levels of agreement.
       There were significant differences between geographic locations in the respondents’
        levels of agreement across many aspects of how the Bank operates (see the Appendix for
        full details). For the indicator question, respondents across all geographic locations had
        statistically similar levels of agreement.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
The World Bank as an Effective Development Partner
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings for the World Bank’s
        “collaboration with the government ” as an effective development partner in the country.
        Employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies and local
        governments, and respondents from the CSOs tended to give the highest ratings, whereas
        respondents from the media tended to give significantly lower ratings.
       There were significant differences between geographic locations in their ratings across
        two of these aspects of the World Bank being an effective development partner (see the
        Appendix for full details). For the indicator questions, respondents across all geographic
        locations had statistically similar ratings.
