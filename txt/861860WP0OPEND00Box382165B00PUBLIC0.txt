Archimedes once said, “give me a lever long enough and I will move the
world.” In disaster risk management, our levers tend to be shorter than we
would like. Seismic retrofits, flood management programs, and climate
adaptation measures only reduce risks; they cannot eliminate them. Nor
can we afford to fund programs in all the places we would like. As a result,
building resilient societies requires knowing where to target our scarce
resources so they get the most leverage.

In many places in the world, we have limited data to tell us where to put
our levers. Maps may be decades old in cities that are experiencing 3%
to 5% annual population growth. Exposure data may be ‘guestimates’
that divide these old maps into 10km grid squares and then limit us to
approximating an average vulnerability within each square. The risk
assessments that build on this coarse data may not always tell us where
our disaster risk management investments will give the best return in
lives saved.

The Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) is building better
access to data. From the Sahel and Horn of Africa to the Caribbean
islands, open government data projects are helping ministries release
disaster risk management data that analysts can access from public data
catalogues. From Indonesia and Sri Lanka to Nepal and Haiti, community
mapping projects are creating maps with millions of individual building
footprints. Across a range of international partners, open data efforts are
mapping the terra incognita within the realm of disaster risk management.
Through efforts like the Open Data for Resilience Initiative, we are getting
a better understanding of where to place our levers.

The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery has funded the
creation of this guide to capture the experiences of an initial round of
founding partners who are using open data to build resilient societies. It is
our pleasure to offer it under an open license with the intent of catalyzing
an ecosystem around a growing wealth of shared wisdom about how to
generate and manage open data projects. Please accept my invitation to
contribute to this guide and expand the list of partnering organizations
around it.

                   preface
                   In the year 869, the residents of Miyato-jima (Japan) experienced a strong earthquake.
                   Knowing that a tsunami might follow, many fled to the top of the nearest hill. To their
                   horror, a wave from the sea combined with a second wave that came over the rice
                   paddies, washing over the hill and pulling the helpless villagers out to sea. Those that
                   survived that day placed a stone on the hill next to a rebuilt shrine, a symbol of the story
                   of how two tsunami waves fused together. For 1142 years, the stone served as a warning
                   to future generations not to flee to the top of that particular hill. When the 11 March 2011
                   earthquake struck off the coast of Sendai, residents of Miyato-jima remembered the story
                   and fled further inland, where they watched two tsunami waves again crash over the hill.

                                        introduction
                                        Credible information about risk is an essential element of Disaster Risk Management (DRM).
                                        Thousands of times each year, disasters reveal decisions about how to apply this information to
                                        the management of risk.† When a school collapses during a moderate earthquake, citizens may
                                        point to the failure of the construction firm to adhere to building standards. Or to the failure of a
                                        government to enforce building codes. Or to the education ministry that should have retrofitted
                                        the structure to better resist known seismic risks.

                                        In each case, critical information was missing—information that might have driven a different
                                        choice about architectural designs, building materials, the site for the building (siting), or actions
                                        to remediate a known vulnerability.

                                        Across the disaster risk management cycle, institutions are now engaged in a process to build
                                        this stock of information. The aim is to improve the chain of decision making across an entire
                                        system—from the donors who fund retrofitting of schools to the parents who need to know how
                                        safe their local schools are.


                                        risk assessment and communication
                                        Building risk assessments follows an internationally agreed approach that combines three
                                        elements: hazard, exposure and vulnerability.

                                        DD   Hazard: The likelihood (probability/chance) and intensity of a potentially destructive natural
                                             phenomenon. For example, ground shaking in an earthquake; severe wind/storm surge in a
                                             cyclone; inundation level and velocity in a flood event.
                                        DD   Exposure: The location, attributes, and value of assets that are important to communities
                                             (people, property, infrastructure, agriculture/industry etc).
                                        DD   Vulnerability: The likelihood that assets will be damaged or destroyed when exposed to a hazard
                                             event. For example, the relationship between the intensity of earthquake shaking and the level

     the world bank group open data readiness assessment toolkit
     To help governments prepare for open data initiatives, the World Bank’s Open Government Data Working Group has
     developed an Open Data Readiness Assessment toolkit. This questionnaire divides readiness into several categories of
     action:


     DD   Leadership: commitment and structures by which national leadership advance open data.
     DD   Policy/Legal Framework: laws and policies around government data, intellectual property, and protection of data.
     DD   Institutional: responsibilities and work processes for release and curation of government data.
     DD   Government Data: availability and findability of key government data.
     DD   Data Demand/Reuse: extent of existing engagement with government data within civil society and between
          ministries.
     DD   Ecosystem: health of partnerships by which governments can catalyze the application of open data to problems in
          civil society, academia, and industry.
     DD   Financing: support for open data efforts, including training, scaling pilots, and curating data sets.
     DD   Infrastructure: evaluation of the baseline ICT resources and what infrastructure will need to be built to support open
          government data initiatives.


     This toolkit is an evolving resource that focuses on general environment for open government data. OpenDRI
     implements one of the Open Data Working Group’s recommendations: to develop open data assessment tools for
     specific topical areas (in this case, for DRM). For more information on the Open Data Readiness Toolkit, see http://
     data.worldbank.org/about/open-government-data-toolkit/readiness-assessment-tool.

                                         open data for resilience
                                         initative
                                         The Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) works with governments to
                                         harness the value of Open Data practices in service of more effective disaster
                                         risk management and climate change adaptation. OpenDRI is neither a
                                         methodology or nor a toolset, but rather an evolving set of practices that can be
                                         configured to meet specific needs. For this reason, OpenDRI starts by listening.


                                         OpenDRI began from a catastrophe. On 12 January 2010, an earthquake devastated Haiti. Buildings
                                         collapsed across an impact zone that stretched from the southern peninsula to the Artibonite valley.
                                         Hundreds of thousands were dead, injured, or incapacitated, including key staff at the United
                                         Nations Mission to Haiti (MINUSTAH) and the staff of the national mapping agency (CNIGS). As
                                         a result, critical information from both UN agencies and government ministries were buried under
                                         the rubble, including the location of the health facilities, current maps of the warren of roads in Port
                                         au Prince, and other data that would be needed to recover quickly and build a more resilient society.
                                         This vacuum of critical data could have greatly magnified the effects of an already catastrophic
                                         disaster, but instead, something unexpected happened.

                                         For the first time, several satellite companies collected fresh high-resolution imagery of the
                                         damage and made the data available for free. Digital Globe, SPOT, and GeoEye each made their
                                         imagery available under an open license that permitted redistribution and reuse. The World Bank
                                         collected imagery via aircraft at even higher resolution and put this additional data under an open
                                         license as well.

                                         These two imagery releases catalyzed a second activity never seen before: a worldwide effort to
                                         map a country in less than three weeks. More than 600 volunteers from the OpenStreetMap
                                         community started tracing the imagery, creating a highly detailed map of Haiti, including
                                         building footprints and roads in Port au Prince. Volunteers from 29 countries made about 1.2
                                         million edits to the map, performing an estimated year of cartographic work in about 20 days—all
                                         for zero cost. This effort catalyzed a rethinking of community mapping and open data within the
                                         World Bank and several other international institutions.

from data to decision
The process of moving from the collection and analysis of open data to driving decisions off the data is a jump that can
be difficult to make. The OpenDRI team has observed three areas where this chain of moving from data to decision is
beginning to happen.
1.	 Impact Modeling. Using the data from community mapping, hazard models, and open government data
    (demographics, inafrastructure, etc), it is possible to use impact modeling tools like InaSAFE (see page 79) to
    visualize the likely impacy of a hazard on schools, hospitals, major population centers, and other scenarios. The
    Province of Jakarta in Indonesia has used this method for monsoon emergency planning.
2.	 Damage Loss Calculation. Based on the attributes collected by community mapping (building types, use, footprint,
    materials, etc), it is possible to calculate the approximate value of hundreds of thousands of individual structures
    in an urban area. In aggregate, these calculations provide a higher-resolution view into potential losses than
    estimations.
3.	 Rubble Calculation. Similar to the data for damages, community mapping provides planner with a better
    understanding of the potential volume of rubble that may occur after an earthquake. USAID is using data from
    Nepal for this purpose.

                                      method
                                      OpenDRI’s mission is to support larger DRM initiatives in a country (such
                                      as risk assessment and preparedness) by creating the living data ecosystem
                                      necessary for ongoing disaster risk management. That said, OpenDRI is not
                                      itself a comprehensive approach to risk assessment. Instead, it is an evolving
                                      set of practices that can be configured to meet specific needs. Because no two
                                      countries face the same exposure to natural hazards and climate change (or
                                      practices around curating disaster risk data), OpenDRI starts by considering
                                      the local context.
                                      OpenDRI approaches the problem of collating, collecting, and catalyzing open data as a matter of
                                      customizing an effort to both meet local needs and support broader DRM strategies. The method
                                      is designed to start in areas where government clients are committed to a DRM agenda and are
                                      ideally ready to engage with open data principles and expand to other challenges as those clients
                                      are ready.

                                      The OpenDRI Team has learned to ask deep questions to see if partners are ready for the
                                      challenge of collecting, assessing, and curating data about the built environment. Risk data is
                                      inherently spatial and requires substantially more care than non-spatial data through its life cycle.
                                      The team is considering developing a diagnostic tool to capture tacit knowledge of the specialists
                                      who have implemented OpenDRI in challenging environments.

                                      The two core elements of the current diagnostic are common across many open data projects:

                                      1.	 Identifying champions who are already trying to perform this work and are
                                          positioned to enable OpenDRI to connect to necessary resources and people.
                                      2.	 Defining a clear use case for open data by listening to the champions and other partners.

alignment with hyogo framework for action
The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters (HFA) defines
the agreement that the international community is pursuing to reduce losses from disasters “in lives and in the social,
economic and environmental assets of communities and countries.”

OpenDRI provides a mechanism for countries to address several priority actions under the HFA:

Identifying and Assessing Disaster Risks
Teaching local nations how to collate existing DRM data and collect new data about the built environment contributes to
creating the infrastructure for national and local actors to “research, observe, analyse, map and where possible forecast
natural and related hazards, vulnerabilities and disaster impacts.” OpenDRI also creates an open exchange for these data
and fosters in situ geospatial capabilities. (HFA III.B.2.iii).

Building a culture of safety and resilience at all levels
Fostering a well-informed populace requires dialogue between local and international stakeholders based on relevant and
current information about their risks. OpenDRI creates a platform for the collation and collection of spatial and statistical
data as well as a forum for building a network of stakeholders around the application of open data to disaster risk reduction.
(HFA III.B.3.i)

Strengthening disaster preparedness for effective response at all levels
Effective response requires coordinated action from preparedness to response and recovery. OpenDRI fosters partnerships
across sectors and communities around the creation of data necessary for identifying and preparing for disasters.

OpenDRI strives to change the culture around risk thinking so that is it based on locally-generated data, curated by local
officials and communities, and translated into local action. The availability of this data helps local actors identify, mitigate,
and prepare for disasters. It also provides the baseline data required for interdependent, coordinated action between
international agencies. For these reasons, OpenDRI is one approach to fostering local resilience within an interdependent,
international, multi-agency partnership, where control of the initiative rests with national ministries.

                                       scoping
                                       Existing OpenDRI projects have not been standalone efforts, but instead
                                       have been components of larger DRM initiatives. In each case, the country
                                       context has provided an environment where a network of partners were ready
                                       for the challenge of collecting, assessing, and curating data about the built
                                       environment.


                                       The two most important factors for success are to find the champions who are already trying to
                                       perform this work and to define a clear use case for open data.

                                       Assessing the readiness of this network of partners for OpenDRI requires a scoping mission (site
                                       visit) that looks at the country content across the four areas that fuse into OpenDRI:

                                       1.	 Open Government Risk Data. What data does the government collect about
                                           natural hazards, the built environment, and other risk factors? How does
                                           the government collate, coordinate, and analyze this data? How is this data
                                           made available to other parts of the public and private sectors?
                                       2.	 Open Mapping and Technology. What is the status of the open mapping community in
                                           the country? What are the coverage (extent) and accuracy of the mapping data? What
                                           kind of open technology community exists to turn mapping data into useful tools?
                                       3.	 Risk Assessment and Communication. What kind of hazard and risk assessment does the
                                           country engage in? Who is responsible for risk assessment? How do risks get communicated
                                           to the public and how does the country track how the public uses this information?
                                       4.	 Hazard Monitoring, Modeling, and Communication. What is the status monitoring of major
                                           risks (including weather forecasting)? How does the country communicate those risks?

                                       Based on this scoping mission, the OpenDRI management team will work with the client to
                                       customize the project to local needs.

opendri framing questions
The GFDRR Labs team is building a diagnostic tool to capture the questions in a questionnaire that could would be submitted as a report from
the Scoping Mission. This diagnostic tool will be available in mid 2014. As an intermediate step, the OpenDRI team has assembled some of
the questions that they commonly ask when performing scoping missions. Because each engagement must be customized to context, so must
the questions be customized to the unique needs of the place and time.

Determining how ready a given country context may be for OpenDRI entails exploring four general classes of questions: What, Who, How, and
Why? What specific use cases OpenDRI would pursue to meet DRM objectives and what data sets are necessary to support those use cases?
Who curates the data to support the use cases or who would collate or collect those data? How do those entities manage those data, including
any policies or laws around those processes? How would the client country’s ecosystem would sustain the initiative? Why is OpenDRI the right
method to support the larger DRM program in the country?

                                        collating existing data
                                        OpenDRI works with partner institutions to solve a core problem: how to
                                        catalogue and standardize the data that governments already possess and
                                        build an ecosystem where these data can be found and used by a range of
                                        partners.


                                        When ministries or international organizations collect information, it often gets stuck in a black
                                        hole: a place where it may be useful within a small orbit, but invisible to the rest of the universe.
                                        Until institutions both organize information in a systematic manner that can be shared with
                                        others and create tools to make the information useful to others, information’s power remains
                                        underutilized or even latent.

                                        OpenDRI has piloted methods and platforms to collate datasets within and between institutions
                                        that work across the DRM cycle. These efforts center on helping ministries open data sets to
                                        wider orbits of institutions, with the preferred approach being to make data both legally and
                                        technically open. The collation phase centers on building this open data ecosystem around a free
                                        and open-source data catalogue (e.g., GeoNode). The following guide to collating data builds on
                                        experiences in approximately two dozen countries.


                                        listening to client problems
                                        The design of OpenDRI starts from a difficult reality: collating data is huge challenge for
                                        ministries officials everywhere in the world. Many governments have tried to aggregate and
                                        centralize some portion of the data that they generate across the national, provincial, and local
                                        levels. These efforts have often failed for several reasons:

                                        DD   Control: the perceived loss of control that proceeds making data available beyond its originating
                                             agency; and
                                        DD   Funding: the perceived loss of potential revenues from selling the data to interested parties,
                                             including other ministries.

data catalogues and geonode
When implementing an open data initiative, governments require a platform that enables them to release data sets to both
the public as well as more limited audiences. This platform must either be capable of hosting the data, including geographic
data, which has special requirements for its storage and visualization, or it must provide a catalogue of other online
resources where the data reside. In either case, the platform must make data findable—including data which may be stored
at a remote server (usually hosted by the institution that curates the data set).

OpenDRI has deployed a platform called GeoNode to meet these needs in over two dozen countries. GeoNode is a
web-based open source platform that facilitates the collation, sharing, management, publication and collaborative use of
geospatial data. It packages several mature and stable open-source software projects under a consistent and easy-to-use
interface allowing users to share data and create interactive maps. GeoNode includes a built-in map composer and viewer;
analysis and reporting tools, geospatial data storage; and data mixing and map creation.
See http://geonode.org/ for more information.




taxonomy of excuses commonly used to avoid releasing data
At CEBTI Gov 2.0 conference in 2010, Andrew Stott (UK Director of Digital Engagement) led a working group through a discussion of the
reasons why government agencies refuse to release data. This taxonomy is based on this brainstorm as well as research for this report.

In general, there are three approaches to scaling open government
risk data:

DD   Expanding the number of data catalogues. The politics of
     centralizing data can hinder efforts to scale open data projects.
     With the advent of tools to link datasets to each other, data
     catalogues no longer need to be centralized. Instead, they can
     form a confederation of catalogues. In this way, each ministry
     can own and curate its own data, and choose what data to make
     available to whom. The confederation of catalogues might offer
     other ministries very different access rights than the rights
     afforded to the general public.
DD   Adding data sets to each data catalogue. Often the initial data sets
     are limited to information which is considered to be low risk and
     high reward for its release. Expanding the data available in each
     catalogue will work towards data which might have lower rewards
     or higher risks for its release.
DD   Increasing interconnections. As the number of data catalogues
     increases, the usefulness of the information will drive more
     interconnections between data. As the density of interlinked
     datasets increase, so will the perceived value of the network. Each
     data set can be viewed as a LEGO™ piece. When topography
     data from one ministry can be combined with meteorological
     forecasts and river gauge data, flood models can be built to
     predict flood damage from future events.
In each case, planning how to scale requires considering several
factors:

DD   Meeting the use cases of partners. The availability of data often
     exposes new use cases, many of which may have additional data
     needs. The Open Data Working Group and Data Curator can
     explore these emerging needs and work with the stakeholderrs
     decide which direction to take the additional effort.

geonode core concepts
A GeoNode is a data catalogue for geospatial information. Analoguous to the Open Knowledge Foundation's CKAN
platform for open structured data, the GeoNode software allows one or more organizations to upload geospatial data sets
that comply to open standards to a central location. GeoNodes can also be federated, so that each organization can retain
stewardship of their own data sets and open specific data to others from outside the organization via web services.

Layers
Layers are geospatial data expressed in either vector or raster format (i.e., polygons or pixels). Layers store one data set,
such as a map of the school building polygons or a satellite image taken on a specific date. Each layer can contain metadata
that describe the provenance of the data, its owner, license, and other key attributes necessary for applying that data set in a
risk model or when making a policy decision. Layers can also be rated and can allow users to have a dialogue about the data
through comments.

Maps
Maps allow users to combine two or more layers (and the associated styles that govern appearance) into composite
resources. Maps can pull layers from the local GeoNode, from a remote GeoNode, or via web services from other remote
sites (such as an ESRI ArcServer, Google Earth Appliance, or other GIS tools).

Documents
GeoNodes support uploading of documents, such as PDFs or images. Documents can be associated with layers or
maps, allowing users to upload reports that describe methodologies used to produce datasets or analyses based on the
combination of layers into a map.

Metadata
A GeoNode supports (and strongly encourages) the use of metadata to describe the provenance, accuracy, and other
attributes of data. Metadata formats can be configured to use one of several international standards, including ISO
19139:2007 and Dublin Core.

Web Services
A web service allows a GeoNode to import or export data via standard protocols. Layers and maps can be exposed as
web services, so that analysts at partner organizations can import the layer or map into their own geographic information
systems. A GeoNode can also pull data from remote sites so that analysts can view data from partners in their maps.

geonode in sri lanka
To enable better disaster risk modeling, the Government of
Sri Lanka partnered with GFDRR, UNDP, and OCHA on the
development of OpenDRI. A component of that program was to
collate data around hazards and exposure and prepare them to be
uploaded into a GeoNode.

Working with the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), the
National Survey Department, Department of the Census and
Statistics, Nation Building Research Organisation, Information and
Communication Technology Agency, Department of Irrigation,
several universities, and the international partners. The OpenDRI
team supported DMC in the aggregation of data that had been
stored in static PDFs, old paper maps, and several databases into a
GeoNode, which the Government dubbed RiskInfo.lk.

The data in the RiskInfo.lk GeoNode is currently available to
authorized users in the OpenDRI partnership, in preparation for
launch. This transitional state is typical for open data projects, as
the partnership reviews data with the parties and affirms that it
is ready for release to the public. Some layers may be restricted to
authorized users.

Administrative Boundaries
The partner to the GeoNode digitized the administrative
boundaries to level 5 for Sri Lanka (this is smallest administrative
unit, called a grama niladhari or GN).

Hazard Layers
Hazard data was divided among several partners. Nation Building
Research Organisation had landslide data. UNDP had performed
a Integrated Strategic Environment Assessment (ISEA) and had
worked with several ministries to aggregate data on earthquakes,
floods, cyclones, and tsunami. These data were available with
methodologies in a 236-page PDF.

Exposure Data
The OpenDRI partners worked with the Department of Census
and Statistics to get demographic data into the GeoNode, and
subsequently uploaded OpenStreetMap building data.

Converting Static PDFs
to Dynamic Data
The OpenDRI team worked with           SRI LANKA
the Disaster Management Centre
to perform the process of turning
the data in the UNDP ISEA report
into digital data in the GeoNode.
This work included taking maps
like figure at right and converting
it to map that could be uploaded
into the GeoNode.

Converting Paper Maps to Digital Maps
Grama niladhari often had paper maps that reflected changes that
had not been entered into the national map. OpenDRI created a
process to digitize the map, first by tracing satellite imagery into
OpenStreetMap, then using the paper maps to add and annotate the
landmarks. The Disaster Management Centre extracted the mapping
data from OpenStreetMap and uploaded it to the GeoNode.




Creating a Tsunami Inundation Map
with UNDP Data and OpenStreetMap
With the new data in the GeoNode, the Disaster Management
Centre was able to create the map at right by combining the UNDP
tsunami hazard map with the new digitized paper maps.

                                       collecting new data
                                       OpenDRI develops a network of citizens who are prepared to collect and curate
                                       data about the exposure of their communities to natural hazards.


                                       Collecting data from field environments has special challenges, especially in countries where
                                       maps are poor and addresses are often a more a narrative than a numerical postal address. Cities
                                       and informal settlements tend to be very dynamic communities, where change is a constant
                                       element of the environment. When data about these built environments do not exist or are either
                                       outdated or inaccurate, it is necessary to collect new data. OpenDRI focuses on this type of data.

                                       Governments generally take two approaches to this challenge: traditional surveys, which place GIS
                                       data into a national map or spatial data infrastructure; and community mapping, which place data
                                       into a growing public database like OpenStreetMap. Traditional surveys generally collect data
                                       using survey methods that are performed by professionals who are licensed and monitored by
                                       associations or national standards bodies. In some contexts, these methods may be best suited
                                       to the task of collecting DRM data. That said, traditional surveys can be slow, expensive, and
                                       accessible only to experts. In contrast, community mapping efforts collect data using an emerging
                                       set of techniques that train communities to curate data about their own built environment. This
                                       approach offers speed, value, and an opportunity to educate communities about different ways of
                                       thinking about the risks they face.

                                       Community mapping for DRM is a relatively new form of data collection. While community
                                       mapping had its start more than two decades ago in participatory GIS, the variances between
                                       its methods and traditional survey data often caused difficulties for national mapping agencies.
                                       The methods of community mapping developed under OpenDRI are specific to mapping using
                                       online tools with standard cartography, satellite imagery tracing, and GPS-based field surveys.
                                       Data quality is checked at multiple stages in a project by third parties (usually university GIS
                                       departments), and variances lead to corrective action in training and tools.

community mapping platforms
For several decades, participatory mapping has used paper and other tools to help communities develop maps of their
surroudnings. While these maps were useful for an intended (often limited) purpose, they often did not provide sufficient
geographic accuracy to use for official government cartography. In 2004, the paradigm began to change.

Upset with the licensing of geographic data from the UK’s Ordinance Survey, a group of geographers founded
OpenStreetMap to “encourage the growth, development and distribution of free geospatial data and provide geospatial
data for anybody to use and share.” (see http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/History_of_OpenStreetMap). In 2006, they
launched openstreetmap.org, based on the concept of a wiki—a form of collective intelligence that allows registered users
to collaborate on the construction and curation of a shared repository of knowledge. OpenStreetMap is a geographic wiki
that allows any registered user to make and edit maps.

Most GIS platforms use a top-down feature taxonomy to structure data. OpenStreetMap (OSM) uses a bottom-up tagging
system, by which users can tag any object as a key-value pair (e.g., building_use = school). This approach has the benefit
of being incredible flexible and easy to explain to lay users. It has enabled OSM to scale to billions of nodes and 1.5 million
users in only 8 years. That said, the tagging system also creates complexities when integrating OSM data into traditional GIS
platforms.

OpenDRI has an approach to balance the need to import data into traditional modeling tools with the power of key-value
tags: an evolving set of standardized tags for describing buildings and infrastructure so that the exposure of geographic
objects to specific natural hazards can be modeled using traditional risk assessment methods. OpenDRI also harnesses the
flexibility of OSM’s tagging system to capture elements that may be unique to the local context, such as architectural styles.

OpenDRI follows The World Bank Group’s policy around using an open license for efforts that mobilize local citizens to
collect data about their communities:

“The World Bank only supports citizen-mapping efforts that give users free access to the map data they create. While citizens
are free to choose the projects and tools that best meet their goals, our guiding principle is simple: if the public helps to collect or
create map data, the public should be able to access, use and re-use that data freely.”

open cities: opendri implementation in kathmandu
The people of Kathmandu face the highest risk of losing their lives from an earthquake of any urban population in the world.
In 2012, the World Bank and GFDRR started working in partnership with the Government of Nepal to launch a project to
better understand seismic risk, in order to build resilience in the education and health infrastructure of the Kathmandu
Valley. The first step of this process was the creation of a disaster risk model to determine relative vulnerability of the
buildings in which such facilities were housed. As this has been completed, the next phase is for this model to be used to
prioritize plans for subsequent building retrofits of schools and health facilities to improve structural integrity in the face of
earthquake.
In November 2012, World Bank staff and consultants began the year-long project by assembling a team of mappers
and community mobilizers. The team was responsible for a wide variety of tasks covering field surveying and software
development to providing training and awareness raising on OpenStreetMap to a range of community groups, particularly
several universities and start-up clubs across Kathmandu Valley.
The 4-person core mapping team (later expanded to 6), was composed of university graduates from Kathmandu University
that were recruited based on their prior contribution to Nepal’s then-nascent OSM community. These core members were
paid full-time salaries at rates commensurate with the local salary structure for recent graduates in technical disciplines. In
addition, the project recruited 6 part-time interns from Kathmandu University and 11 volunteers from Tribhuvan University.
Office space for the team was located within a co-working space. This gave the team access to meeting rooms, reliable
connections to the internet and opportunities to interact with other technologists and entrepreneurs, some of whom would
later themselves become active in OpenStreetMap.
Open Cities Kathmandu surveyed 2,256 schools and 350 health facilities in the Kathmandu Valley. In addition to collecting a
comprehensive list of health and school facilities structural data, the team worked to create a comprehensive base-map of
the valley by digitizing building footprints, mapping the road network, and collecting other major points of interest.
The Open Cities Team also conducted significant outreach to universities, technical communities and government in order
to grow the OSM community. Over 2,300 individuals participated in OSM trainings or presentations during the first year
of the project. In addition to the use of school and health facility data to plan retrofitting activities, the data has been used
in a number of transportation planning applications and USAID has incorporated it into disaster preparedness planning
exercises. The American Red Cross has also recently begun to contribute to OpenStreetMap in Kathmandu, signaling further
interest from development partners. A local NGO called the Kathmandu Living Labs, comprised of participants in the first
phase of the Open Cities Project, has been created in order to continue the work.
                                                                                                                                    65

                                   ecosystem
                                   OpenDRI catalyzes a change to mindset: it builds a community of practitioners
                                   who apply open data to their daily problems, and in so doing, creates a
                                   sustainable ecosystem around a living and growing corpus of data that
                                   describe a dynamic society.


                                   Before an OpenDRI engagement, decision makers and their datasets tend to be loosely connected.
                                   As the data catalogue and community map fill out, the curators for each dataset come into
                                   closer relationship with each other. As they work out policies around how to make data findable
                                   and available to a wider audience, they often find themselves asking and answering questions
                                   which had previously been closed to them, either for lack of data or direct connection to specific
                                   expertise. This curiousity generates a demand for workshops, data, and tools that help answer
                                   their evolving questions. In the process, interconnections between people and data grow denser.

                                   OpenDRI catalyzes this relational power through data. By linking data together, OpenDRI links
                                   decision makers together. By making data open, OpenDRI opens minds to different decisions.

                                   Catalyzing the ecosystem of users around open data is still a new and evolving practice at
                                   OpenDRI. Catalyzing and sustaining change is difficult. Without continuous funding, most
                                   development efforts falter, brain drain may pull key talent to other organizations, and stakeholders
                                   revert to the data sharing practices that they used prior to the OpenDRI engagement.

                                   OpenDRI’s designers take a practical approach to this problem: catalyzing open data ecosystems
                                   with periodic or occasional influxes of energy and resources. The development partners who
                                   funded and catalyzed the initial collation and collection of data work in concert with local actors.
                                   Together, they build institutions and processes that keeps the data fresh and the community
                                   around the data vibrant and productive.

                           When shared, collective memory can grow into a general conscioueness and extend across many
                           generations. Open data is becoming a tsunami stone for the modern age—a digital collective
                           memory for societies that have faced disasters, rebuilt, and asked how they can avoid replicating
                           designs that proved weak before the forces of nature. Over time, open data can lead to more
                           resilient societies by creating a shared understanding of how to best manage risk and then design
                           approaches to managing those risks.

                           In less than decade, readers will look at the initial version of this guide like an early piece of
                           new software. Its creators hope that it will have provided a useful scaffolding for expanding the
                           practices around the collation and collection of open data, as well as the approaches that we take
                           to catalyzing communities to apply open data to decision making. If it has done so, it will have
                           done its job, but only if others keep building upon it.

                           We therefore invite thinkers from around the world to extend this guide. We have placed it under
                           a Creative Commons license to foster the creation of a collective memory around open data
                           practices. If you do build upon the Guide and add your insights in any language, please contribute
                           your experiences and insights back to the global community. More information will be made
                           available on coordinating a collective effort via the GFDRR.org web site.

                           Open data is a new way to give voice to a community's needs. We hope that the emerging set of
                           methods described in this Guide empowers those who are producing and curating open data
                           in their communities. Together, as partners, we hope to build the collective memory that our
                           grandchildren will need as they make decisions about risk in a world where climate change will
                           affect their everyday lives. They will need a far deeper understandings of their past to inform the
                           decisions that they need to make to protect the future of their own children.

Methodology	
Buildings and features are drawn on Field Papers and marked with an identifying number.
Mappers note this identifying number in the Field Paper ID field of this survey form, and then
add attribute data that conform to the data model designed for the field data collection work.
Survey forms vary for each project and adapt to changes in design. This survey conforms to the
Buildings data model on the page 112.
