Executive Summary and Introduction

1.      This Public Expenditure Review (PER) is aimed at filling a knowledge gap to support the
Government of the Federated States of Micronesia (GoFSM) in improving the design of public
expenditure policies, working within the existing Compact and governance framework, to address
these key challenges. The quantitative analysis relied on data provided by the GoFSM, audit reports,
compact reports, and annual economic review data generated by the Office of Statistics, Budget,
Overseas Development Assistance, and Compact Management Budget (SBOC) with technical
assistance (TA) from the Graduate School USA. The PER also draws on data from the 2014 Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report for the National Government (NG) only.
These data sets are not exhaustive and/or some do not fully capture the national and state government
breakdown. The data limitations may result in some inaccuracies and inadvertent distortions in
outcomes. The main recommendations of this PER to support the GoFSM in addressing the
aforementioned challenges outlined below are centered on how to (a) improve public expenditure
management to support macroeconomic stability and growth and (b) improve public expenditure
management to support efficient, effective, and equitable service delivery. The PER is composed of a
concise set of chapters analyzing macroeconomic and fiscal trends, intergovernmental relationships,
public investment management (PIM) issues, and the two largest expenditure sectors: education and
health.


2.       Over the past five years, the economy contracted by an average of 0.2 percent, while
inflation (largely imported) remained steady, averaging 3.4 percent. The Federated States of
Micronesia (FSM) has a very narrow production base, with subsistence agriculture and fisheries and
the public sectors dominating the economy, both with regard to employment and value added. The
contribution of institutional sectors to growth suggests that private enterprises relied on the public sector
for growth opportunities and households tended to fall back to subsistence when growth slows. Growth
accelerations and decelerations were largely influenced by the implementation of the U.S. funded
airport upgrade project and Compact grants—although over the long run, the net effect of public
investment on growth has been small. Economic growth and international competitiveness are severely
constrained by the country’s small size, remoteness, geographic isolation and dispersion, and thin
institutional and human capacity.

3.     With a population of around 100,000, an economy of US$318 million in FY2014, and
ranking in the top decile of global remoteness indicators, the FSM is one of the smallest countries

                                                     2
and among the most remote in the world. At the same time, the FSM faces structural trade deficits
and is vulnerable to international price fluctuations.1 All petroleum products and a high proportion of
food are imported. The rise in food and fuel prices in 2008 resulted in inflation peaking at 13 percent
and current account deficits widening substantially, showing its extreme vulnerability to international
commodity price shocks. The trade deficits are largely financed by official grants and fishing license
fees. With limited financial infrastructure, a large portion of the Government’s assets (including the
assets in the various trust funds [TFs]) are invested offshore and, therefore, subject to volatility in
international financial markets. Finally, the FSM is vulnerable to climate change events such as sea
level rise, and its location heavily exposes the country to natural disasters such as cyclones, king tides,
and droughts, with implications for current and expected future fiscal costs.

4.       A host of structural factors, such as the federal structure, grant management system, and
rigidity of fiscal policy, renders economic management highly complex. The FSM’s federal
structure implies that economic decision making is dispersed across four state governments (SGs) and
one national government (NG). The need to find consensus among the GoFSM has frequently been a
major roadblock to reform. In addition, the Joint Economic Management Committee (JEMCO),
consisting of representatives from the FSM and the United States, also has significant influence on
fiscal policy making. Under the amended Compact of Free Association (Compact), the FSM receives
significant funding from the United States. The JEMCO reviews and approves grant allocations,
performance objectives, and, where appropriate, assessment tools, for the upcoming year. It also
reviews the development plans and other planning and budget documents of the government and
monitors the progress made by the government toward sustainable economic development and
budgetary self-reliance in relation to its written goals and performance measures. With no independent
monetary and exchange rate policies (due to use of the U.S. dollar), fiscal policy provides the main
macroeconomic policy lever. The fiscal policy framework is, however, only partially able to mitigate
the effects of short-term shocks. While fixed Compact grants (prioritized to specific sectors) provide
some revenue certainty in the medium term,2 low domestic revenue mobilization and increasing reliance
on revenue sources vulnerable to external influences may limit the scope for revenues to adapt to shocks.
Similarly, with wages accounting for over half of recurrent expenditures and the important role of the
public sector, there is also limited scope for expenditures to adapt to shocks. In the past, large external
aid flows from the United States supported long-term macroeconomic stability, as provisioned under
the Compact.


                                        Box 1. Compact of Free Association
    At the end of World War II, the United Nations created the Trust Territory of Pacific Islands and the United
    States accepted the role of Trustee. The FSM was under the civil administration of the U.S. Navy from 1944 to
    1951. Administration authority was then transferred to the U.S. Department of Interior (USDOI) until 1986
    when the FSM became independent. During that period, the FSM benefitted from U.S. investments to rebuild
    infrastructure and expand the provision of public services, including health and education. A sovereign country
    since 1986, the FSM entered into a ‘Compact of Free Association’ with the U nited States. Under the Compact,
    the FSM receives yearly financial transfers. The amended Compact provides U. S. support for a 20-year period
    that began in FY2004. Under the Compact, the FSM receives two streams of funds —Compact Sector Grants
    (CSGs) and contributions to the Compact Trust Fund (CTF)—that will total approximately US$2.1 billion over
    the 20-year Compact period. This is equivalent to payments of US$92.7 million per year in constant terms—
    US$76.2 million is provided as sector grants, US$0.5 million finances an annual audit, and US$16.0 million is
    paid as contributions into the CTF. While the Compact has no specified termination date, the annual sector


1 Exports averaged approximately 25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the past five years, and prospects for
increasing these are limited. With a narrow production base, the FSM is heavily dependent on imports, which averaged around
80 percent of GDP over the past five years.
2 In the long term, when Compact grants are replaced by CTF income, revenues may become more volatile and dependent on

international financial market and economic conditions, therefore less able to compensate for short-term shocks.

                                                            3
      grants will cease in 2023, to be replaced by disbursements from the CTF from 2024. Eligibility for federal
      programs, the provision of U.S. services, and the open migration provision will continue beyond 2023.

      The use of the CSG is guided by the Fiscal Procedures Agreement between the FSM and U.S. governments.
      This establishes, among others, the requirements on grant governance, disbursement, usage, and reporting. The
      USDOI has the fiduciary responsibility for the approval and implementation of the CSGs, through the JEMCO.
      The JEMCO was established to “strengthen management and accountability with regard to assistance provided
      under the Compact, and to promote the effective use of funding provided. ” The JEMCO members consist of
      three representatives from the United States and two from the FSM, and decisions are reached on a majority
      basis.

1.    CSGs are routed through the NG, 70 percent of which fund recurrent activities and the remaining 30 percent
      are used for capital spending and are also known as the Compact Infrastructure Grant (CIG). CSGs are shared
      across SGs based on Congressional decision premised on the distribution formula, which is largely determined
      by population. CSGs currently finance around half of total public spending. Between FY2016 and FY2023,
      CSGs from the United States, which are a major source of funding in the education, health, and infrastructure
      sectors, are scheduled to decline in real terms due to scheduled annual decrements to the amounts of the CSGs
      and an inflation adjustment (set at 2/3 of the U.S. Implicit Price Deflator - IDP) which is projected to be below
      FSM’s annual inflation—reducing resources available for service delivery. This reduction in the CSGs is offset
      by an annual increase in contributions to the CTF. From FY2023, income CTF assets should replace the real
      value of the existing CSGs. However, the CTF value is currently below the projected path to achieving this.
      Based on current projections, CTF income generated in FY2024 is expected to only be able to replace around
      two-thirds of CSGs, resulting in a fiscal cliff for the country.

      Note: The target balance estimate is defined as the size the CTF will need to achieve by the end of FY2023 to support a
      smooth and sustainable transition from CSGs to annual CTF distributions in FY2024. This is calculated based on the
      scheduled contributions to the CTF and assuming a constant return. The projected balance estimate reflects the actual
      evolution of the CTF balance up to FY2015 and the projected CTF balance profile based on the FY2015 actual. This is
      calculated based on the scheduled contributions to the CTF and assuming two levels of return, as shown in the legend. The
      FY2023 CSG is estimated based on the Compact schedule, while total spending in FY2024 is estimated from the 2014 Debt
      Sustainability Analysis. Distribution from the CTF may vary depending on the financial market return, affecting the
      magnitude of the shortfall as well.



     5.       Poverty has regressed and remains concentrated in Chuuk, raising questions around the
     efficiency and equity of public expenditure policy. Supported by large and steady external aid flows
     as well as a declining population, gross national income (GNI) for the FSM grew steadily to US$3,200
     in 2014 (World Development Indicators [WDIs], atlas method), much higher than many of its Pacific
     peers. However, poverty and inequality worsened between FY2005 and FY2013, with 1 in 10 people
     in the FSM living below the food poverty line and more than 4 out of 10 not being able to afford basic
     daily needs. Poverty remains more prevalent, severe, and deeper in Chuuk, where half of the population
     resides. While many factors besides public expenditure determine poverty outcomes, sustaining poverty
     reduction will require the GoFSM to make sound public expenditure policy choices to improve their
     efficiency and equity.




                                                                   4
6.       Similarly, weak and varying human development outcomes across the country also
suggest room for improving the effectiveness of public spending to support long-term economic
development. In education, although enrolments are high at the primary level, only 34 percent and 22
percent of children in grade 8 achieved ‘minimum competency’ or above in reading and math,
respectively. Performance across states varied widely. In reading, a mere 17 percent of children were
minimally competent or above in Chuuk, compared to 56 percent in Kosrae. In math, performance
ranged from 10 percent of children achieving minimum competency or above in Chuuk to 42 percent
of children in Kosrae. In health, public health and mortality outcomes are low. Outcomes also vary
across states, for example, reported immunization rates among two-year-old children range from 46
percent in Chuuk to 85 percent in Kosrae. Despite weak outcomes, public spending is high across key
sectors relative to the FSM’s peers—suggesting a low level of return. Improving human development
outcomes across the country will in the long term support the development of the economy.

7.       A summary of the recommendations from the PER is provided below, with more detail on each
of these presented in subsequent chapters.

       A. Growth and Stability

    savings regime.

8.       Macroeconomic stability is hampered by the FSM’s high exposure to external shocks.
With growth prospects constrained by structural issues, the FSM faces challenges in generating
sufficient domestic revenue (in 2014, tax revenue was equivalent to 12 percent of GDP) on their own
to meet spending needs. At the same time, increasing dependence on revenues vulnerable to
externalities can create revenue volatility, although this is currently partially dampened by steady
Compact grants. Limitations regarding revenue, together with larger spending levels, by extension,
imply wider public sector deficits. While pre-grant deficits typically ranged between 30 and 40 percent
of GDP, in the past, this was almost entirely met through Compact grants. Given that the FSM has no
domestic financial markets and limited access to international capital markets, any remaining deficits
are met through the temporary creation of arrears or drawdown of reserve assets. On the other hand,
surpluses (which have been achieved over the past five years) are generally saved. Prudent fiscal policy,
together with the lack of independent monetary policy, resulted in fiscal outcomes not leading to
inflationary pressures. Exposure to external shocks in turn requires a more prominent role for
government to stabilize income and consumption.

9.      Economic stability could be supported through enhanced domestic revenue mobilization
and strengthening reserve asset management. With average border tax and income tax at around half
of what the FSM’s regional peers collect and limited excise on sin goods, a review of the current tax
system may be warranted to guide the government in the broader tax reform strategies. In parallel, tax
administration, including tax roll management, could be strengthened to improve tax compliance.3
Improving domestic revenue mobilization will create fiscal space and reduce reliance on revenue

3 A pilot program supported by Pacific Financial and Technical Assistance Center to improve tax compliance has resulted in
significant increase in collections. Under this pilot, national cigarette tax collection has, for example, increased by over 100
percent compared to the previous calendar year, and aggregate collection was up US$1.8 million (or around 1 percent of total
spending) over the same period. More broad-based reforms to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio from 12 percent toward the level
achieved by regional peers could help further fill the fiscal gap.

sources vulnerable to external shocks. For saved revenues, the GoFSM should ensure they are governed
adequately, with clear disbursement rules, for example, to supplement any shortfalls from CTF
distributions and ensure macroeconomic stability.


Efficient, Effective, and Equitable Service Delivery

    growth.                        prioritization approach.               plans.

10.      Given the importance of the public sector to the economy, improving the quality of core
public expenditure, such as the wage bill, is important to providing efficient service delivery. The
wage bill accounted for over half of recurrent spending in FY2014 or 25 percent of GDP. Although it
has remained flat in nominal terms and declined as a share of GDP, it continues to be significantly
higher compared to other economies in the Pacific. For example, the FSM’s wage bill as a share of GDP
is roughly double that of Tonga, which has a similar population size. This may be interlinked with the
duplication of some functions across the GoFSM and the institutional and governance arrangements.
Despite the relatively high proportion of resources devoted to wages, performance of the public sector
remains modest, and outcomes in key sectors are weak. In addition, the manual payroll system takes up
a significant portion of public servants’ time and results in inadvertent leakages. This makes improving
the performance of the public sector and containing and possibly reducing wage bill expenditures in
real terms a concern for the government.

11.     To this end, the GoFSM could strengthen wage bill management and systems to improve
service delivery and minimize leakages. In the short term, automation of payroll information systems
could support improved oversight and control of the public sector wage bill and reduce unproductive
use of public servants' time.4 In addition, a broader review of public administration, including size,
efficiency, and human resource management, will shed light on future reform areas for consideration.
These include potentially streamlining payroll policies across the states and for different functions to
eliminate any misalignment in pay levels, tailoring human resource needs to meet changing organization
of service delivery, and unifying performance standards and incentive or accountability requirements.
Addressing some of these areas will support improved efficiency of the public sector and service
delivery in the medium to long term.


4Reducing the wage bill, for example, by 3 percent through minimizing leakages such as overpayment is equivalent to around
1 percent reduction in total spending.

                                                            6
12.     Similarly, efficiency of other recurrent expenditures should be evaluated. Other recurrent
expenditures accounted for around 40 percent of recurrent spending in FY2014 or around 20 percent of
GDP and experienced modest growth over the past five years. Bucking the overall trend, expenditures
on purchases of medical supplies and unspecified other government expenditure rose significantly
between FY2009 and FY2014. Expenditures under this category include, among others, subsidies to
the social security, payments to nonpublic schools, contributions to the passport revolving fund,
Micronesian Longline Fishing Company loan repayment, and scholarship grants. The efficacy of these
expenditures is not clear. Similarly, while the cost of purchasing medical supplies rose, sporadic
shortages of medicines continued. Recent performance audits highlighted, for example, weaknesses in
the procurement process which may hinder the efficiency of these expenditures for service delivery.

13.      Improving procurement and the evaluation framework could be one avenue to reduce
inefficient spending. Improving the procurement process, contract implementation, and inventory
controls for pharmaceutical and medical supplies will ensure the receipt of quality goods on time and
at the lowest costs.5 In the long run, improving the evaluation framework and transparency of other
recurrent expenditures, including ad hoc transfers, could strengthen accountability and maximize return
on government investments and reduce inefficient spending.

14.      Options to better incentivize performance could also be considered to improve spending
efficiency. In the short term, citizen participation and provider accountability could be improved
through (a) the publication of summarized budget information and dissemination of this information on
platforms that are easily accessible by the public and (b) the publication and promotion of key state
performance indicators to create more awareness and scrutiny among citizens and competition among
the SGs.6 Improving publicly available data on inputs, outputs, and outcomes across the governments
will also support the future analysis and design of policies. In the medium term, broader options to
incentivize outcomes, such as output-based targeted transfers where a separate portion of resources may
be held back and distributed only when key performance indicators are met, could be considered. In the
social sectors, performance indicators could focus on access to services, for example, enrolments in
schools and access to preventive and promotive health services. This will not only provide an incentive
for governments to improve their performance and monitoring but also provide an indicator that is
visible to the wider public for scrutiny.

15.      Finally, infrastructure projects could be better prioritized to maximize return and sustain
medium term growth. The FSM has invested a large amount of resources in infrastructure in the last
7–8 years and despite recent declines, public capital spending overall has been much higher in the FSM
than its Pacific Island peers. The composition of infrastructure investment was largely in line with the
priorities of the Infrastructure Development Plan (IDP). Going forward, the arrangements of the
Compact may have serious implications for capital spending after 2024. More specifically, since public
investment is a discretionary form of spending, it is more sensitive to cuts than recurrent expenditure
when government is confronted with a fiscal gap. A balanced approach is therefore recommended in
the short to medium term with a more realistic pace of infrastructure spending and in-parallel fixing of
current weaknesses in the public investment management (PIM) system. More specifically, the GoFSM
could undertake a more robust needs analysis for sectors and states to strengthen infrastructure project
screening criteria and its prioritization approach.7 This will help maximize return on investment and
smooth economic cycles and support sustained growth.

5
  Recent audit reports suggest that improving pharmaceutical procurement practices could result in savings equivalent to
around 1 percent of spending without adversely affecting service delivery.
6 The GoFSM has already begun to implement recommendation part (a) through the dissemination of annual fiscal and

economic updates through the DoFA website.
7 The GoFSM could consider adopting a needs-based mechanism for allocation of capital spending for infrastructure projects.

In particular, a sound approach and capacity for robust project appraisal are critical for allocative efficiency improvement. In

                                                               7
Equitable Resource Allocation

 Desired Impact                Short-term Action                               Medium- to Long-term Action
 Move toward a needs-based     Review division of                              The GoFSM undertakes a review of the
 approach to resource          responsibilities (clarify areas of              transfer formulae, in consultation with
 allocation across all sectors overlaps and gaps) through the                  the USDOI, including options for

 government policies.          FUNDWARE across the states.                     education GFS.
Note: GFS = Government finance statistics.

16.       The current transfer system and institutions may be encouraging a supply-driven service
delivery model that does not adequately address imbalances and leads to inefficiencies. As noted
earlier, there are large differences in development outcomes across the states and sectors, which may
be attributable to differences in resource availability, geography, system quality, and so on.
Furthermore, expenditure allocation is currently interlinked with Compact grant allocation and national
priorities. However, the current revenue sharing arrangement, while being very simple and transparent,
does not take into account the differences in the fiscal capacity across states. For example, one SG may
be able to raise more revenues from their own sources due to factors such as differences in population,
wealth, and so on. Therefore, the current system does not adequately correct for different vertical
imbalances across the states. Furthermore, the analysis of economic performance, development
outcomes, and efficiency issues across sectors highlights the different challenges faced by each of the
states as well as potentially unmet horizontal imbalances. Efforts to address this may however be
constrained by the reliance on CSGs, which are allocated across the states based on a relatively static,
largely population-based formula and prioritized for specific sectors. This may also be inadvertently
contributing to a supply-driven service delivery model, leading to inefficiencies. Across the education
sector for example, an index of relative cost to graduate a student in year 12 is computed and highlights
different needs and efficiency issues across states. Relative to Kosrae (the most efficient state according
to the index), it costs around 190 percent more to graduate a student in Chuuk, followed closely by Yap
(170 percent more) and Pohnpei (50 percent more). Weaknesses in the public financial management
(PFM) system and limited transparency, accountability, and incentives may also be exacerbating the
challenge of allocating resources efficiently and equitably.

17.      To better meet different development needs across the country, resource allocation could
be strengthened through a review of the various distribution formulae. The GoFSM could
undertake a review of the distribution formulae for the CSGsand, in consultation with the USDOI, FSM
may wish to consider a review of the CSG guidelines. The goal would be to move to a more flexible
needs-based approach, in turn ensuring allocative efficiency. For example, in other countries, the
transfer formula is often designed to take into account population (size of service delivery needs), the
proportion of the population in poverty (which will need additional resources), GDP per capita
(wealthier states should be able to raise more own resources), dispersion (which will cost more to deliver
services), and tax effort (to remove distortionary incentives). The transfer formula is then typically
embedded in a medium-term fiscal framework and adjusted periodically based on performance.

18.     Planning and budget execution could be improved to support budget effectiveness and
government policies. To improve the credibility of the budget and fiscal discipline, the GoFSM could
consider strengthening the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) in the short term,

the long term, the strategic focus of the identification or prioritization of infrastructure projects can also be improved with
advice from independent experts and active participation of the concerned stakeholders, especially the private sector.

                                                              8
including further unifying the chart of accounts across the states, mapping the chart of accounts to the
GFS, including in the health and educations sectors,8 and linking the systems across the GoFSM to
improve oversight and budget execution. These will in turn help reduce the large number of
supplemental appropriations and ensure that the budget is an effective tool for implementing
government policies. Improving coordination, planning, budgeting, and reviewing transfer mechanisms
will in the long term provide confidence that future CTF income will be allocated efficiently and
potentially support the FSM to transition toward a more autonomous resource allocation decision
framework.

19.      Return on investment is low in the social sectors and spending effectiveness could be
improved to enhance long-term economic development. Public expenditure on health and education
is high in the FSM, in comparison with peer island states and has remained steady. While access is
moderate, school enrolments have not translated into learning, with a very large share of children unable
to meet national learning standards. The return on education investments is thus low. Similarly, in the
health sector, performance on public health and child and maternal mortality outcomes, relative to that
of its peers, indicates a low return on its health investments. In addition, payments into the health system
and contributions to publicly funded insurance schemes are also low. The large differences in health
and education per capita spending across states are also striking, with the smaller states of Yap and
Kosrae spending significantly more than the other two. These may be related to the supply-driven,
input-based approach to service delivery and, together with the weak outcome indicators in some
pockets, suggest the need to investigate how best to organize service delivery in these sectors.
Furthermore, state and local authorities responsible for the organization and management of service
delivery provide limited reporting on performance and the use of resources, and there is very limited
concept of paying for performance. The anticipated decline in financial resources for the social sectors,
implied by the 2023 expiration of CSGs, which finance the bulk of spending needs, underscores the
importance of improving value from current investments.

20.    To this end, the GoFSM should evaluate how best to organize service delivery to meet the
needs of the population. While being cognizant of the different geography and capacity across the


8In the health and education sectors, a full GFS will show expenditures by function and further disaggregate these by economic
classification. Functional classification for health in a complete GFS includes medical products, appliances, and equipment;
outpatient services; hospital services; public health services; and health research and development. For education, the
classifications are preprimary and primary, secondary, postsecondary non-tertiary, and tertiary education, as well as education
not definable by level, subsidiary services to education, education research, and development. Economic cross-classifications
are compensation of employees, consumption of fixed capital, interest, and social benefits. If developing a full GFS is not
feasible, one step forward will be to collect data on functional classifications and then build the system in a phased approach.

                                                               9
states, the GoFSM should evaluate the current service delivery organization model of closely placing
facilities to beneficiaries. Especially in light of depopulation in some states, weak performance of
remote schools and the tendency for citizens to bypass nonhospital facilities that are close by in favor
of hospitals. A needs-based resource allocation model should then follow service delivery needs. This
will also help clarify whether the large share of resources currently earmarked for administrative
activities—resources that do not go directly to schools or specific health facilities or programs —is
needed. If not, this expenditure could be rationalized or reoriented to improve sector outcomes.

21.      The GoFSM could holistically strengthen education system quality and accountability.
The regressivity of current education spending reflects the population of out-of-school children who
primarily come from the lowest consumption households. Further work is needed to understand what
keeps these children out of school and confirm whether indirect and opportunity costs of education pose
a significant constraint. In secondary education, enrolments could be improved, first through improved
learning at the primary level, to motivate and enable children to stay in the system after completing
primary school. Possible steps toward improving this9 could include, in the short term, a diagnosis of
learning needs through implementation of early grade learning assessments and classroom observations,
which will inform teacher training and skill building. Strengthening provider accountability in the
medium term will require building the capacity of schools to plan and implement the key responsibilities
of identifying priorities to support learning needs and managing and targeting resources accordingly.
This could be followed by enhanced autonomy to allow for school-level decision making. The success
of such school-based management also requires improved availability of information and creation of
mechanisms for participation of parents and other stakeholders at the school level. Second, to the extent
that secondary schooling is seen as a means to access higher education and better-paid jobs, secondary
school enrolments are unlikely to improve unless returns to schooling are perceived to rise, which
highlights the importance of aligning secondary education with economic opportunities and needs for
skills.

22.      In the health sector, the GoFSM should focus on strengthening primary and preventative
health care. In the health sector, a possible first step is improved provision of public health services to
address issues such as low reported immunization rates (in Chuuk in particular) and maternal and child
care services. In the medium term, localization of preventive and promotive health services may also
improve the quality of public health services, but costs and benefits need careful examination in relation
to local capacity in each state. Tobacco and alcohol taxation will also help control chronic disease risk
factors in the FSM, thereby reducing the cost burden of the sector. In the long term, the GoFSM should
also explore options for more sustainable and equitable health financing mechanisms. Improving social
sector outcomes and building human capital will support the FSM in long-term economic development.

23.      Going forward, more specific design option papers, such as on intergovernmental
transfers, could be prepared if there is interest and demand from the authorities. As opposed to
being a simple choice among a list of possible modalities, reforming any governmental system is an
intricate process that must fully consider the country context in its design, including the political
economy context, fiscal positions, and technical capacity at the various levels of government. Rather
than providing a full analysis of the potential modalities, this PER seeks to present a brief overview of
some of the options for strengthening the FSM’s fiscal framework as a basis for launching dialogue
among all stakeholders, including development partners.




9Improving the quality and accountability of the systems that currently affect more than 90 percent of the children at both
primary and secondary levels could lead to improvements in quality of education and in turn address the enrolment and equity
challenges, as people respond to higher private returns to (higher quality) schooling by coming into the system.

I.      Macroeconomic and Fiscal Trends

1.1     Introduction

1.      This first chapter analyzes macroeconomic and fiscal trends to assess the overall fiscal
policy direction and identify any emerging challenges. In the context of declining Compact Sector
Grants (CSGs) since FY2004 and the scheduled end to Compact grants, which may not be fully replaced
by the Compact Trust Fund (CTF) income, this chapter provides an overview of recent macroeconomic
and fiscal developments and sustainability. More specifically, this chapter aims to document recent
revenue and expenditure trends. Both functional and economic composition of expenditure have been
analyzed across time and compared to stated policy objectives to ascertain allocative efficiency.
Economic composition of expenditure has been analyzed across time with a focus on recurrent versus
nonrecurrent expenditure and wage versus nonwage expenditure. Benchmarking has been conducted
where possible to provide the government with information on fiscal indicators of its peers. The
objective of this chapter is to assess the overall fiscal policy direction and identify any emerging
challenges as well as areas of potential reforms that could support the GoFSM in strengthening its long-
term fiscal sustainability.

2.       The quantitative analysis relies on data from the Office of Statistics, Budget, Overseas
Development Assistance, and Compact Management (SBOC) and the audit reports and is
constrained by data limitations. Without a fully uniform chart of accounts across the states and the
chart of accounts not mapping to the international GFS standards, the analysis relied on annual
economic review data generated by the SBOC with technical assistance (TA) from the Graduate School
USA and annual audits compiled by the National Audit Office, limiting the accuracy and comparability
of the analysis. There may be inconsistencies in the data recorded by the government compared to the
data recorded by the USDOI and Graduate School USA, which may also hamper the accuracy of the
analysis. Notably, the SBOC was restructured into separate departments in 2015, with statistics now
reporting to the Department of resources and development, budget now reporting to the Department of
finance and administration, and overseas development assistance and compact management reporting
to the president’s office.

1.2     Recent Economic Performance

3.      Between FY2009 and FY2014, the economy contracted by an average of 0.2 percent and
growth acceleration and deceleration were largely influenced by the implementation of the
airport upgrade project and the CIG. While the international economic conditions remained adverse
in FY2009, a surge in construction and the airport renovation funded by the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) resulted in a return to positive growth in the economy. Growth continued in
FY2010 as a result of further injection of funds from the FAA projects and a pickup in CIG use. After
several years of fiscal consolidation, public administration also returned to a period of growth in
FY2010 and the economy expanded by 3.2 percent overall. These trends continued to exert themselves
in FY2011, although good performance in fisheries replaced public administration as a source of
growth. With the windup of the FAA stimulus, the economy remained flat in FY2012 and contracted
by 3.4 percent in FY2013, the worst economic performance in the past decade. This trend continued in
FY2014 due to challenges in the implementation of the CIG.

4.       The main sectors that drove growth between FY2009 and FY2014 are fisheries and
construction. Value added from fisheries (domestic fleet) grew between FY2010 and FY2012. ,
reflecting the increased value of fish caught. However, FY2013, due to fishing vessels having to
undergo repairs, the value added from this source declined significantly before recovering in FY2014.
Construction growth experienced between FY2009 and FY2011 was largely tied to the FAA project,

                                                  11
which also saw a lagged effect on the retail and wholesale sectors. As the project began winding up in
FY2012, these sectors also contracted.

5.      Contribution to growth by institutional sectors suggests that private enterprises relied on
the public sector for growth opportunities and households tend to fall back to subsistence when
growth slows. The public sector (including public enterprises) constitutes around 40 percent of GDP
and growth contribution was flat between FY2009 and FY2014. Private enterprises contribute around
20 percent of GDP, and private enterprise growth coincided with the public investment cycle,
suggesting that private enterprises relied on the public sector for growth opportunities. Interestingly,
households' contribution to GDP (at around 30 percent) and growth were countercyclical to private
sector activities, indicating that they fall back on own resources or subsistence when the private sector
contracts. Structural issues such as high transportation costs, internal dispersion, and lack of economies
of scale may be binding constraints to economic growth and may in turn limit tax potential under the
current setup.

1.3               Fiscal Trends

7.      Fiscal trends in the past decade have been characterized by general expenditure restraints
and increasing revenues. In the past decade, recurrent revenues have generally seen an upward trend
in both nominal and real terms. Tax revenues rose on the back of higher corporate taxes collected
through the captive insurance industry. Nontax revenues have also risen since 2010 on the back of
increasing fishing license fees, contributing to the overall increase in recurrent revenue. Recurrent
expenditure generally stayed flat in nominal terms between FY2004 and FY2014, declining in real
terms. This is partly explained by the fact that a significant portion of recurrent expenditure is funded
through the CSG, which has also declined in real terms. With capital expenditure largely funded through
the Compact Infrastructure Grants (CIG), the recurrent surpluses achieved have translated to overall
surpluses in recent years.

8.       The composition of expenditure has been stable since FY2009. Around three-quarters of the
budget is recurrent expenditure, with the remaining quarter spent on capital projects. Recurrent
expenditure tends to be rigid, with around 60 percent used to fund wages and salaries (including
professional and contractual services). A further 30 percent of recurrent expenditure is used to purchase
goods and services, with the remaining funding transfers and other expenditures. The capital budget is
dominated by Compact and donor-funded projects. Grants (mostly Compact) financed an average of
around 60 percent of the budget between FY2009 and FY2014, with domestic revenues funding the
remainder of the budget. The capital budget is almost entirely funded by the CIG, which declined
significantly in FY2013 and FY2014 due to factors including the absence of an updated Infrastructure
Development Plan (IDP), among others.

9.      The composition of revenue has shifted significantly since FY2009 toward revenue sources
vulnerable to external shocks. Excluding US$20 million one-off captive insurance revenues derived
through the Micronesian Registration Advisors (MRA) in FY2014, tax revenues have remained steady,
averaging around 19 percent of total revenues.10 Nontax revenues, including fishing license fees,11

10 For this analysis, one-off corporate taxes derived through the captive insurance scheme in FY2014 are not included in the
analysis of recurrent revenue trends, given their one-off nature, which distorts the overall picture.
11 The FSM is a member of the parties to the Nauru Agreement and receives license fees for vessel days sold to distant water

fishing nations. The eight parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) and Tokelau, in recent years have initiated a more strategic
management of tuna resources with higher economic returns for member countries through the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS).
The VDS limits purse seine fishing access to the waters of the PNA members and allows transferability and greater flexibility
in access terms. Under the scheme, the member countries set the total catch limit needed to maintain a healthy fish stock and
translate that catch into individual vessel fishing days which are allocated to member countries by the PNA Office based on
an agreed formula, the countries then sell the days. As a result of the introduction of the VDS and subsequently a minimum

increased from around 15 percent of total revenues in FY2009 to over 30 percent of total revenues in
FY2014. Grants remain the largest sources of revenue although dependence on grants has declined in
recent years—grants to total revenues fell from around 68 percent in FY2009 to 50 percent in FY2014.

10.      The resulting fiscal surplus has been largely put away into the FSM Trust Fund (TF)
although debt servicing continues to rise in parallel. The government has acted prudently in saving
recent surpluses and has built up the balance of the FSM TF to around US$60 million by end-2014. In
parallel, total debt outstanding and debt servicing have also continued to increase owing to new loans
contracted largely for infrastructure purposes and expiration of grace periods on existing loans. While
the current debt stock is moderate relative to GDP, the government has in parallel accumulated about
US$120 million in the unused CIG. This would suggest an opportunity to better coordinate funding to
priority projects to minimize cost and meet its service delivery obligation.

Revenue Trends

11.      With structural issues affecting tax potential, the FSM receives a small and declining
portion of revenues from taxes collected. Tax revenues (excluding the one-off MRA receipt in
FY2014 from the initial public offering of Alibaba) remained flat at around 12 percent of GDP in the
past five years to FY2014. Corporate taxes collected mainly through the captive insurance industry, 12
account for an increasing proportion of tax revenues—16 percent in FY2014. Without this, taxes
collected would have declined as a share of GDP. In FY2014, trade taxes accounted for 21 percent of
tax revenue, wage and salary taxes accounted for 21 percent of tax revenue, and the sales and turnover
taxes accounted for over 40 percent of tax revenues, providing the main sources of tax revenue.




benchmark price, access fees are estimated to have increased by at least a multiple of four between 2009 and 2015 this has
resulted in FSM experiencing. a structural increase in fishing revenues..
12 With the introduction of the captive insurance industry, which began operating in the FSM in FY2009, receipts from the

MRA have increased significantly, and collections through the MRA rose to around US$27 million in FY2014 on the back of
a one-off payment. Tax on the MRA and fishing license fees are kept by the NG and not shared with the states.

12.     Figure 11 indicates the FSM’s relatively weak tax effort in comparison to its neighbors,
which the GoFSM recognized as an issue. Relative to the size of the economy, the FSM collects
around half of the taxes that other neighboring economies (including those much smaller in size) collect.
Recognizing this as an issue in light of the 2023 transition and longer-term fiscal sustainability, the
GoFSM attempted to undertake reforms, including the introduction of the value added tax (VAT) to
broaden and improve the progressiveness of the tax base.13 However, these reforms failed in obtaining
the required passage of the relevant legislation by all states and have been repealed. Other alternatives
to enhance tax collection could be made through a combination of strengthening tax administration,
compliance, and/or increasing rates that will support sustained or improved service delivery, in light of
declining CSGs and limited growth prospects. Further details on potential measures to improve the tax
system can be found in annex 1.

13.     The FSM’s tax rates for both income and trade are low in comparison to other PICs. The
income tax rate is 6 or 12 percent depending on income levels, with a tax-free threshold of US$5,000.
Gross revenue tax is US$80 on the first US$10,000 and 3 percent thereafter and applied across all
businesses although there has been a recent change to exempt some inputs (business wages and salaries
and social security contribution). Figure 13 shows that the top income bracket for the FSM is among

   Earlier analysis by the IMF suggested that reforms to broaden the tax base and improve compliance could increase
collections by 4 percent of GDP, which will bring the FSM’s tax efforts much closer to its neighbors.

the lowest in the region. Import tariffs are relatively low with five bands (3, 4, 25, 30, and 50 percent).
Few import items are subject to high rates of import duty (25–50 percent). The rates for food products
and general merchandise are 3 and 4 percent, respectively. The average applied tariff rate is around half
that of its regional peers. Tax on tobacco is set at US$0.005 per cigarette, while liquor tax is set between
25 percent and 30 percent. Figure 65 highlights that the FSM receives very little in the form of taxes on
tobacco.

14.      The 2014 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report for the
National Government (NG) only suggested some potential weaknesses in the FSM’s overall tax
administration system. The FSM operates a relatively simple domestic tax system. However, there do
not appear to be any regulations supporting the relevant laws, and the absence of regulations affects the
clarity of procedures. The quality and transparency of tax collection vary across the GoFSM. Tax
administration is also hindered by overlapping jurisdiction of national, state, and municipal laws and
collection bodies. The 2014 PEFA report for the NG noted that ineffective incentives exist for ensuring
voluntary compliance with tax registration and declarations, and there are weaknesses in risk assessment
for both tax and customs and limited capacities for undertaking comprehensive tax audits. There are no
systematic tax awareness and education campaigns, and tax information is not available in other
languages. Uncollected arrears are high, amounting to US$18 million outstanding, while the average
collection ratio is low. Finally, there are no independent processes for appealing tax decisions.

15.      The PEFA report for the NG also identified areas that the main tax administration office
could strengthen. The Customs and Tax Administration Division (CTA) of the NG is responsible for
the collection of all shared revenues and national revenues and has field offices in each state. Local
taxes are collected by each state’s tax departments. All taxpayers of direct and indirect taxes
administered by the CTA are supposed to register with one of the CTA’s field offices, where their
details are entered into the tax roll. Each field office maintains its own tax roll in a manual system
(spreadsheet), and there are no systemic links between the information in the field offices and no
systematic sharing of information between the business (gross revenue tax) and personal income taxes
managed by the CTA and the wage-based social security taxes collected by the Social Security
Administration. The CTA field offices are mandated to ensure that they are maintaining a complete list
of businesses for identifying, detecting, and correcting the nonpayment of taxes that are due. However,
there are no systematic checks in place to ensure that all relevant taxpayers are on the tax roll. There
are no direct linkages with any government business registration databases and no systematic indirect
reconciliation mechanisms, such as checks of local newspapers, to identify unregistered potential
taxpayers to supplement taxpayer registration system controls. A performance audit on the CTA also

                                                    17
 found that the tax rolls were incomplete and that the CTA does not actively identify new taxpayers but
 instead uses a listing of taxpayers who made payments the prior year. It also found that no other
 procedures were undertaken to identify new taxpayers who are not filing returns.

 Expenditure Trends

 16.      Recurrent expenditure as a share of GDP remained steady at about 46 percent of GDP
 between FY2009 and FY2014. The share of recurrent expenditure funded through grants continues to
 decline, falling from 64 percent in FY2009 to under 50 percent in FY2014. The large share of recurrent
 expenditures, funded through CSGs that are declining, influenced the relatively level trend in recurrent
 expenditures. Wages (including professional and contractual services), which account for 60 percent of
 recurrent expenditures, have been contained between 25 and 28 percent of GDP since the beginning of
 the amended Compact, owing to the implementation of employment and wage controls for many
 years.14 Purchase of goods and services, which accounts for a further one-third of recurrent
 expenditures, has remained largely unchanged at around 15 percent of GDP. Other expenses, including
 subsidies and transfers, have however increased slightly over recent years. Recurrent expenditure is
 high as a share of GDP, compared to its neighbors.

 17.     The proportion of resources devoted to wages is high. The wage bill accounted for 56 percent
 of recurrent spending in FY2014 or 25 percent of GDP. Although the wage bill has remained flat in

 14   Inclusion of professional and contractual services, due to data limitations, may inadvertently result in inaccuracies.

nominal terms and declined as a share of GDP, it continues to consume a significant proportion of
resources.15 However, compared to Tonga, for example, which has a similar population size, the amount
of public resources devoted to wages is half that of the resources devoted to wages for the FSM. This
may be interlinked with the duplication of some functions across the GoFSM given the institutional and
governance arrangements and the geographical dispersion of the country. Partial information suggests
that of the amount spent on wages and salaries in FY2014, around 20 percent was spent in the education
sector and 15 percent in the health sector. In addition, of the total employees from the NG, SGs,
municipals, and government agencies, around one-third are employed by the education sector and a
further one-sixth by the health sector with the remainder in public administration and other areas.16 The
relatively high proportion of resources devoted to wages enhances inefficiency of service delivery.

18.     Despite the relatively high proportion of resources devoted to wages, later chapters show
that performance of the public sector remains modest, and outcomes in key sectors are weak. This
makes improving the performance of the public sector and containing or possibly reducing wage bill
expenditures in real terms a concern to the government.

19.      In addition, the manual payroll system takes up a significant portion of public servants’
time to administer and results in inadvertent leakages. Based on interviews undertaken with
authorities, the use of a manual payroll and human resource management system absorbed a significant
portion of public servants’ time on tasks such as signing off pay slips. The 2012 performance audit also
found weakness in the integrity of the payroll system, particularly in payroll records management and
controls, which resulted in significant overpayments to active employees for hours not authorized and
not requested and wrongful payment to terminated employees. These payments were also not detected
or corrected by the relevant departments. Automation of human resource and payroll information
systems could support improved oversight and control of the public sector wage bill and reduced
unproductive use of public servants’ time.

20.    A comprehensive review of public administration could help identify avenues to help
bring the size of the wage bill more in line with its regional peers and improve public service

15
   As is the case in many small fragile states, high unemployment rates and the scarcity of private sector jobs place pressure
on the public sector to absorb excess labor. This reality, combined with the political economy setting, often results in jobs
being framed as rent (World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Public Sectors in the Pacific Islands (WPS7102) Horsecroft
2014 and contributes to the large share of resources devoted to wages.
16 As noted in various sections of the document, data issues constrained more in-depth analysis, including those on the public

sector, for example, unclassified expenditures in the health sector.

                                                                19
performance. From a wage bill management perspective, the institutional structure results in
fragmentation of payroll policies across the states and for different functions. A public administration
review, including size, function, and human resource management, will help identify potential areas of
inefficiency. The analysis of the 2014 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) shows, for
example, that public sector employees across all states earn more than the private sector. In fact, NG
employees located in the states earn around double that of SG employees and four times more than
private sector employees, and they are typically ranked among the top 20 percent income group.
Another issue in civil service management is overlapping job grading and payment structures for a
relatively small public service (33 grades and pay levels in addition to those employed on higher salaries
under special service contracts17) without clearly distinguished job grading differentials. These may
suggest potential misalignment in pay levels, which could be better anchored to living standards and
required skills. In addition, under the freeze of the nominal wage, most heads of government units have
stopped performance evaluation of their staff because there is no way to reward good performers. A
revitalized uniform performance evaluation system that fairly awards good performers and removes
nonperformers could support improved public service delivery.18

21.      Despite flat growth in spending on the purchase of goods and services, the expenditures
on medical supplies continued to increase. Purchase of goods and services accounted for around 30
percent of recurrent spending in FY2014 or around 15 percent of GDP. Despite the level trend of
spending on goods, the cost of medical supplies continued to increase while sporadic shortages of
medicines continued. Performance audits in 2014 and 2015 highlighted, for example, weaknesses in the
procurement process for pharmaceutical and medical supplies, which did not allow for the receipt of
quality goods on time and at the lowest costs. It also found weaknesses in contract implementation and
inventory controls. Overall, this would suggest the need for greater consideration on how to improve
the value for money, that is, make the existing dollar stretch further, in procurement of medical supplies
and inventory management process to improve the efficiency of the system and service delivery.

22.     Other recurrent expenditures, including government transfers, rose by 25 percent
between FY2009 and FY2014. Other expenditures accounted for around 10 percent of total recurrent
expenditures or around 5 percent of GDP. Expenditures under this category include, among others,
subsidies to the social security, payment to nonpublic schools, contributions to the passport revolving
fund, Micronesian Longline Fishing Company loan repayment, and scholarship grants. Given that the
FMIS is not mapped with the GFS codes and cannot be aggregated, the actual trend on these
expenditures may be obscured. Improving transparency of these expenditures will ensure accountability
and maximize return on government investments.

1.4      Sectoral Resource Allocation

23.      Total expenditure has declined in real terms, driven by declines in social and economic
and infrastructure spending. Total social sector spending declined by around 2 percent per year in
real terms between FY2009 and FY2014. Given that over 80 percent of spending in these sectors is
funded by CSGs, this is largely a reflection of the decline of CSGs in real terms. Total economic and
infrastructure spending declined by around 6 percent per year during this period, reflecting the decline
in the use of the CIG. On the other hand, total spending on justice, finance and administration, and other
sectors grew by between 1.5 percent and 2 percent per year during this period. Compared with the
composition of expenditures in Samoa (a strong economic performer in the region), total spending on

17 Nominal wage was frozen as an expenditure control policy in the past years. Special service contracts were introduced to
mobilize skilled workers without violating the nominal wage freeze.
18 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing TA support to undertake a functional review of government units,

strengthen corporate planning and linkage to resource allocation, revitalize performance management and streamline pay
structure, and integrate special service contract and exempt positions into the public service system.

social sectors and administration was higher in the FSM while total spending on economic and
infrastructure sectors was lower in more recent years (more detailed analysis on capital expenditure can
be found in chapter 3).

                         Box 2. Six-Part Strategy for Transition and Accelerated Growth
 1.     Macroeconomic stability. Maintaining fiscal stability and responsibility through the initial transition
        period of the amended Compact; maintaining essential public services and protecting the public
        investment program; and implementing tax reform in support of the growth strategy
 2.     Good governance. Improving effectiveness and efficiency of the government; protecting essential
        services through the transition; improving public sector management; enhancing accountability; and
        ensuring the rule of law and safeguarding property rights
 3.     Developing an outward-oriented, private sector-led economy (competition policy). Improving the
        regulatory regime; promoting domestic and foreign investment; enhancing entrepreneurial skills and
        opportunities; and reducing inefficiencies of the public enterprise sector
 4.     Investing in human resource development. Protecting health expenditure levels and improving health
        outcomes; health financing for the future; protecting education expenditures and improving education
        outcomes; and linking higher education and skills development to the needs of a growing economy
 5.     Investing in infrastructure. Protecting investment levels through the transition; learning from the past
        and targeting critical needs within the growth strategy; and long-term financing of economic
        infrastructure
 6.     Long-term sustainability. Environmental concerns integrated into the growth strategy; social and
        cultural factors protected during the growth strategy; intergenerational equity supported by the CTF

24.      Expenditure allocation is interlinked with Compact grant allocation and national
priorities. The national road map for development is detailed in the FSM Strategic Development Plan
(SDP) 2004–2023. The SDP aims to provide a strategy for transition to the post-2023 period (see Box
2 for details). The SDP is longer in its time horizon and is interwoven with the Compact resource
allocation. Resource or expenditure allocation is in turn based on the SDP and interlinked with sectoral
distribution of CSGs. Although resource allocation tends to be in line with national priorities, the decline
in spending for social sectors and economic and infrastructure sectors is inconsistent with the SDP
priorities. Furthermore, in many other countries, national priorities tend to be updated at regular
intervals to reflect changing circumstances, priorities, and achievements. As the plan has never been
updated, it is not known if the current expenditure allocation is consistent with the latest national
priorities for development.

1.5     Budget Execution

25.      Analysis of the budget is difficult. The following section provides an analysis of budget
execution for the general fund budget, given data limitations on the externally funded budget and its
execution. The FMIS (FUNDWARE) is used across the NG and the SGs. However, the chart of
accounts is not coded according to the GFS and is inconsistent across the states. As a result, it is difficult
to obtain an accurate economic and functional description across the GoFSM or in-year reporting. The
use of the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles system, where unused funds this year are
counted as revenue next year, also clouds the ability for analysis of budget execution and reduces budget
credibility. Congressional capital projects are also not normally appropriated with the budget but
through supplementary appropriations during the year, making a comprehensive analysis of budget
execution difficulty.

26.      The aggregated revenue and expenditure outturn deviate significantly from the original
and final budgets, suggesting weakness in the original budget formulation and supplementary
appropriations. Between FY2009 and FY2014, on average, the actual revenue outturn deviated from
the original budget by 17 percent each year. This is largely due to inaccurate revenue projections
associated with fishing license fees. The expenditure outturn, on the other hand, was tracked closely to
original budget figures, with the average outturn deviating from the original budget by an average of 3
percent each year. Overall trends in both revenue and expenditure execution also suggest scope to
strengthen the planning process underlying the original budget formulation and supplementary
appropriations.

27.     Supplemental appropriations are numerous and not well executed, suggesting the
potential to strengthen this process. Each year, numerous supplemental appropriations are passed. In
FY2013, for example, 11 supplemental appropriations were passed, totaling US$15.9 million or a 22
percent upward adjustment to the original budget. The final budget between FY2009 and FY2014, on
average, deviated from the original budget by around 15 percent. However, the revised budget was
generally not well executed at the aggregate level with, on average, 11 percent difference between the
expenditure outturn and revised budgets. In fact, at the aggregate level, the expenditure outturn tracks
much closer to the original budget. This raises questions about the quality of budget planning—the
linkage to GoFSM policies, transparency, and accountability.

28.    Weaknesses in planning and internal controls have contributed to the large variance in
expenditure composition across departments. The credibility of the budget as a policy document is
undermined when deviations at the department level are large. This is typically a result of

                                                     22
underspending or overspending and the reallocation of resources between ministries or budget
categories within the year causing deviations from planned expenditure allocation and policy direction.
As noted earlier in the chapter, at the line department level, variances in the composition of primary
expenditures across budget heads exceeded 15 percent, with weaknesses in planning and internal
controls being a contributing factor.

1.6         Fiscal Sustainability

29.      The GoFSM has prudently saved recent surpluses; however, the fiscal situation is
expected to tighten in the medium term. Despite budget execution weaknesses identified in the earlier
section, the GoFSM has acted prudently in saving recent surpluses, derived from higher fishing and
reinsurance revenues. The 2014 Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis further projects, in the
baseline, the achievement of overall fiscal surpluses in the medium term. Surpluses are, however,
expected to turn into deficit from FY2024 as a result of the expected cessation of CSGs, which are not
expected to be fully replaced by income earned on TF assets. The resulting fiscal gap will lead to either
an unsustainable debt situation or a reduction in services. This highlights the importance of increasing
fiscal space in the medium term and continued prudence in saving surpluses to buffer against future
shocks, including natural disasters and potential non-communicable disease (NCD)-related upward
pressures on the budget.

30.      Policy makers in small developing states face a key fiscal policy choice —building fiscal
buffers to enhance resilience to shocks versus funding for development spending. When a
government expands fiscal space by accumulating public savings instead of financing spending for
development needs, it foregoes a rate of return on the associated public investment. The opportunity
cost of building fiscal buffers can be used to assess the optimal mix between building fiscal space and
capital spending. Estimates suggest that the opportunity cost of building fiscal buffers is high for the
FSM, given the many development challenges facing the country.19 Econometric analysis by the IMF
also suggests that the effect of public investment on growth is stronger in Asia and Pacific small states,
consistent with their large development needs. However, return on public investment in the FSM has
been low in the past, and increasing capital expenditure through expanding the deficit and increasing
public debt to beyond 30 percent of GDP could negatively affect growth. Unlike many other countries,
the FSM has a backlog and pipeline of CIGs that could be devoted to infrastructure investment. The
GoFSM should aim to ensure the use of the CIG for projects that offer the highest rate of economic and
social return (see chapter 3 for details).

31.      Managing reserve assets with clearly established objectives, governance structure, and
disbursement rules will ensure that these funds are used appropriately to best meet the needs of
the country. In recent years, the government has made an effort to save revenues, such as those from
the captive insurance and fisheries industries, in line with international best practice. However, the 2015
audit on the FSM TF, where recent surpluses have been saved, found weaknesses in its governance.
These include (a) the lack of a board of trustees as required by law; (b) the lack of timely reporting on
the TF status and operating results; (c) the lack of timely reconciliation and proper maintenance of
accounts; and (d) transfers from the general fund to the TF without allotment as required by law. In
addition, it is not clear if the investment strategy is appropriate for the objective of the TF. Finally, a
clearly specified disbursement rule, particularly around how the FSM TF could supplement CTF
disbursement, will be critical to support a smooth 2023 transition. To this end, the GoFSM has already
taken steps to improve select aspects of FSM TF governance through amendment of the FSM TF Act.

1.7     Conclusion

32.      The analysis found that although the GoFSM has been prudent in saving surpluses over
the past several years, the 2023 transition remains a major challenge to achieving long-term
sustainability, and creating fiscal space remains key. More than halfway through the SDP 2004–
2023, the government has made limited progress on the Six-Part Strategy for Transition and Accelerated
Growth. The economy, including the private sector, has contracted. Growth may have been constrained
by structural issues, which also affects domestic revenue potential. Despite this, and weaknesses in
budget execution, the GoFSM has achieved surpluses in recent years on the back of fisheries and
reinsurance revenues. However, fiscal sustainability remains a challenge in light of the 2023 transition,
and creating fiscal space remains critical. To this end, the GoFSM could consider options to improve
collection and management of resources as well as increase the efficiency of public spending. Core
actions and next steps are laid out below and more details are provided in the conclusion.

33.      In light of the 2023 transition challenges, fiscal space could be created through increased
tax effort toward the regional average. Increasing tax collected as a share of GDP may be possible in
the short term through addressing identified tax administration weaknesses, including better
management of the tax roll, to improve compliance. Pilot programs to improve compliance are already
yielding fruit. With average border tax and income tax at around half of what the FSM’s regional peers
collect, a review of the current tax system may be warranted to assess their appropriateness. The review
could guide on broader tax reform strategies, including, for example, the excise tax on tobacco—which
is currently significantly lower than regional peers—and could support the reduction of NCDs and the
burden of health care costs.

34.     This could be complemented by improved resource management. Several weaknesses have
been identified in the governance of the FSM TF, where recent surpluses have been deposited. This
may adversely affect its ability to ensure savings are managed adequately to buttress against future
shocks. As such, continued improvements to FSM TF governance structure, investment policy, and


                                                     24
disbursement rule complementarity with CTF, may be warranted in the medium term to maximize
income earned on these reserve assets and help fill any fiscal gap.

35.      Planning and budgeting could be improved to support greater allocative efficiency of
public spending and ensure that needs are met. Budget execution is difficult to gauge given data
issues; however, aggregated revenue and expenditure outturns deviate significantly from the original
and final budgets, suggesting weakness in the original budget formulation and supplementary
appropriations. The planning process could, for example, be strengthened though embedding the LTFF
into the annual planning and budgeting process across all governments. The numerous supplemental
appropriations, which are not well executed, suggest the potential to strengthen this process in the long
term, so that the budget becomes a more effective tool for policy implementation. Greater allocative
efficiency could also be gained by moving toward a needs-based approach and more coordination
between governments. This, together with options to increase allocative efficiency within key sectors
is discussed in more detail in the following chapters.

36.     Technical efficiency could be improved through strengthened public sector management,
which will also support the creation of fiscal space. In the short term, strengthening the integrity of
the payroll system, including through automation of payroll records management and controls, will
support improved oversight and control of the public sector wage bill and reduce the potential for
leakages. It could also minimize the high administration and unproductive use of public servants’ time
for activities such as signing off pay slips. In the medium term, after a broader review of public
administration, the GoFSM could consider, among others, streamlining payroll policies across the states
and for different functions, which will eliminate potential misalignment in pay levels and a lack of
uniform performance standards and incentive or accountability requirements. This will support
improved effectiveness of the public sector and service delivery in the medium to long term. In addition,
value for money could be improved through strengthened procurement and evaluation practices, as
discussed in detail in later chapters.

II.     Intergovernmental Relationships

2.1     Introduction

37.      A federation which is heavily reliant on Compact transfers, the FSM has a unique
governing structure that further complicates fiscal management. The federation structure presents
challenges for decision making, building consensus, and implementing GoFSM reforms or programs.
With the bulk of service delivery responsibilities resting on the SGs, and largely funded through
Compact transfers, the NG often acts as a conduit amid the policy discussion between the United States
and the SGs. This presents further challenges for decision-making expenditure management. The 2023
transition has prompted many questions among stakeholders on the appropriateness of the current
institutional arrangement and how intergovernmental relationships could be improved to meet
imbalances and promote effective management of public resources.

38.     This chapter aims to evaluate the existing institutional framework and how it can be
improved to promote the effective management of public resources. Weak spending or revenue
decisions coupled with any deficiency of transparency and accountability, which may result from
inadequate institutional arrangement, could lead to inefficient spending and unequal development
across the country. To date, there has been little analysis of institutional arrangements in the FSM or
how they have enabled SGs to effectively, efficiently, and accountably spend money on public services
for development. To this end, this chapter first looks at the current trends in institutional revenue raising,
service delivery responsibilities, and transfer mechanisms to help identify any horizontal or vertical
imbalances. This is followed by an analysis of per capita spending across key sectors and performance
across states to evaluate how efficient governments are in converting resources to outcomes. Finally,
this chapter reviews PFM issues based on available information, which will help identify potential areas
of weakness for transparency and accountability. This analysis aims to highlight some of the
intergovernmental issues facing the FSM. A more detailed options analysis to address these issues
would be the next step, if there is demand from the authorities.

2.1     Institutional Arrangement

39.      The FSM is a voluntary federation of four semiautonomous states, each with its own
executive and legislative bodies and considerable autonomy to manage its domestic affairs. The
FSM consists of 607 islands across four states—from west to east—Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae.
Each of the four states has its own culture and traditions, but there are also common cultural and
economic bonds such as the traditional clan systems. Traditional leaders exercise significant influence
in society, especially at the village level. Although English is the official language, Chuukese,
Kosraean, Pohnpeian, and Yapese are more commonly spoken in each state. The FSM constitution was
ratified in 1978, with the voters of the then trust territories, Ponape, Kusaie, Truk, and Yap Districts,
approving the constitution. The ratification of the constitution by these four districts recognized their
sovereign right to form the FSM and make the FSM constitution the supreme law of the land. Each
state, however, also retained its own constitution, elected legislature, and governor, as well as separate
legislative and judicial systems.

40.      The constitution specifies the three tiers of government and the responsibilities of the
national, state, and local governments. Article V of the constitution states that it does not take away
the role or function of a traditional leader as recognized by custom and tradition or prevent a traditional
leader from being recognized, honored, and given formal or functional roles at any level of government
as may be prescribed by this constitution or by statute. Article VII states that the three levels of
government in the FSM are national, state, and local. A SG is not required to establish a new local
government where none exists on the effective date of the constitution. Article VIII of the constitution

                                                     26
states that a power expressly delegated to the NG, or a power of such an indisputably national character
as to be beyond the power of a SG to control, is a national power. A power not expressly delegated to
the NG or prohibited to the states is also a state power.

41.      Article IX of the constitution clearly specifies the legislative powers of the NG and the
SGs. More specifically, the NG has the responsibility to (a) provide for national defense; (b) ratify
treaties; (c) regulate immigration, emigration, naturalization, and citizenship; (d) impose taxes, duties,
and tariffs based on imports; (e) impose taxes on income; (f) issue and regulate currency; (g) regulate
banking, foreign and interstate commerce, insurance, the issuance and use of commercial paper and
securities, bankruptcy and insolvency, and patents and copyrights; (h) regulate navigation and shipping
except within lagoons, lakes, and rivers; (i) establish usury limits on major loans; (j) provide for a
national postal system; (k) acquire and govern new territories; (l) govern the area set aside as the
national capital; (m) regulate the ownership, exploration, and exploitation of natural resources within
the marine space of the FSM, 12 miles beyond island baselines; (n) establish and regulate a national
public service system; (o) impeach and remove the president, vice president, and justices of the supreme
court; (p) define national crimes and prescribe penalties, having due regard for local custom and
tradition; (q) override a presidential veto by not less than a three-fourth vote of all the state delegations,
each delegation casting one vote; and (r) promote education and health by setting minimum standards,
coordinating state activities relating to foreign assistance, providing training and assistance to the states,
and providing support for postsecondary education programs and projects. On the other hand, the power
to (a) appropriate public funds; (b) borrow money on the public credit; and (c) establish systems of
social security and public welfare may be exercised concurrently by the National Congress and the
states. A power not expressly delegated to the NG or prohibited to the states is a state power.

42.       Article XII sets out the fiscal roles of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of
the NG and provides the basis for the raising of resources and their expenditure. Subordinate to
this, Title 55 of the FSM Code governs most PFM activities in the FSM, including budget procedures,

                                                                27
financial management, revenue raising, Compact procedures, contracting, auditing, TF management,
public projects, and debt. This legislative framework sets out the basic budget and accountability
structures, including (a) the requirement that all revenues and other resources raised or received by the
government be paid into the general fund, out of which only legally approved expenditures can be made;
(b) appropriate oversight by the FSM Congress; and (c) the delegation of responsibility and
accountability for public resources to specified stakeholders. PFM is also largely delegated to the states.
National responsibility for PFM is shared between the Divisions of Overseas Development Assistance
and Compact Management and the DOFA. The fiscal year is from October 1 to September 30.

43.      As detailed in the constitution, almost all administrative (service delivery) functions are
the responsibility of the state and local authorities.20 Most service delivery functions are assigned to
the SG, including health and education, while the NG is mainly responsible for providing policy
coordination, standard setting, and M&E functions. The current expenditure assignments are shown in
Table 6. With regard to national defense, although this is an NG responsibility, the Compact includes
provisions for national defense and is therefore not managed, in practice, by either the NG or the SG.
With regard to infrastructure, priorities for investment are set by the SGs, and in the past decade the NG
was responsible for coordinating financing, procurement, and construction. Once they are complete, the
infrastructure assets are handed over to the SGs for management and maintenance. However, beginning
in 2015, this model has been revised so that responsibilities for construction of the infrastructure assets
will also be handed over to the SGs,

Note: CIGs were managed by the NG up to the end of FY2014. Land taxes are difficult to implement in the FSM
context given traditional clan ownership.

44.    There is a clear division in revenue raising authority between the NG and the SGs.
National taxes—including income tax, gross revenue tax, import duty, fuel tax, and business license
fees—are set by the NG. These taxes are collected by the NG through representative offices in each of

20Although there are three tiers of government, this analysis focuses on the NG and SGs, given the data limitation on local
governments. In this document, the SG is also referred to as local government or local authority.

                                                            28
the states, and these taxes collected are transferred directly to the national Treasury. A fixed proportion
is repatriated to the SG at a later date (Table 6), depending on the location of tax collection. However,
the SGs do not have access to the NG account system and are, therefore, unable to tell the accuracy of
the regular tax transfers. National taxes constitute the bulk of tax revenues collected for the FSM. Local
taxes—including sales tax, excise tax, transaction tax, and fuel surcharge—are set and collected by each
of the SGs. These are collected by the state tax offices and are kept wholly by the SGs.

45.      There is a relatively transparent transfer system between the NG and the SGs. General-
purpose transfers (revenue sharing) are based on a fixed ratio as required by the FSM constitution and
as further determined by law and provide general budget support to the states. As described in Table 6,
revenue-sharing arrangements are based on a transparent fixed ratio. This ratio was increased in 2015
from a 50:50 share to a 70:30 share, with 70 percent of these revenues repatriated to the SG. The caveat
to the increase in the SG share of revenues is that the additional 20 percent revenue shared needs to be
saved in the state TFs to prevent pro-cyclical spending patterns.21 SGs have full authority in determining
the usage of the other 50 percent. In addition, with rising fishing license fees, the NG has allocated, on
an ad hoc basis, US$10 million in FY2015–16 to the SGs for states to spend on infrastructure projects.

46.     States also receive significant transfers from the Compact based on a static allocation
formula. CSGs are routed through the NG; however, their functional use (for example, wages versus
purchase of goods versus transfers) is at the discretion of the SGs, based on consultations with the
USDOI and final allocation decisions of the JEMCO. The recurrent portion of CSGs, totaling 70
percent, are annually allocated for education (33 percent of Compact grants), health (21 percent),
environment (3 percent), private sector development (5 percent), and capacity building (8 percent),
although there are some annual variations in these sub-allocations. The remaining 30 percent of CSGs
are earmarked for capital spending and are also known as the CIG.

47.      In addition to the static sector allocation for CSGs as determined under the Compact,
CSGs are shared across states based on a distribution formula. The distribution formula roughly
shares one-third of CSGs equally across the four states, with the remainder shared based on the
population of the states (there are also other adjustments based on negotiations). The latest Compact
division formula details that Chuuk will receive 42.2 percent of the CSGs (excluding COM and
supplemental education grants), with the remainder going to Pohnpei (28.1 percent), Yap (17.6 percent),
and Kosrae (12.1 percent). This results in the smaller states receiving a relatively large share of the
resources on a per capita basis. In the past, given the country’s federation structure, the GoFSM has had
limited practice in allocating public funds to address income inequality across the four states. Other
sources of grant funds that are awarded for specific projects in specific states (for example, from China
or other external partners) are supposed to be divided equally among the states and the NG in accordance
with the constitutional provision contained in Article XII, Section 1(b).22




21 These is no policy to guide the future usage of these savings nor how these savings could complement the FSM TF in
meeting the 2023 transition.
22 The provision says, “Foreign financial assistance received by the NG shall be deposited in a Foreign Assistance Fund. Except

where a particular distribution is required by the terms or special nature of the assistance, each SG shall receive a share equal
to the share of the NG and to the share of every other SG.”

                                                               29
2.3      Current Trends

                                Box 3. Theory on Intergovernmental Relationships
 A federal system is typically concerned with combining the political and economic advantages of unity while
 preserving the valued identity of subnational units or states. In this context, it is important in exploring and
 making continuous adjustments to the respective roles of different levels of the government and assigning
 responsibilities and fiscal instruments to the proper level of the government. Traditional theory on fiscal
 federalism contends that the NG should have the basic responsibility for macroeconomic stabilization and
 income redistribution in the form of assistance to the poor. The SGs should be responsible for the provision of
 goods and services whose consumption is limited primarily to their own jurisdictions and the allocation of
 resources to provide these services, to better meet state-level needs and preferences. The choice of a system of
 governance involves other values as well, including political objectives, and the system needs to be designed
 with the right incentive and accountability mechanism. While many studies on this topic tilt in favor of more
 localized service delivery, partly due to its ability to avoid inefficiencies of centralized decision making, recent
 literature suggests that more localized service delivery unless carried out under a strong center is also doomed
 to fail. The challenge in the new paradigm is to devise an appropriately structured system that mandates and
 provides incentives for responsible local government fiscal behavior and enables the creation of a climate
 conducive to development. More details can be found in annex 2.

48.      Given that the bulk of service delivery responsibilities lie with the SGs, not surprisingly,
the SGs are responsible for over half of total government spending. SG spending constitutes an
important share of local economies, with SG spending averaging around 40 percent of state GDP over
the past five years. The share of SG spending in total expenditures averaged 51 percent in the five years
to 2014, falling from an average of 62 percent in the previous five-year period. The fall in the SG
spending in total expenditure was largely explained by the pickup in implementation of CIGs, which
up to FY2014 had been the responsibility of the NG. This trend is expected to reverse going forward,
with the return of responsibility for building capital projects to the SGs in FY2015, although there has
been no clear indication of an increase in SG capacity. 23 Recurrent spending by the SG on the other
hand remained steady, averaging 68 percent of total expenditure in the past decade, partly a reflection
of the fixed revenue allocation and grant transfer formulae.

49.      Data on sector composition of SG expenditure show some repetition and gaps in function
areas that the constitution is silent on. From a sector perspective, around 85 percent of all health and
education expenditure and around 80 percent of all expenditure on finance and administration occur at
the SGs. This is as expected given the highly localized nature of these service delivery functions.
However, in these sectors, there are some areas of repetition; for example, each of the SGs and the NG
have separate scholarship boards, medical referral boards, and procurement systems, all of which add
to service delivery cost and reduce the efficiency of public spending. Spending on economic
development has progressively shifted to the NG (from around one-fourth to half of total spending over
the past five years), while the SGs’ share of spending on environment and emergency management has
increased over the past decade to around 60 percent of all spending in this category from a negligible
base five years ago. Despite the constitution being silent on these two functions, spending trends would
suggest these are in fact shared responsibilities.




23The number of people above the age of 25 years with an associate degree (AA/AS) or higher is used as a proxy for capacity.
The 2000 census estimated that 11.7 percent of the relevant population group attained an AA/AS or higher, while the same
ratio fell slightly to 11.6 percent, as estimated in the 2010 census.

50.      Distribution of revenues has moved in favor of the NG, given the recent rise in fishing
license fees and corporate taxes derived from captive insurance. The share of SG revenues in total
revenue averaged 46.3 percent in the five years to FY2014, falling from an average of 60.9 percent in
the previous five years. The fall in the SGs’ share of revenues is largely due to the rise in fishing license

fees24 and increased corporate taxes collected through the captive insurance industry, both of which are
currently NG revenues. The lack of reliance on the national taxes by the NG may result in a disincentive
to raising or even reforming the portion of the tax regime within the purview of the NG. In fact, recent
tax law changes to the national taxes have, in fact, reduced the tax base.

51.      The NG has made efforts to increase the SG’s share of revenues. In FY2014 and FY2015,
the Congress approved measures to (a) increase the state’s share of shared taxes from 50 percent to 70
percent (with the additional 20 percent required to be saved in the state’s TFs); (b) reduce the NG’s
share of the Compact grant from 10 percent to 0 percent; and (c) appropriate US$10 million of surpluses
per year for infrastructure expenditure for states in FY2015 and FY2016. These ad hoc measures do not
provide explicit policy objectives such as meeting existing gaps or improving access to services by the
poor, and there are also some leakages into the recurrent budget. Therefore, it will be difficult to
evaluate their efficacy in the long term.

52.      More fundamentally, the current revenue-sharing system does not correct for vertical
imbalances. While the flat sharing rate of NG revenues (that is, 70 percent to all states) is very simple,
this does not take into account the differences in the fiscal capacity. For example, one SG may be able
to raise more revenues from their own sources due to factors such as differences in population, wealth,
and so on. Therefore, the system does not equally correct for different vertical imbalances across the
states. Such a system should therefore be complemented by either more NG spending in the poorer
states or higher general-purpose transfers to poorer SGs to help correct for horizontal imbalances.

 Types of imbalances. Horizontal fiscal imbalance is measured between the governments at the same level and
 emerges when SGs have different abilities to raise funds from their tax bases and provide services. This may
 arise from differences in the cost of service delivery, potentially due to geographic conditions or differences in
 local economic activities, wealth, or local resources endowments. Vertical imbalances arise when the revenue
 sources assigned to each level of government do not broadly correspond to their assigned expenditure
 responsibilities. One approach to measuring vertical imbalance is to identify the ability of different levels of
 governments to finance expenditures from their own sources of revenues. To meet these imbalances, transfers
 such as those described below can be employed.

 General-purpose transfers. Such transfers are provided as general budget support, with no strings attached.
 These transfers are typically mandated by law. Such transfers simply augment the recipient’s resources and are
 intended to preserve local autonomy and enhance inter-jurisdictional equity.

 Targeted transfers. Such transfers are intended to provide incentives for governments to undertake
 expenditures in specific programs or activities. They are best suited for subsidizing activities considered high
 priority by a higher-level government but low priority by local governments. In their simplest form, they are
 grants for general areas of state expenditures (such as education) with no strings attached, allowing recipients’
 discretion in allocating the funds among specific uses within the sector (block grants). Targeted transfers can
 also specify the type of expenditures that can be financed by presetting shares to expenditure categories such
 as salaries, capital expenditures, or operating expenditures (input-based targeted transfers). Alternatively,
 targeted transfers may be output based by requiring the attainment of certain results in service delivery (output-
 based targeted transfers). Targeted transfers may also incorporate matching provisions, requiring grant
 recipients to finance a specified percentage of expenditures using their own resources. Matching requirements
 encourage greater scrutiny and local ownership of grant-financed expenditures. However, they represent a
 greater burden for a recipient jurisdiction with limited fiscal capacity. More details can be found in annex 3.

 Capitation grants. These grants are resources allocated directly to service delivery units, typically based on a
 per capita financing formula. For schools, the formula is typically based on the number of pupils enrolled and
 is hence directly linked to school enrolments in such a way that enrolment of each additional student results in
 increased funding to the school. For health centers, the size of the grant is typically linked to the size of the
 local population and local demand for health services. The formulae adopted by different countries vary widely,
 but in general, they share the objectives of pursuing equity, efficiency, and transparency in resource allocation.

53.      With local revenues funding a relatively small portion of spending, the SGs rely heavily
on external grants to fund their operations. At the states, local revenue as a share of state GDP
remained low, ranging from 2.9 percent in Pohnpei to 8.3 percent in Yap. As a result, local revenue
raised by the SGs has, on average, funded a mere 12 percent of SG expenditure in the past decade.
National taxes collected by the NG and shared with the SGs, on average, funded an additional 13 percent
of SG expenditure in the past decade. While revenue sharing is a common and simple way of sharing
resources with the SG and may be appropriate in light of capacity limitations, it provides poor incentives
for the local governments to boost collections and improve local economic growth. The remaining
three-quarters of SG expenditure is funded through the Compact and other grants according to the
distribution formula. There are currently no equalization or matching grants to channel funds from
relatively wealthy jurisdictions to poorer ones to ensure or incentivize a consistent level of service
delivery.

54.     Hard budget constraints have generally held across states. The SGs rely heavily on external
grants and have the authority to issue debt. However, in practice, conditions for hard budget constraints
have generally held. This is explained by the SGs having limited access to debt capital markets and
contraction of even concessional debt through the NG, achievement of near balanced budgets at the SG,
and general restraint by the NG from bailing out SGs.

55.      The NG has played a restricted role in ensuring macroeconomic stability, suggesting room
for the NG to enhance its role in policy coordination to ensure macroeconomic stability. One of
the key functions of the NG in a federal structure is to ensure macroeconomic stability. Economic
growth and inflation at the states have been volatile and varied, which may be partly attributable to its
size, remoteness, and other structural issues. Pohnpei is the only state with average positive growth in
the past decade while the other states have all faced sustained economic contractions. Real economic
growth has also been volatile and contingent on external factors. Given the rigidity of the fiscal
framework, the nationally coordinated fiscal policy is only partially able to mitigate the effects of
external shocks such as the global financial crisis and the global food and fuel crises. Although there
are no independent monetary and exchange rate policies, the use of the U.S. dollar may have also
contributed to stability. Coordination of the economic policy by the NG has also been limited and partly
hampered by the lack of timely data. The FSM is also classified as being at high risk of debt distress
according to the IMF, partly due to concerns on the potential inability of CTF income to replace CSGs.
However, the NG has enhanced efforts to increase savings to mitigate future shocks.

NG’s efforts to address this may be constrained by the reliance on CSGs. Analysis of poverty trends
suggests that both poverty and inequality increased between 2005 and 2013. Poverty remains more
prevalent, severe, and deeper in Chuuk and Pohnpei than Yap and Kosrae. The proportion of the
population living below the food poverty line in Chuuk and Pohnpei accounts for 94 percent of the total
extreme poor, and Chuuk alone constitutes 72 percent of the extreme poor of the nation. Poverty has a
high correspondence to the level of education, and it is more significant according to the household
head’s education. Working in the public sector is a definite advantage to moving away from poverty,
but it requires a high level of education for entry. The continued concentration of poverty in Chuuk, for
example, raises the question of whether resources have been appropriately allocated to adjust for the
differential needs across the country. Public spending as a share of state GDP ranged from 20 to 60
percent of GDP in FY2014. There may exist a relationship between the size of SG spending to GDP
and population, poverty rate, and geographic dispersion.25 However, this relationship does not hold as
strongly for the states of Chuuk and Kosrae. Efforts to address horizontal imbalances may be
constrained by heavy reliance on CSGs.

57.     Given the tightening fiscal conditions for SGs, which may already be affecting service
delivery, it is important to look at sector outcomes and expenditure performance across states.
Real expenditure per capita has fallen across the states, some by as much as 30 percent, partly explained
by the contraction of CSGs in real terms and despite a falling population level. Chuuk, the largest and
most scattered state with around half of the FSM’s total population, had the lowest expenditure per


25 This would be expected because (a) in wealthier states, non-state activities are expected to be higher; (b) in larger states,
more economies of scale is expected in service delivery; and (c) in more geographically dispersed states, the cost of public
service provision is expected to be higher. However, with limitations on the number of observations, this relationship is
difficult to prove in a statistically significant manner.

                                                                       35
capita followed by Pohnpei, the second largest state, and then the smaller states of Kosrae and Yap.
Movements in real per capita expenditure in health and education varied across the states, with Chuuk
experiencing a 30 percent increase compared to a 27 percent decline experienced by Pohnpei. This
highlights the difference in needs and issues across the states. With the implementation of the LTFF
beginning in 2014, expenditure per capita for SGs is expected to fall further in the coming years.26 In
this context, understanding how much different states are spending to deliver the same services could
help identify areas of potential efficiency gains. Performance indices reflecting the outputs and
outcomes achieved in key sectors have been computed to analyze differences in spending efficiencies
across the states; however, these will need to be interpreted in the context of local geography and so on.
However, this analysis is constrained by data issues as noted through the report.

58.      Based on available student completion data and expenditure data, an index of relative
cost to graduate a student in grade 12 is computed and highlights different needs and efficiency
issues across states. Based on this index, Kosrae is the most efficient state, with the highest ranking on
the index, while Chuuk is the least efficient state. Compared to Kosrae, in Chuuk it costs around 190
percent more to graduate a student, followed closely by Yap (170 percent more) and Pohnpei (50 percent
more). Some of these disparities may be associated with differences in population density and
geographic disparity. However, one significant disparity in outcomes for Chuuk is the 8th and 12th
grade completion rates, which are at around 30 percent of the total enrolled students. This may be
explained by the relatively low expenditure per student. On the one hand, this may suggest a need to
refocus expenditure toward education in Chuuk, in particular to improve the completion rate, which
would minimize nonproductive investment in education. On the other hand, the low completion rates
in Chuuk may have less to do with public spending than with household-level, demand-side constraints
to accessing schools (see chapter 4). In Yap, cohort completion rates are at around 40 –45 percent.
However, expenditure per student is the highest among the states. This may be explained by the fact
that there are 59 schools for a state of 11,000 people (compared to 8 in Kosrae for a population of around
7,000) and around 300 staff for a student population of around 2,700. Across all governments, limited
sector performance data are collected and/or published.

59.      Similarly, based on available data on the public sector across the states, two performance
indices were computed to provide comparison on the relative size and efficiency of the public
sector in collecting revenues. The first indicator looks at the size of the public sector using the number
of public sector employees (including public enterprises) adjusted for the relative wage differential
between the public sector and the private sector. The indicator suggests that Chuuk had the least
‘bloated’ public sector while Kosrae had the most ‘bloated’ public sector. Interestingly, Yap is the only
state where the pay differential between the public and private sector was 1.5 times while all the other
states had pay differentials exceeding 2.0 times, suggesting some room for better alignment. In addition,
NG employees deployed at the states earned on average 3.5 times to 4.5 times more than those employed
in the private sector, also suggesting room for better alignment (Figure 17). The second index looks at

26The LTFF sets out the objective to reduce expenditure in real terms by 6 percent every 3 years until 2023, in the absence of
effective increases in revenue effort, to reduce dependency on grant financing and further streamline service delivery by SGs.
The LTFF does not extend to the NG.

the relative efficiency in the public sector in collecting local taxes. Yap spends the least on finance and
administration to collect every dollar of local taxes. In comparison, it costs between 100 percent and
200 percent more in the other states to collect every tax dollar, with Kosrae being the most inefficient.
This would suggest the potential for some efficiency gains in finance and administration in Kosrae.
Furthermore, a review of the existing tax policy or reorientation of finance and administration resources
toward tax collection may be warranted across the states to improve tax effort.

60.     Current resource allocation norms may be a contributing factor to the varied
performance across sectors and states. In the past, resource allocation across states and sectors have
tended to be relatively static. While there are no obvious distortions from these allocation decisions, as
demonstrated above and also in the following chapters, the needs and issues of the states differ.
Therefore, the current resource allocation model may inadvertently be resulting in a supply-driven
service delivery model, leading to efficiencies in the system. In addition, while an accountability
framework exists, implementation issues remain a challenge. For example, there are sector-specific
outputs such as improved graduation rates associated with CSGs; however, not achieving these targets
does not tend to have serious implications on future transfers. Furthermore, several reports from the
U.S. Governance and Accountability Office (GAO) have noted the continued lack of reporting on sector
indicators or outcomes.27 Introducing an incentive mechanism may be one avenue to support improved
accountability, development performance, and efficiency.

61.      The passage of numerous supplementary budgets during the year and frequent
reallocations among administrative heads suggest weak budget credibility. The NG and SGs all
operate within balanced budget requirements based on either constitutional or statutory provisions.
However, the definition of a balanced budget is
not restricted to the operations of a single Figure 30. Five-year Divergence between Actual and

the states. Variance in expenditure composition

62.     The 2014 PEFA report for the NG found that budget credibility is undermined by
fragmentation in the planning process and gaps in what is covered as part of the planning and
budgeting process. Despite the preparation of several planning documents in recent years, there are
weak links between these plans and budgets. The long-term development plan, contained in SDP 2004–
2023, has sectoral and/or departmental mission statements, strategic goals, outcomes, activities, and
outputs. Medium-term strategic plans, including those recently developed by the states, have not been


27Although this may be a reflection of a variety of factors, including the thin and limited capacity in SGs and the lack of clarity
around the M&E responsibilities.

                                                                37
fully costed. Other planning documents exist, such as the long-term fiscal planning document. However,
in practice, there are no sector or line department medium-term strategy documents that reflect complete
costings for recurrent and investment expenditures. The fragmentation of planning, implementation,
and M&E responsibilities across departments and between the NG and SGs also hampers their
effectiveness. There also exists a weak linkage between investment budgets and forward expenditure
estimates, including maintenance. Although medium-term estimates are required to be presented in the
budget documents for two forward fiscal years, the figures are typically the same as those for the coming
fiscal year (proposed budget). There also appears to be a relatively limited role for the political level at
both the executive and legislature levels in medium-term and policy-based budgeting. A weak linkage
between development plans and budgets could lead to inefficient resource allocation to achieve the
desired outcomes.

63.      The FSM, given its federation structure and the receipt of funds under the Compact, has
a complex budget process, and its compressed nature may hamper budget credibility. For SGs to
receive CSGs, budget processes begin in April with submissions of authorized state budgets to the NG
by May 15. This is then submitted to the U.S. Office of Insular Affairs (OIA). Upon completion of joint
consultation, the budgets are revised, compiled, and resubmitted to the JEMCO for final approval in
August. Back in the FSM, there are appropriations by the Congress and each of the state legislatures
before October 1. In practice, the budget preparation process for the next fiscal year begins early, soon
after the beginning of the current fiscal year. In the past, line departments have been frequently late in
submitting their detailed budget requests, in part because the calendar gives them only a limited time
from receipt of the full Budget Call to put together a large amount of information and complete their
submissions (sometimes as little as four weeks during the Christmas and New Year period),28 resulting
in delays in the approval and implementation of the budget. On a separate note, given that the
preparation process begins early and there is weak in-year reporting, the governments often do not have
a good sense of fiscal developments in the current year. As a result, past budgets have been based solely
on the previous year’s budget figures. In consultation with USDOI, decompressing the front end of the
budget calendar may support improved budget credibility.

64.     Limitations of the FMIS may in turn be restricting the governments’ ability to improve
aggregate oversight of fiscal risks, monitoring of budget performance, and accountability. The
same FMIS is used across the NG and SGs. However, the chart of accounts is not fully uniform or
mapped to the GFS and as such the data in the FMIS cannot be aggregated automatically to produce
summary data such as total wages spent or total taxes collected by the SGs. It will allow for sharing of
revenue collection data between the NG and SGs on time. Improving the FMIS29 will also enable easy
production of regular in-year reports, tracking and adjusting expenditure as needed. This could also be
the starting point to addressing other reasons for inefficient expenditure management, including
incomplete reconciliation practices; weaknesses in internal controls; the unavailability of key fiscal
information to both parliament and the public; and weaknesses in linking policies, plans, and budgets
and in turn improving transparency and accountability. The GoFSM is working with the Bank to
introduce a new FMIS across the SG and NG. The project is under preparation and the design will draw
on the challenges identified in this analysis and discussions with the SGs and NG.

65.      The budget along with other fiscal information is not generally shared with the public and
its current contents will be difficult for the public to consume. The budget book, despite it being
several hundred pages long, does not provide information on the macroeconomic context, the debt
stock, financial assets, summarized information on revenues and expenditures according to the main
heads of classification (apart from the individual line department summaries), or analysis of the fiscal
implications of new policies. As such it would be a difficult document for the public to consume (even
if it was made public), limiting transparency and participation. Publication and dissemination of
summary information of the budget and other fiscal data could improve transparency, accountability,
and public participation to enhance service delivery. To this end, the GoFSM has begun to publish an
annual economic fiscal and economic update through the DoFA website.

66.      Transparency is also made more difficult by limited channels to access information, for
example, on websites and the lack of a systematic means of disseminating information. In the FSM,
in practice, it is very difficult to get hold of the final GoFSM budget book (containing the final, approved
figures, including supplemental requests) in a print or electronic form. It is not posted on existing
websites, and printed copies are not generally made. The original Appropriation Act is posted on the
Congress website but, in the absence of an index, the act is difficult to find as it involves searching
individually through each of the congressional sessions and, within these sessions, each file. At the
same time, there are numerous supplementary budgets, access to which involves the same process of
searching. Up-to-date reports prepared by the FSM Office of Public Audit are available on the office’s
website, which is easy to navigate. Otherwise, reports from some congressional hearings are available


29An IMF TA has supported the NG in mapping its chart of accounts with the GFS and the rollout of this mapping exercise
should not require significant additional work. A further TA with the information technology service provider to code the
mapped GFS codes into the FMIS will then be needed.

on the Congress website, but accessing the reports requires searching through each congressional
session, which can be time-consuming.

67.      Findings from audit reports, which are published regularly, are not systematically
followed up on. Each year, the Congress appropriates a significant amount of monies from the general
fund to fund public projects and social programs in the four states. Funding for public projects increased
from US$4.2 million in FY2001 to US$6.3 million in FY2013 and is estimated to have increased further
to US$10 million in FY2014 (over 3 percent of GDP). The 2014 Performance Audit on these funds
found that the process for appropriation, allotment, and spending of these public funds was not sufficient
to establish transparency and accountability. Also, certain projects were disbursed without following
the intent of the appropriations or projects and issues, with noncompliance of applicable laws and
regulations. While the government formally responded to the report, no further follow-up actions were
made. Given the tight fiscal conditions and the need for growth impetus, ensuring transparency and
accountability of spending will ensure the best development outcomes for the population.

68.     Budget transparency is a necessary but not sufficient condition to ensuring greater
accountability of authorities. While the legislative framework sets out the basic budget and
accountability structures, the ability of stakeholders to hold the government to account for the
achievement of policy priorities can be constrained by the limited involvement of the cabinet in
reviewing and approving budgetary parameters and by the legislature’s relatively limited focus during
budget discussions on how closely proposed budgetary allocations relate to government policies.
Translating budget transparency into accountability requires participating in the budget process. This
includes participating in highlighting the budget priorities to ensure that the budget reflects not only
local needs and preferences but also participation in M&E. Several studies have in fact shown that
disclosure of financing information in itself will not necessarily lead to more accountability if there are
impediments to citizen participation in the budget (Fukuda-Parr et al. 2011; Khagram et al. 2013).
Participatory budgeting, as a social accountability mechanism, could be an entry point for a potentially
broader governance reform in the country.

2.6     Conclusion

69.      The analysis found that moving toward a needs-based approach to resource allocation
with sound institutions and appropriate incentive mechanisms could support spending efficiency
and development outcomes. Despite the high level of localized service delivery in the FSM, outcomes
remain weak and varied, suggesting areas of potential disconnect in the current institutional setup. In
particular, the current static transfer system, while transparent, may be reviewed and strengthened to
better equalize for different development needs and cost of service delivery across the states. This could
be complemented by appropriately designed incentive mechanisms to improve development outcomes.
A more fundamental step, to enable these initiatives, is to strengthen transparency and accountability,
starting with the FMIS and budget publication. Strengthening intergovernmental relationships and
public expenditure management are important steps for the GoFSM in building the experience and
credibility, which in the long term could support its move toward fiscal independence. Core actions and
next steps are laid out below and more details are provided in the conclusion.

70.      In the short term, clarifying further the division of responsibilities and improved
harmonization and collaboration across the governments could support efficiency gains. While
division of responsibilities is generally clear, some overlaps and gaps remain, which should be clarified
through the relevant legislative and policy bodies. These bodies should seek to clarify the
responsibilities of functions that are currently shared in practice, but not specified in the constitution,
such as economic development and environment and emergency management. These bodies could also
debate the merit of streamlining functions that are replicated across the states. Moreover, across the
various sectors, the FSM will benefit from greater collaboration and coordination between the national
and state departments, with a greater role afforded to the national departments for capacity building,
technical support (including in the area of statistics collection and M&E), and assistance to state
departments, creation and implementation of minimum standards in service provision, and a formal
drafting of national and state-specific sector objectives, with a clear link between inputs, outputs, and
outcomes. Such collaboration will pay due respect to the autonomy conferred upon the states under the
FSM’s constitution. Without such coordination, it is difficult to plan at the aggregate level to ensure
that resources are targeted to where they are needed most.

71.      To meet the emerging fiscal gap, the NG should work with the SGs to improve tax effort.
Incentivizing improved tax effort by the SGs will reduce the SGs’ dependence on CSGs and fiscal gap
in the long term. This could be done in numerous ways but requires further detailed analysis, which is
beyond the scope of this study. Other countries have implemented matching grants, for example, to
incentivize improvements in tax effort by the local governments.


                                    Box 5. Taxation and Decentralization
 Many countries attempt to achieve objectives such as reducing the fiscal gap or inequality through systems
 variously described as ‘tax sharing’ or ‘revenue sharing’. While there are a wide variety of such systems, most
 of them suffer from several common problems. First, if they do not apply to all national taxes but only to a
 subset of such taxes, they may bias the national tax policy. Second, if—as is often the case—they share the
 revenues from origin-based (production) taxes to the jurisdictions from which the revenues are collected, they
 break the desirable link between benefits and costs at the local level and hence reduce accountability and the
 efficiency of tax decentralization. Third, since tax rates in such systems are invariably set by the central
 government and since the sharing rate is often applied uniformly throughout the country, once again the
 accountability link is broken and the local authorities have no incentive to ensure that the amount and pattern
 of their spending are efficient. In the case of Argentina’s system of revenue sharing, structural reforms became

                                                       41
 contingent to additional revenue-sharing arrangements and the revenue-sharing arrangement itself became the
 subject of political dispute.

 To develop adequate revenue sources for service provision, in addition to strengthening tax administration,
 practical options to stimulate tax efforts include (a) allocating a fraction of the grants according to the rate of
 growth of own revenues; hence, remunerating those SGs that exert a larger tax effort than the average (to reduce
 large fluctuations from one year to another, a moving average of the growth rate of own revenues from the past
 3–5 years could be applied; (b) implementing a ‘matching principle’, where revenues collected by the SGs are
 matched by the NG through a co-financing grant, with those smaller or more disperse or poorer SGs receiving
 a higher matching rate, which is periodically reviewed; and (c) introducing complementing capacity grants to
 support states with weaker capacity.

72.      More importantly, the GoFSM could consider a review of the current transfer system
rather than continue with ad hoc revenue-sharing measures. The current transfer system (both
revenue-sharing and distribution formulae) may not be correcting for different imbalances equally, and
the efficacy of the ad hoc revenue-sharing measures is unclear. Therefore, a review of the current
transfer system may be warranted, to evaluate options to equalize resource allocation based on different
development needs and cost of service delivery across the states. In other countries, the transfer formula
is often designed to take into account population (size of service delivery needs), the proportion of the
population in poverty (which will need additional resources), GDP per capita, (wealthier states should
be able to raise more own resources), dispersion (which will cost more to deliver services), and tax
effort (to remove distortionary incentives). The transfer formula is then typically embedded in a
medium-term fiscal framework and adjusted periodically based on performance.

73.      To better meet horizontal imbalances and improve development outcomes, the GoFSM in
consultation with the USDOI may consider a review of the allocation of CSG across sectors. While
there are no obvious distortions with the sector allocation of the Compact grant allocation formula,
regular review of the Compact sector allocations may be warranted to adjust for differential sectoral
needs across the different states and improve outcomes. To further incentivize outcomes, a separate
portion of CSGs may be held back and distributed only when key performance indicators are met
(output-based targeted transfers). This not only provides an incentive for governments to improve their
performance and monitoring but also provides an indicator visible to the wider public for scrutiny. In
parallel, greater TA may be needed to help support capacity building in the long term.

74.      Improving transparency could be a first step toward strengthened local accountability.
Very little information is currently shared in a systematic way with the public, including information
on public finances, making it difficult for citizens to participate in the decision-making process.
Information that is being shared, such as the budget, is also difficult for citizens to absorb. To overcome
these issues, many other countries publish summarized budget information and disseminate this
information on platforms that are easily accessible by the public. In addition, the publication and
promotion of key state performance indicators in other countries formed the basis of additional resource
allocation and created more awareness and scrutiny among citizens and competition among the SGs,
which led to improved service delivery and outcome.

75.     Strengthening the FMIS is also important to ensure implementation of the budget and the
achievement of the stated development objectives. Strengthening the FMIS, including to further unify
the chart of accounts across the states, mapping the chart of accounts to the GFS, and linking the
systems, will enable easy production of regular in-year reports, tracking and adjusting expenditure as
needed and revenue information for planning. This could also be the starting point to address other
reasons for inefficient expenditure management, including weaknesses in internal controls, cash flow

departments.

III.    Public Investment Management

3.1     Introduction

76.      Infrastructure investment is a key pillar underpinning the GoFSM’s strategy for
development; however, its utilization has been weak in the past and the resource envelope is
uncertain going forward. The SDP 2004–2023 aims to achieve self-reliance and sustainability with
open, outward-oriented, and private sector-led development. To this end, infrastructure investment is
expected to play a significant role in achieving the objectives of the SDP. Currently, a very large portion
of all public investments are funded by grants, mostly Compact and U.S. federal grants. However,
implementation of these projects is often slow and full utilization of these funds has not yet been
achieved, resulting in over US$120 million of unused funds remaining in the U.S. Treasury awaiting
implementation. Going forward, the arrangements of the amended Compact may have serious
implications for capital spending after 2024. More specifically, since public investment is a
discretionary form of spending, it is more sensitive to cuts than recurrent expenditure when the
government is confronted with a fiscal gap.

77.     This chapter aims to investigate the effectiveness of resource allocation, identify
bottlenecks to infrastructure investment, and consider how current policies can be improved to
meet the 2023 transition. To analyze allocative and technical efficiency of public investment in the
FSM, this chapter (a) documents the current institutional setup and capital projects put in place since
the amended Compact came into effect; (b) analyzes and benchmarks overall trend, sector and state
composition, source of funding and implementation rate, and growth impact and compares the
composition of actual infrastructure investment with the strategic priorities as outlined in the IDP and
SDP; and (c) documents challenges to public investment management using the Bank’s ‘Diagnostic
Framework for Assessing Public Investment Management’ and taking into account the newly released
IDP 2016–2025. This chapter concludes by providing some recommendations on how current policies
can be strengthened to improve the return on infrastructure investment and ensure adequate policy and
resources in the post-2023 period. Core actions and next steps are laid out below and more details are
provided in the conclusion.

78.      The quantitative analysis of actual performance relies largely on the SBOC project data
set and is notably constrained by data limitations. While data about planned commitments for
individual projects are available, there is little information about the progress of actual disbursements,
intended development outcomes of projects, or whether the completed projects achieve these outcomes.
There are limited data on outputs of infrastructure investment (such as quality and coverage) for
examining the efficiency of the investment process by linking outputs to inputs. The lack of baseline
and regularly collected data, on performance, for example, also prevents a robust analysis of impacts of
infrastructure projects. No database exists for the monitoring of public projects.

3.2     Expenditure Trends

79.     Public Infrastructure Management (PIM) in the FSM was highly centralized until the end
of FY2013, with the Project Management Unit (PMU) managing the bulk of infrastructure
investment implementation. About 90 percent of public capital expenditure was managed by the NG
during FY2009–13, and the share had been relatively stable. On average, each state managed less than
US$2.5 million a year, and Kosrae even managed just 0.5 million. The situation has changed
considerably since FY2014 when the amount of capital spending managed by the SGs increased 2.5
times and about one-third of total capital spending was managed by SGs.




                                                    44
80.      Capital spending managed by the states largely comprises public projects that do not use
Compact funds and are subject to Congress appropriation. Despite its small scale, the overall
spending for public projects has increasingly become a major spending item of the budget. Expenditure
by the National Congress on Public Projects rose from US$6.8 million in FY2013 to US$10 million in
FY2014 as a result of a second appropriation during 2014. Consequently, spending for public projects
exceeded one-quarter of public capital expenditure or accounted for 5.4 percent of total expenditure in
FY2014. More than half of this money was spent on economic and infrastructure projects in the states
while a further 25 percent went to assist with funding of municipalities in the states. SG capital spending
experienced a further boost in 2014 from the allocation of US$10 million of fishing license fee for
infrastructure development.

81.       Detailed project data provided by the SBOC as of June 2014 show that US$116 million of
infrastructure projects were implemented between FY2004 and FY2013, out of US$180 million
committed for this period. There was, however, a de-obligation of almost US$29 million, leaving
actual commitments of just US$151 million in the first decade of the amended Compact. The total
amount that the FSM can receive as agreed in the amended Compact was US$250 million for FY2004–
14. However, only 58 percent of the available Compact resources were committed and the cumulative
grant arrears amounted to more than US$100 million at the end of FY2014. Almost four-fifths of these
actually committed resources were provided by the amended Compact (and the rest came from other
sources such as U.S. Federal Programs, the ADB, and other matching funds). The FSM capital spending
declined significantly in FY2013–14 after a rapid growth period during FY2009–12. Capital spending
contracted by 37 percent in FY2013 and a further 9.6 percent decline was recorded in FY2014. As a
result, the share of capital spending in total government expenditure plummeted from about 30 percent
in FY2009–12 to just 20 percent in FY2014. The decline was largely caused by the suspension of new
infrastructure grants that began in FY2013. The release of new funds was conditioned on the revision
of IDP 2004–2023, which was completed in October 2015. In addition, the FAA-funded projects for
airport improvements drew to a close in FY2013, and this contributed considerably to the 25.9 percent
decline in construction activities in this fiscal year.

82.      Another salient feature of public investment in the FSM is the large degree of fluctuation.
Year-on-year growth rate of capital spending over FY2004–14 varied from −37 percent in FY2013 to
87 percent in FY2009 to 115 percent in FY2007. Part of the fluctuation can be explained by the small
size of capital spending, so the initiation or conclusion of a project can induce a significant proportional
change. Yet with the well-known availability of resources and of the list of approved projects over a
long period, large fluctuations also reveal information about the inadequate quality of planning and
implementation capacity. Stop-go investment policies can lead to negative consequences for the cost,
timeliness, and quality of the resulting infrastructure asset. International experience suggests that the
volatility of investment flows, even when corrected for income levels, is associated with the strength of
PIM institutions (IMF Staff Report, June 2015).

83.     Figure 31 shows a strong short-term correlation between public capital spending and the
performance of the construction sector. This is particularly true for the post-2008 period during
which the growth rates of public capital spending and the GDP of the construction sector do not differ
much from each other. While public capital spending appears to have an instantaneous effect on the
construction sector, the relationship between public capital spending and GDP growth is much less
obvious. Possible causes for any disconnect between public capital spending and growth, as outlined
by some reviews,30 include composition, sequencing, and efficiency of investment. This includes

aspects such as the arbitrage between new investments and maintenance expenditures or resources
allocation across subsectors. The government can choose to allocate public investment in infrastructure
assets (such as roads) that directly influence market production or in assets relevant for human capital
accumulation (such as schools and clinics) that may have a lagged effect on growth. Lack of consistent
and comparable data on infrastructure spending, stocks, and services in developing countries prevents
a robust estimation of this relationship. Moreover, the use of investment flows in developing countries
does not reflect the effective infrastructure stocks and the level of services that they provide. This is
because the official costs of investments in developing countries are often disconnected from their
effective value, mostly due to governmental inefficiencies or institutional weaknesses (see Pritchett
1996, for a more detailed discussion).

84.      Despite the recent decline, FSM public capital spending has been at a much higher level
than that of its Pacific Island peers. During FY2007–12, the average share of FSM public capital
spending in GDP was 15.4 percent, considerably higher than that of other PICs. For FY2013 and
FY2014, the FSM still spent more than 13 percent of its GDP on public investment, notably higher than
its peers, despite the sharp decline in infrastructure investment (Figure 32). However, FSM growth
performance over FY2007–12 was considerably inferior to other Pacific Islands peers. Figure 33 shows
that during FY2007–12, a higher share of public capital spending was associated with higher growth in
these PICs. While Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are separate from the group with high rates of growth,
the FSM was the outlier in the sample with almost no change in GDP despite significant public capital
spending.

85.      The sectoral priorities of FSM capital spending in infrastructure has been guided by the
IDP 2004–2023, which essentially reflects the priorities specified in the Fiscal Procedures
Agreement for the amended Compact. For the CIG, first priority was given to education, health,
water supply, wastewater, and solid waste and second priority to economic-development-related
projects such as roads, airport and seaport improvements, and energy-related projects. According to the
IDP, water supply or wastewater and education sectors have the largest allocation of funds at 19 percent
and 18 percent, respectively. The economic infrastructure in aggregate accounts for about 48 percent of
all infrastructure investments.

86.      Sectoral composition of approved projects indicates that, in reality, economic
infrastructure received the top priority in FY2004–13 instead of being the second priority as
specified in SDP 2004–23. Figure 34 compares the allocation of resources across the sectors as outlined
in the two IDPs and the actual commitments in FY2004–13. Apparently, the share of economic
infrastructure does not differ notably between the three cases. In particular, there is a high degree of
similarity between actual allocation in FY2004–13 and planned allocation in IDP 2016–2025.

Compared to IDP 2004–2023, the other two plans allocate much higher shares for education and health
at the expense of the water supply, wastewater, and solid waste sectors.

87.      Despite this emphasis on economic infrastructure, the FSM economy performed poorly
over the decade between FY2004 and FY2013. During this period, infrastructure investment picked
up significantly with the operation of the PMU. Some other PICs spent less on economic infrastructure
investment with regard to share in total capital spending and less on education but still achieved
relatively good performance. Both Samoa (for 2008–10) and Solomon Islands (for 2010–14) spent
around one-third of their capital spending on energy, roads, telecommunication, and agriculture and
about 11–14 percent on education. Samoa spent less on capital spending than the FSM, on average, just
8.6 percent of GDP over 2007–12 and grew by about 1.5 percent a year on average. Solomon Islands
even recorded an average growth rate of 4.5 percent over 2010–14. These examples illustrate that while
composition of infrastructure investment may matter for growth, there are other decisive factors behind
poor performance of the FSM economy that may constrain the FSM’s economic performance over the
long term.

88.      The IDP 2004 allocation of infrastructure grants among the states adopted a largely per
capita-based formula instead of a need-based approach. Actual allocation for FY2004–13 broadly
reflected this formulae, with Chuuk being the largest recipient. The SGs accounted for 44 percent of all
resources for approved projects during FY2004–12. However, Chuuk is the most populous state, but
per capita capital spending for Chuuk was only about US$1,350. This is higher than in Pohnpei but is
only about half of Yap and Kosrae, the two smallest states with regard to population. In addition, the
geographical allocation as well as the sectoral allocation in this period was considerably affected by the
US$42 million Weno Road Project in Chuuk, which was one-quarter of the total approved resources
for FY2004–13. Taking out this large project, each Chuuk resident (where poverty is most concentrated)
only received one-fifth of their peers in Yap and Kosrae, and economic infrastructure accounted for 25
percent of total allocation.

3.3     Efficiency Review

89.      Since weaknesses in PIM can negate the argument that fiscal resources allocated to public
investments could enhance economic prospects, attention to the processes that govern public
investment selection and management is critical. This section adopts a recent World Bank analytical
framework to review the PIM in the FSM. The framework highlights the eight critical features
commonly observed in countries with an efficient system of PIM. These features cover all project cycles
and are essential for minimizing systemic loopholes, ensuring value for money, and achieving intended
goals of development strategies. They are considered to be ‘must‐have’ features, not with the intention
of establishing a gold standard but to provide a logical and internally consistent system that even a low‐
capacity country should try to follow to establish basic disciplines for project selection and
management. Lack of reliable data and information in the FSM, however, prevents a full coverage of
all must-have features of this framework, as depicted in figure 37.

90.      Strategic guidance and preliminary screening. The FSM SDP 2004–2023 and its third
volume, IDP 2004–2023, provide guidance for the identification of infrastructure projects. The project
selection also takes into account consultation with the states, with consideration of funding availability
from the Compact and other sources. The IDP is overly broad and ambitious. It identifies an investment
of US$2.3 billion spread across 750 projects from FY2003 to FY2017. The IDP has a fairly broad
coverage spreading over 11 different infrastructure sectors. There are no explanations or justification
for the selection or prioritization of individual projects. The IDP was prepared by the Department of
Transport, Communication, and Infrastructure (DTCI) in consultation with the states but there was no
participation of independent experts to guide the formulation of strategic priorities.

91.      IDP 2004–2023 adopted a multiple criteria assessment (MCA) with a long list of criteria for
preliminary screening of projects, including impact on the economy, health and safety of the
community, contribution toward the development of the FSM workforce, potential social benefits and
environmental impact, viability, sustainability, and potential impact on the private sector development.
There were no guidelines on whether the adoption of criteria differs across states, sectors, or size of
projects. A long list of criteria may increase the subjectivity and reduce the level of strategic focus of
the selected projects to achieve the ultimate goal of economic self-sufficiency by 2024. Lack of a clear
priority can undermine the feasibility of development plans because of the resulting low allocative
efficiency. Although the sectoral allocation of resources during FY2004–13 broadly followed the IDP,
the outcomes differed remarkably from the plan. The FSM was not able to promote private sector
development, one of its main targets for economic self-sufficiency.

92.      The lack of robust need-based analysis for the allocation of resources across sectors and states
is another factor that can contribute to undermining the potential impact of infrastructure projects
(GAO-14-243T 2014). According to the IDP 2004 - 2023, education, health, and public utilities receive
the first priority, and physical infrastructure comes second in the sectoral allocation. The distribution
across the four states follows a formula determined by an FSM law. All these criteria, sectoral priorities,
and allocation formulae remain broad and not based on robust evidence to ensure close connection
between selected investments and intended development outcomes.

93.     Project appraisal. There are no well-defined standardized central guidelines in the FSM for
project appraisal. The majority of projects in the IDP 2004-2023 were prepared by the states that also
have limited capacity in undertaking robust appraisals. The few existing guidelines for Compact
projects focus on the fiduciary and procurement procedures and inadequate attention paid to economic
benefits of projects. For public projects under Congress appropriation, the proposers have to fill in a
simple template, the Project Control Document that only contains information about cost, location,
timelines, and requested source of funding. Like the majority of developing countries, there is also no
independent review of appraisal of project proposals in the FSM, even if the projects are funded and
appraised by donors. An independent review of appraisal is of importance to counter optimism bias, an
empirical tendency to systematically overestimate benefits and underestimate costs in project
appraisals. An independent review by the government can also consider domestic conditions and
capacity constraints, local impacts, and prospective developments of which a donor may not be fully
aware.

94.     The appraisal system in the FSM shares similar characteristics of a typical aid-dependent
country, in which the appraisal of donor-funded projects relies on donors procedures. Where public
investment is fully financed from domestic sources or where aid is largely in the form of budget support,
weaknesses in government capacity to appraise projects create an immediate risk that low-quality
projects will be accepted into the budget and implemented. This is evident in the appraisal of public
projects appropriated by Congress. Apart from the information provided in the Project Control


                                                    50
Document, which basically provides only information about costs, location, and time frame, there is no
formal appraisal to assess whether the projects will bring economic benefits to the society.

                      Box 6. Independent Review of Appraisal in Belarus and Ireland
 Belarus. The State Appraisal Agency was established with a mandate to appraise all public investment projects.
 It charges a fee of 5–10 percent of project preparation costs to the implementing agency. The agency consists
 of about 70 senior experts on construction and other capital investment. In most cases, the agency provides its
 appraisal result within 30 days. With sufficient resources available from fees charged to the proposal-
 submitting agencies, the State Appraisal Agency has managed to recruit highly qualified technical professionals
 and has provided extensive training to ensure appraisal quality. The agency claims that about US$300 million
 was saved by its review in 2006.

 Ireland. The Department of Finance requires that line departments involve external review in their appraisal.
 Agencies are allowed to carry out their CBA in-house, but they have to commission outside experts to review
 the results of their appraisals. For example, the Department of Transport now engages professional companies
 to carry out audits of compliance with the Department of Finance guidelines and audits of progress in project
 implementation. The projects to be audited are selected by the department’s Investment Monitoring Group.
 The auditors engaged are required to submit detailed reports of all audits carried out, setting out their findings
 and making recommendations where appropriate.

portfolio are key to efficient investment. Project selection is widely viewed as the most critical stage of
the investment management process because the decision making is often under strong pressure from
various interest groups, so it is difficult to ensure an airtight technical process for the selection.
However, good international practice shows that the robust results of sound project appraisal can help
provide useful technical inputs to facilitate the decision-making process.

96.      The revised IDP (2016-2025) includes a selection process for FSM infrastructure projects
during this period, as depicted in figure 38. The process includes several good elements needed for
having a sound portfolio of investment. The foundation of the selection is an infrastructure review that
analyzes the current status of 10 infrastructure sectors in the FSM and assesses the demand for services
in each sector. Based on the review, a long list of sector projects is produced for each state. In the next
step, project prioritization is conducted through several filters by a working group, which comprises
representatives of the executives, legislatives, infrastructure managers, and civil societies. In the first
step, the priority project lists are formulated taking into account the indicative funding envelope and
the current Infrastructure Planning and Implementation Committee listings and priorities. Projects are
then further prioritized by implementation timing, considering projects’ expected impacts and
availability of resources. The final filter of the prioritization process involves a strategic rating in which
the priority group assesses contribution of priority projects to the overall strategic objectives. A cost
benefit analysis (CBA) however is not included in this process.


                                                        51
97.      However, the engagement of the JEMCO and OIA (Figure 39) imposes further administrative
layers to the current appraisal process, which still lacks robust quantitative assessment of economic
benefits of individual projects. It is common in a good PIM system to include CBA in the prioritization
of projects. In addition, the adoption of an MCA approach for rating with a large number of criteria
(nine as in IDP 2016–2025, covering economic, social, environmental, and institutional aspects) runs
against the risk of diluting the strategic focus.31 The application of the same weights for each of the nine
objectives, irrespective of sector or geographic location of the projects, indicates that further gain in
allocative efficiency can be achieved by setting priorities in accordance with different needs of the
states. Finally, limited availability of information about the risks, perhaps because of the lack of
assessment and valuation of risks associated with projects, can also result in suboptimal decision
making and undermine the efficiency of the portfolio.

98.       Project implementation. Various reports point to the limited implementation capacity as a
major factor behind the sluggish performance during FY2004–08. In this period, the FSM was only able
to implement US$5 million a year on average and hence accumulated about US$50 million grant
arrears.32 The performance improved significantly after the FSM PMU was established and became
fully operational. Greater control over the timing and execution of infrastructure projects has been
shifted from the SG to the NG and helped strengthen the professionalism of project implementation. As
a result, the performance improved considerably in the second five years of the amended Compact, with
about US$21 million allocated to infrastructure projects every year.

99.      Other factors affecting the implementation include the lack of adequate and competitive
construction infrastructure and local skilled labor and the inability to secure land lease for public
projects.33 In addition, the weak federal structure of the FSM is another factor that contributes to inhibit
successful implementation of CIGs. Each state has its own constitution and authority over budget
policies. As a result, it is difficult for the NG to align the infrastructure portfolio with the FSM national
priorities. The states have made their own decisions about the distribution of funds between the sectors
from their allocated amounts.

100.    While the operation of the PMU has clearly helped clarify roles and responsibilities for project
implementation and improve focus on managing the total project costs over the life of each project,
persistent weak internal control remains a critical issue that can impede the implementation process. A
report of the GAO in 2013 pointed out that only half of the financial statement audit opinions for the
FSM are unqualified for FY2006–11, and 17 out of 18 financial statement audits for those years from
the FSM found material weaknesses and significant deficiencies, resulting in the entities receiving
qualified and disclaimed audit opinions with regard to internal controls over financial reporting.34

101.     The monitoring of projects’ implementation remains a major problem, which has partially been
caused by the somewhat cumbersome institutional arrangements for M&E. At the federal level, the
SBOC had in the past been in charge of the oversight of the overall program, and it monitored the
progress of the infrastructure projects through the PMU within the FSM DTCI. Each state also has an
entity responsible for providing oversight of infrastructure projects within the state. Given the federal
structure, the SBOC does not have sufficient autonomy to impose the reporting requirements on the
states. An indicator of this issue is the persistence of issues related to availability, quality, and timeliness
of the regular monitoring reports. The dissolution of the SBOC is expected to further complicate
institutional arrangements for M&E.

102.    The upstream institutional arrangements for PIM in the FSM involve a complex system with
engagement of the GoFSM, the JEMCO, and the OIA before and after the award of funds. Before the
annual awarding of Compact funds, the FSM must submit a development plan that identifies goals and
performance objectives for each sector. In addition, the United States and the JEMCO are to approve
annual sector grants and evaluate the country’s management of the grants and their progress toward
program and economic goals. The postaward oversight function is exercised both by the FSM
government and by the OIA. The former is required to monitor day-to-day operations of sector grants
and activities, submit periodic financial statements and performance reports for the tracking of progress
against goals and objectives, and ensure annual financial and compliance audits. The OIA evaluates the
quarterly and annual performance and monitors the sectoral grant outlays as well as the fiscal
performance of the government.

103.    Completion review. The separation between the project implementation agency and the
operation and maintenance of the generated assets requires a well-established mechanism for the
handover of assets. In the FSM, the weak compliance with requirements for completion reporting is
another factor behind the suspension of new infrastructure grants during FY2013–15. According to the
existing financing procedures, the FSM needs to prepare and submit several project completion
documents that, among others, state the amount of grant used and the de-obligated or leftover grant
money from each of the completed projects. The FSM could strengthen initiatives to stay on top of the
paperwork, largely due to weak coordination between the PMU, the SBOC, the DOFA, and the states.

                                                   53
104.    Capacity. In addition to sound institutional arrangements and robust approaches and
techniques, competent capacity is another prerequisite for effective PIM. Thin capacity for qualified
individuals can be a critical bottleneck for the FSM, recent census data show that only 4 percent of the
FSM population has a higher education degree. This binding constraint was illustrated with the
extremely slow implementation progress of infrastructure grants in the first five years of the amended
Compact and the import of external expertise with the PMU operation partially solved the issue and
resulted in some initial implementation success. However, the import of outside experts only represents
a temporary solution and in the longer term, concerted efforts are needed for the development of local
capacity, not only in project implementation but also in the other phases of PIM.

105.     Outcomes. An indicator of efficiency of public infrastructure investment is the large amount
of unallocated grants as well as undisbursed resources from approved projects accumulated over time.
It was reported that during FY2004–14, about US$150 million worth of projects, out of US$252 million
available according to the amended Compact, was approved.35 About half of these grant arrears were
the result of a slow start from FY2004 to FY2008. The other half resulted from the standstill of grant
approval during FY2013–15. Of the approved amount during FY2004–13, 13 percent remains
undisbursed as of the end of FY2013 (figure 40). There is also room for improvement with regard to
project completion. During FY2004–12, the FSM completed only 6 education-related projects out of
19 prioritized projects approved by the JEMCO.

106.     There seems to be a weak nexus between public capital spending and the IDP’s development
goals, especially private sector growth. Except for FY2010 and FY2011, the private sector contracted
every year in the first decade of the amended Compact despite large public capital spending. On
average, the private sector contracted 2.5 percent a year, even faster than the contraction rate of GDP.
As a result, the contribution of the private sector to GDP declined, from about 24 percent in FY2004 to
just 19 percent in FY2014.

107.      Weak correlation between public capital spending and GDP as well as the private sector over
the last 10 years seems to indicate that public infrastructure investment did not live up to expectations
in relieving growth bottlenecks and binding constraints. Infrastructure investment is complementary to
other investment, so excessive infrastructure investment has no added value, but if suboptimal
infrastructure investment constrains other investment, it constrains growth (Newbery, 2012).
Infrastructure investment in the FSM appears to have strong short-term impact on the construction
sector, but its medium- to long-term effects on output and productivity are not likely to improve unless
critical constraints are removed.

3.4     IDP 2016–2025

108.     IDP 2016–2025 introduces several improvements over its predecessor, IDP 2004, for
preliminary screening of projects, institutional arrangements, and M&E. The prioritization of
projects is facilitated with the adoption of a multi-criteria assessment in which the contribution of each
priority project to the IDP’s nine strategic objectives is rated to provide a strategic rating out of 10. In
addition, the prioritization will be reviewed at regular intervals as part of the planning and budgeting
process. Improved prescreening of projects and a shift in priorities toward economic infrastructure
sectors are expected to lead to improvement in allocative efficiency.

109.    A particular improvement is the clarification of the roles and responsibilities of different
agencies involved in infrastructure investment management. A report on institutional strengthening
was prepared based on review of background reports and data, as well as consultations with
stakeholders. The proposed arrangements received strong endorsement from all state governors and the
president. The essence of the proposed implementation model is the reform of the PMU, which will
now focus on program management whereas project management will be delegated to the states by the
formation of the PMOs. The PMU will be responsible for project completion analysis as well as for
provision of ongoing support to each state to ensure standards are developed and shared.

110.     The proposed delegation of the project management functionality to the states can have
both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, the management agencies are based in the
states and hence will be better informed about local information and needs, have better oversight, and
can deal with implementation issues more effectively. Improved access to project implementation
information can contribute to improving M&E. Limited capacity of the states is expected to be
addressed by the proposal for having a single external party to undertake the initial PMO role in each
state. On the other hand, the establishment of the state PMOs will impose one more administrative layer
to the system, and the increased complexity of the institutional arrangements in combination with
empowered role of states agencies in PIM in a weak federal structure context can make it more difficult
in holding involved agencies accountable. The examination of PIM in selected aid-dependent countries
in a recent World Bank research suggests that rationalizing and mainstreaming the PIUs is one of the
priority reform areas for PIM system in these countries (box 7).

                     Box 7. Main PIM Reform Priorities in Aid-dependent Countries
 The following priorities for the PIM system reform are derived from (a) the current system functionality
 synthetized from the case studies of a recent World Bank research project and (b) assessment of priority areas
 at the margin for strengthening the PIM system functionality. Case studies include the Democratic Republic
 of Congo, Lesotho, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Zambia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

 into Assets for Growth.

111.     The allocation of infrastructure funds across four states appears to be similar to IDP 2004.
It remains unclear whether the newly proposed allocation was developed based on a robust needs
analysis or still follows the per-capita formulae. Without a further analysis of the demand for different
types of infrastructure services and the identification of binding constraints, the large potential gains in
allocative efficiency associated with shifting resources across sectors or states may not be fully realized.

112.     Further gains in allocative efficiency can be achieved with better project appraisal and
selection. The focus of the institutional arrangements proposed in the new IDP is technical efficiency
associated with implementation. Nevertheless, limited attention has been paid on the appraisal and
selection of the projects. CBA is either not a standard component of project appraisal yet as it is in
almost all countries, or the quality of the analysis in the FSM is not independently reviewed. While
some projects may generate positive economic benefits, it is rare to assess their relative value for money.
Moreover, good practices in project appraisal, in the United Kingdom for example, also give attention
to business case justification, project management arrangements, risk mitigation, and procurement
strategies.

113.    The priority of IDP 2016–2025 to accelerate CIG commitment and disbursement would
need to be complemented with local capacity building. It is proposed that in FY2016 alone, projects
worth more than 50 percent of the committed amount for FY2004–13 will be implemented, and the
planned amount for FY2016–19 is three times as much as the amount implemented in the first 10 years
of the amended Compact. The plan includes fast-tracking spending of infrastructure grant arrears
(US$126 million) of the first decade of the amended Compact. The establishment of project
implementation offices in the four states and the recruitment of external agencies, as recommended by
the IDP, can help boost the implementation in the short term like the foundation of the PMU before.
However, the replication of the PMU model in the states alone may not be sustainable unless it addresses
the remaining issues, including weak local capacity or inadequate quality of project implementation.
Other current problems such as lack of reliable and timely data and weak monitoring can be exacerbated
by the proposed arrangements, which moves the implementation responsibilities to the states.

3.5     Conclusion

114.     Poor performance in the first half of the amended Compact, with regard to both the
economy as a whole and the infrastructure sector, has brought the FSM development strategy
such as SDP 2004–2023 and IDP 2004 into question. The apparent lack of priorities and limited
connection between the projects and intended outcomes have made these strategic documents an
inefficient tool for preliminary screening of projects. In an effort to improve the strategic documents, it
was agreed to dissect the SDP into 3–5 year plans with clear targets and appropriate resources for
implementation. Action Plan 2023 was released in February 2015 and focuses on the activities to be
undertaken during FY2015–17. The updated IDP for 2016–25 was released in October 2015, which
documents the priority needs for the first time, including climate change adaptation, in four stand-alone
state plans. Prioritization of projects will be reviewed at regular intervals.

115.      The feasibility of IDP 2016–2025 will be contingent on removing structural impediments.
The plan aims to accelerate infrastructure spending but seems to envisage limited measures to address
the root causes of slow implementation in FY2004–15. In addition to structural economic issues such
as remoteness, it takes time to overcome binding constraints such as inadequate capacity of local
contractors or implementation agencies, customary land titling, or inadequate legal framework and
institutional arrangements. The absence of a robust needs-based approach to project selection and
negligible changes in sectoral allocation raises questions about attainment of the intended goals of
improving efficiency.

116.      A balanced approach is recommended in the short to medium term with a more realistic
pace of infrastructure spending and in-parallel fixing of current weaknesses in the PIM system.
Spending priority in the short term can be given to infrastructure investment arears and perhaps a small
number of the top-rated projects. At the same time, adequate attention should be given to building
implementation capacity, especially the project implementation offices in the states, improving
information availability, and strengthened enforcement of monitoring and reporting for improving
technical efficiency. Heavy reliance on external expertise can help boost spending in the short term, but
it is unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term, especially under an expected tighter fiscal situation.

117.    In the medium term, improvement of the priorities across and within sectors as well as of
the states can help strengthen strategic screening and increase allocative efficiency. A good start
can be a robust need analysis for states and sectors, which will then be the foundation for improvement


                                                     57
of specific criteria and guidelines needed to ensure strategic selection of projects. There is also a need
to undertake ex post evaluation of selected completed projects. The DTCI can then lead the preparation
of a midterm review of IDP 2016–2025 with inputs of the need analysis and these ex post evaluations.
The midterm review of IDP 2016–2025 can also benefit from independent experts and active
participation of concerned stakeholders, especially the private sector. Apart from broad-based
consultations, the establishment of a body such as an Infrastructure Strategy Board to provide
independent expert advice to the Congress and the states to guide strategic priorities or oversee the
compliance with the strategy can be considered, and not only for the midterm review of the IDP.

118.    Having an independent agency responsible for M&E of infrastructure projects can be
considered. The agency can produce guidelines and regulations for M&E and ensure smooth and timely
information flow as well as the disclosure of information. Independence of evaluation implies that this
agency should not belong to the DTCI. Following common practice, it is recommended to put this

119.     Finally in the long term, there is considerable room for improvement of allocative
efficiency through the development of a robust project appraisal system. This will include the
building of local capacity for project appraisal, formulation of a sound legal framework as well as
establishing appraisal agencies and mechanism at NG and SG level. Different sectors also demand
different appraisal approaches whose level of complexity is expected to be proportionate to the size of
projects.

IV.         Education Sector Issues

4.1         Introduction

120.     The education and health sectors in the FSM, financed largely by CSGs, will likely face
shrinking resources due to the grants’ expiration planned for 2023. Anticipating the expiration of
the CSGs in 2023, the GoFSM (excluding NG) has begun implementation of the LTFF (see chapter 6)
to protect against a sudden reduction in service delivery. In this context, to inform future allocations of
public expenditure, it is important to understand current expenditure trends and how sectoral spending
is linked to outputs. Such an exercise will help identify any potential allocative or technical efficiency
gains, which will support improved education and health outcomes in the medium to long term.

121.     This chapter explores expenditure trends by economic, functional, and administrative
classifications and examines these in relation to sector outcomes. As part of this analysis, the PER
benchmarks the FSM with other countries within the region to see how the level of spending and
outcomes compare. The analysis attempts to take into account the FSM’s relatively low population
density and, dispersion and remoteness, which could make the delivery of public goods and services
more expensive. A benefit incidence analysis (BIA) is carried out to examine inequities in government
allocation of resources for education services and on the public use of these services. Given the expected
changes in fiscal space and the changing context, the chapter discusses options for improving resource
allocation and expenditures in line with priorities identified.

122.     One challenge faced in producing this chapter was the difficulty in obtaining certain types
of expenditure data. Data on education and health spending broken down by subsector are not publicly
reported in the FSM. These data are also not available through the national Department of Education
(DoE) or Department of Health (DoH), as the NG does not require that states report data disaggregated
in this way.36 Due to lack of standardization across the four FSM states in reporting of education and
health spending data, state-level variations in resource allocation could not be explained, including any
potential relationship with differences in population density or remoteness. This implies that analysis
of spending by various levels of the sector is not possible. More importantly, the fact that these data are
not reported or required points to a bigger problem of lack of transparency in how public resources are
distributed within the sector. When this information is not generated or disseminated regularly,
providers cannot be held accountable for performance.

123.     Working within the data constraints, the following chapters highlight core action areas
that could help improve return on investment in the education and health sectors. The first
subsection of each chapter describes the current structure of the FSM education and health systems.
This is followed by an analysis of expenditure and performance trends, which sheds light on emerging
challenges. The final subsection highlights key areas where an appropriately designed combination of
interventions could help improve the quality of education outcomes as well as health services in the
FSM. The examples from international experience are meant to illustrate how broad principles of
service delivery have been adapted and adopted in other country settings. The precise nature and design
of interventions relevant to the FSM, along with decisions about which type of intervention would be
best suited to the varying service delivery environment and needs of the four states, will require deeper
situational and further sector-specific analysis. The four states differ vastly in capacity and quality of
services delivered. While the core action areas recommended here (with more details provided in the
respective concluding sections) broadly apply to all states, the specific actions and their sequencing
may vary depending on the state.

4.2     Structure of the FSM Education System

124.    The structure of the education system of the FSM is very similar to the U.S. model. There
are four levels: early childhood education (ECE) for ages 3–5, elementary for ages 6–13 (grades 1–8),
secondary for ages 14–18 (grades 9–12), and postsecondary. Education is compulsory only until grade
8 or when the student turns 15. The COM is the major tertiary education provider in the country. The
COM has a national campus located in Pohnpei and state campuses in each of the FSM states. The
COM offers AA/AS and certificate-level programs in a range of subjects, as well as short training
programs. The COM operates a Fisheries and Maritime Institute in Yap. Finally, there are limited
technical and vocational education training programs aimed at students at the secondary level.

125.    With regard to institutional responsibilities, the FSM national DoE sets standards, while
the state DoEs are responsible for curriculum and instruction. Responsibility for carrying out the
functions of the NG in education rests with the national DoE. The department works in collaboration
with the state DoEs and the COM in planning, developing, and promoting GoFSM education goals. The
constitution does not clearly delineate the powers and responsibilities of the states and the NG. A
constitutional convention in 1990 sought to clarify the issue by proposing that for education, the NG's
role should be limited to “setting minimum nationwide standards, coordinating state activities and
foreign government assistance, and providing training, TA, and support for postsecondary education
programs.” However, the states have autonomy in setting their own curricula, tests, and standards.

126.    In 2014, the FSM had a total of 129 elementary and 33 secondary schools serving a student
population of 26,554 across its four states. Chuuk, the largest state with nearly half of the country’s
population, operates 60 elementary schools, employing 576 teachers and serving 9,077 students, and 19
secondary schools, employing 201 teachers and serving 2,385 children. Kosrae, in comparison, with
the smallest population (7 percent of the population) operates 7 elementary schools, employing 157
teachers serving 1,443 students, and 1 secondary school, employing 52 teachers serving 675 students.
This coverage of services supported primary net enrolment rates (NERs) that vary from 83 percent in
Chuuk to 91 percent in Yap, 92 percent in Pohnpei, and 95 percent in Kosrae (HIES 2013; see figure
42). Secondary NERs stood at 53 percent in Chuuk, 59 percent in Kosrae, 64 percent in Yap, and 65
percent in Pohnpei.

127.     In 2014, the FSM had a total of 2,230 teachers and staff employed across the states in
elementary and secondary schools. Teachers accounted for 82 percent of all staff, with the remainder
engaged in administrative and other tasks. Chuuk had the largest share (40 percent) of all teachers and
staff, followed by Pohnpei (30 percent), Yap (18 percent), and Kosrae (12 percent). Personnel cost

                                                     62
ranged from 55 percent to 94 percent of school budget. Teachers and staff employed across the states
in elementary and secondary schools represent around one-third of total government employees and
declined slightly between FY2013 and FY2014, possibly due to the implementation of the LTFF. While
expenditure data on wages of teachers and school and administrative personnel is not available, back-
of-the-envelope calculations on personnel cost per teacher or per staff employed suggest that teacher
salaries are broadly in line with the average wage earned by SG employees.

128.     Student-teacher ratios (STRs) indicate that service delivery is organized to overcome
challenges of remoteness and places schools as close as possible to beneficiaries. The geography
and population contexts of the states vary significantly and are reflected in state-specific STRs (figure
43). Consider the STR of 8 in Yap and 18 in Pohnpei. Pohnpei has the same population density as Yap
(Table 1), but overall the population is less dispersed, with a significantly smaller fraction (5 percent)
resident in the state’s outer islands (OI) (43 percent in Yap). The lower STR in Yap thus ser ves to
compensate for the state’s higher population dispersion. Kosrae is unique among the states in that its
entire population is resident on one island only, but the state still has the thinnest population density in
the country and, to compensate for this, the lowest primary STR. Chuuk is the most densely populated
among the four states and, compared to Yap, has a significantly smaller share of population resident in
the OI. It would be expected that the STR is comparable to that in Pohnpei, but it is much lower. This
is because Chuuk has the lowest enrolment rate in the country; the STR is lower than expected due to
the number of children out of school. Thus, overall the STRs, combined with enrolment rates in each
state, indicate that the distribution of service delivery inputs aims to bring services as close as possible

129.    The FSM’s education system underpins a labor market characterized by relatively low
formal employment, high unemployment, and a high share of migrant labor. The 2010 census
suggested that around half of the FSM’s labor force was in formal employment while a quarter was
engaged in subsistence, with the remainder unemployed. Of those engaged in the formal sector, around
half were engaged by the private sector. In the 2013 HIES, among adults of age 25 years and older,
higher education attainment was associated with a higher likelihood of being engaged in paid
employment (Figure 44).37 Among adults who completed high school or an AS, paid employment was
15 percentage points likelier than among those who completed elementary school only. Half and three-
quarters of those with college and postgraduate degrees, respectively, were likely to be engaged in paid
employment. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) migration
database reports that over 31,000 Micronesians are living in the United States (equivalent to 30 percent

37
  Unpaid employment includes producing goods for own and/or family consumption; unpaid family worker (family
business, and so on); help with basic household duties inside (washing, cooking, cleaning, and so on) and outside (gardening,
maintaining lawn, and so on); and volunteer work.

                                                                                       63
of the domestic population). More than 60 percent of migrants to the U.S. mainland were most likely to
be in paid employment, and the ratio of private-to-public sector jobs is high. Wages for paid migrant
workers suggest that the majority are in labor-intensive industries. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
constraints to U.S. labor markets include high cost of flights to the United States, weak education
(literacy, numeracy), and the lack of familiarity with living in a cash economy without the support of
extended families.

4.3         Expenditure Trends

130.    The FSM spends around 20 percent of its recurrent expenditure on education and this
trend has remained flat over the past five years. Between FY2008 and FY2014, nominal recurrent
expenditure on education hovered just under US$40 million per year.38 In real terms, expenditure
declined slightly between FY2010 and FY2012, before flattening out to just under US$30 million
annually. Education spending is largely funded through CSGs, which has declined in real terms.
Between FY2010 and FY2014, this constituted roughly 20 percent of total recurrent spending by the
government. In FY2014, SG education expenditure ranged from 30 percent of total recurrent
expenditure in Yap to 41 percent in Chuuk. This pattern in spending for SGs has held fairly consistently
since FY2010.

131.    SGs’ expenditure combined accounts for 90 percent of the FSM’s recurrent expenditure
on education (Figure 47). Operating under a federated structure, the bulk of spending responsibilities
on education in turn rests with the states. Chuuk absorbs the largest share (34 percent in FY2014),
followed by Pohnpei (29 percent), Yap (15 percent), and Kosrae (11 percent). Per capita expenditures
vary significantly between states (figures 48 and 49), with expenditures in Yap and Kosrae almost twice
as high as those in Chuuk and Pohnpei. In FY2014, Kosrae incurred the highest per capita public
expenditure among all states, at US$1,862 per population ages 5–19 years, followed closely by Yap

(US$1,657), with Pohnpei and Chuuk spending almost half as much at US$915 and US$793,
respectively. Further, Kosrae and Yap have recently experienced significantly larger increases in per
capita expenditures in real terms, compared to Pohnpei and Chuuk.39

39Between FY2012 and FY2014, real per capita expenditure rose by 15 percent and 12 percent in Kosrae and Yap, respectively,
and by 6 percent in Chuuk, with no significant change in Pohnpei. This partly reflects small declines in the populations of
Chuuk and Kosrae, while in Yap, the population increased slightly but real expenditure growth in the states outpaced this
increase.

                                                                                                    65
132.     For each SG, most of the expenditure is incurred on personnel and consumables. A closer
look at the composition of these per capita expenditures across the SGs is revealing (Figure 50). The
largest category of expenditure is incurred on personnel—each state spends between 44 percent
(Kosrae) and 66 percent (Chuuk) of its expenditure on teachers and other staff. The next largest category
is consumables, absorbing between 18 and 31 percent of expenditure in Pohnpei and Yap, respectively.
An important feature of the spending is that even though the share spent on personnel is smaller in both
Kosrae and Yap than in Chuuk and Pohnpei, the amount the former two states spend in nominal terms
on personnel is significantly higher than that in the latter two states, driven by differing STRs across
the states. Also notable in Figure 50 is the higher amount spent on consumables in Yap and Kosrae,
which in some states likely reflects the logistical complexity of getting learning materials and other
school equipment to remote schools.40

133.     Within each state, a large share of the education budget is allocated to administrative and
other state-level programs, but it is not clear how schools benefit from this highly centralized
administrative spending. A breakdown of education expenditures by level of facility was not available
for any of the states, so this report attempted to use budget data for 2014 to explore how resources were
allocated within the sector in each state (box 8). Elementary schools were allocated roughly 40 percent
of the budget in each state, except in Yap where the share stood at 23 percent. Secondary schools were
allocated between 15 percent (Yap and Kosrae) and 23 percent (Chuuk). Overall, education
administration costs combined with state-administered programs that could not be broken down by
school level were quite large in each state, varying from 26 percent in Pohnpei to 46 percent in Yap.
More quantitative data is needed to ascertain whether or how schools benefit from this highly
centralized administrative spending.




40Expenditure classifications by type (for example, personnel) were only available for financing that was reported on in Annual
Compact Reports. For total education spending, there are at times significant differences between the amounts reported in the
Annual Compact Reports and those in the government audit reports. In FY2014, these amounted to a total of US$874,376
(Kosrae), US$1,122,160 (Pohnpei), and US$477,911 (Yap). This expenditure is thus at the moment ‘unclassifiable’.

                Box 8. How Are Resources Allocated within the FSM’s Education System?
Breakdown of education expenditures by level was not available for any of the states, so this report attempted
to use budget data for 2014 to explore how resources were allocated within the sector (Table 10). Budget item
categories varied significantly across states, depending on state-specific programs, but allocations to each
primary and secondary school in the country were reported, allowing a breakdown of the budget allocations by
primary and secondary level and across central and OI. Such an analysis helps inform policy making; strengthen
M&E, transparency, and accountability; and build a picture of who benefits from government spending at each
level of the system.

In Kosrae, the largest share of the budget (43 percent) was allocated to elementary schools (grades 1 –8), 15
percent to the state’s one secondary school, 4 percent to ECE, and a very large share to the ‘other’ category,
which is the budget for central, state-level expenditures (38 percent), which cannot be broken down by level,
and in Kosrae include the state DoE; ‘curriculum and instructional services’; Division of Facilities, Community
Affairs, and Supports; the Special Education Program; the Education Improvement Project; and Workforce and
Skill Training. In 2014, Kosrae reported having no public ECE facilities, and further work is needed to
understand what the budget earmarked for ECE was used for.

Chuuk has a similar budget allocation pattern as Kosrae, with 42 percent allocated to elementary schools, a
slightly higher allocation of 23 percent to secondary schools, no allocation to ECE (although it is possible that
the allocation was included under another category but not reported separately), and a large share of the budget
(35 percent) allocated to the ‘other’ category. This category included ‘administration and personnel’, planning
and development, the Central Office, and two regional education centers.

Pohnpei also had budget allocations similar to those in Kosrae and Chuuk for elementary schools (39 percent)
and secondary schools (21 percent), but a significantly higher allocation for ECE (14 percent), and 26 percent
for other activities that could not be broken down by education level. ‘Other’ included the Vocational Education
Improvement Project; School Improvement Project; Curriculum, Instructional Development, and Specialized
Education; Offices of Elementary and Secondary Education; Special Education Program; postsecondary
scholarships; and Workforce Development and Skills Training. Like Kosrae, Pohnpei does not report on the
number of ECE facilities in the state, but the budget data indicate that the ECE allocation supports teachers and
other personnel at 24 facilities.

Yap’s budget allocation for elementary school was significantly lower than the other states, at 23 percent, and
15 percent allocated to secondary schools. The state had the highest allocation in the FSM to ECE, and
elsewhere reported operating 25 ECE facilities. The ‘other’ category allocation was comparable to Kosrae and
Chuuk at 46 percent and included education administration, budget and supply division, curriculum division,
four central school zone offices, cultural programs, and special education, among others.

 In each state, per capita budget allocations are significantly higher in the OI than elsewhere in the state. Figure
 51 shows per capita budget allocations for elementary and secondary schools in each state —in each case, the
 amounts allocated to schools at each level are divided by the number of students enrolled at that level. With the
 exception of secondary schools in Chuuk, the per capita budget allocations are always significantly higher in
 the OI than elsewhere; however, outcomes are lower than FSM average.

134.    When compared to developing country peers, the amount of resources devoted to
education is high. Among the two other Pacific Island countries on which internationally comparable
expenditure data are available for education—Fiji and the Solomon Islands—the FSM has the smallest
GDP, but the highest education expenditure as a share of total government spending (figure 52). The
same holds true in comparison with the Caribbean small states, with the exception of Belize, which
spends a little more on education. Comparisons on the basis of per capita GDP are even more striking
(figure 53)—the FSM is among countries with the highest spending on education, as a share of total
government expenditure.

135.     Resources devoted to the OI remain moderate, suggesting that factors other than
population dispersion may be contributing to the relative high costs of service delivery. The FSM
like many other PICs face the challenge of needing to deliver services to a highly disperse population,
which may contribute to the high cost of service delivery. However, spending patterns suggest that only
a small share of resources are devoted to remote education facilities. More specifically, the overall
budget allocated to OI primary and secondary schools, including salaries for teachers, varies from a
mere 3 percent in Pohnpei to 15 percent in Yap to 20 percent in Chuuk (10 percent of the aggregate
FSM budget). This suggests that other costs such as those embedded in the large share of the education
budget allocated to administrative and other state-level programs may also be contributing to the high
cost of service delivery in the FSM.

4.4           Education Sector Challenges

136.     Despite the relatively high expenditure, enrolment rates are low, especially at the
secondary level, when compared to developing country peers. In 2013, the FSM’s gross enrolment
rate stood at 98 percent at the primary level and 69 percent at the secondary level, with an NER of 88
and 59 percent, respectively. In spite of being the highest spender on education as a share of GNI in the
group of Pacific Island states, the FSM’s primary gross enrolment rate was higher only than Tuva lu,
and its NER higher only than Tonga, which spends only 3 percent of its GNI on education. At the
secondary level, Fiji and Palau, with the highest NERs in the group, spend significantly less than the
FSM, which perform only slightly better than the state with the lowest NER, Vanuatu. Comparison with
the small Caribbean states yields similar conclusions, which, with the exception of Guyana, sustain
primary and secondary NERs superior to the FSM at less than half the education expenditure as a share
of GNI. See annex 4 for more international comparisons.

137.     Within the FSM, higher per capita spending does not necessarily translate into higher
enrolments. The distribution of per capita expenditure across the four FSM states, when considered in
conjunction with performance on basic education outcomes, suggests striking differences between
states in how effectively they are able to convert financial resources and education inputs into outcomes
(figure 55). Kosrae spends about twice as much as Pohnpei in per capita terms but maintains a
comparable NER in primary education and a significantly lower secondary NER. Yap also spends twice
as much per capita as Pohnpei while maintaining roughly the same enrolment rates as the latter. Chuuk
spends roughly the same in per capita terms as Pohnpei, but net enrolments lag significantly behind
other states.

138.     Disconnect between state-specific per capita expenditures and education outcomes on the
ground reflects the need to review the fiscal allocation formulae. The variation in per capita
expenditures across the states may not reflect the true needs or demand for schooling on the ground but
rather a centrally determined formula for allocation of resources across the states, which relies on a
resource envelope set in the Compact and allocated according to the distribution formula (section 2.2).
This results in the smaller states receiving a relatively large share of the resources on a per capita basis.
To improve education outcomes and equity in distribution of education resources across the states, the
GoFSM may consider a review of various transfer formulae. Overall, the FSM has to decide whether to
continue the current arrangement of earmarked education transfers from central to local governments
or to transition in the long term to direct school transfers. School funding formulae can be used to
determine how to allocate resources directly to schools (see annex 10).41 Generally, distribution
formulae include factors such as population, density, school age population, senior population,
geography, dispersion, and existing poverty rates. Other approaches seek to incentivize performance,
for example, a portion of funds may be held back and distributed when agreed-upon performance goals
are met. A variety of indicators can track performance, including enrolments, primary-to-secondary
school transitions, or performance on the early grade reading, math assessments recommended in
section 4.5. This not only provides incentive for subnational governments to improve performance and
monitoring but also provides an indicator visible to the wider public for scrutiny.

139.    Many children are out of school, possibly due to indirect costs of enrolment, but for most
the reasons are not clear. Although the earlier analysis of STRs shows that placement of primary
schools aims to bring services close to beneficiaries, many children remain out of school. Among
children ages 6–13 years who are out of school, Chuuk has the highest share (72 percent), followed by
Pohnpei (20 percent), Yap (5 percent), and then Kosrae (3 percent). Fifty-one percent of out-of-school
children ages 6–13 years come from households in the lowest and second lowest consumption quintiles.
Figure 55 presents household reports on why children between the ages of 5 and 19 years are not in
school. Interestingly, 47 percent of children are not in school due to ‘personal reasons’; it is unclear
what this means; households are unwilling to divulge what they consider sensitive or private
information. Participants in consultations around these data hypothesized that households are unwilling
to reveal information about financial hardships or other social circumstances that could hurt their social
standing in their respective communities. This large category of unexplained out-of-school children
notwithstanding, the data do reveal that even though school is free, indirect and opportunity costs of
education are a constraint for a significant fraction of households: for 9 percent of children, schools
were reported to be ‘too far away’, and 17 percent had to ‘help at home’. Another 12 percent were
reported to leave due to poor academic performance.




41The ‘first generation’ model for such formulae used by many countries implementing school-based management involves a
simple capitation (per student) formula, usually weighted by age or grade to capture differential costs from different levels of
school education. The ‘second generation’ formula models seek to address ‘vertical equity’ through inclusion of weights to
reflect the relative scale of disadvantage, sometimes including multiple characteristics (for example, boarding of special needs
pupils).

Note: See annex 5 for an explanation of how benefit incidence is measured.

140.     Government spending on primary education is slightly regressive and becomes more
regressive at the secondary level. Figure 56 presents the benefit incidence of public spending (annex
5) on education at the primary and secondary levels, based on quintiles of population. The spending is
slightly regressive at the primary level and becomes more so at the secondary level. This is not
surprising, given that private school enrolments are very small and limited to children from the highest
consumption quintiles and that most of the children out of school at both the primary and secondary
levels are from socioeconomically disadvantaged households. At grades 1–8, children from households
in the lowest consumption quintile constituted 14 percent of all enrolled children, 22 percent were from
households in the middle consumption quintile, and 22 percent were from households in the top quintile.
The situation reverses in secondary school, with children enrolled from the lowest consumption quintile
constituting only 11 percent of enrolled children, compared to 23 percent from the highest.

141.      Findings of a partial BIA suggest that public expenditure on tertiary education is highly
regressive (Figure 56). A mere 3 percent of students enrolled in public tertiary education institutions
come from the lowest consumption quintile households, compared to 80 percent from the two highest
quintiles. However, tertiary education in the FSM is not free, and data on fees paid by students were
not available at the time of writing. Presumably, the government recoups some of its expenditure
through fees. Further, scholarships are offered by the SGs and NG to students from low-income
households, and data on this are also not available. Given the disproportionally high representation of
the richest in the tertiary student population, it is likely that the incidence of tertiary education subsidy
is still quite regressive overall, but the BIA is not complete in the absence of the missing pieces of
information.

142.    Enrolments are not translating into strong learning outcomes across the country. Each
year, the national DoE in collaboration with the states’ DoE administers the National Minimum
Competency Test (NMCT) in math and reading to all the students in grades 4, 6, 8, and 10 (annex 6).
In 2013, the year for which the most recent data are available, all private and public schools were
included, and 94 percent of all schools in the country participated in the assessment. Results are
sobering: nationally, only 34 and 22 percent of children in grade 8 achieved ‘minimum competency’ or
above in reading and math, respectively. Performance across states varied widely. In reading, a mere
17 percent of children were minimally competent or above in Chuuk, compared to 56 percent in Kosrae.
In math, performance ranged from 10 percent of children achieving minimum competence or above in

                                                      71
Chuuk to 42 percent of children in Kosrae.42 Low learning across the states was confirmed in the
baseline Early Grade Learning Assessments conducted in Kosrae and a limited number of schools in
Pohnpei, with 80 percent of the grade 5 children sampled in Pohnpei performing at the ‘developing’
level or lower in English literacy and 52 percent of grade 3 children in Kosrae in numeracy (ADB 2015).

143.    Assessment results indicate that children learn little in schools, which may be due to low
teacher quality. Teacher quality has two key dimensions, teacher knowledge (what knowledge does
the teacher have that he or she can impart to students) and teacher effort (are they doing the best that
they can to impart whatever they know). In the FSM, there is room for improvement in both dimensions.
One, there is no formal teacher training institute in the country. The COM has a small program on
education, which graduated a mere 116 students in 2012–2013. Until recently, there were no minimum
qualifications or standards expected for teaching. About 68 percent of teachers in 2014 had an AA/AS
and no formal training in pedagogy, and another 16 percent had no formal degree at all. Second,
incentives for maximizing teacher effort are missing. While public service jobs are reportedly in high
demand, it is not clear how competitive the selection process is for teachers. Also, opportunities for
supervision are limited in many schools. The smallest schools are concentrated in the most remote
locations, typically the OI, and are in contact with mainland authorities by radio only.

144.      The current organization of the education system reflects a supply-driven formulaic
approach, lacking provider accountability, and relatedly, incentives for performance. Most of the
efficiency and equity analysis in this PER relied on budget data instead of actual spending. This is
because beyond certain state-level aggregates, the NG does not require detailed reporting on use of
resources or performance. Without such information, it is impossible to hold state education authorities
accountable for performance or to perform regular M&E. Further, the limited data that could be used
reflect the underlying input-based approach to service delivery, where budgets are allocated on the basis
of a centrally determined formula43 and an implicit policy objective of bringing service delivery as close
as possible to beneficiaries within a given resource envelope. Finally, at the level of schools, there are
no incentives for performance. Schools are financed on the basis of requested budgets, with no
consideration for performance or learning in classrooms. Teacher salaries are determined by SGs, with
little accountability to the communities they serve. The FSM needs to move away from a supply-driven
formulaic approach to operating schools to one focused on supporting and rewarding performance. This
is not possible without information made available on time and without providers made accountable for
their performance, with rewards and penalties awarded accordingly.




42
  Before 2013, assessment data are available for 2012 only, and there has been no significant change in outcomes since then.
43Resources for the education sectors are largely derived through the U.S. CSGs. These grants are shared among the states
based on the distribution formula. The distribution formula divides resources based largely on population, with the remainder
equally divided among the states, irrespective of size, geography, poverty, and capacity. There are also no performance-based
incentives in the current resource allocation model. The distribution formula has been changed several times over the past 2 –
3 years. However, changes to resource allocation are not based on changing needs but are centrally and supply driven.

                                                             72
              Box 9. How Can Information for Accountability Improve Learning Outcomes?
 There are three main accountability channels through which information could affect learning outcomes:
 (a)       Increasing choice. Providing parents with hard evidence about learning outcomes at alternative
 schools allows parents and students to optimally go to their preferred schools. In a context where there is a
 choice of schools and where school-level resources are linked to attendance, the information about learning
 outcomes can have two effects. First, it can reduce the information asymmetry between service providers (who
 know substantially more about what is going on in the schools) and service users. Second, the enhanced
 competitive pressure induced by a more effective choice can induce providers to improve quality. Both of these
 effects increase client power in the provision of services.
 (b)       Increasing participation. By publicizing rights, roles, and responsibilities and by documenting
 service delivery shortfalls relative to other schools in the village, district, province, or country, information can
 be a motivator for action on the part of parents and other stakeholders. Lack of information could lead parents
 and other stakeholders to believe that performance is adequate—in turn leading to complacency. The provision
 of information can rebalance the relationship between users and providers and spur users to action, including
 increased or more effective oversight of schools —thereby also increasing client power. The logical chain is
 that provider effort increases as a result of this intensified oversight, thereby improving education quality.
 (c)       Increasing voice. Providing credible information can allow parents and other stakeholders to lobby
 governments more effectively for improved policies, either at the local or national level. It provides content to
 feed the voice that citizens use to pressure governments and hold them to account. Information can expose
 shortcomings and biases, and its wide dissemination can overcome information asymmetries that perpetuate
 inequalities (Keefer and Khemani 2005; Majumdar, Mani, and Mukand 2004). Finally, information can become
 the basis for political competition (Khemani 2007).

145.    The anticipated decline in financial resources for education underscores the urgent need
to investigate ways to reorganize services to improve value from current investments. Low
learning in FSM schools indicates that the country is not reaping the full benefits from its education
investments. This, in a context of shrinking resources, renders it critical to look for ways to increase the
value gained from each dollar invested. This section has highlighted the key shortcomings of the
existing system, where improvements could help the overall efficiency of the system. On the
expenditure side, the high allocation to administrative costs across the GoFSM indicates that they
should be further scrutinized. The most urgent need, however, is for improvement in learning outcomes
across the four states, at all levels of the system. Merely changing spending patterns and allocating
resources differently will not help with this. It is imperative that the FSM look at the current model of
service delivery and identify ways to reorganize it so that value for resources invested can be improved.
The next section has some recommendations to this end.

4.5      Conclusion

146.     This section recommends core action areas that could help strengthen accountability and
improve service delivery. Strengthening accountability and fixing service delivery is a long-term
process, which will require deeper sector-specific analysis in the areas of primary, secondary, and
tertiary education services. This goes well beyond the scope of this chapter. Instead, this chapter
recommends a number of core action areas. In each area, further analytical work will shed light on the
costs (direct and indirect) and benefits of proposed strategies. The biggest cost of inaction by far is
continued low return to a large investment and opportunity costs of what those resources could have
been put to use instead. A decline in resources will likely only have a negative impact on the system’s
already low quality and outcomes, similar to, for example, the decline in enrolments witnessed in
countries undergoing structural economic reforms that affected financing and governance of the
education sector in the 1990s.



                                                          73
Knowledge Gaps to Be Filled Urgently

147.       Further sector-specific analysis based on improved data sources should investigate the
scope for efficiency improvements through reallocation of resources, starting with the high
administrative costs. The low return on education investments highlights the need for closer
examination of resource allocation within the sector and how well the input-based financing to states
corresponds to actual needs across the states. The smaller states of Yap and Kosrae spent roughly twice
as much per capita as Pohnpei, but outcomes are not significantly better than in the latter. All states
earmark a large portion of the education budget for administrative and other state-level programs.
Ostensibly, such state-administered programs aim to support schools, but little information is publicly
available on how these are targeted or their specific activities. Further, given that these budget lines
have existed now for quite some time, with little change in allocations, and outcomes have changed
little in the meanwhile, there is now an urgent need to unpack and assess the function and usefulness of
these programs. Overall, from an efficiency perspective, it is a priority to ascertain whether or how
schools benefit from this highly centralized administrative spending and whether there is room to reduce
this spending and generate savings for investing elsewhere in the sector while maintaining or improving
outcomes.

148.    Low performance in national assessments indicates the need to diagnose critical learning
needs, followed by teacher training and skill building to improve teacher knowledge and
classroom practice. Children cannot learn if a teacher is not effective. Evidence from around the world
underscores how exposure to a good teacher can generate lifelong benefits. As a first step, a diagnostic
exercise is needed across all states to identify the most critical areas for improvement in teaching and
classroom practice. Early grade reading and math assessments generate information on student
performance and reveal the specific domains of learning that can be targeted and improved upon through
classroom practices. Teacher training and professional development can then focus on these areas.44

Core Action Areas for the Medium Term

149.    Further analytical work in the medium term can shed light on how to improve equity (and
enrolments) at the primary and secondary levels. As discussed earlier, the regressivity of public
spending reflects the population of out-of-school children who primarily come from the lowest
consumption households. Further work is needed to understand what keeps these children out of school
and confirm whether indirect and opportunity costs of education pose a significant constraint (i.e.
distance to school, need to help at home, poor academic performance). In secondary education,
enrolments could be improved through interventions in two areas. First, poor learning at the primary
level suggests that very few children will be motivated or able to stay in the system after completing
primary school. Thus, improving learning in primary schools should improve retention of students at
higher levels. Second, to the extent that secondary schooling is seen as a means to access higher
education and better-paid jobs, secondary school enrolments are unlikely to improve unless returns to
schooling are perceived to rise. This in turn depends on how well secondary school and higher education
learning align with economic opportunities and needs for skills.45


44 In Pohnpei and Kosrae, a modified version of these assessments has already been implemented under the ADB-supported
Quality Primary Education in the North Pacific. The project supported development, piloting, and implementation of an Early
Grade Learning Assessment, a survey tool that enables education practitioners to track student progress in literacy and
numeracy development and delivered teacher professional development focused on areas in need of improvement. Follow-up
of children after one year indicated significant improvements, with a 21 percentage point increase in children assessed to be
at the proficient or advanced levels in reading and a similar improvement in numeracy (ADB Quality Primary Education in
the North Pacific reports, 2015). Other FSM states may benefit from a similar exercise.
45 If the expenditure analysis recommended earlier reveals that there is room for cutting back on centrally incurred NG or SG

expenses, the potential savings generated could help improve equity by allowing a diversion of resources to programs targeting

                                                             74
150.    To improve the return on its education investments, the FSM must shift its focus from
managing financial and other inputs to improving provider accountability and performance.
Beyond the closer examination of certain expenditure pockets suggested earlier, efficiency gains in the
FSM cannot be realized with a mere reallocation of resources from one part of the sector to another,
without fixing the organization of service delivery, and, in particular, its lack of incentives and
accountability. Learning outcomes will not improve if schools continue to be financed on the basis of
requested budgets, with no consideration for performance or learning in classrooms or with teachers
who are accountable more to remote SGs than to the communities they serve.

151.    A key step to strengthening accountability is to build school capacity to make and
implement key decisions while enhancing school autonomy in the long term. Across the world,
countries have adopted varied strategies to strengthen the capacity of schools to plan, manage, and
execute activities to improve education outcomes. One approach is school grants, where a
predetermined amount of money is awarded competitively, or by other predefined allocation rules, to
schools based on the proposals they submit. Capacity-building efforts to strengthen school-level
planning and support from central authorities to clearly define roles and responsibilities usually
accompany such programs. In Mongolia, for example, a recently launched school grants program aims
to promote design and execution of cocurricular activities to improve teaching and learning processes
as well as learning outcomes in reading and math and strengthen school-level planning of activities by
the school community (teachers, school principals, administrators, students, and school board members)
to improve the learning environment of the school. Annex 7 highlights another example from Myanmar.
In Tonga, a school grants scheme was very well received, with high satisfaction rates expressed by
beneficiaries and reduced inequality in availability of learning materials across schools.46

152.     Such school-based management can be a powerful tool to improve education outcomes,
but its success depends critically on design of the right incentives for performance. Enhanced
school-level management and autonomy have to be balanced by providers accountable to school
communities who are empowered to voice preferences, needs, and priorities; otherwise, low levels of
accountability can constrain effectiveness of autonomy policies (Hanushek et al. 2012). Accountability
in turn rests foremost on availability of information on performance that is generated and disseminated
regularly. As seen earlier, such information is not available in the FSM. This weakens citizens’ power
to hold providers accountable and also weakens their voices relative to policy makers and politicians.
When information can be successfully used to promote effective choice and competition and enable
citizens to participate in school oversight and management, it can lead to improved educational
outcomes (Box 9). Subsequent to this, community involvement and ownership of schools require a
process or mechanism that allows local education stakeholders to get involved in school decision-
making processes and management, for example, create school committees that may monitor the
school’s performance in test scores or teacher and student attendance; appoint, suspend, dismiss, and
remove teachers and ensure that teachers’ salaries are paid regularly; and approve (albeit rarely) annual
budgets, including the development budget, and examine financial statements.

Core Action Areas for the Long Term

153.    In the long term, improvements in teaching quality are contingent on creation of a stock
of high-quality candidates and teacher management policies that reward and retain only the best.
Training to improve teacher skills among existing teachers is a remedial measure that is not efficient in


demand-side constraints found to keep children out of school, especially in Chuuk. Of note are cash transfer programs that
have shown promise in many other settings.
46 No data on impacts on management at the school level or on learning outcomes were collected.



                                                           75
the long term. The key is to attract the most motivated candidates to the profession. There is growing
evidence that, for reasons not fully understood, some people, regardless of training, interest, and good
intentions, are simply not effective teachers.47 To improve teacher effectiveness, the FSM could
consider (a) strengthening the existing education program at the COM to provide preservice teacher
training that is mapped to state-specific learning needs; (b) creating incentives for high-ability
secondary school candidates to enter the program and the teaching profession; (c) raising the profile of
the teaching profession through higher entry requirements; and (d) reforming teacher management
policies to retain only the best performing teachers in the long term. Pay-for-performance programs
could also be piloted in states with the capacity to administer these programs. In contrast to other
incentives for teachers, both contracts without guaranteed tenure and pay-for-performance programs
establish direct links between teachers’ performance and rewards or sanctions (annex 9).

154.     Further sector work should explore optimal service delivery organization in the FSM,
focusing on the special issues of low-STR and low-performance schools. Students enrolled in remote
schools are among the lowest performers in the country. Attendance at school where a child is not likely
to add to his or her learning is like not going to a school at all—and given the expense incurred, it
becomes important to assess the value add of these schools from the perspective of communities
benefiting from them. Even if these children perform poorly on national assessments, are there other
local skill needs being met by these schools? Costs could be reduced by exploring alternative strategies
for deployment of personnel, such as assigning teachers to teach multiple grades. The broader
nationwide efforts to improve teacher quality, described earlier, should also help.48




47
   Research confirms that teacher effectiveness does increase during the first three years of teaching. Contrary to the belief
that attrition should be avoided as teachers become more effective with confidence gained over time, there is no evidence that
the trend continues after three years. Further, there appear to be no clear methods for transforming ineffective teachers into
effective ones, and rapid assessment, coupled with the termination of new teachers early in their careers, may be the most cost-
effective strategy for increasing student learning (Yen and Ritter 2009; Bressoux, Kramarz, and Proust 2009; and McKee,
Rivkin, Sims 2010).
48 The high per capita expenditure on small, remote, difficult-to-supervise schools poses a special challenge. Attracting good

teachers to these schools is difficult and supervision opportunities are minimal, and both factors make management to improve
quality challenging. Any analysis undertaken on this front should also take into account that efforts to provide expensive,
targeted supervision support and TA to improve management of teaching and learning in these difficult-to-reach schools will
only increase already large education expenditures.

V.          Health Sector Issues

5.1         Structure of the Health System in the FSM

155.     The FSM’s health care system is organized into three levels. The three levels in health care
are the national, state, and municipal levels. At the national level, the DoH has no direct role in the
provision of health care services but is limited to health planning, donor coordination, and technical and
training assistance. It also has an implied role in quality assurance and health standards. The DoH
services in each state is responsible for running state curative, preventive, and public health services,
including the main hospital, peripheral health centers, and primary care centers, generally called
dispensaries. Most DoH services have minimal capabilities for planning and programming and have
structurally weak management systems. There is a main hospital in each state. For residents who live
on the OI, access is difficult because of the lack of public transportation between the islands.
Dispensaries typically are located in island municipalities based on population, need, and political
considerations. Finally, in the municipalities (including the outlying islands), there are dispensaries
similar to health clinics (posts). These dispensaries are part of the state health department, but their day-
to-day operations are under the supervision of the mayors in which the dispensaries are located. Services
that can be provided at the dispensaries through the health assistants staffed at these dispensaries are
mainly diagnosis and treatment of common ailments. The more advanced cases are referred to the state
hospitals. All health facilities are publicly funded, but hospitals are mandated to charge fees for some
services. Hospitals thus operate mainly on the basis of input-based public financing, but they also
recover some costs from insurance plans for services provided to patients covered under insurance.

156.    In 2011,49 the FSM had a total of 5 hospitals and 117 public health and other facilities.
Each of the four states had one public hospital in 2014 (Table 11); Pohnpei was the only state with a
second private hospital. Hospitals in the FSM employ doctors, nurses, and other health staff and provide
both inpatient and outpatient primary and secondary care. Other health facilities, of which dispensaries
form the largest share, do not employ doctors or nurses and provide preventive and promotive care, as
well as basic outpatient curative care. Of these, Chuuk, the largest state with roughly half of the
country’s population, has the largest share (70 facilities). Kosrae, in comparison, with the smallest
population (7 percent of the population) operates five aid posts only.

157.     Population coverage per nonhospital health facility is low, for less densely populated
states, reflecting the desire to place these facilities as close as possible to beneficiaries. Population

covered per nonhospital health facility50 in the FSM varies from 480 per facility in Yap to 2,863 in
Pohnpei (Table 11). Pohnpei has the same population density as Yap,51 but overall the population is less
dispersed with a smaller fraction resident in the state’s OI. To compensate for the high population
dispersion, Yap has more nonhospital facilities than Pohnpei, and the population covered per facility is
six times higher in Pohnpei than in Yap. Kosrae’s entire population is resident on one island only, but
the state still has the lowest population density in the country. To compensate for the sparse population,
the number of facilities is higher than could be expected on the basis of population alone and also results
in high population coverage (1,263 per facility). Chuuk has the highest population density among the
four states and roughly half the population of the country—still, the population covered per facility is
four times lower than in Pohnpei. Thus, relative to Pohnpei, each of the other three states has a
significantly higher density of health service coverage. Overall, the lower the population density of the
state, the lower the population coverage per nonhospital health facility, which reflects an attempt to
place services as close as possible to beneficiaries.

158.     Pohnpei receives a very high proportion of total outpatient visits in the FSM, relative to
its share both in the country’s population and in the total number of health care facilities. Of the
total 357,445 outpatient visits that took place in the FSM during 2014, 50 percent occurred in Pohnpei,
even though the state has only 36 percent of the country’s population. As seen above, Pohnpei also has
the lowest density of health service coverage among the four states. Further, while Yap and Kosrae
receive outpatient visits consistent with their population shares (14 and 7 percent, respectively), Chuuk
receives significantly less, at only 28 percent of total outpatient visits in the FSM. One possibility is
that Pohnpei’s resident population tends to use health services a lot more than the other states, on a per
capita basis. Limited evidence from the 2013 HIES suggests this might be a partial cause: among those
with long-term illness, household members were between 8 and 12 percentage points (in Kosrae and
Yap, respectively) likelier to use health services than in the other three states. Another possibility is that
Pohnpei receives a higher share of visits from out-of-state residents, but facility-level data are not
available to confirm this. Taken by itself, it is hard to determine whether the higher-than-expected use
of the Pohnpei state hospital is a good or bad thing: on the one hand, it may lead to congestion and long
wait times for patients (no data are available to confirm this). On the other hand, if the high use is due
to out-of-state beneficiaries bypassing local health facilities, then this may indicate that the quality of
care at Pohnpei state hospital is significantly superior to that in other health facilities in the country.

159.     Health care is provided either free or at very little out-of-pocket (OOP) cost, and coverage
of health insurance schemes is low. In the FSM, OOP expenditure on health rose slowly from 4.7
percent of total (that is, public and private) expenditure on health care in 2004 to 9.5 percent in 2013
(WHO 2015). While the distribution of OOP expenditure across socioeconomic classes is not known,
the overall spending is quite low compared to other countries. Interviews conducted for this PER
revealed that central health authorities believe that cost recovery at health facilities, particularly
hospitals, is very low. While hospitals have set fees for services, most people either do not pay these
fees at all or do not pay the entire amount.52 Finally, publicly funded insurance schemes cover a very
small fraction of the population. Currently, the Micare and Chuuk health care plans enroll just under a
fifth of the FSM’s population.53 While the exact share is not known, health insurance enrolment is

50 Henceforth, this chapter refers to all facilities other than hospitals as ‘nonhospital health facilities’. Among nonhospital
health facilities, the differences between the different types of facilities are minimal, as these employ non-physician staff only
and no nurses and provide limited curative care.
51 Chuuk has a population density of 383 people per km2, Pohnpei 106, Yap 96, and Kosrae 60 (FSM 2010 Census of

Population and Housing, SBOC).
52 Health authorities believe that the primary reason underlying low or insufficient payments is a law that mandates that all

hospitals treat patients, regardless of their ability to pay.
53 With low OOP payments at health facilities, high coverage among this class of the population could mean that the more

socioeconomically advantaged segment of the population is also the one that is making payments into the health system.

concentrated among government employees, indicating high coverage among the wealthier in the
country. Given the low OOP payments at health facilities, high coverage among this class of the
population implies that those better-off in the country are the ones making payments into the health
system. Information on contribution rates and other aspects of insurance was not available at the time
of writing. Also, data on the share of insurance in health financing were not available.

160.     To access tertiary care, state health departments refer patients to hospitals abroad, and
until recently, associated costs of treatment were covered by the states. The FSM’s health system
is beginning to encounter second-generation challenges that extend beyond the concerns of primary and
secondary care, which leads to a growing demand for complex services that are not available in the
FSM. Such cases are treated with off-island referrals to other countries, including Guam. While data on
the total number of off-island referrals were not available at the time of writing, government reports
show that off-island referrals constituted 9 percent of public health expenditure in 2014. Interviews
conducted for this PER revealed that states are now mandated to cover referral and treatment costs only
for patients covered by a health insurance scheme; however, no data are currently available on how
effectively this policy is being enforced or on its welfare impacts.

5.2                        Expenditure Trends

161.    Like education, total spending on health declined between 2010 and 2012 and remained
flat thereafter. With CSGs funding the bulk of health sector spending and the planned Compact
decrements, it is not surprising that between 2010 and 2014, nominal recurrent expenditure on health
hovered between US$31 and 32 million per year (Figure 57). In real terms, expenditure declined from
US$26.8 million to US$23.6 million between 2010 and 2012 and then increased to US$24.2 million in
2014. SG spending patterns in health followed similar trends, given the bulk of the service delivery
functions occur at the states (Figure 58).

164.     Most of the expenditure takes place at the states, with per capita expenditure in health
varying significantly across states. SG expenditures combined accounted for between 78 and 80
percent of the total government expenditure on health in recent years (Figure 58). Chuuk absorbs the
largest share, followed by Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae. Per capita expenditures vary significantly between
states, with expenditures in Yap and Kosrae almost twice as high as those in Chuuk and Pohnpei (Figure
60 and Figure 61). In 2014, Yap incurred the highest per capita public expenditure among all states, at
US$466, followed closely by Kosrae (US$427), with Pohnpei and Chuuk spending almost half as much
at US$208 and US$207, respectively. Further, Kosrae and Yap have recently experienced significantly
larger increases in per capita expenditures in real terms, compared to Pohnpei and Chuuk—between
2012 and 2014, real per capita expenditure rose by 18 and 31 percent in Kosrae and Yap, respectively,
by 3 percent in Chuuk, and declined in Pohnpei by 9 percent.

equipment to remote health facilities in the latter two states.

166.    However, poor procurement processes contribute to low quality and inefficiencies in
spending on pharmaceutical and medical products. Various reports document issues in the FSM’s
procurement practices surrounding pharmaceuticals and medical supplies (Office of National Public
Auditor 2014, 2015 performance audits). In Pohnpei, between FY2011 and FY2013, purchases worth
US$3.8 million of medical and pharmaceutical supplies could not be tracked or provided with inventory
accountability due to the absence of an inventory management system, and deliveries worth another
US$415,000 for FY2012 and FY2013 could not be accounted for. Receipt of quality medicines could
not be ensured due to lack of quality assurance mechanisms. In Chuuk, audits reveal that supplies were
bought with short shelf life, and supplies worth US$324,000 were not delivered on time. This lack of
procurement accountability leads to increased risk of theft, loss, misuse, abuse, and inefficient spending.
Frequent use of emergency orders has increased the cost of buying medicines, particular in Chuuk,
where costs were estimated to increase by 76 percent on average. In Pohnpei, over US$400,000 could
have been saved through competitive bidding and US$379,000 in Chuuk.

54Expenditure classifications by type (for example, personnel) were only available for financing that was reported on in Annual
Compact Reports. For total health spending, there are at times large differences between the amounts reported in the Annual
Compact Reports and those in the government audit reports. In 2014, these amounted to a total of US$1,988,295, US$679,297,
and US$2,637,770 in Yap, Kosrae, and Pohnpei, respectively. This expenditure is thus at the moment unclassifiable.

                                                                           81
167.     The overall level of health expenditure is linked to resource allocation decisions
surrounding the use of grant funds, which finance the bulk of health expenditures in the FSM. As
shown in the introduction section, the structure of the amended Compact entailed a series of sector
grants with around one-fifth of CSGs used for the health sector. Within this envelope, CSGs are shared
across states based on the distribution formula that roughly shares one-third of CSGs equally across the
states, with the remainder share based on the population of the states. This results in the smaller states
receiving a relatively large share of the resources on a per capita basis, and this is also reflected in the
pattern of expenditures observed in this section.

168.     Classification categories currently used to report allocation of resources within the sector
do not shed light on how resources flow across facilities nor on how well critical functions, for
example, prevention, are financed. Breakdown of health expenditures by level of facility was not
available for any of the states, so this report attempted to use budget data for 2014 to explore potential
breakdowns of the data (Box 10). Budget categories varied significantly across states and do not allow
a meaningful comparison across states. Health administration costs vary widely between the states —
Yap allocates a mere 3 percent of its budget to this and Pohnpei and Kosrae 16 and 46 percent,
respectively, while in Chuuk they cannot be separated from the other budget categories, which is a
concern in its own right. Further analytical work using expenditure data is needed to ascertain whether
or how health facilities benefit from this centralized administrative spending. Another complication is
that budget categories overlap between type of facilities (hospital versus nonhospital facility or clinic)
and programs, which can be administered at any of these facilities. Because of this, the estimates
presented here for the breakdown by type of facility should be treated with a great deal of caution.
Overall, hospitals receive a large allocation in each state, and this is not problematic in and of itself and
is to be expected, as the usage of hospitals is high. Further analytical work would be needed to help
identify inefficiencies in spending within hospitals and how health care delivered here could be
improved. Beyond that, it is impossible with these data to link expenditure patterns with the health
outcomes observed. Kosrae has arguably the best health outcomes in the country (lowest infant
mortality rate [IMR] and highest immunization rates), and it appears to spend relatively more on
preventive health as a share of its total budget. However, in the absence of reliable prevention estimates
in the other states, it is hard to draw conclusions about how well the structure of health spending maps
to actual needs on the ground.


                  Box 10. How Are Resources Allocated within the FSM’s Health System?
 Breakdown of health expenditures by level of facility was not available for any of the states, so this report
 attempted to use budget data for 2014 to explore potential breakdowns of the data (Table 11). Budget item
 categories varied significantly across states and do not allow a meaningful comparison across states. Another
 complication is that budget categories overlap between type of facilities (hospital versus public health facility
 or clinic) and programs, which can be administered at any of these facilities. Finally, the underlying budget
 numbers on which these estimates are based add up to a total of US$28.7 million, whereas the total health
 expenditure in both 2013 and 2014 was roughly US$31.2 million. Because of this, the estimates presented here
 for the breakdown by type of facility should be treated with a great deal of caution.

   • In Chuuk, the largest budget category (76 percent of the state’s health budget) was ‘hospital and
     management’, but it was not clear whether this allocation was for hospitals only or included Chuuk
     DoH administrative expenditures. The allocation for dispensaries constituted 10 percent of the health
     budget, while preventive activities were allocated 8 percent. The ‘other’ category for Chuuk included
     dental care only (5 percent of budget).
   • Kosrae had budget breakdown available for only four categories: Office of the Director and Division
     of Administrative Services (46 percent), Division of Curative Services (37 percent), and Division of
     Preventive Services (17 percent). The budget for curative care could not be disaggregated by level of
     facility (hospitals versus dispensaries).



                                                        82
   • Pohnpei allocated 32 percent of its health budget to its public hospital, 7 percent to dispensaries, 16
     percent to cover administrative state-level expenses, and 9 percent to disease-specific programs; these
     included tuberculosis elimination, diabetes, and maternal and child health. The budget for prevention
     is low, likely because many of these expenditures are covered under disease-specific programs that
     include preventable infectious diseases, although this needs to be investigated further. A large portion
     of the budget is allocated for medical supplies and drugs (22 percent); however, this also cannot be
     disaggregated by level of facility. A final 3 percent was allocated for the community health center.
   • State-level administration budget is very low in Yap compared to the other states, at only 3 percent.
     Twenty-four percent was allocated to the public hospital. Forty-one percent of the expenditure went
     to three categories, namely health services, medical supplies, and ‘primary section’, and could not be
     categorized by level or type of health facility. Another 14 per cent went to the state’s four community
     health centers. As with Pohnpei, the budget allocation for prevention is low (2 percent) and is likely
     covered under another category—for example, disease-specific programs (6 percent). The other (10
     percent) includes medical referrals, dental care, and family planning.
   • Roughly 20 percent of the FMS’s health expenditure takes place at the national level. In 2014, of the
     US$6.08 million budgeted for the NG, roughly 4 percent was allocated for health system support and
     for the Environmental Health Services Unit, but no further breakdown was available for the allocations
     marked ‘Federal DoH programs’ and ‘U.S. federal health programs’, which together accounted for 87
     percent of the budget.

169.      A BIA could not be carried out as the needed beneficiary data are not available. The 2013
HIES did not collect data on health facility utilization that would permit a BIA to be carried out. For
example, data needed would include information on use of outpatient and inpatient care for all
household members and the type of health facility accessed (that is, public or private and the health
facility level). Currently, data on provider use are only collected for household members suffering from
long-term (ongoing) illness.

170.     Current patterns of public and private spending on health indicate a financing model that
may not be sustainable in the long term. Overall, public spending on health in the FSM is high relative
to peer island states. At the same time, payments into the health system are low, as evidenced by reports
of lower-than-mandated, or even zero, OOP payments at health facilities. Contributions into the publicly
funded insurance scheme are also low due to low population coverage. These expenditure patterns, in
the light of a shrinking resource envelope in coming years, raise grave concerns about the sustainability
of the system in the medium to long term. Further analytical work should look at the fee structure at
health facilities, its enforcement, pricing of services and premiums under existing publicly funded
health insurance schemes and their viability, and welfare implications.

171.     Public expenditure on health in the FSM is also relatively high with regard to basic health
outcomes financed by these expenditures. Among the Pacific Islands, the FSM is a low performer on
immunization coverage (figure 63). For the diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) vaccine, the
coverage rate among children between the ages of 12 and 23 months stands at 81 percent, the third
lowest rate in the group, in spite of the fact that the better-performing states are all relatively lower
spenders on health as a share of GDP. Tonga, which spends on health significantly less than the FSM
as a share of GDP, still has a similar vaccination rate. Each of the small Caribbean states has vaccination
rates higher than those in the FSM, at significantly lower health expenditures as a share of GDP—the
lowest performer among these (Suriname) has a DPT vaccination rate of 86 percent. On other outcomes
as well, the FSM does not perform as well as could be expected given the country’s level of spending
on health. Among the Pacific Island states, the FSM has the third highest infant mortality after Kiribati
and the Marshall Islands (30), the third highest under-5 mortality, and maternal mortality close to the
median in the group.

172.    Efficiency with regard to ability to convert inputs into outcomes varies considerably
across states. The high expenditure on health across the GoFSM and the distribution of per capita
expenditure across the SGs, when considered in conjunction with performance on basic health
outcomes, suggest striking differences between states in how effectively they convert resources into
outputs and outcomes (figure 63). In 2014, despite spending roughly at the same level of per capita as
Pohnpei, Chuuk lagged behind in immunization coverage by 30 percentage points and had an IMR
twice as high as that in Pohnpei. Yap and Kosrae spent twice as much as Pohnpei in per capita terms,



                                                                                     84
but immunization rates exceeded that in Pohnpei only by 6 and 8 percentage points, respectively. Kosrae
had the same IMR as Pohnpei, while that in Yap was more than twice as high.

173.     Given the FSM’s geographic dispersal, the state-based delivery systems are considered to
be the only feasible way of administering health in the FSM, but there are challenges. Given the
geographic dispersal, remote nature, and cultural diversity of many island communities, these state-
based systems for health delivery of services have the best chance, in theory, of developing more
responsive and effective services to meet the needs of the community. However, most observers of the
health system maintain that there is a need for a collaborative approach between the states and the DoH
to achieve national standards of health care and reporting. As the states are responsible for providing
health services with control over the bulk of health budgetary provisions, the DoH, as the national body
for health policy development, has limited capacity to affect state policy and planning frameworks. The
partnership between NG and SGs for health services could be improved through strengthened
collaboration and cooperation.

174.     Immunization rates are low, particularly in Chuuk. Given the level of spending, the
foundational public health is not sound. The immunization rate among two-year-old children in the
country was a mere 73 percent overall in 2014, varying from 46 percent in Chuuk to 85 percent in
Kosrae (figure 64). Thus, the goal of universal immunization is not being reached, raising serious public
health concerns. While high rates of incomplete immunization suggest the need to scale up existing
public health systems and delivery, non-immunization indicates that the system may not be working at
all for some people. The principal concern for further research is to investigate whether these trends in
non-immunization are merely due to reporting errors from the method of disease surveillance used, or
if these speak to deeper systemic shortcomings within the public health system.

175.     Skilled attendance at birth is high, but use of prenatal health services is low. With nearly
9 out of 10 births occurring in health facilities, skilled attendance at birth is high in the FSM (UNICEF
2012). Women’s access to reproductive health services, however, remains relatively low. Data show
that few women start antenatal care in the first trimester of their pregnancy. In 2010, around half of
pregnant women received ‘adequate’ antenatal care, and only a third of infants were born to pregnant
women who received prenatal care beginning in the first trimester. As with the data on immunization

                                                   85
rates, low access to antenatal care reflects low reach of education and counselling messages and of
preventive and promotive health interventions in general.

                         Box 11. Why Protect and Bolster Investments in Public Health?
 In a free market, public health goods like immunization and vector control will be undersupplied by private
 providers as the true marginal costs of production will not be recouped by providers (Hemenway 1994) due to
 the existence of positive externalities. In addition, even families who are fully aware of the benefits of
 immunization may have insufficient incentive to ensure that their children are vaccinated. Government
 involvement is thus necessary to strengthen household demand and correct market failures. The marginal
 benefit of an intervention in public health is far greater than the marginal benefit from investment in curative
 care, and public health interventions improve the efficiency of the health system. Investments in the right public
 health measures reduce exposure to risk of disease, dramatically improving efficiency and hence the impact of
 curative health care services. Strong public health systems, by preventing illness, debility, and death, protect
 communities against the large economic costs associated with controlling disease outbreaks (Gupta and Rani
 2004). An absent doctor cannot cure a sick child, but an effective sanitation system protects children on an
 ongoing basis (Muralidharan et al. 2006). Finally, an investment in public health is an investment in the poor.
 Poor people suffer more from infectious diseases compared to the rich (Chaudhury, Hammer, and Pokharel
 2008; Mahal et al. 2001).

176.      Low use of nonhospital facilities, with people preferring to travel long distances to access
care at hospitals, suggests low quality and potential inefficiencies in the system. A closer look at
the distribution of outpatient visits across hospitals and nonhospital care facilities sheds light on
potential underlying inefficiencies in the system. Although Yap has the highest density of nonhospital
services in the FSM, only 36 percent of all outpatient visits in the state annually take place in these
facilities—the remaining all occur at the state’s hospital. This translated into 0.06 visits per nonhospital
facility per population covered, annually, compared to 2.8 visits per population covered at the state
hospital (Table 13). The share was similar in Kosrae, at 35 percent (0.28 visits per population covered
per nonhospital facility versus 2.5 visits at the state hospital). When combined with the fact that these
two states are also the highest spenders on health in per capita terms, these numbers point to high
inefficiencies in the system: in Yap and Kosrae, users of the health system prefer to bypass relatively
close and easier-to-access nonhospital facilities and seek care in hospitals. In Chuuk and Pohnpei, in
contrast, roughly 75 percent of outpatient visits occurred in nonhospital facilities. There are two things
to note: one, the striking contrast between these states is that they maintain the same share of outpatient
visits in nonhospital facilities at almost the same expenditure level in per capita terms, but Pohnpei
accomplishes this at a population-to-facility ratio four times higher than that in Chuuk, as seen earlier.
Two, hospital use per population covered is significantly higher than use of nonhospital facilities in
both states.55

177.   Use of inpatient services appears to be lower than the capacity available at hospitals. Bed
occupancy rates in public hospitals are also low (Table 13). In 2013, bed occupancy rates varied from
83 percent in Kosrae to 58 percent in Chuuk. Overall, the data point to lower-than-capacity use of

55In Pohnpei, the number of visits at the state hospital per population covered annually is roughly half that in Yap and Kosrae;
this is likely due to the existence of a second private hospital, but data on visits at the private hospital were not available to
confirm this at the time of writing.

                                                               86
hospital facilities for inpatient care. Data on the one private hospital in Pohnpei were not available. The
length of stay did not vary much across the states, standing at roughly five days per inpatient episode.
While the numbers point to unused capacity at hospitals, further analytical work looking at the extent
of avoidable cause-specific mortality—along with forecasts for trends in inpatient care needs, given the
current chronic disease burden—will determine whether hospital capacity indeed exceeds needs.

178.     Limited use of nonhospital facilities could be a sign of potential weakness in the referral
system or poor quality of service delivery at these facilities. An important feature of any health
system is a well-functioning referral system that ‘screens’ patients for medical conditions, allowing
primary health care to be delivered at a lower-level facility and referring more advanced cases to a
higher-level facility. If a significant number of people are bypassing lower-level facilities to seek
treatment at government hospitals, there is a risk of overburdening higher-level facilities with a high
patient load, which might compromise the quality of care provided. Designing an appropriate course of
action will require an understanding of the factors explaining why people bypass lower-level facilities,
such as weaknesses in the referral system or perceptions of low quality of care or high closure or
absenteeism rates. Currently available data do not shed light on why lower-level facilities are bypassed.
With regard to health sector outputs, performance could be improved along some measures but is
satisfactory according to government reports,56 but no information is currently available on patient
satisfaction or quality of curative clinical care in the FSM.

179.     With the exception of Kosrae, access to improved sanitation remains low in all states.
Infectious diseases continue to take a toll in the FSM, and waterborne and food-borne diseases are major
causes of hospital admission. Updated data are not available, but between 1990 and 2003, pneumonia,
sepsis, and diarrhea were the leading killers of infants. Nearly three-quarters of reported cases of
diarrhea involved young children below the age of five in 2011. Many studies have found that poor
sanitation and unhygienic personal habits can lead to very high levels of illness (Sanan and Moulik,
2007). In the HIES (2013), the share of households with access to improved sanitation (connection to a
septic system or any type of latrine) ranged from 57 percent in Yap to 99 percent in Kosrae. Further, in
each state, the poorest households were significantly less likely to have access to improved sanitation.
The difference between the lowest and highest consumption households stood at 36 percentage points
in Chuuk and 22 percentage points in Pohnpei (in Yap, the same held true but the differences were not
statistically significant). Other sanitation efforts such as handwashing and safe water are also important.
In addition to latrine provision, campaigns for educating people about toilet use, to ensure that latrines
built by the government are, in fact, used by people, have been shown to have important sanitation
impacts (Bleakley 2007; Sanan and Moulik 2007).

180.     While coverage of public health services is low, chronic illnesses and related risk factors
are increasingly prevalent. The FSM’s infant and child mortality rates indicate a significant burden
of infectious disease, but a large share of adult mortality—67 percent of all deaths (WHO 2011)— stems
from NCDs (Table 14).57 Outdated surveys report high prevalence of chronic disease but do not allow
comparisons across economic class. The FSM’s STEPwise Approach to Chronic Disease Risk Factor
Surveillance Survey conducted in Pohnpei and Chuuk showed that in 2002 and 2006, respectively, in
the adult population ages 25–64 years, the prevalence of obesity was 42.6 percent and 47.3 percent,

56 For example, 80 percent of health facilities in Yap are stocked with essential drugs and supplies at least 80 percent of the
time, and this rises to 95 percent in Kosrae. Biomedical equipment was reported to be functional at least 80 percent of the year
in 81 percent of the health facilities in Yap, rising to 99 percent in Chuuk.
57
   The mortality estimates for the FSM have a high degree of uncertainty because they are not based on any national NCD
mortality data. The estimates are based on a combination of country life tables, cause of death models, regional cause of death
patterns, and World Health Organization (WHO) program and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS estimates for
some major causes of death (not including NCDs). Data on state-specific mortality and burden of disease are not available for
the FSM. Data on causes of outpatient and inpatient visits are collected at health facilities; however, these were only partially
available through the DoH for some facilities at the time of writing and could not be analyzed.

                                                               87
prevalence of hypertension was 21.2 percent and 15.2 percent, prevalence of diabetes was 32.1 percent
and 35.4 percent, and prevalence of elevated blood cholesterol was 46.6 percent and 19.2 percent,
respectively.58 Further, chronic-disease-related risk factors were at very high levels in Pohnpei and
Chuuk in 2006. In Pohnpei, for example, the overall prevalence of current smokers was 31.6 percent,
29.9 percent of those surveyed reported they currently chewed betel nuts, and the overall prevalence of
current alcohol drinkers (defined as those who have consumed alcohol in the past 12 months) was 28.7
percent.

                        Box 12. Strategies to Reduce Exposure to Key NCD-related Risks
 The World Bank report ‘Live Long and Prosper: Aging in East Asia and Pacific ’ (2016) documented effective
 strategies to reduce exposure to key NCD-related risks in East Asia and Pacific, particularly in the areas of
 smoking, malnutrition, alcohol use, and vaccination.

 Intervention on smoking. Control of tobacco use is as outlined in the WHO Framework Convention on
 Tobacco Control including (a) increased taxes on tobacco products; (b) enforcement of smoke-free workplaces
 and packaging and labeling of tobacco products with comprehensive health warnings supported by public
 education; and (c) banning of tobacco advertising, promoting, and sponsorship.

 Intervention on malnutrition:
     • Promotion of physical activity and dietary quality and efforts to reduce obesity, including (a) introduction
       of taxes for unhealthy food; (b) provision of subsidies for healthy food; (c) administration of marketing
       restrictions; and (d) community-based physical activity at schools, workplaces, and so on
     • Reduction of population-wide salt consumption through (a) voluntary reduction of salt levels in processed
       food and (b) food additives and sustained public education to encourage change in food choices
     • Reduction of undernutrition and low birth weight through (a) targeted interventions to reduce stunting
       and wasting in poor populations and (b) multisector interventions such as food fortifications

 Intervention in alcohol use. Reduction of population-wide harmful alcohol consumption, including: (a)
 increased taxes on alcoholic beverages; (b) limited access to retail alcohol; and (c) banning of alcohol
 advertising, promotion, and sponsorship.

 Figure 65 depicts the price of a 20-pack of cigarettes as of September 2014 using data from the draft WHO
 Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic. The red portion of each bar represents the portion that is excise tax.
 The blue portion represents the cost, insurance and freight, profit margins (for example, manufacturer,
 distributor, and so on), and other taxes (for example, import tax, sales tax, and so on). One way to help control
 chronic disease risk factors in the FSM may be to strengthen tobacco control by an incremental increase in
 excise duties, over the medium term: the WHO recommends up to 70 percent of the retail price of cigarettes.


58 Estimates based on self-reported data on chronic disease prevalence show a significantly lower incidence of disease. In the
2013 HIES, diabetes and hypertension were the most commonly reported chronic illness—ranging from 10 to 15 percent of
adults between the ages of 46–55 years and 66–75 years, respectively for diabetes, 6 to 13 percent for hypertension in the same
age groups, and 3 to 8 percent for heart disease. Self-reported prevalence of gout ranged from 2 percent in the 46–55-year age
group, to 9 percent in the 66–75-year age group. Nationally, individuals from the highest consumption quintile households
were 4 percentage points likelier to report suffering from diabetes. For hypertension, heart disease, and gout, there were no
significant differences between the rich and poor in the likelihood of reporting suffering from the disease.

                                                              88
 The FSM may also consider an increase in taxation of alcohol products as a way of reducing harmful alcohol
 consumption, as well as of products high in sugar content, given the high levels of obesity. These taxes will
 help expand fiscal space to finance interventions

181.      The FSM’s health system lacks provider accountability and, relatedly, incentives for
performance. As documented earlier, one challenge faced in producing this chapter was the difficulty
in obtaining certain types of expenditure data. Beyond certain state-level aggregates, the NG does not
require detailed reporting on use of resources or performance, for example, at the facility level. Without
this information, it is impossible to hold providers accountable for performance or to perform any kind
of regular M&E. Second, at the level of health facilities and providers, there are currently no incentives
for performance. Hospitals are financed on the traditional fee-for-service basis, which incentivizes
service volume rather than quality. Public health facilities and dispensaries are staffed by health
assistants whose salaries are determined by SGs, with little accountability to the communities they
serve. The FSM needs to move away from a supply-driven formulaic approach to operating health
facilities to one focused on supporting and rewarding performance. This is not possible without
information on key performance indicators made available on time and without providers made
accountable for their performance, with rewards and penalties awarded accordingly.

182.     Existing and emerging health challenges, in the face of shrinking financial resources,
underscore the urgent need to investigate ways to reorganize services to improve value from
current investments. The changing health care needs and growing demand for increasingly complex
care will stress the health system in coming years, which is problematic in the context of shrinking
resources. As such, it becomes critical to look for ways to increase the value gained from each dollar
invested. This section has highlighted the key shortcomings of the existing system, where improvements
could help the overall efficiency of the system. Foremost is the need to fix public health services and
bolster preventive and promotive health efforts (primary prevention). Improved primary and secondary
prevention, along with improved quality of care at health facilities, will be key to managing the
changing health needs in a financially viable way—and to curtail growth in off-island referrals. It is
imperative that the FSM look at the current model of service delivery and identify ways to reorganize
it so that value for resources invested can be improved. The next section has some recommendations to
this end.



                                                                                                                89
5.4      Conclusion

183.     This section highlights core actions and avenues to improve the efficiency of spending and
sustainability of the health sector. In the context of a declining resource envelope, this chapter shows
that public expenditure on health in the FSM is high, but the FSM’s public health and mortality
outcomes are relatively low. This is indicative of low value and return on public investments, which
may be attributable to weak provider accountability and incentives for performance but could be
improved on. Strengthening accountability and fixing service delivery are a long-term process that will
require deeper sector-specific analysis in the areas of public health and outpatient and inpatient curative
services. This goes well beyond the scope of this chapter. Instead, this chapter recommends a number
of core action areas for each subsector. In each area, further analytical work will shed light on the costs
(direct and indirect) and benefits of proposed strategies.

Knowledge Gaps to Be Filled Urgently

184.     Improved reporting of data is needed to support design and implementation of existing
and new policies. The generation and dissemination of data concerning the health system is a core
public health responsibility. Data on health expenditures, budgets, service use, and other operational
data will be needed to analyze the welfare impacts of any new policy the department intends to pursue,
including consolidation or localization of services. These data are also needed for regular monitoring
of the system. For example, data on health spending by type of facility will allow analysis of spending
by various levels of the sector. Breakdown of hospital spending data by spending on personnel,
consumables, and so on will help inform design of strategies to improve efficiency within hospitals. In
addition, reporting on expenditures and budgets should be standardized across states, facilitating
identification of drivers of cost, and inform policy making. Other avenues for improvement may also
be considered at a later stage.59

185.     Future analytical work based on improved data should investigate the scope for efficiency
and equity improvements through reallocation of resources within the sector or for savings. While
the reorganization of services recommended later in this section may help get better value out of current
investments, current resource allocation patterns need to be further investigated to see whether there are
pockets of expenditure that could be cut back without affecting outcomes or whether there is any scope
for reallocations within the system that could improve system efficiency and equity.

186.    A review of resource allocation formulae will help resolve any disconnect between state-
specific per capita expenditures and actual needs on the ground. As in the education sector, the
variation in per capita expenditures across the states does not reflect demand for services on the ground,
but rather a centrally determined formula for allocation of resources across the states (chapter 2). To
improve health outcomes and equity in distribution of health resources across the states, the GoFSM, ,
may consider a review of the various transfer formulae. The appropriate mix of health financing
modalities, for example, fixed allocation to health facilities depending service volume, capitation, and
performance-based payments, depends on local administrative capacity and will require further study.
Needless to say, core public health functions such as surveillance and outbreak response should be
nationally managed and funded. The ideal financing model will also depend on the organization of
service delivery. For example, if delivery of preventive and curative outpatient care is localized, a new

59
   This may include (a) administration of multipurpose health surveys that collect household-level information on health
service utilization, individual-level health status and outcomes, and financing of medical expenditures (the existing HIES
questionnaires can be easily modified to accommodate this); (b) information to monitor the quality of services provided in
government facilities and not just their coverage; (c) data for studies to analyze the financial viability of existing public
insurance schemes; and (d) adequate measures taken to ensure that the quality of data collected is acceptably high and that
data are available on time to be useful for policy and decision making.

                                                             90
mechanism would be needed to hold local governments accountable for use of SG transfers.60 This
could be targeted at basic public health services such as immunization as well as prevention and chronic
case management of NCDs at the primary health care level.

Core Action Areas for the Medium and Long Term

187.    Improving provision of public health services remains a priority in the FSM and will in
turn improve the efficiency and equity of the health system. One important step toward increased
investment must be raising public awareness and building social participation (Gupta and Rani 2004).
Because those for whom disease is prevented may be a less visible constituency than those who are
already ill and seeking a cure, population-based public health interventions are too often not undertaken
even though they fix market failures, are pro-poor, and are often relatively easy to implement (Hammer,
Aiyar, and Samji 2007; see Box 12). The FSM should therefore take action toward maintaining and
strengthening public health systems. There is a particularly urgent need to understand the reasons
underlying low immunization coverage, improve maternal and child care service delivery, and maintain
and protect government expenditures on public health.

188.     Localization of preventive and promotive health services may improve quality of public
health services, but costs and benefits need careful examination in relation to local capacity in
each state. There is a dire need to strengthen preventive and promotive health services at the local level.
One possible option is to shift control over these services to local, grassroots-level governance
institutions, where they exist. Placing health prevention and promotion staff, including any outreach
workers for reproductive and child health, under the direct supervision of local governing authorities
will also help increase oversight and strengthen accountability in the health system as a whole.
Localizing control over these services could have various benefits, including increasing health workers’
accountability and incentives to perform as well as they can on the job and improved stocking of
supplies and medicines in local facilities to treat the specific needs of communities. Any design of such
a localization program will require careful planning and a strong monitoring system to identify
problems, including lack of clarity in responsibilities between levels of government, need for support
to local governments in carrying out new responsibilities, and building new capacities. A monitoring
system is also needed to observe and rectify other unintended consequences.

189.     Tobacco and alcohol taxation could be a cost-effective measure to help control chronic
disease risk factors in the FSM. While the only data available on NCD morbidity and mortality burden
are outdated and projections for future trends cannot be conducted, the limited data available clearly
indicate that the problem is large enough to warrant preventive action today. Reducing exposure to risk
early in life is part of taking a life-course approach to reducing illness and disability at older ages. Box
12 summarizes key cost-effective strategies for reducing population-level exposure to NCD-related
risks. Notable among these is tobacco control, which, as outlined in the Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control, is the most cost-effective set of strategies for controlling NCDs. Improvements can
happen quickly. This is confirmed by the experience of the United States and Western Europe (Cutler,
Deaton, and Lleras-Muney 2006). In 2012, the Philippines passed landmark tax legislation that raised
excise taxes on cigarettes, indexed the rates to inflation (starting in 2017), allocated a portion of the
revenue to compensate tobacco farmers, and earmarked the remainder to finance universal coverage
programs. This experience spurred other countries such as Indonesia, Tonga, and Vietnam to develop
similar legislation on so-called sin taxes. In the FSM, there is considerable scope to raise revenues and
help control chronic disease risk factors through incremental increase in excise duties, including an
increase in taxation of tobacco, alcohol, and sugar products as a way of reducing harmful consumption.


60   The Plan Nacer and Plan Sumar (Argentina) and Brazil (Family Health Program) are notable examples.

                                                            91
190.      Further analytical work should investigate the optimal service delivery arrangements for
improving quality of outpatient curative care and NCD case management, including personnel
management policies. In interviews conducted for this PER, health authorities indicated plans to
strengthen primary curative care to address the growing burden of chronic disease through improved
access to doctors, who are currently employed at the four state hospitals only, while all other health
facilities are staffed by health assistants. Such a policy move has far-reaching but different
consequences depending on the strategy employed. A host of factors affect the relative costs and
benefits of each type of arrangements and should be considered in the context of how best to organize
overall service delivery.61 For example, are doctors available and willing to work in rural areas? In a
context of patients frequently bypassing lower-level facilities, what type of incentives and management
policies will ensure that doctors are not absent at work and that they exert their best effort on the job?
In addition, if capable, skilled doctors are in short supply and they prefer to practice in urban areas, is
it better to allow beneficiaries to visit them in urban areas or to seek care from less able doctors in the
periphery? The trade-offs need to be carefully examined and could be evaluated as part of the broader
public sector review.

191.    Improving procurement processes may also contribute to quality and efficiency gains in
health spending. While the issues and their severity vary across the SGs, reform in procurement
systems will support full and open competition in bidding processes, strengthen internal control
procedures to track and monitor the delivery of pharmaceutical and medical supplies, including
penalties for delays, improve planning for procurement of supplies on an annual basis, and improve
inventory reporting.62 Strengthening these processes may lead to improved outcomes through
improving the quality of services.

192.      Quality improvement in care provided at small, remote health facilities will require
strengthened accountability to local communities—barring that a consolidation of services at
bigger facilities may be needed. Small, remote, difficult-to-supervise health facilities pose a special
challenge. Attracting good health staff to these facilities is difficult and supervision opportunities are
minimal. Both factors make management to improve quality challenging. One way to rationalize the
distribution of resources could be a consolidation of the health system that entails a concentration of
services at bigger, easier-to-supervise, and more frequently used facilities, reducing the overall number
of facilities over time. Barring such a consolidation, efforts to access and provide expensive, targeted
supervision support and TA to improve management of low-performing facilities in these difficult-to-
reach locations will only increase already large health expenditures and are unlikely to affect outcomes.
Another option is to continue to staff nonhospital health facilities with health assistants but ones that
are not only recruited from the communities they serve but are also directly accountable to them under
a localized system, along the lines indicated earlier for public health services. In addition, these
assistants can be supported by a corps of rural health doctors who are employed centrally but rotate on
a regular basis, visiting remote facilities for limited periods. Consolidation of services has both costs
and benefits, and further analytical work is needed to carefully evaluate these for each of the FSM
states.63

61 Another area where we currently know little about is the quality of inpatient care in hospitals. Without facility-level data on
expenditures, and no data on quality of inpatient care provided in the four state hospitals and one private hospital, it is not
possible to ascertain whether there is any room to improve value for money. Further analytical work could look at
accountabilities of hospital managers (to who and for what); incentives for performance (service volume versus quality and
patient satisfaction); and degree of autonomy over assets and human resources.
62 There are also considerable variations in the unit prices that Pacific countries are paying for pharmaceutical and medical

supplies, and there is potential room for savings to help meet increasing health needs (Pacific Heads of Health Meeting:
February 2015).
63 Determining the optimal organization of services in the FSM will require further analytical work to analyze usage patterns

across locations within states and associated costs and benefits. The potential benefit of consolidation with regard to
improvement in the overall level of morbidity is hard to predict because no data are available to quantify the impact of access
to treatment on morbidity levels. However, a diversion of resources away from facilities that do not appear to influence health

                                                               92
193.     Given the changing health care needs and low payments into the system, the FSM could
explore options for more sustainable health financing. As seen earlier, the coverage of the Micare
and Chuuk health care plans is low, and OOP payments are also low. To improve the financial viability
of the system, a study could be undertaken to explore a cost-sharing mechanism, either through fees or
general copayment or raising funds through taxation, which may be more efficient and more equitable.
The need for off-island referrals for health services also poses a special concern, given that the states
currently bear the risk of covering these services when they are too small to pool adequately. Pooling
of risks associated with this type of tertiary care is needed nationally, and the FSM may benefit from
entering into an arrangement with other countries to access better deals with international providers of
these services. Supranational or regional insurance options to cover these catastrophic expenses could
also be considered, such as those under discussion with development partners in Guam and Palau.




outcomes is a logical step forward. Second, data are not available on absenteeism rates among health staff in the FSM, but a
potential benefit of strengthening referral institutions is its effect on productivity among health personnel. Consolidated
facilities will offer enhanced opportunities for peer monitoring as several staff members at the same level could be expected
to monitor each other’s attendance. Finally, since people are already bypassing lower-level facilities closer to them to seek
care in hospitals further away, the additional welfare cost associated with consolidation of services at higher levels should be
considered, particularly for the poor.

                                                              93

194.     The LTFF is a tool intended to support decrement management for each SG and serves
as an action plan for implementation with timelines and specifications for the state-level budget
holder. The Compact, as amended, included two provisions that, by design, lead to annual reductions
in the real value of the grants made available to the FSM, which is offset by increased amounts to the
CTF. The partial inflation adjustment and design shift to an annual decrement was designed to present
a more gradual adjustment toward increased self-reliance in the lead up to FY2024. However, some
observed that the typical response to the declining real value of CSGs was dominated by incremental
cuts that did not result from focused deliberations and thus did not tend to reflect explicit or practical
priorities. Therefore, a change is needed in policy approach to ‘avoid dilution’ of prioritized
governmental activities.

195.     The LTFF process was designed to address a broad range of fiscal challenges, with a
particular focus on expenditures, as revenues are often contingent on exogenous factors. This
includes (a) unsustainable growth trends in health and education expenditures, including rapid growth
of wages in these sectors; (b) evidence of unmet needs in critical service areas of government, especially
in health and education; (c) unsustainable growth in government wage bills, possibly to the detriment
of spending on all other expenditure categories; (d) limited progress on broad-based and FSM-wide tax
reforms; (e) decline of Compact funding in real terms, by design, due to the combined impact of the
partial inflation adjustment and the annual decrement; (f) stagnant or declining economic activity during
the early amended Compact period followed by more positive results in the recent few years; (g) states
not fully meeting their obligations under the Compact to match contributions to the Infrastructure
Maintenance Fund, and the evident need of still greater allocations toward infrastructure maintenance;
and (h) the need to constrain expenditures, increase revenues, and/or find subsequent domestic or
foreign contributors to increase CTF contributions, to adjust to projected levels of sustainable support
after FY2023.

196.    A two-step process ensued: (a) technical preparation and the design of fully costed fiscal
policy options across key revenue and expenditure categories using FY2013 as the baseline and (b)
leadership conference to allow for long-term expenditure and revenue policy deliberations and high-
level adoption of the state’s component of the LTFF.

197.     As part of the first step, an analysis of fiscal trajectory and CSG allocations from FY2004
to FY2013 took place to understand the fiscal structure. An overview of fiscal structure highlighted
the emerging fiscal gap and the need for policy commitments with regard to both revenues and
expenditures to address the impact of fiscal pressures. A technical review by each budget holder
(departments, agencies, and special appropriations) across all branches of government and sources of
revenue also took place. The targeted level of 20 percent expenditure reduction was presented in priority
order for each budget and for the aggregate of Compact and general fund categories. Potential revenue
efforts available to close the emerging fiscal gap, including NG and SG revenue reform options, were
also considered. Finally, potential consideration of alternative distribution of CSG funding and/or local
revenues of the NG to support state-level service delivery—or what has been commonly referred to as
potential ‘burden-sharing’—was discussed.

198.   As part of the second step, findings from the first step were presented at the leadership
meetings. The targeted level of fiscal compression through, in the first instance, expenditure cutting
was reduced from 20 percent to 18 percent as a result of using modelling estimates inclusive of both
Compact sector funds and local revenues. The 18 percent target was also proposed and adopted to be

                                                   94
broken into three tranches of 6 percent each. The initial 6 percent expenditure cut was deemed to be a
firm commitment to be binding on the FY2014 budget submission, while the remaining two 6 percent
tranches were deemed contingent for possible implementation in FY2017 and FY2020 if the other
identified categories of fiscal adjustment through revenue reform and/or structural reform failed to
materialize.64 A clear commitment was made for revisiting the contingent commitments through a
similar process in advance of the FY2017 budget preparation cycle to reflect emerging realities and/or
actions on items outside the control of state leadership. The structure of the LTFF is meant to allow for
monitoring of the embedded commitments.


                                     Box 13. Long-term Fiscal Framework
 In nominal terms, CSGs are expected to remain largely flat with very small upward adjustments expected until
 FY2023. In real terms, sector grants are expected to decline by around 2 percent per year when taking into
 account the US$0.8 million decrement per year and partial inflation adjustment. Between FY2014 and FY2023,
                                                                  this is equivalent to around 20 percent
                                                                  reduction in real value of CSGs. However, this
                                                                  is partially diluted by the expected moderate
                                                                  increase in general fund revenues. Taking this
                                                                  into account, the reduction in real value of
                                                                  revenues is expected at around 18 percent
                                                                  between FY2014 and FY2023. However, it
                                                                  was not intended that the 18 percent cut would
                                                                  take place immediately in FY2014 but rather
                                                                  in a set of three tranches of 6 percent each in
                                                                  FY2014, FY2017, and FY2020. The intended
                                                                  LTFF provides for some inflation adjustment
                                                                  in the intervening years. Since the Compact
                                                                  provides for partial inflation adjustment, after
                                                                  each initial cut of 6 percent in the first year of
                                                                  each three-yearly cycle, some allowance, up to
 2 percent, can be permitted in each of the following two years. Each state was then requested to identify the
 initial three-year cut of 6 percent, which would be a firm commitment and reflected in the FY2014 budgets
 submitted to the JEMCO.

 To identify the initial three-year cut of 6 percent (using FY2013 as the baseline), two working groups were
 established, consisting of budget holders and supported by state technical staff, the SBOC, and the Graduate
 School USA. The working groups were tasked to (a) review and validate budget holder submissions with regard
 to amount, prioritization, detail, and feasibility; (b) consider negative impact of submissions and rank in order
 of priority and potential impact; (c) review compared to set priorities across governments; and (d) identify
 budget areas where reductions in excess of 20 percent may be needed to protect higher priority projects. These
 deliberations were not detailed in the LTFF reports.

 •   Chuuk. Over 60 percent of the reductions result from the health and education sectors. In the DoE, 56
     percent of the FY2014 expenditure reductions result from reduced asset and maintenance of elementary
     and secondary schools. A further 20 percent is derived from reductions to scholarships with the
     remainder attributable to reductions in wages and salaries. In the DoH, around 70 percent of the FY2014
     reductions result from reduced services at the hospital (two-thirds of which are related to reduced
     purchase of goods and services and one-third to reduced overtime and travel). A further 15 percent is
     derived from reductions to dispensary services, with the remainder attributable to reductions in dental
     and nursing services.
 •   Pohnpei. Around two-thirds of the expenditure reductions stem from the health and education sectors
     as well as reduced costs at the state legislature. In the DoE, one-fourth of the FY2014 reductions result
     from reductions to scholarships, with a further 21 percent derived through reductions to food services
     at schools. The remainder are attributable to reductions in purchase of instruction materials (15 percent),


64Based on LTFF modelling, if a revenue effort is equivalent in budgetary terms to 12 percent of the FY2013 budgeted
expenditure baseline (about US$3.4 million), then balanced budgets could be sustained without requiring additional
expenditure cutting above and beyond the initial round of FY2014 planned reductions.

                                                         95
      aid to private schools (14 percent), wages and salaries (7 percent), utilities (7 percent), and so on. In the
      DoH, 85 percent of the FY2014 reductions result from reduced off-island medical referral services, with
      the remainder attributable to reductions to food services (at the hospital). At the state legislature,
      proposed reductions stem from reduced travel, consumables, and fixed asset investments.
 •    Kosrae. Around 72 percent of the reductions stem from the DoH, administration and finance, education,
      resource economic affairs, and state legislature. In the DoH, almost all of the FY2014 expenditure
      reductions are associated with reducing staffing and related costs. In the DOFA, expenditure reductions
      largely reflect reducing PFM projects and activities. In the DoE, reductions were made to asset and
      maintenance activities as well as administrative and support activities. In the department of resources
      and economic affairs, community agriculture and fisheries activities were reduced. Finally, at the state
      legislature, reductions were made to representation and travel funds.
 •    Yap. Around 63 percent of the reductions stem from the public works, health, and education sectors.
      Revenue measures (airport fees) under the department of public works and transportation are expected
      to significantly reduce the need for expenditure reductions, while expenditure reduction is expected to
      be achieved in operations and maintenance and personnel. In the DoE, FY2014 expenditure reductions
      result evenly from reduced asset and maintenance, feeding program, and power and utilities for school
      runs. In the DoH, around 57 percent of the FY2014 reductions result from reduced travel, a further 32
      percent from reduced costs associated with medical equipment, and the remainder associated with
      medical referrals.

 While the FSM states completed their LTFFs, the NG did not complete an LTFF. However, a major element
 of the discussion at the state-level LTFF meetings was the contribution that tax reform and burden sharing
 could make to assist the states in maintaining services as Compact resources declined. Reflecting the NG’s
 position to not prepare an LTFF, no allocation for CSGs was made for FY2014 with the exception of the
 continuing operational grants to the COM. The release of Compact resources by the NG freed up an equivalent
 amount for the states to help offset the decrement.

6.2      Implementation of the LTFF

199.    The LTFF is the first tool of its kind aimed at focusing the attention of the policy makers
and budget holders toward a more sustainable fiscal framework. The LTFF in its design and
implementation has focused the attention of the stakeholder to the various economic challenges facing
the FSM in the medium to long term. The process has also enabled policy makers and various line
ministries to begin the dialogue on prioritizing service delivery and efficiency gains. The fiscal
framework is also a great tool for policy makers and line ministries to consider the potential implications
of any decision making in a holistic manner.

200.    While the LTFF aimed for a one-off step reduction in expenditure for the states in FY2014
from FY2013 levels, actual audited data suggest that total expenditure continued to rise. Total
nominal expenditure rose by 3.4 percent in FY2014 compared to FY2013, while real GDP declined by
3.4 percent in FY2014. While the states diverged with regard to expenditure growth, no single state saw
a non-negligible reduction in recurrent spending. Wages and salaries similarly grew by 3 percent across
the same period. Purchase of goods and services grew by 4.6 percent. From a sector perspective,
expenditure for health, education, and social affairs grew by 3.2 percent. Tax revenues on the other
hand fell by 3.3 percent.

201.    The LTFF highlights many of the key challenges facing the FSM; however, it is unclear
how this translated into a holistic plan. Taking the health and education sectors as an example, the
LTFF noted growth in spending in these sectors, while service delivery gaps remain. In response, the
reductions in spending noted under the LTFF, across the states, concentrate in these two sectors.
However, a wide variety of proposals are made and in the education sector range from reducing
maintenance, to reducing food offerings, staffing levels at the schools, and scholarship offerings. It is
not clear how these initiatives will reduce existing unmet service delivery gaps or how they fit into a
broader or coherent plan for the sector. It is also unclear how far the LTFF has gone with regard to
protecting or enhancing priority activities with an impact on human health or public safety while
reducing or eliminating lower priority activities, including those popular among some interest groups.

202.     Consistency between the LTFF, the 2023 Transition Plan, the SDP, and government
decisions would warrant closer attention. The LTFF highlights that growth in government wages has
been unsustainable and the SDP stated goals to restructure and rationalize the public sector. On the
other hand, the 2023 Transition Plan notes that “although much has been said and written about the
over-inflated wage bill…the major issue is that through a decision of Congress salaries have been frozen
since 1997…given the increase in the cost of living, this is not providing good incentives to the
workforce as real wages have declined.” In addition, as recently as 2015, the government approved a
cost-of-living adjustment to all public servants at the NG.

203.     Revenue-side reforms that could support the states in avoiding future expenditure
rationalization has stagnated. Tax reforms, including those to introduce more broad-based VATs and
strengthen tax administration, were repealed, given divergent views. Other state-level tax reforms
considered have also not progressed. The NG has increased revenue sharing of taxes with the states and
on an ad hoc basis shared excess revenues. The increased revenue share to the states from taxes is
earmarked for building the state’s TFs to mitigate future shortfalls while excess revenues shared are
earmarked for state-level infrastructure projects. It is therefore unclear how these additional revenues
shared with the states fit into the LTFF. Furthermore, the stagnation in revenue reforms affects the
ability for the states to avoid future expenditure rationalization.

6.3     Mapping the PER to Challenges Identified in the LTFF

204.    This PER reiterates the importance of using the LTFF across all states annually for
coherent policy making and makes additional recommendations in some of the key areas of
challenges noted in the LTFF and the 2023 Transition Plan. The LTFF process has documented a
broad range of fiscal challenges. More broadly, this PER was aimed at informing policy makers on
areas of potential efficiency gains in light of declining Compact funding in real terms and supporting
the government in building appropriate institutional structures, systems, processes in the lead up to
2023, when resource allocation and management decisions move fully to the GoFSM. This PER also
overlaps with many of the key challenges noted in the LTFF and provides some further
recommendations as set out below.

•     With regard to limited progress on broad-based and FSM-wide tax reforms, this PER highlights
      that increasing tax effort, even within the existing framework, will support the creation of fiscal
      space. To this end, strengthening tax administration, improving incentives for the SGs to access
      unreached tax base, and reviewing the appropriateness of current tax rates are potential avenues
      to increasing tax effort.

•     One challenge noted in the LTFF is the unsustainable growth in government wage bills, possibly
      to the detriment of spending on all other expenditure categories. Analysis of this PER showed
      that although the wage bill is not growing as a share of GDP, a large amount of resources is
      devoted to it while public sector performance remains weak. Strengthened wage bill management
      through automation of payroll information systems in the near future could support improved
      oversight and control of the public sector wage bill and reduced unproductive use of public
      servants' time. In the medium term, the wage bill policy could also be streamlined and better
      anchored to living standards and required skills to remove any potential misalignment in pay
      levels.

•     Another challenge noted in the LTFF is the growing health and education expenditures and
      evidence of unmet needs in these sectors. This PER finds that spending in these sectors has been
      flat in nominal terms and declined in real terms, but high relative to regional and international
      peers. Despite the relatively high spending, outcomes remain weak. One way to improve return
      on investment is through improved transparency and accountability, supported by strengthened
      data collection and capacity at the local level. Improving and tailoring service delivery
      arrangements in a holistic manner and increasing collaboration between the NG and SGs are also
      important.

•     A further challenge highlighted in the LTFF is stagnant economic activity, which the 2023
      Transition Plan aims to address through increasing infrastructure investments, through use of CIG
      arrears. The PER highlights areas in PIM that could be strengthened to support more efficient
      infrastructure investments. However, this will also need to be complemented with capacity
      building at the local level.

•     This PER also reiterates the need to continue saving, so that there are adequate sources of
      financing to meet public service delivery needs and to buttress against inevitable future shocks.
      To this end, clearly establishing the objectives of the FSM TF together with an adequate
      governance structure, appropriate investment strategy, disbursement rules, and linkage to the
      macroeconomic framework will ensure that surpluses are used to achieve the set objectives.

Annex 1. Measures to Improve the Tax System and Increase Revenue

In some cases, revenue can be increased by raising rates within an existing system. However, the ability
to generate increased revenue in this manner may be limited. This is particularly likely when an
economy is undergoing substantial structural change, traditional tax bases are declining, and the tax
system has fundamental weaknesses. Structural problems in the tax system may well be a major factor
underlying not only fiscal deficits but also poor growth and employment performance. Consequently,
programs of fiscal adjustment are often accompanied by an effort to improve or even restructure the tax
system. This annex focuses on questions relating to tax policy design during a reform period. It must
be emphasized, however, that improvements in tax policy are more likely to be successful when they
are accompanied by measures to strengthen tax administration.

Characteristics of a Desirable Tax System

The characteristics of a desirable tax system outlined in this section represent a blend of both
macroeconomic and microeconomic considerations. In the former case, a tax system's responsiveness
to GDP growth and its revenue-generating capacity are paramount. However, because overall economic
growth may be affected by the microeconomic allocative effects of a tax system and the post-tax
distribution of income and wealth, the system's efficiency and transparency, for example, are also
critical.

Revenue-generating capacity. A central objective of the tax system is to raise revenue to finance
government spending, without resort to inflationary financing. This suggests the importance of a tax
system that can generate revenue increases—at least in line with the growth in nominal income—
without frequent changes in tax rates or introduction of new taxes. In this regard, reliance on specific
(quantity-based) taxes in times of inflation or on tax bases that are shrinking in relation to the rest of
the economy should be avoided because they contribute to low tax responsiveness (or elasticity).

Efficiency. Taxes influence relative prices in the economy and, therefore, have an impact on the pattern
of production, consumption, and income. A desirable tax from the point of view of efficiency is one
that minimizes its impact on relative prices, thus leaving the allocation of resources essentially
undisturbed. Too heavy a tax on a particular commodity will tend to reduce its production and
consumption and may, therefore, result in a loss of efficiency if scarce resources are diverted from their
most productive use, in turn compromising growth. In practice, efficiency is achieved by levying taxes
on as broad a tax base as possible and at fairly low and uniform rates. This also implies keeping tax
exemptions to a minimum.

Equity. Taxes should be levied in a fair and equitable manner. The decision on what distribution of the
tax burden is fair and equitable is something for each country to decide for itself, preferably through a
democratic process. A distinction may be drawn between vertical and horizontal equity. The former
refers to differentiation of the tax burden according to ability to pay (as measured by income, wealth,
or consumption), while the latter refers to equal treatment of those in similar economic circumstances.
Certain types of taxation may affect income distribution, for example, a progressive income tax or an
excise on luxuries. However, expenditure policy is likely to be a more efficient instrument than taxation
for influencing income distribution, through transfers and expenditures on social services and targeted
social assistance programs.

Transparency. Tax codes should be clearly drafted, well defined, and easily understood by the tax-
paying community. For private investment, it is especially important to have tax rates that are both
stable and predictable. Once tax laws that can generate buoyant revenue growth are established, it is
preferable to minimize the frequency of discretionary modifications to these laws. If changes are

                                                   99
planned over a reform period, taxpayers should ideally know in advance the tax implications of their
production and consumption decisions. A simple, transparent tax system is also relatively easy to
administer and promotes compliance.

Reasonable overall tax burden. There are constraints on how much a government can raise in taxes.
Even if all the above criteria are met, too high a tax burden will undermine the system's effectiveness
by encouraging tax evasion and distorting the structure of relative prices in the economy. One measure
of the tax burden is the ratio of tax revenue to GDP, a ratio which varies widely among countries. An
‘acceptable’ level of this ratio will be determined to some extent by public choices concerning the level
of government expenditure or by other factors such as the need to service a large public debt.

Design of Major Taxes

Drawing on the above criteria, the following design features for major taxes are often recommended:

    •   VAT. This should be a broad-based tax on final domestic consumption that does not tax
        intermediate consumption (thereby minimizing cumulative taxation as goods move through
        successive stages of production and distribution) or exports and one that does not differentiate
        by source of production (foreign or domestic). Because of its efficiency and revenue security,
        the ideal instrument to achieve this objective is a VAT at a single rate, with crediting provisions
        and zero rating of exports.
    •   Excises. A selected number of excises can be introduced to discourage consumption of
        particular items (for example, alcohol and tobacco); link tax payments to the existence of
        negative externalities (for example, a gasoline tax as a means of pollution abatement); or tax
        certain luxury goods. Excises should be levied equally on domestic production and imports and,
        particularly, in an inflationary environment, on an ad valorem basis.
    •   Customs duties. If a moderate level of protection is thought desirable to encourage local
        industry, a low uniform customs duty, when properly coordinated with a VAT and excises, is
        the preferred instrument. Duty drawback or suspension schemes are needed to relieve exporters
        of the anti-export bias caused by customs duties on inputs. To the extent that such schemes are
        difficult to administer, particular importance is attached to maintaining a low tariff rate.
        Exemptions from customs duties should be limited and clearly defined to avoid abuse. A low
        across-the-board tariff may also be justified for revenue reasons in countries where other (and
        preferable) taxes may prove difficult to administer.
    •   Export taxes. Such taxes should generally be avoided, because they tend to cause an outflow
        of resources in the export sector toward less efficient uses, thus compromising growth
        objectives. However, they can sometimes be used on a limited basis to reach hard-to-tax
        activities (common in the agriculture sector) as a temporary substitute for income taxation and
        to absorb one-time gains, for example, from a devaluation or from exceptional movements in
        world commodity prices.
    •   Profit taxes. A tax on profits should ideally be levied at a single rate comparable to the top
        marginal rate of personal income tax. This minimizes the likelihood of tax-induced shifts
        between personal income, partnerships, and corporations. Deductions, allowances, and credits
        are best applied neutrally across sectors and assets to foster efficiency. Tax incentives (such as
        investment allowances and, particularly, tax holidays), if used at all, should be strictly limited
        with regard to coverage and duration. A minimum profits tax based on gross assets may be used
        in some circumstances to promote compliance and equity.



                                                   100
    •   Income taxes. A basic personal income exemption should be set high enough to exclude the
        very poor and sufficient progressivity can be achieved with only a few income tax brackets.
        Tax brackets should be adjusted periodically in situations of high inflation to avoid the tendency
        for ‘bracket creep’ and supply-side considerations argue for keeping rates as low as possible.
        Ideally, income taxes should be levied on a globalized income tax base (including all forms of
        income). However, it is often administratively necessary to establish schedular taxes on
        different sources of income. Final withholding taxes for wage (and possibly interest and
        dividend) income have proven successful in curtailing revenue leakage.
Tax Administration
Improvements in tax policy are more likely to be successful when they are accompanied by measures
to strengthen tax administration. The essential elements required for successful tax administration
reform include an explicit and sustained political commitment; a team of capable officials dedicated to
tax administration reform; a well-defined and appropriate reform strategy; relevant training for staff;
additional resources for the tax administration or, at least, some reallocation of resources; and changes
in incentives for both taxpayers and tax administrators.

Tax administration reform must strive to enhance both its effectiveness and efficiency. Interventions to
improve effectiveness include promotion of taxpayer self-assessment, provision of taxpayer education,
adoption of procedures for minimizing the cost of compliance, implementation of systems for tax
returns processing and accounting that quickly detect noncompliance and take appropriate actions, and
establishment of an audit plan to detect violations as efficiently as possible. Also needed are adequate
penalties for violations that strike at the heart of the tax system, such as failure to file returns and to pay
taxes on time.

Along with a strategy for enhancing effectiveness, tax administrations can adopt a number of measures
to focus their scarce resources in the most efficient manner for revenue collection and enforcement.
These measures include establishment of a large taxpayers’ unit; adoption of a threshold for tax
registration that exempts small enterprises from major taxes; the imposition of an alternative tax on
small enterprises with limited revenue potential; use of final withholding of taxes on individual taxes;
and use of banks for receiving tax payments.

The above measures for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of tax administration suggest an
organization of the tax administration to support five principal functions: taxpayer education;
registration, accounting, and returns processing; collection enforcement; auditing; and legal services
and appeals.

Major reforms in tax design and administration take time to implement. New legislation is often
required and basic systems and procedures frequently need modification. In addition, reform may lead
to changes in the relative tax burden of different groups and economic sectors. Short-term revenue
requirements must also be addressed during the reform process. In developing short-term tax policy
packages, particular consideration needs to be given to the revenue productivity of proposed measures,
their administrative feasibility, and their likely consistency with the desired direction of more
fundamental tax reform. On the basis of such criteria, the most promising short-term measures may
emphasize increases in the rates of indirect taxes (particularly broad-based sales taxes and excises) and
expansion of the tax base by eliminating exemptions.

Annex 2. Review of Fiscal Federalism and Lessons from International Practices

A federal system is concerned with combining the political and economic advantages of unity
while preserving the valued identity of subnational units. The federal system was created with the
intention of combining the different advantages that result from the magnitude and littleness of nations
(Tocqueville 1990). The political advantage of unity is security, while the economic advantages of unity
are those that result from operating within a common market. In addition, centralized provision of
services (that can be provided less expensively on a larger scale or their benefits may spill over to
districts) creates economies of scale and captures externalities. However, this is at the cost of imposing
a common policy on populations with varied preferences and priorities. On the other hand, political
advantages of subnational flexibility are that it fosters greater responsiveness of policy makers to the
will of the citizenry and results in a closer congruence between public preference and public policy.
Economic advantages of localizing service delivery are allocative and technical efficiency. Smoke et
al. (1994) argued that under this model, allocative efficiency could be achieved as local preferences
could be more closely met. In addition, under local people’s scrutiny, technical efficiency of local public
goods and services could also be maximized (Wolman 1990). The trade-off between autonomy and
efficiency forms the basis of the federal approach to governance. For federations, the complementary
roles of the different tiers of government should in turn be determined by analyzing the most effective
ways and means of achieving desired objectives.

Federalism is concerned with making continuous adjustments over the continuum and exploring
the respective roles of different levels of the government and assigning responsibilities and fiscal
instruments to the proper level of the government. For federations, with constitutionally structured
dispersion of power, federalism should not be viewed as a fixed allocation of spheres of central and
provincial autonomy or a particular set of distribution of authority between governments. It rather is a
process, structured by a set of institutions and endogenous factors, through which authority is distributed
and redistributed in light of changing conditions (Sharma 2005). In turn, the key dimensions of authority
that are often distributed or decentralized are political, administrative, and fiscal. Fiscal federalism
refers to the public finance dimension of intergovernmental relations. It specifically addresses the
reform of the system of expenditure functions and revenue source transfers from various tiers of
government to meet imbalances.

Traditional theory on fiscal federalism contends that the central government should have the
basic responsibility for macroeconomic stabilization and income redistribution in the form of
assistance to the poor. Musgrave (1959) and Oates (1972) lay out a general normative framework for
the assignment of functions to different levels of government and the appropriate fiscal instruments for
carrying out these functions. The argument for central responsibility for stabilization and redistribution
stems from some fundamental constraints on lower level governments. In the absence of monetary and
exchange-rate prerogatives and with highly open economies that cannot contain much of the
expansionary impact of fiscal stimuli, the local governments simply have very limited means for
traditional macroeconomic control of their economies. Similarly, the mobility of economic units can
seriously constrain attempts to redistribute income. An aggressive local program for the support of low-
income households, for example, is likely to induce an influx of the poor and encourage an exodus of
those with higher income who must bear the tax burden. In addition to these functions, the central
government should provide certain ‘national’ public goods (like national defense) that provide services
to the entire population of the country and/or have potential spillover or economies of scale benefits.

The local governments should be responsible for the provision of goods and services whose
consumption is limited primarily to their own jurisdictions and the allocation of resources to
provide these services. By tailoring outputs of such goods and services to the particular preferences
and circumstances of their constituencies, localized provision increases economic welfare above that,

                                                   102
which results from the more uniform levels of such services that are likely under national provision.
The basic point here is simply that the efficient level of output of a ‘local’ public good is likely to vary
across jurisdictions as a result of both differences in preferences and cost differentials. To maximize
overall social welfare thus requires that local outputs vary accordingly. Traditional theory however does
not offer a precise delineation of the specific goods and services to be provided at each level of
government. The SGs should be provided with adequate resources for localized service delivery
responsibilities.

The choice of a system of governance involves other values as well, including political objectives,
and the system needs to be designed with the right incentive and accountability mechanism. The
approach of Inman and Rubinfeld (1997) incorporates explicitly certain political goals and examining
trade-offs between such goals and economic efficiency. In addition, the design of a federal system also
needs a set of formal and informal institutions that embodies the right type of incentives for public
decision makers (Olson 1990). These rules or procedures must make the costs of public programs as
fully visible as their benefits in ways that make public officials accountable for their decisions (Shah
1998). Various studies have found that fiscal federalism may lead to allocative inefficiencies as well as
poor accountability and governance if expenditure and revenue mobilization functions are not property
assigned across different levels of government (Hommes 1995; Fukasaku and de Mello 1999; World
Bank 1999).

While many studies on this topic tilt in favor of more localization, partly due to its ability to avoid
noted inefficiencies of centralized decision making, more recent literature suggests that a strong
center is also needed for this to succeed. According to Blanchard and Shleifer (2000), a weak center
is prone to manipulation by strong coalitions and interest groups. There are strong arguments that most
of the problems with more localization can be solved by central government interventions and
regulatory powers, for example, China’s success due to a strong center, to withstand the disparaging
behavior of local interests and unhealthy local demands. Strong administrative control of the local
government by central authorities is in fact important for an efficient federal system. Central
governments need to be willing to resist unhealthy demands from the lower levels of government. Riker
(1964) suggests that centralization does matter for federalism to be effective.

The challenge in the new paradigm is to devise an appropriately structured system that mandates
and provides incentives for responsible local government fiscal behavior and enables the creation
of a climate conducive to development. To this end, the center should assume a more sophisticated
style of stewardship and be responsible for constructing such support structures, processes, and national
institutions that create an enabling environment and provide appropriate incentives for the SGs to
behave responsibly. It is also critical to develop the skills of local government employees to meet the
requirements of the systems and the abilities of central government officials to assist local governments
in the process of their evolution to greater autonomy.

Summarized below is a review of international practices yields a set of practices to avoid and a set of
practices to emulate.

Types of transfers to avoid
    (a) Grants with vaguely specified objectives.
    (b) General revenue-sharing programs with multiple factors that work at cross purposes and
        undermine accountability and do not advance fiscal efficiency or fiscal equity objectives. Tax
        decentralization or tax-base sharing offers better alternatives to a general revenue-sharing
        program, as they enhance accountability while preserving state autonomy.
    (c) Grants to finance state deficits, which create incentives for running higher deficits in future.

                                                    103
     (d) Unconditional grants that include incentives for fiscal effort. Improving service delivery while
         lowering tax costs should be public sector objectives.
     (e) Input-based (or process-based) or ad hoc conditional grant programs, which undermine local
         autonomy, flexibility, fiscal efficiency, and fiscal equity objectives.
     (f) Capital grants without assurance of funds for future upkeep, which have the potential to create
         white elephants.
     (g) Negotiated or discretionary grants in a federal system, which may create dissention and
         disunity.
     (h) One-size-fits-all grants to local governments, which create huge inequities.
     (i) Grants that involve abrupt changes in the total pool and its allocation.


Principles to adopt
     (a) Keep it simple. In the design of fiscal transfers, rough justice may be better than full justice, if
         it achieves wider acceptability and sustainability.
     (b) Focus on a single objective in a grant program and make the design consistent with that
         objective. Setting multiple objectives in a single grant program runs the risk of failing to achieve
         any of them.
     (c) Introduce ceilings linked with macro indicators and floors, to ensure stability and predictability
         in grant funds.
     (d) Introduce sunset clauses. It is desirable to have the grant program reviewed periodically—say,
         every five years—and renewed (if appropriate). In the intervening years, no changes to the
         program should be made, to provide certainty in budgetary programming for all governments.
     (e) Equalize per capita fiscal capacity to a specified standard to achieve fiscal equalization. Such a
         standard will determine the total pool and allocations among recipient units.65
     (f) In specific-purpose grant programs, impose conditionality on outputs or standards of access and
         quality of services rather than on inputs and processes. This allows grantors to achieve their
         objectives without undermining local choices on how best to deliver such services. Most
         countries need to establish national minimum standards of basic services across the nation to
         strengthen the internal common market and economic union.
     (g) Recognize population size class, area served, and the urban or rural nature of services in making
         grants to local governments. Establish separate formula allocations for each type of municipal
         or local government.
     (h) Establish grandfathering provisions that ensure that all recipient governments receive at least
         what they received as general-purpose transfers in the pre-reform period. Over time, as the
         economy grows, such a provision will not delay the phase-in of the full package of reforms.
     (i) Make sure that all stakeholders are heard and that an appropriate political compact on
         equalization principles and the standard of equalization is struck. Politics must be internalized

65Calculations required for fiscal capacity equalization using a representative tax system for major tax bases are doable for
most countries. In contrast, expenditure need equalization requires difficult and complex analysis, inviting much controversy
and debate; as desirable as it is, it may not therefore be worth doing. In view of this practical difficulty, it would be best to
deal with fiscal need equalization through output-based sectoral grants that also enhance results-based accountability. A
national consensus on the standard of equalization is critically important for the sustainability of any equalization program.
The equalization program must not be looked at in isolation from the broader fiscal system, especially conditional transfers.
The equalization program must have a sunset clause and provision for formal review and renewal. For local fiscal equalization,
one size does not fit all.

                                                              104
        in these institutional arrangements. Arm’s-length institutions, such as independent grant
        commissions, are not helpful, as they do not allow for political input and therefore tend to opt
        for complex and nontransparent solutions.
Moving from a public sector governance culture of dividing the spoils to an environment that enables
responsive, responsible, equitable, and accountable governance is critical. Doing so requires exploring
all feasible tax decentralization options, instituting output-based operating and capital fiscal transfers,
establishing a formal fiscal equalization program with an explicit standard of equalization, and ensuring
responsible access to borrowing.

Annex 3. Achieving Results-Based Accountability through Performance-Oriented Transfers

Economic rationales for output-based grants (used interchangeably with performance-oriented
transfers) stem from the emphasis on contract-based management under the new public management
framework and strengthening demand for good governance by lowering the transactions costs for
citizens in obtaining public services under the new institutional economics approach. The new public
management framework seeks to strengthen accountability for results by changing the management
paradigm in the public sector from permanent appointments to contractual appointment and
continuation of employment subject to fulfilment of service delivery contracts. It seeks to create a
competitive service delivery environment by making financing available on similar conditions to all
providers—government and nongovernment.

The new institutional economics approach argues that dysfunctional governance in the public sector
results from opportunistic behavior by public officials, as citizens are either not empowered to hold
public officials accountable for their noncompliance with their mandates and/or for corrupt acts or face
high transactions costs in doing so. In this framework, citizens are treated as the principals and public
officials the agents. The principals have bounded rationality—they act rationally based on the
incomplete information they have. Acquiring and processing information about public sector operations
is costly. Agents (public officials) are better informed than principals. Their self-interest motivates them
to withhold information from the public domain, as releasing such information helps principals hold
them accountable. This asymmetry of information allows agents to indulge in opportunistic behavior,
which goes unchecked due to high transactions costs faced by the principals and a lack of or inadequacy
of countervailing institutions to enforce accountable governance. Results-based accountability through
output-based grants empowers citizens by increasing their information base and lowering their
transactions costs in demanding action.

Output-based transfers link grant finance with service delivery performance. These transfers place
conditions on the results to be achieved while providing full flexibility in the design of programs and
associated spending levels to achieve those objectives. Such transfers help restore recipients’ focus on
the results-based chain (Figure 3.1) and the alternate service delivery framework (competitive
framework for public service delivery) to achieve those results. To achieve grant objectives, a public
manager in the recipient government will examine the results-based chain to determine whether or not
program activities are expected to yield the desired results. To do so, he or she needs to monitor program
activities and inputs, including intermediate inputs (resources used to produce outputs), outputs
(quantity and quality of public goods and services produced and access to such goods and services),
outcomes (intermediate- to long-run consequences for consumers or taxpayers of public service
provision or progress in achieving program objectives), impact (program goals or very long-term
consequences of public service provision), and reach (people who benefit from or are hurt by a
program). Such a managerial focus reinforces joint ownership and accountability of the principal and
the agent in achieving shared goals by highlighting terms of mutual trust. Thus internal and external
reporting shifts from the traditional focus on inputs to a focus on outputs, reach, and outcomes —in
particular, outputs that lead to results. Flexibility in project definition and implementation is achieved
by shifting emphasis from strict monitoring of inputs to monitoring performance results and their
measurements. Tracking progress toward expected results is done through indicators, which are
negotiated between the provider and the financing agency. This joint goal setting and reporting helps
ensure client satisfaction on an ongoing basis while building partnership and ownership into projects
(Shah 2005b).




                                                    106
            Figure 3.1. Example of Results Chain with an Application to Education Services




Output-based grants must have conditions on outputs as opposed to outcomes, as outcomes are subject
to influence by factors beyond the control of a public manager. Public managers should be held
accountable only for factors under their control. Outcome-based conditions diffuse enforcement of
accountability for results. Because the grant conditions are concerned with service delivery performance
in quality of output and access, the manager is free to choose the program and inputs to deliver results.
To achieve those results, he or she faces positive incentives by grant conditions that encourage alternate
service delivery mechanisms by contracting out, outsourcing, or simply encouraging competition
among government and nongovernment providers. This can be done by establishing a level playing
field through at par financing, by offering franchises through competitive bidding or by providing
rewards for performance through benchmarking or yardstick competition. Such an incentive
environment is expected to yield a management paradigm that emphasizes results-based accountability
to clients with the following common elements:

    •   Contracts or work program agreements based on prespecified outputs and performance targets
        and budgetary allocations
    •   Replacement of lifelong rotating employment with contractual appointments with task
        specialization
    •   Managerial flexibility but accountability for results
    •   Redefinition of the public sector role as a purchaser but not necessarily a provider of public
        services
    •   Adoption of the subsidiarity principle—that is, public sector decisions made at the level of
        government closest to the people, unless a convincing case can be made not to do so
    •   Incentives for cost efficiency
    •   Incentives for transparency and competitive service provision
    •   Accountability to taxpayers
Under such an accountable governance framework, grant-financed budget allocations support contracts
and work program agreements, which are based on prespecified outputs and performance targets. The
grant recipient’s flexibility in input selection—including hiring and firing of personnel and
implementation of programs—is fully respected, but there is strict accountability for achieving results.
The incentive and accountability regime created by output-based transfers is expected to create
responsive, responsible, and accountable governance without undermining local autonomy. In contrast,

                                                   107
traditional conditional grants with input conditionality undermine local autonomy and budgetary
flexibility while reinforcing a culture of opportunism and rent seeking.
                Table 3.2. Features of Traditional and Output-Based Conditional Grants




Output-based grants create incentive regimes that promote a results-based accountability culture.
Consider the case in which the NG aims to improve access to education by the poor and to enhance the
quality of such education. A common approach is to provide grants to government schools through
conditional grants. These grants specify the type of expenditures eligible for grant financing (books,
computers, teacher aids, and so on) as well as financial reporting and audit requirements. Such input
conditionality undermines budgetary autonomy and flexibility without providing any assurance about
the achievement of results. Moreover, in practice it is difficult to enforce, as there may be significant
opportunities for fungibility of funds. Experience has shown that there is no one-to-one link between
increases in public spending and improvements in service delivery performance (Huther, Roberts, and
Shah 1997).

Output-based design of such grants can help achieve accountability for results. Under this approach, the
NG allocates funds to local governments based on the size of the school-age population. Local
governments in turn pass these funds on to both government and nongovernment providers based on
school enrolments. Nongovernment providers are eligible to receive grant funds if they admit students
based on merit and provide a tuition subsidy to students whose parents cannot afford the tuition. All
providers are expected to improve or at the minimum maintain baseline achievement scores on
standardized tests, increase graduation rates, and reduce dropout rates. Failure to do so will invite public
censure and in the extreme case cause grant funds to be discontinued. In the meantime, reputation risks

                                                    108
associated with poor performance may reduce enrolments, thereby reducing the grant funds received.
Schools have full autonomy in the use of grant funds and are able to retain unused funds.

This kind of grant financing will create an incentive environment for both government and
nongovernment schools to compete and excel to retain students and establish reputations for quality
education, as parental choice determines grant financing to each school. Such an environment is
particularly important for government schools, where staff have lifelong appointments and financing is
ensured regardless of performance. Budgetary flexibility and retention of savings will encourage
innovation to deliver quality education. Output-based grants thus preserve autonomy, encourage
competition and innovation, and bring strict accountability for results to residents. This accountability
regime is self-enforcing through consumer (parental choice in the current example) choice.

Note: In each figure in this panel, the FSM has two data points—FSM and FSM2. Both points use the same value for the
respective y-axis variable in each plot, but the x-coordinate (education expenditure as % of GNI) is different. For the data
point ‘FSM’, the x-coordinate is the value from WDI (2015), which is 24 percent. For the data point ‘FSM2’, the x-coordinate
is the value calculated by authors using total nominal recurrent education expenditure for FSM in 2013 (US$39.2 million)
divided by the GNI reported in WDI in 2015 (US$342.1 million), equals 11 percent. An explanation for the difference
between the two values was not available at the time of writing, nor was the WDI methodology used to arrive at the estimate
in that database.

Annex 5. Benefit Incidence Analysis: Methodology and Interpretation of Results

The BIA is a tool to assess how tax policy or government subsidy affects the distribution of welfare in
the population. In other words, the BIA evaluates the distribution of government subsidies among
different groups in the population, in particular, among different income groups. In the literature, most
of the BIAs divide the population into subgroups (for example, quintiles or deciles) based on household
per capita income. Since expenditures on health and education are expected to have a redistributive
impact, the BIA is centered on assessing whether public spending is progressive, that is, whether it
improves the distribution of welfare, proxied by household income or expenditure. Likewise, the BIA
shows how the initial ‘pre-intervention’ position of individuals is altered by public spending or how
well public spending serves to redistribute resources to the poor (van de Walle 1995). Put differently,
it estimates how much the income of a household would have to be raised if the household fully pays
for the subsidized public services (Sabir 2003).

The BIA involves three steps: (a) array individuals or households by per capita income (or expenditures)
and group by deciles or percentiles; (b) compute estimate of the unit subsidy of providing a particular
type of government service as derived from official data on government spending; and (c) identify users
of the government service (based on data on individual or household service utilization) and impute the
unit subsidy to the said households or individuals (Demery 2000).

The BIA undertaken for this PER defines quintiles over population, that is, across individuals. Quintiles
of population or individuals result when all individuals, ranked by a welfare indicator, in this case per
capita expenditure, are divided into five groups containing the same number of individuals regardless
of their household membership.

To present the results of the analysis, this annex uses a graphical representation of the distribution of
benefits, that is, concentration curve or benefit concentration curve (Figure 56). This curve is generated
by plotting the cumulative distribution of ‘benefits’ of public spending on the y-axis against the
cumulative distribution of population sorted by per capita expenditure on the x-axis. One can assess the
progressivity or regressivity of a public subsidy by comparing the benefit concentration curve with the
45-degree diagonal and the Lorenz curve of consumption. The diagonal indicates neutrality in the
distribution of benefits. If the distribution of benefits lies along this line, the poorest 10 percent of the
population gets 10 percent of the subsidy, the poorest 20 percent accounts for 20 percent of the subsidy,
and so on. Thus, the diagonal reflects perfect equality in the distribution of benefits and it is also referred
to as a perfect equality line.

The distribution of benefits is said to be progressive if the lower-income groups receive a larger share
of the benefits from government spending than the higher-income groups. For instance, if the
concentration curve lies above the diagonal, then the poorest 10 percent of the population receives more
than 10 percent of the benefits and the distribution of benefits is said to be progressive in absolute terms.
Conversely, if the benefit concentration curve lies below the diagonal, then the poorest 10 percent of
the population captures less than 10 percent of the benefits and the distribution of benefits is said to be
regressive in absolute terms.

Annex 6. The FSM’s National Minimum Competency Test

Based on information from the FSM DoE in 2014, the NMCT is the only standard assessment tool
currently being used for assessing performance of elementary and secondary students in the FSM. The
GoFSM has developed guidelines for the administration of the NMCT, and these require the national
DoE in collaboration with the states’ DoE to administer the NMCT in math and reading to all the
students in the selected grades, beginning in 2013. All private and public schools were included in
testing for the school year 2013. The NMCT is administered to grades 6, 8, and 10 in reading and to
grades 4, 6, 8, and 10 in math. The assessment is based on the national curriculum standards and
benchmarks and is designed to identify weaknesses and strengths in teaching curriculum. In math, the
NMCT standards are as follows: Standard 1: numbers, operation, and computation; Standard 2:
geometry, measurements, and transformation; Standard 3: patterns and algebra; and Standard 4:
statistics and probability. In reading, the standards include reading and literature. While standards and
benchmarks are available for each grade, this annex illustrates these for reading and math for grade 8
only.

Annex 8. Incentives for Teacher Performance: Why Focus on Bonus Pay and Job Stability?

In contrast to most of the other incentives for teachers, both contracts without guaranteed tenure and
pay-for-performance programs establish direct links between teachers’ performance and their rewards
or sanctions. Thus, contract tenure and pay-for-performance reforms are potentially two of the strongest
instruments at the disposal of education policy makers to increase teachers’ accountability for results.

Contract teachers. International evidence suggests that the use of contract teachers can strengthen the
scope for local monitoring of teacher performance, resulting in higher teacher effort and hence improved
learning. The most rigorous of the seven available evaluations of contract teachers have all found them
to be more cost-effective than regular civil service teachers (Bruns, Filmer, and Patrinos 2011). In both
Kenya and India, randomized trials have found learning outcomes for students of contract teachers to
be equal to or better than those of civil service teachers despite contract teachers’ much lower salaries.
Nonexperimental studies in two additional states in India found similar results. Earlier evidence on
community-hired teachers in Central America (summarized in Vegas 2005) was less robust but also
suggested that contract teachers achieve similar or better student grade progression and learning
outcomes (controlling for student background) at lower cost. Although contract teachers usually work
for lower salaries than their civil service counterparts, the cost-effectiveness of a contract teacher policy
is likely to depend on country characteristics and the level of education involved. All of the evaluated
cases involved contract teachers at the primary level, for example, where the supply of potential teachers
with adequate skills is not as likely to be constrained as at the secondary level, or for specialty subjects
such as sciences and math. Second, there are nagging questions about the sustainability of this policy
over time. Many of the evaluated cases suggest that contract teachers may accept the lower salaries and
insecure tenure because they are queuing for civil service positions.

Teacher bonus incentives. In the right setting, and with the appropriate program parameters, teacher
bonus incentives can improve student outcomes. Teacher bonus initiatives in developing countries have
proliferated over the past several years, both as small-scale experiments and as high-profile, systemwide
reforms. In contrast to the situation just five years ago, and in contrast to recent U.S. evidence, a growing
body of developing-country studies suggests that bonus pay incentives can work—at least in settings
characterized by weak systems for performance monitoring and accountability, evidenced by relatively
high teacher absence rates, low teacher dismissal rates, and low student learning performance.
• Relatively weak teacher professionalism—evidenced in most cases by low standards for entry
• Relatively large bonus size—for example, an annual bonus of 30–300 percent of monthly salary
• Focused performance metrics—emphasis on a small number of key measurable results, notably
     student learning improvements or relatively easily measured teacher ‘inputs’ such as monthly
     attendance, rather than more complex, subjective, and comprehensive performance evaluations
• ‘Fair’ performance metrics—rewards to schools on a value-added basis (for progress relative to
     their starting point) or compared with schools with similar geographic and student socioeconomic
     conditions, not for absolute levels of performance
• Rewards clearly linked to prior period results—annual bonuses directly linked to test or other results
     for the previous school year or monthly bonuses for input measures monitored over the previous
     month, such as teacher attendance
Teacher bonus incentives ‘work’ in the sense that student learning outcomes improve in the presence
of the bonus. Across the eight most carefully evaluated cases, the bonus program raised average learning
outcomes in incentive schools relative to control schools by about a 0.15 standard deviation; in the
highest case, learning outcomes by the second year of the program were a 0.27 standard deviation
higher. Although not huge, effects in this order of magnitude are relatively rare across other types of
education interventions, and the consistency of positive impacts, across a wide variety of country
contexts, is noteworthy. Source: Bruns, Filmer, and Patrinos 2011.

Annex 9. General Principles Underlying a GFS System

Uses of the GFS System

The GFS system is designed to provide statistics that enable policy makers and analysts to study
developments in the financial operations, financial position, and liquidity situation of the general
government sector or the public sector in a consistent and systematic manner. The GFS analytic
framework can be used to analyze the operations of a specific level of government and transactions
between levels of government as well as the entire general government or public sector.

One method used in the GFS system to produce summary information on the overall performance and
financial position of the general government or public sector is through the use of a set of balancing
items, such as the net operating balance, net lending/borrowing, and the change in net worth. Such
balancing items are most effectively defined and measured within an integrated and comprehensive
accounting framework such as the GFS system.

In contrast to summary measures, the detailed data of the GFS system can be used to examine specific
areas of government operations. For example, one might want information about particular forms of
taxation, the level of expense incurred on a type of social service, or the amount of government
borrowing from the banking system.

The harmonization of the GFS system with other macroeconomic statistical systems means that data
from the GFS system can be combined with data from other systems to assess general government or
public sector developments in relation to the rest of the economy. Similarly, the establishment of
internationally recognized standards permits government finance statistics to be used in cross-country
analyses of government operations, such as comparisons of ratios of taxes or expense to GDP.

The GFS system pertains to the general government and public sectors as defined in the 1993 statement
of national accounts. These sectors are defined in terms of institutional units, which are economic
entities that are capable of owning assets, incurring liabilities, and engaging in economic activities and
transactions with other entities in their own right. These characteristics render institutional units a
subject of economic and statistical interest that can be satisfied by compilation of a full set of accounts
for them, including balance sheets.

Two types of flows are recorded in the GFS system: transactions and other economic flows. For the
most part, transactions are interactions between two institutional units that take place by mutual
agreement. The Statement of Government Operations records the results of all transactions during an
accounting period. They are classified as revenue, expense, net acquisitions of nonfinancial assets, net
acquisitions of financial assets, or net incurrences of liabilities. Transactions that generate revenue or
expense result in a change in net worth. Other types of transactions result in equal changes to assets
and/or liabilities and do not result in a change to net worth. Other economic flows include price changes
and a variety of other economic events that affect the holdings of assets and liabilities, such as debt
write-offs and catastrophic losses. The Statement of Other Economic Flows summarizes these changes
in assets, liabilities, and net worth. The Balance Sheet for the general government or public sector is a
statement of the stocks of financial and nonfinancial assets owned, the stock of claims of other units
against the owners of those assets in the form of liabilities, and the sector’s net worth, equal to the total
value of all assets less the total value of all liabilities.

The comprehensive treatment of transactions and other economic flows in the GFS system enables the
opening and closing balance sheets to be reconciled fully. That is, the stock of a given type of asset or
liability at the beginning of an accounting period plus the changes in that stock indicated by transactions
and other economic flows equals the stock at the end of the period. Such an integrated statistical system
permits the effects of policies and specific economic events to be described and analyzed fully.

Various classifications are applied to the flows and stocks recorded in the GFS system. For example,
each revenue transaction is classified according to whether it is a tax or another type of revenue, expense
transactions are classified by purpose and by economic type, assets are classified according to whether
they are financial or nonfinancial, and financial assets and liabilities are classified both by type of
instrument and the sector of the unit that issued the asset held by government or that holds the liability
issued by government.

Despite harmonization of the GFS system with the 1993 SNA, there are differences between the two
statistical systems. The most important difference is that the focus of the GFS system is on financial
transactions—taxing, spending, borrowing, and lending—while the 1993 SNA also focuses on the
production and consumption of goods and services. As a result, the treatment of government productive
activities in the GFS system differs substantially from the treatment of those activities in the 1993 SNA.
Significant differences relate to the treatment of own-account capital formation, retirement schemes for
government employees, and the degree of consolidation.

In many cases, the compilation of government finance statistics will be the first step in the compilation
of statistics for the general government sector of the national accounts. For this reason, some data that
normally would not appear in a standard GFS presentation should be maintained in subsidiary records
because they are needed for the national accounts. For example, the detailed estimates of retirement
schemes for government employees should be maintained so that the different treatment of such
schemes in the 1993 SNA can be accommodated.

Definitions of concepts in the GFS system are the same as in the 1993 SNA, but the coverage of a
particular category of transactions may be slightly different. For example, compensation of employees
recorded as an expense in the GFS system does not include the compensation of employees engaged in
own-account capital formation, but compensation of employees in the 1993 SNA includes the
compensation of all employees. The definition and composition of compensation of employees,
however, is identical in both systems. Using the same name when the coverage is different could be
misleading. To identify where the coverage or some other aspect of a concept differs from the same
concept in the 1993 SNA, the indicator ‘[GFS]’ is added after the GFS title and an explanation of the
difference is provided.

Contingencies, such as loan guarantees and implicit guarantees to provide social benefits when various
needs arise, can have important economic influences on the general economy but do not result in
transactions or other economic flows recorded in the GFS system until the event or condition referred
to actually occurs. As a result, provision is made for recording contingencies as memorandum items.

In terms of the implementation of the GFS system, some countries may be able, at least initially, to
compile only a small part of the GFS system. It is not appropriate to lay down general priorities for data
collection when economic circumstances may vary so much from one country to another. In practice,
priorities usually are best established by national authorities that are familiar with the situation, needs,
and problems of the individual countries in question and may require parallel TA.

Annex 10. International Examples of School Funding Formulae

There are several models for funding of schools and these were documented in Levačić (2006). It
highlighted four main types of factors in the derivation of financing formula: (a) basic pupil numbers
weighted by different age or grade of education; (b) curriculum-related formula (notably to reflect
language teaching); (c) pupil-related factors (notably reflecting disadvantage for particular
socioeconomic and minority groups); and (d) school-related factors (notably small size and geographic
location). To reflect the significant differences in the precision of some formulae, some additional
subcategories within the four main headings are added. A particular feature is the use of ‘safety netting’
for a limited period to assist the gains or losses of moving to a formula-based system. Australia and
California, USA are two countries with the ‘safety netting’ criterion. The following are important
considerations for each of the four blocks with country examples.

    (a)     Block Grants - by Pupil Numbers

The calculation of pupil numbers is either derived from the actual enrolment on a fixed census date
(which is then fed into the annual education management information system statistics) or on an average
daily enrolment where the data can be regularly updated. Most countries using a census approach select
a date close to the start of the school year; this may not therefore reflect dropout over the school year
and is open to some degree of manipulation. Furthermore, since the EMIS system is updated only once
a year, the census data is used retrospectively (that is, the data of the previous year are used).

The weighting of the student numbers is important, particularly if the formula reflects staffing costs. In
general, most formula systems use a three- or four-level approach depending on whether preschool is
included. Preschool students generally carry a higher weighting because of the need for lower class
sizes and higher staffing ratios (and also to some extent more varied equipment). Higher secondary also
usually attracts greater weights because of subject specialism and, therefore, lower class sizes as well
as the need for more science and vocational equipment. Both New Zealand and Republic of Korea’s
funding formula reflect such student weights. New Zealand groups students in four age groups: primary
grade 1–6, secondary grade 7–8, 9–10, and 11–12. In Korea, preschool (KG), primary, junior secondary,
and high school are the four student allocation levels.

    (b)     Block Grants - by Curriculum

The main weighting given on curriculum concerns the provision of alternative language education apart
from the primary language of instruction. This can be either dual language provision for a large number
of students or schools or provision of an alternative language medium at schools for a minority
community. Examples can be found in Estonia; Ontario, Canada; and New Zealand. In Estonia, the
government overfunds places where there is a sufficient minority of students in any municipality who
wish to study in one of the two main languages of instruction (Estonian or Russian). In Ontario, Canada,
the government funds both language and cultural studies for ‘First American’ and Innuit groups.
Funding for additional language provision should be distinguished from support for additional remedial
language help for non-native speakers; this is dealt with under the pupil disadvantage block. In New
Zealand, the government funds Maori Immersion schools based on four levels of the extent to which
the curriculum is partially or completely taught in Maori.

Other curriculum enhancements can be for particular specialism schools requiring specialized teachers
and equipment. These can include music and performing arts, specialist science and medical vocational
skills, and sports. For example, Poland has 14 additional weights to reflect specialist types of education
in music, art, health, and sports, while Lithuania has different weightings for vocational schools.


                                                   118
    (c)      Block Grants - by Disadvantaged Pupil Criteria

Disadvantaged pupils are reflected in formula funding for three types of disadvantages. The first group
of weights is for various forms of special learning needs arising from physical or learning difficulties.
In some countries, these additional weightings are only for pupils studying in mainstream schools; in
other countries, special schools are included wholly within the funding formula and the weights
allocated are large, given the often small sizes of the schools and the specialist nature of care that is
needed. Countries that provide additional weights for special needs students include Australia; New
Zealand; and Ontario, Canada.

The second group of weights concerns socioeconomic disadvantage. This is usually identified through
a proxy indicator such as eligibility for free or reduced price school meals (in Malaysia, the personal
income tax threshold or the distribution of special family subsidies for households with income under
MYR 2,500 per month could also be used). Another indicator of disadvantage that is often used is the
low educational background of one or both parents which is found from census information. The
example of Ontario, Canada, exemplifies this type of weights: special allocations are given to four
socioeconomically disadvantaged groups: (a) low-income; (b) recent immigration to Canada; (c) single
parent; and (d) low parent education. In a number of countries (for example, Australia, New Zealand
and some U.S. states), an additional amount is added to reflect the impact on learning needs and
resources of a concentration of pupils of socioeconomic disadvantage, which are assessed by quartiles
or deciles. For example, Australia provides extra allocation to schools that have a concentration of
pupils from the two lowest socioeconomic quartiles. In California, this compensates for the fact that
pupils cannot be weighted twice for different factors.

The third category concerns pupil disadvantages relating to being immigrant children whose native
language is not the medium of instruction. In the United Kingdom, for example, this language allocation
must be calculated on a pupil-by-pupil basis and is limited to a three-year period of adjustment although
the rate may be higher for secondary compared to primary pupils, to reflect higher costs of acquiring
fluency at a later age of entry into school. In Australia, students who come from a non-English
background and have parent(s) completing limited English courses are given more allocation. In
Norway, 3.4 percent of funding is allocated to non-Scandinavian-speaking students who are either
children from non-Scandinavian countries or Norwegians born with immigrant parents from non-
Scandinavian countries.

    (d)      Block Grants - by School-related Criteria

The school-related criteria usually consist of three main elements. The first is block allocations to reflect
the fixed costs of schools. These block allocations are usually made to support smaller schools that are
at a disadvantage in heavily pupil-driven formula allocations. For example, Australia provides special
small school allocations. The maximum additional funding is AUD 150,000 for primary schools and
AUD 240,000 for secondary schools. Similarly, England provides a lump sum (optional) of up to GBP
200,000 for small schools.

The second class of criteria relates to reflecting the higher costs of geographic locations which are often
but not always linked to smaller schools. Usually this relates to the higher costs of providing educational
facilities in areas with scattered populations (which may include higher costs of home to school
transport, educational supplies, and utilities plus extra salary supplements for teachers.) However, they
can also reflect higher urban living costs for teachers working in high cost areas in or near major cities.
Examples for this type of location-specific weights can be found in New Zealand, Armenia, and
Norway. In New Zealand, isolated schools receive additional funding. Armenia places an allocation
weight of 1.02 and 1.2, respectively, for schools that are in mountainous areas and high mountainous

                                                    119
areas, to support extra cost. In Norway, 5.08 percent of allocations target location-related costs, based
on two criteria: the number of different zones having 2,000 inhabitants and the number of wards in each
municipality.

The third class of criteria reflects special school characteristics and higher costs such as split sites; the
use of historic buildings; safety and security issues; or, as in parts of former Soviet Union countries and
China, different winter heating needs and systems.
