Overview
Highlights
 For a rapidly urbanizing world, well-planned and well-functioning urban transport provides vital arteries
  for efficient urban economies, linking the poor and disadvantaged to opportunities and services, and
  helping address key transport-induced challenges such as congestion, pollution, safety, and sprawl, that
  evolve without appropriate planning, regulation, and investment.
 The evaluation exercise focuses on three themes that cut across strategies and project designs during
  FY07–16: mobility for all (including the poor, women, and persons with disabilities), sustainable service
  delivery, and institutional development.
 In spite of the pressing need arising from rapid urbanization, Africa has a declining urban transport
  portfolio that in the second half of the review period (FY12–06) focused increasingly on urban roads.
  Upper-middle-income countries represent 43 percent of the evaluation portfolio commitments.
 Overall, the World Bank Group has been effective in supporting improved service quality and increased
  access, but approaches based on increasing infrastructure capacity are not balanced with approaches
  based on demand management.
 Among disadvantaged groups (poor, women, disabled persons, elderly) the poor received the most
  support. Much less attention was paid to the special needs of women and disabled persons.
 Affordability of urban transport services is rarely analyzed in the World Bank Group’s projects, with
  unknown impact on the mobility of the disadvantaged. Financial sustainability remains a challenge for the
  provision of public transport services. Financing gaps between revenues and operation and maintenance
  costs are common. The World Bank is often optimistic in appraising the costs, timing, and financial
  viability of mass transit projects.
 Efforts to engage the private sector to achieve operational efficiencies and improved financing seldom
  combine the policy and institutional strengths of the World Bank with transactional strengths of the
  International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.
 The World Bank Group has achieved localized environmental mitigation benefits along key urban transit
  corridors or systems, but broader environmental benefits could be still be achieved by using a
  comprehensive approach that combines upstream (policy and sector framework) and downstream
  (operational) measures.
 Weak institutional capacity and coordination remains a critical challenge in the urban transport sector.
  Institutional development support is a part of 80 percent of World Bank Group projects, yet these often
  focus on a single local body during a one-time project. Longer-term and more ambitious institutional
  reform engagements occurred in only a few cities.
 The World Bank Group’s contribution to urban transport development goes beyond projects. Investments
  often provide a platform for the World Bank Group to offer guidance, training, technical assistance, and
  learning throughout the project cycle, South-South learning and exchange, and good practices for
  demonstration to sector stakeholders and further adoption.

 Bank Group support for
 mobility of the disadvantaged.
 Ex ante analysis of impacts on
 women, and a focus on their
 security and amenities, were
 the exception rather than the
 norm. Where targeted
 interventions were provided,
 projects seldom tracked the
 impacts on these
 disadvantaged groups. The
 opportunity to mainstream
 support for the disadvantaged,
 to routinely utilize
 affordability analysis, and to
 learn from results are all UT
 project design features whose
 potential remains untapped.

 mitigation through urban

 only localized impacts.
 Addressing environmental
 sustainability at a policy level,
 coupled with an investment
 operation, showed a better
 chance of environmental
 success. However, policy
 support can only be effective if
 it is enforced. Projects with a
 comprehensive approach,
 offering upstream and
 downstream support, were
 more likely to yield citywide
 environmental sustainability.

 to be largely disconnected
 from relevant “upstream” work
 of the World Bank.
 Consequently, there may be
 unrealized investment
 opportunities involving private
 service provision of urban
 transport services.
 *This report took a pilot approach whereby Management developed recommendations based on IEG’s findings and
 conclusions. The draft recommendations in the matrix will be finalized upon formal endorsement by the Board.

1. Why Urban Transport Matters
 Highlights
  Urban transport provides vital arteries in increasingly urbanized developing countries for efficient urban
   economies, connectors for the poor and disadvantaged, and a means to help address key urbanization
   challenges such as congestion, pollution, and transit safety that evolve without appropriate planning,
   regulation, and investment.
  This evaluation focuses on three themes rooted in World Bank Group strategy: mobility for all including
   the disadvantaged, financially and environmentally sustainable service delivery, and institutional
   development to strengthen sector management.

More than half the world’s population live in cities, and this share will grow to 60
percent by 2030. In developing countries, cities are powerful engines of economic
growth and potential poverty alleviation, but they also face challenges. Rapid
urbanization exerts pressure on all urban systems and services, ranging from water
and power supply to education, health, and transport. For example, while the
world’s cities occupy just 3 percent of its land mass, they account for more than 60
percent of energy consumption and 75 percent of carbon emissions. 1

Most developing country cities share mobility and accessibility limitations due to
increased motorization, with negative effects on urban structure and serious welfare
implications for the urban poor in travel time, health, safety, expense, and access to
job opportunities. These cities are often poorly planned and tend to have weak
institutional capacity. Appropriate transport policies, planning, institutions, and
services can bring large gains to urban economies and improve the welfare of the
urban poor, as part of broader urban development activities (UN 2015).

Urban transport (UT) matters for at least three reasons:

    •   Urban transport systems facilitate the movement of people and goods and
        provide access to economic and social opportunities. The literature confirms
        that investments in transport lead to increased productivity and growth (Berg
        et al. 2015). In particular, UT investments facilitate employment growth
        (Duranton and Turner 2012).
    •   Urban transport connects the urban poor to job opportunities and other
        services, and can facilitate safe accessibility for women and disabled and
        elderly persons. With planning and investment in public transit, integrated
        services and ticketing can improve affordability and convenience so that the
        poor can manage their longer, and often more complex, journeys to their


                                                                                                                1

        destinations (Suzuki, Cervero, and Iuchi 2013). For women, investment in
        security services, lighting, and adequate bathroom facilities can make systems
        more accessible. For elderly and disabled persons, appropriate system design
        and investment would bring universal access.
    •   Urban transport can help mitigate the negative consequences of congestion,
        pollution, safety risks, and poor security associated with unplanned city
        growth. Rapid motorization puts city transportation systems and
        environment under pressure. Wasted time and fuel in traffic, and motor
        vehicle air pollution, cost billions of dollars (Litman 2015). Weak regulation
        and law enforcement increases urban safety risks. Africa, for example, has the
        highest proportion of pedestrian and cyclist deaths at 43 percent of all road
        traffic casualties (WHO 2015). Better planned and delivered urban transport
        systems and services can help address these challenges (Dittmar and Ohland
        2012).


Why an Urban Transport Evaluation?
Sustainable urban transport is a recognized goal of the international community. Its
value is affirmed in the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG 11.2 sets
the objective of providing access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable
transport systems for all by 2030. 2 In addition, the 21st meeting of the Conference of
the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change set the objective of “sustainable transport” (UNEP 2015).

Urban mobility is a strategic objective of the World Bank Group, understood to
advance its twin development goals of shared prosperity and extreme poverty
eradication by contributing to efficiency and growth and access of the poor to
opportunity, while addressing urbanization challenges. In the face of rapid
urbanization and its challenges, recent World Bank strategies have come to embrace
the objectives of mobility for all and financial and environmental sustainability
(figure 1.1). At the same time attention has increasingly turned toward more
comprehensive and inclusive approaches, specifically public and nonmotorized
transport (NMT).

IFC and MIGA do not have an explicit urban transport strategy. 3 The number of
urban transport projects among them is small but relevant to the World Bank
Group’s policy framework. A review of five recent IFC Roadmaps found almost no
strategic discussion of urban transport. 4 However, there was a reference to IFC
participation in urban infrastructure public-private partnerships (PPPs). IFC’s
infrastructure development strategy also refers briefly to urban transport

development. Similarly, while MIGA is involved in six guarantees in urban
transport, it has no strategic objectives for this sector.

Given the importance of urban transport, therefore, this evaluation exercise aims at
filling a relevant evaluative gap because no prior Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) evaluation focused on urban transport in spite of a substantial portfolio of $25
billion of commitments during the evaluation period, 2007–16. IEG carried out an
evaluation in 2013 entitled Improving Institutional Capability and Financial Viability to
Sustain Transport, but it only included a portfolio of 58 World Bank and 2 IFC and 2
MIGA projects. The current evaluation builds on the findings of that evaluation but
has a broader scope and a refined focus on UT.

Objective, Scope, and Methodology
The overarching question this evaluation set out to answer is: “To what extent has
the World Bank Group supported sustainable urban transport development in client
countries that contributed to cities’ efficiency and economic growth, environmental
quality, the welfare of the poor and vulnerable groups, and road and traffic safety?”
To answer this question, a theory of change articulates the development impact
assumptions underlying the World Bank Group’s activities in UT. The theory of
change (figure 1.2) identifies the links between the activities of the World Bank
Group in the urban transport sector and their expected outcomes, which, in turn, are
necessary preconditions to achieve the World Bank Group’s long-term development
goals.

WHY URBAN TRANSPORT MATTERS
The scope of the evaluation focuses on the intermediate outcomes identified in the
theory of change, which reflect the three themes that emerged from IEG’s review of
World Bank Group strategy, the World Bank Group’s urban transport portfolio, and
relevant literature:

Mobility for all—including the disadvantaged: the poor, women, and disabled and
elderly persons. Key parameters to assess the mobility impact of World Bank
Group’s urban transport activities include:
              o Enhanced capacity and improved quality;
              o Improved demand management (traffic management measures,
                integrated transport and land use planning, shift demand from private
                vehicles to public transport);
              o Inclusive services with targeted interventions for the disadvantaged;
              o Affordable service (to reduce transport cost to the disadvantaged)
              o Improved mobility for all as a result of the support listed above. 5

Financially and environmentally sustainable service delivery. Sustainable
transport systems are people-oriented, financially sustainable, and protective of the
environment. Parameters to assess financial and environmental sustainability of
the World Bank Group’s urban transport activities include:

          o Quality of financial analysis and economic analysis;
          o Involvement of private sector and its impact on financial sustainability;
          o Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) and pollutant emissions;
          o Issuance and enforcement of related environmental regulation.
Institutional development to strengthen sector and city management. Key
parameters to assess the impact of urban transport activities include:
          o Institutional capacity building for urban sector management and
            operation; capacity building for human resources;
          o Fiscal capacity enhancement;
          o Strategic, policy, and regulatory framework;
          o Structural reform or alignment of relevant institution.
Evaluative tools: The evaluation applied five instruments. As elaborated in
appendix A, these include (i) a portfolio review and analysis of relevant World Bank
Group financing and advisory and analytic products; (ii) nine in-depth relevant
Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs); (iii) five country case studies and
six desk reviews; (iv) partnership reviews of the Public Private Infrastructure
Advisory Facility (PPIAF) and the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Program (SSATP);
and (v) interviews with relevant World Bank Group staff, counterparts, clients,
beneficiaries, other stakeholders, and experts. In addition, IEG piloted two “lenses”
highlighting the attributes of behavior change and service delivery (appendix F).

The portfolio under evaluation posed certain challenges given its diversity and the
relative youth of the long-gestating infrastructure projects. For the 10-year
evaluation period (including all projects closed 2007–16), IEG found 104 evaluated
and validated UT lending projects. Most of these were road projects, leaving very
few evaluated bus rapid transit (BRT) and Metro projects. Three IFC and two MIGA
projects were evaluated. There is no validated evaluative system for the World
Bank’s Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) projects. In addition, the team found
a lack of uniformity in the nature and quality of indicators of mobility, institutional
development, and financial and environmental sustainability applied across
projects, as well as numerous instances of missing targets and measures, whether at
baseline, project closure, or both. Thus the evaluative challenge was to find results

2. The World Bank Group’s Portfolio Support
for Urban Transport
 Highlights
  The World Bank Group has a portfolio of $24.5 billion in urban transport during the review period 2007–16.
   IFC and MIGA emphasized private sector participation.
  Regionally, in spite of the pressing need arising from rapid urbanization, Africa had a sharply declining
   portfolio that in the past five years of the review period focused on urban roads.
  The portfolio since 2012 has concentrated more on upper middle income countries, raising questions of
   whether poorer countries were underemphasized.

The World Bank Group’s engagement in urban transport involves a portfolio of
nearly $25 billion over the past decade. Of 297 financing projects, the World Bank
was responsible for 93 percent of projects, worth $23.5 billion, with IFC delivering
over half a billion dollars in financing and MIGA guarantees totaling $1.1 billion.
During the period under review, 140 projects were closed and 104 were evaluated.

IEG found a high degree of relevance of overall World Bank support for urban
transport development to the priorities of client countries. IEG reviewed 383 country
strategy documents, 33 percent of which mention urban transport. Among these, 59
percent had at least one urban transportproject approved during the relevant period.
Country strategies for 12 countries (evenly distributed in Africa, Europe and Central
Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean) mention urban transport in the country
strategies without having project-level support for it.

IEG’s portfolio analysis suggests five basic types of projects: four associated with
distinctive modes (i.e., roads, conventional buses, BRT, and metro or rail), and one
focused on upstream activities intended to build policies and sectoral oversight
capacity (figure 2.1).

   •    Roads: 144 “roads-only” projects financed construction and improvement of
        urban roads without accompanying support for public transport. Of these, 21
        percent were dedicated road projects 1 under the Transport and Information
        and Communications Technology Global Practice (Transport GP) while
        others were nondedicated 2 road projects under other GPs; 66 percent of these
        were under the Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience GP (GPSURR). Road
        projects tend to be smaller than other urban transport projects; although they
        comprise 49 percent of projects, they involve just 29 percent of commitments.



                                                                                                            7
CHAPTER 2
THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S PORTFOLIO SUPPORT FOR URBAN TRANSPORT
    •   Conventional buses: 44 projects support conventional bus systems, including
        bus terminals/depots/stations, bus dispatching systems, priority lanes,
        and/or new or upgraded buses, as opposed to rapid mass transit options
        such as BRT or metro systems. Fifty-seven percent of the conventional bus
        projects are dedicated under the Transport GP and the rest were
        nondedicated mainly under the GPSURR.
    •   BRT: 17 projects supported BRT systems involving dedicated and prioritized
        BRT lanes, specialized infrastructure, and acquisition of a BRT fleet.
        Compared to conventional bus systems, BRT systems require substantial
        construction, so although they comprised less than 7 percent of projects, they
        represented 13 percent of commitments.
    •   Metro and urban rail: 29 projects supported metros or urban or suburban
        rail. These capital-intensive investments comprise only 10 percent of UT
        projects but 29 percent of commitments (figure 2.1). This included 24 projects
        in 16 cities in eight countries which financed main system infrastructure such
        as tracks, cars, and signaling. Another five projects financed infrastructure
        connected to metro systems such as terminals and infrastructure for
        integration with other public transport modes. Twenty-one are dedicated
        projects under the Transport GP, five under MIGA, and three under IFC.
    •   Other modes: Eight projects invest in transport modes other than the four
        main modes, for example, a MIGA guarantee for ferries in Turkey and an IFC
        investment in an Indonesian taxi company.
    •   Upstream activities: Finally, 55 projects include only upstream activities
        intended to facilitate the enabling environment, focusing on policy reform
        and institutional design issues. The main instruments applied included
        development policy loans, technical assistance loans, and 13 investment
        project financing.

                                 THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S PORTFOLIO SUPPORT FOR URBAN TRANSPORT
Some projects support more than one mode. Projects that support conventional
buses and BRT also construct and upgrade roads for private car users, for example;
and projects that support integration of different systems across modes sometimes
support multiple systems. Moreover, close to 50 percent of the BRT and
conventional bus projects, 24 percent of metro, and 17 percent of roads projects
include support for NMT users (pedestrians, cyclists). While Transport GP projects
were generally dedicated to transport and often financed public transit, GP SURR
projects often had multiple urban development goals and only a minority of finance
went to urban transport, usually for roads.

Although urbanization increased during the evaluation period, the overall portfolio
trend (measured by projects appraised and their commitment/guarantee value) was
flat (figure 2.2) except for 2010, when there was a one-year surge in the wake of the
global financial crisis. 3 Upstream support held steady and the value of roads
projects edged upward. The number of public transit projects—metro, BRT, and
conventional bus—increased slightly, but average project size was smaller.

Regional Distribution and the African Exception
Regionally, both the number and value of projects in the East Asia and Pacific
Region grew dramatically. In the Latin America and the Caribbean Region, the
number of projects declined sharply, as did commitment values. Yet the sharpest
decline was in the Sub-Saharan Africa Region. Not only did commitments decline by
35 percent in the second half of the evaluation period, but the number of projects
approved in the second half of the period

declined by nearly 60 percent (figure 2.3). Further, road only projects grew from 53
percent to 81 percent of commitments, while support for public transport in the
latter period all but disappeared (figure 2.4), in spite of rapid urbanization and the
World Bank’s sectoral strategy favoring public transit and NMT. There was a
concommitant reduction in staffing. Earlier World Bank Group efforts in Africa
experienced delays and cost overruns (Ghana, Tanzania) and difficulties with
                                                             sustainability (Nigeria).

                                                           and the literature indicate
                                                           that roads alone cannot

By income level, the emphasis has shifted somewhat from lower middle-income to
upper middle-income countries, led by a focus on metro (rail) systems (figure 2.5).
By commitment value, the refocus is more stark—in the most recent period, 44
percent of commitment value was in upper middle-income countries, up from 28
percent in the first period. Informants offered a variety of explanations for why the

and readiness for private sector participation.

Advisory Services and Analytics
During the evaluation period, the World Bank delivered 165 pieces of Advisory
Services and Analytics (ASA) in urban transport. ASA focused on lower middle-
income countries (38 percent), followed by upper middle-income countries (24
percent) and low-income countries (12 percent). ASA tended to cover multiple
modes of transportation or the entire urban transport sector, or multiple urban
services. Regionally, East Asia saw nearly a quarter of all ASA, while Africa saw
only 6 percent.

IEG’s review of ASA documents found that the World Bank’s advisory work
supported the view that urban transport interventions can be planned and
implemented to support sustainable economic development and mobility
improvements, and other benefits to the environment, social integration, and safety.
The documents highlighted numerous cross-cutting topics related to UT; with most
ASAs reviewing a large array of sub-sectoral interventions (for example, in land use
and planning). Sixty-nine percent concerned upstream policy and institutional

percent of ASAs), while only 16 percent focused on a single mode of transport
(figure 2.6).

THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S PORTFOLIO SUPPORT FOR URBAN TRANSPORT
     •   Factors promoting inclusion and options for pro-poor transport policies.
     •   Access or use by women and disabled persons.
     •   Subsidies and financing schemes to support financial viability.
     •   PPPs, and within those, financial viability and assessment mechanisms.
     •   Technical aspects: physical standards, intelligent transport systems, and
         traffic management measures (especially regarding road safety).
     •   NMT.

Because the World Bank did not track it, IEG found no systematic evidence of ASA
influence, only individual examples. For example, in Ghana, background studies on
transport demand, use, challenges and potential options and routes laid a clear base
for its urban transport project, through a series of trust-funded (PPIAF and Global
Environmental Fund [GEF]) technical studies. More broadly, in all country cases,
partnerships and trust funds financed a major part of ASA delivery, often
complementing financing projects.


IFC and MIGA Portfolios
IFC’s Investment Services (IS) project engagements are concentrated in a small
number of countries, with 80 percent of commitment value in four countries
(Colombia, the Russian Federation, Senegal, and Turkey). Its investments are split
between direct investments in private providers of services and subnational finance
projects specifically supporting urban transport investments. IFC provided
subnational financing to Izmir (Turkey) for its metro, while in Senegal, IFC lent
directly to the owner of the concession company (SENAC) selected to design, build,
operate, and maintain a toll road connecting downtown Dakar to the city’s airport.

IFC also approved 15 Advisory Services (AS) projects with an expenditure of $20.8
million. Of these, 80 percent were in lower middle-income countries, none in low-
income countries. IFC AS supported clients in mobilizing private sector investments
in UT sectors, mostly in public transport, 27 percent supporting metro and urban
rail, and 33 percent supporting BRT.

MIGA’s portfolio is small: five of six guarantees were in Turkey (three in the city of
Izmir, two in Istanbul) and five of six were for metro projects. MIGA’s newest
product, a guarantee against nonhonoring of sovereign financial obligations
(NHSFO), is suited to lumpy infrastructure investments where a stream of public
payments is critical to profitability. For example, MIGA issued an NHSFO guarantee
worth more than $400 million for a loan to the Metropolitan Municipality of
Istanbul, relating to early phases of construction of an underground metro system.

3. Mobility for All
 Highlights
  The World Bank Group has been generally effective in helping countries to improve urban
    transport service quality and access.
  The World Bank Group effectively improved mobility on the transport systems or in the areas
   with its interventions.
  City-wide mobility was not achieved because demand management (shifting and avoiding travel
   demand) measures are yet to be broadly supported and successfully implemented.
  The mobility improvement for disadvantaged groups is limited, largely because the targeted
   interventions were limited and affordability was hardly addressed.


Poor urban mobility is a common issue in both developing and developed countries,
but the situation in developing countries is far worse. The average congestion level
for 72 large cities in Western Europe and the United States is 22 percent. Comparable
data are available for 14 large cities in three countries with World Bank Group urban
transport projects (Brazil, China, and Turkey), whose average congestion level is 36
percent. 1 Mobility for all relies on effective urban transport service delivery, which is
multidimensional and requires:

     •   Increased supply of service, hence enhanced capacity of systems and better
         service quality. A shortage of infrastructure is one reason for poor mobility.
         Cities require continuous investment both to address gaps and to
         accommodate fast-growing demand. For example, in Vietnam, the road
         network in Hanoi covers less than 7 percent of the land area (Fang 2011), in
         contrast to almost 25 percent road network coverage in many U.S. cities, 15
         percent in most European cities, and 11 percent in China’s large cities. Users,
         particularly the poor who have no alternative means of transport, experience
         low-quality and even dangerous transport service;
     •    Improved travel demand management (TDM). Globally, it has become
         abundantly clear that although increased supply can meet travel demand to
         some degree, no city can build its way out of congestion (World Bank 2002). 2
         TDM includes integrated transport and land-use planning, adequate
         regulations and pricing of private vehicle and motorbike usage, and on-road
         traffic management measures. Such approaches help to balance travel needs
         with the capacity of available facilities by containing urban sprawl, creating
         compact and pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, and reducing per capita

         vehicle-kilometers travelled, and are a part of any comprehensive urban
         transport solution;
    •    Inclusive services. In developing countries, increasing urban population
         combined with unplanned urban development leads to decentralized urban
         sprawl and piecemeal development patterns. The urban poor often gravitate
         to the fringes of the cities, where public transport is inadequate and the travel
         distances to work and many services are longer. The spatial disconnection of
         the urban poor excludes the poor from accessing job opportunities and
         services, and is thus an important contributor to poverty;
    •    Affordable service: Unaffordable urban transport service is a hard constraint
         for the poor. A recent study in Africa noted that the poorest households in 11
         African cities (Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Dakar, Dar-es-Salaam, Douala,
         Kampala, Kigali, Kinshasa, Lagos, Nairobi, and Ouagadougou, ) would need
         to spend around 19 percent of their household budget to afford a round-trip
         motorized commute. For the poorest quintile, the figure is 53 percent in Dar
         es Salaam, and more than 100 percent in Lagos. Such high costs relative to
         household budgets in African cities have led to travel patterns dominated by
         walking, which greatly limits access to economic opportunities (Lall et al.
         2017).


Enhanced Capacity and Improved Service Quality
The World Bank Group has been successful in increasing the supply of urban
transport infrastructure and services in client countries with its support for urban
transport. In the past 10 years, the World Bank Group approved 245 urban transport
projects (about 82 percent of the portfolio) with components designed to increase the
supply of infrastructure and services, and delivered 104 of them, with a total
commitment amount of $11.4 billion (table 3.1).

CHAPTER 3
MOBILITY FOR ALL
In some countries, the World Bank Group’s support for increasing the supply
represented only a small contribution to system capacity. For example, during the
evaluation period, the World Bank Group approved three metro/urban rail projects
to support three metro systems in three Chinese cities, while between 2009 and 2015,
the Chinese government built 87 metro/urban rail systems in 25 cities.

In other countries, however, the World Bank Group pioneered urban transport
services. For example, the “BRT-lite” concept was first introduced by the World
Bank Group to African cities, and the first system opened in Lagos, Nigeria in 2008. 3
In Tanzania, the World Bank introduced the country’s first BRT, which became fully
operational in 2016 (World Bank 2017). In Ecuador, the World Bank, in conjunction
with the Inter-American Development Bank, the Corporación Andina de Fomento,
and the European Investment Bank, introduced mass transit with construction of the
first line of the Quito Metro (World Bank 2013).

The increased supply of urban transport services facilitated by World Bank Group
projects translates into improved service quality, as evidenced by improved service
reliability and user satisfaction. Forty-eight evaluated projects measured quality
outcomes; 63 percent of these achieved quality improvement targets. In Brazil,
increased availability of rolling stock (Rio de Janeiro) and additional trains and
signaling capacity (São Paolo) contributed to increased train frequency and reduced
peak wait times. In the Mumbai Urban Transport Project, the capacity of the train
fleet was increased (through the addition of 285 nine-car trains), as was the peak
hour average frequency of train service. Improvements in quality were reflected by
higher levels of user satisfaction. The Colombia Integrated Mass Transit Systems
project reported that between 74 percent and 83 percent of people surveyed (2012)
rated the BRT system as better than the traditional bus system. In the Lima
Transport Project, the percentage of users satisfied with the metro system exceeded
the target. Reasons cited by users included reduced waiting times, shorter trip times,
new and modern cars, and enhancement of train stations, all of which contributed to
better service delivery.


Improved Demand Management
Relatively few World Bank Group urban transport projects supported TDM. About
123 projects (40 percent) of the World Bank Group’s urban transport portfolio
included one or more type of TDM activity. This is in contrast to the high share of
projects supporting an increased supply of service (82 percent). Within a broadly
defined concept of TDM, the World Bank Group employs three different
approaches:

                                                                         MOBILITY FOR ALL
   •   improving traffic flows, given the existing levels of on-road travel demand,
       through traffic management interventions;
   •   mitigating travel demand, to avoid future demand increases or adverse
       consequences thereof, through integrated transport and land-use planning;
       and
   •   shifting travel demand from private vehicles to public transit systems
       through policies to discourage private vehicle usage.

Projects which invest in improved/increased supply of on-road public transport
systems (conventional buses and BRTs) are the most active in applying TDM
measures (figure 3.1).

Figure 3.1. Traffic Demand Management Measures in World Bank Group Urban Transport
Activities, by Mode




The most commonly used TDM approach was traffic management interventions
such as installation of area or central traffic control systems, capacity building of
traffic management units, and enhancement of information technology (IT) systems.
In WuHan, China, the World Bank supported three urban transport projects during
the evaluation period, all three of which supported traffic management measures in
the city. Some projects also included improved urban road engineering design.
About 60 percent of bus-based public transport projects (conventional buses and/or
BRTs) incorporated traffic management measures, as compared with only 18 percent
of metro projects and 13 percent of roads-only projects. Traffic management
activities have increased in frequency over time, but this type of support was often
limited to a specific transport corridor or a certain area of a city.

Eleven evaluated projects sought to reduce travel time and improve mobility of
users through improved traffic management; 82 percent of these were successful. In
Wuhan, traffic management measures had a significant, positive impact on traffic


                                                                                      17

congestion overall. The implementation of Area Traffic Control (ATC) resulted in
improvement of traffic speed on average by 11 percent, delays at intersections were
reduced by 28 percent, and vehicles made 19 percent fewer stops before they passed
an intersection (Zhan 2015). In India’s Mumbai Urban Transport Project, an ATC
system was implemented, resulting in smoother and faster flows of traffic at
intersections.

Support for mitigating travel demand was provided in 80 projects (27 percent)
through integration of urban transport and city development plans. Compact city
development, which enables people to travel less distance to get to jobs, markets,
and services, is one solution to sprawl, and begins with integrating transport plans
with land use. Public transit projects (BRT, conventional buses, and metro/urban
rails) included more of such support than the road-only projects. Large cities are the
main recipients of integrated urban planning support, while medium and small
cities, despite being among the fastest-growing, rarely received support.

Twenty-eight projects (80 percent of the closed projects with activities on integrated
plans) produced and delivered integrated land-use plans, transport-oriented
development strategies, or, in a few cases, a general or urban transport master plan.
However, information regarding the adoption and application of integrated plans
was rarely reported. This could be partly explained by the typically “one-time”
nature of World Bank Group urban transport engagements in any city; that is, only
nine cities out of about 100 received more than one dedicated project during the
evaluation period. After the project closes, the World Bank Group loses leverage
(and lacks budget) to track the impacts of policy reforms. At the same time,
changing land use patterns takes time, local government may have limited authority
and capacity to coordinate integration of land and transport planning agencies, and
actions taken in recent years may take decades to achieve results.

Public transport uses less road space than private vehicles to move the same number
of users. Consequently, shifting people from private vehicles to public transport
would increase overall mobility for urban residents. The World Bank Group has
delivered results on quality and capacity through the supply of public transport,
which does encourage its use. Yet, such “pull” factors are not sufficient to achieve
large modal shifts. “Push” measures—such as rationing or charging for private
vehicles to limit or discourage usage—are important complements. 4 These include,
but are not limited to, vehicle quota systems, license number–based restrictions in
central business districts, highly occupied vehicle, peak-hour usage and parking
limits, and congestion pricing. The level of technical sophistication and political
sensitivity of these measures varies, and few of these TDM approaches were found
in the World Bank Group’s urban transport portfolio. Overall, only about 28

                                                                        MOBILITY FOR ALL
projects, or 10 percent of urban transport projects, included push measures, either
through limiting parking or congestion pricing. A higher proportion of bus-based
transport projects support this type of TDM approach (29 percent for conventional
buses, 20 percent for BRT) than either metro or roads-only projects (4 percent each).

Efforts to shift demand, however, did not appear to have been effective, mainly
owing to lack of implementation or, when implemented, weak enforcement. During
the evaluation period, 15 closed and evaluated projects (15 percent) aimed at
achieving the modal shift from private to public transport. Within this subset of
projects, while the support led to increased ridership in 67 percent of the cases, the
public transit modal share increase happened in 53 percent of the cases. Also, it was
not clear whether the increased ridership was a shift from private cars. In some
projects, the share of public transport even decreased. In Senegal’s Urban Mobility
Improvement adaptable policy loan, for example, the targeted public transport
modal share was not met despite a significant (12 percent) increase in public
transport ridership from 2007–08; in fact, the modal share had remained stable at
about 62 percent since end-2005. In Tunisia’s Second Transport Project, the project
targeted modal retention of the bus system at 50 percent, and yet the modal share
actually declined to 32.8 percent of total motorized trips at project closing.

There remains an urgent need to strengthen enforcement of parking restrictions on
sidewalks and in lanes intended for bicycles. So far, no congestion pricing plans
supported by the World Bank Group have been implemented because their
application is often not supported by the public, particularly private car owners. In
addition, they require advanced traffic management and monitoring, and sound law
enforcement. Under Colombia’s Second Programmatic Productive and Sustainable
Cities development policy loan (DPL), for example, regulations were approved to
enable municipalities with populations greater than 300,000 inhabitants to introduce
congestion and pollution charges, but no schemes were implemented.


Inclusive Services
IEG assessed social inclusion of three disadvantaged groups in the urban transport
context: the poor, women, and disabled and elderly persons. Across these groups,
the poor received the largest share of targeted support while less attention was paid
to the needs of women and the disabled and elderly persons (figure 3.2). Interviews
with task team leaders suggest that a lack of resources and team knowledge, and
different client priorities on social issues, explain the limited engagement.

CHAPTER 3
MOBILITY FOR ALL
Figure 3.2. Targeted Interventions for the Disadvantaged, by Group and Mode




The World Bank Group was most successful in providing easier access for the poor.
Within the set of 20 evaluated projects with targeted interventions aimed at
improving the access for the poor, 88 percent reported satisfactory outcomes. In
particular, these projects provided the poor with easier access to roads and to public
transport services. Rwanda’s Urban Infrastructure and City Development Project
opened up new areas to development and benefited the poor in Kigali and Butare.
The Cameroon Urban and Water Development project increased access to urban
roads in low-income settlements. The average distance to reach a public
transportation facility decreased from more than 700m to less than 500m. Under São
Paulo Metro Line 4 Phase 1, the integration of bus lines with the metro system was
achieved in all six stations, and has increased the low-income population’s access to
public transport and to employment centers and service facilities.

Inclusive access was achieved primarily through i) extending public transit
infrastructure and services to poor neighborhoods; ii) integrating multiple transit
modes; and, iii) provision of NMT facilities. Thirty-one projects (10 percent) had
interventions connecting poor communities to infrastructure and services. Peru’s
Lima Metro Line 2 project supports construction of a 35-km system, which will
provide access to and from Ate-Vitarte, one of the poorest districts in the Lima
region with some 576,000 inhabitants. About 35 percent of BRT projects had similar
interventions. The Tanzania Second Central Transport Corridor Project integrated
six feeder stations with the Dar Rapid Transit (DART). About 17 percent of urban
road projects included connections to low-income communities. The Democratic
Republic of Congo Emergency Urban and Social Rehabilitation Project focused its
interventions in road construction on access for poor neighborhoods that lacked all-
season access to the center of the city.

Mode integration is another way that the World Bank Group enhances access for
those inhabitants of poor communities located on the periphery of a city’s main
transport system. Twenty-seven mass transit projects (nine BRT and 18 metro/urban
rail) incorporated support for modal integration. The Argentina Metropolitan Areas
Urban Transport project included a component to finance detailed designs for the
construction of the Mitre Intermodal transport terminal in areas of Córdoba.
Nigeria’s Lagos Urban Transport Project II supported the development of a bus
feeder system to improve poor communities’ access to BRT and urban rail services.

NMT infrastructure disproportionately benefits the poor because they rely more
heavily on walking and biking to reach their destinations. Along with increased
supply of NMT infrastructure, norms and regulations accommodating NMT are also
important. NMT activities were included in 22 percent of World Bank Group UT
operations. Nine projects with NMT components (12 percent) received financing
from the GEF. More support has also been given for pedestrians in signal settings,
better designs at street crossings, and enforcement to prevent parked vehicles on
sidewalks. The World Bank Group’s support has helped cities create more bicycle-
friendly environments, including road designs that include a “safe corridor” for
NMT users. However, despite its importance for the poor, World Bank Group
support for NMT was skewed toward middle-income countries. Nineteen projects—
or a third of urban transport projects with NMT activities—are in China; 10 middle-
income countries, including China, account for 66 percent of NMT support in terms
of the number of projects. In African cities, walking accounts for 30–35 percent of all
trips taken (UN Habitat 2013); however, the Africa Region received only 9 percent of
World Bank Group NMT support (figures 3.3, 3.4).

The World Bank Group has fewer cases of improved access for women, albeit with
an effort to address the security of women and meet their special needs when they
use urban transport services. Targeted support for women’s security was found in
20 projects (7 percent). Metro projects most frequently incorporated support for
women. In Brazil, several of the World Bank–financed projects supported female
passenger security: in Rio de Janeiro, the suburban rail and metro systems include
cars which are reserved exclusively for women during peak hours to reduce
harassment. However, this type of segregation has received mixed reviews, and was
not adopted in mass transit systems in São Paolo and Salvador. Ecuador’s Quito
Metro Line One includes a gender-sensitive design, including adequate lighting on
platforms, stations, and the surrounding areas. For roads-only projects, providing
street lighting is the main approach to improving security for women.

A smaller number of projects worked to address the social norms and beliefs that
affect access to opportunities. In Mexico, the World Bank Group developed a project
called “Hazme el Paro,” that encourages community participation to address sexual
harassment against women in Mexico City’s urban public transport. A pilot project
to involve drivers and bystanders in cases of sexual harassment against women in
the bus system was designed, and its implementation is under evaluation.

The limited results on improved access for women could be attributed to fewer
targeted interventions for women; and even where there was such targeting, results
monitoring was weak. Out of seven projects with (sparse) information on improved
access for women, three were roads projects which did not have targeted
interventions, but applied a corporate core indicator—beneficiary (percentage as
women)— and were reported as successful. The rest had targeted interventions such
as improved in-vehicle services, bus stops, and information communication. A pilot
scheme using photovoltaic lighting at bus stops was included in the Chile Santiago
Urban Transport Project. Users (especially women) gave this pilot a high rating. A
Senegal project supported NMT facilities and street lighting. All these increased
women users’ sense of security, which contributed to improved access.

Generally, targeted interventions to enhance access for the disabled and elderly
were yet to be broadly applied, and their achievement was limited to a few cases.
IEG noted that about 30 projects (about 11 percent) supported universal access for
the disabled and elderly persons. Overall, the share of public transit projects (metro,
BRT, and buses) that include support for universal access was higher than the share
of roads-only projects. However, only one project, the Universal Mobility Project in
Lima, had a specific project development objective of mainstreaming the needs of

persons with disability in the planning and implementation of urban walking and
public transport facilities. Case studies and interviews suggest that many clients
have not yet adopted universal access features in their transport system design.
Projects in the East Asia and Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean Regions
stood out as most frequently incorporating universal access design features.

Altogether, only four closed and evaluated projects measured improved access for
the disabled and elderly, and three of them (75 percent) were successful. Chile’s
Santiago Urban Transport Project implemented specific measures for people with
reduced mobility, such as audio signaling for blind people, ramps to access stations,
and reserved seats in buses. Eighty percent of the Transantiago fleet is now
accessible to disabled people. In Colombia’s Integrated Mass Transit System, the
project constructed pedestrian overpasses, and access ramps at stations and trunk
buses that are completely accessible for disabled persons. On the other hand, Peru’s
Lima Transport Project showed poor results in improving accessibility for disabled
persons. Several obstacles limiting autonomous and safe access to buses and bus
stations were reported, in spite of the installation of elevators and in spite of
equipping buses with a boarding mechanism to match floor height to platform
height (Vasquez and Pena Herrera 2015).


Affordable Services
Affordability of transport services has yet to be sufficiently considered and
addressed by the World Bank Group’s urban transport portfolio. Though
affordability of UT services can seriously limit the mobility of the poor, it is seldom a
clear priority in World Bank Group support. Only 25 (8 percent) project appraisal
documents (PADs) discussed affordability as a sectoral issue. Further, 26 projects (9
percent) included activities to address affordability. Mass transit projects supported
affordability the most: nearly a quarter of BRT and metro/urban rail projects
provided measures to ensure affordability. By contrast, less than 5 percent of
conventional bus and road projects supported affordability. About 6 percent or three
projects of upstream engagement had activities to improve UT affordability.

The primary approach through which the World Bank Group has supported
affordability is through policies for fare integration or subsidies, or through
preparation of affordability studies. Integrated fares can reduce the total cost of
using public transport networks, encouraging use by lower-income users who
cannot afford multiple tickets for transiting between modes. Support for integrated
fares was provided in 18 projects (13 metro projects, four BRT, and one upstream).
World Bank Group projects in Rio de Janeiro and São Paolo supported creation of

MOBILITY FOR ALL
the Bilhete Unico, a single ticket with free transfers between buses and trains. The
country case study found that the decline in transport costs in these two cities has
been partly attributed to the Bilhete Unico system.

Eight urban transport projects (3 percent) supported the design of subsidy schemes,
policies, or studies to improve affordability. Many developing country governments
consider public transport to be a public good; hence, they choose to keep general
user costs low, which requires budgetary subsidies from local governments.
Literature and empirical experience suggest that pricing urban transport services at
a level which ensures cost recovery with targeted subsidies for specific groups to
ensure affordability is a better approach (Mehdniratta, Rodriguez, and Ochoa 2014).
The challenge, however, is to identify accurately the beneficiaries of the targeted
subsidies (the poor) and how to deliver the subsidy. Income can be difficult to
determine, especially when a large proportion of the poor are informally employed.
The World Bank Group could provide more technical support to design a subsidy
scheme that would improve affordability without imposing an unsustainable
burden on the local government budget. So far, the World Bank Group has provided
such support in only a few instances. In 2014, Bogotá rolled out a “pro-poor”
transport subsidy program, based on World Bank technical support. Smart cards
were issued with stored users’ personal information and programmed with different
subsidies when issued to eligible users. As of April, 2015, 250,000 people had
obtained a subsidy via the smartcard, and almost 150,000 had actually used it
(Rodriguez et al 2016).

Available evidence on the World Bank Group’s contribution to improved
affordability of the urban poor is restricted to five projects. In Nigeria’s Lagos Urban
Transport Project, for example, the amount spent by poor households on bus travel
along the project-improved corridors fell from 20 percent of income to 12 percent
between 2005 and 2010 (the target was 15 percent). In Colombia’s Integrated Mass
Transit Systems Project, the share of total public transport users from the lowest
income strata increased by 30–50 percentage points in Bogotá and Barranquilla. In
Brazil’s São Paolo Trains and Signaling Project, the share of low-income rail users
rose to 35 percent from less than 5 percent after the fare integration.


Mobility Results
Overall, the World Bank Group has been effective in achieving mobility results in
urban transit systems or areas. The increased supply and improved demand
management contributed to improved mobility. Altogether, 30 percent of evaluated
projects were targeting mobility improvement; 69 percent of these were successful.

                                                                      MOBILITY FOR ALL
Achievements included improvement in trip speeds of pedestrians, public transport
users and private vehicles by enhancing capacity, smoothing traffic flows, reducing
bus stops, improving road user discipline, and rationalizing parking. Projects in
China and Peru, for example, reported success in achieving mobility improvements
of public transport users. In China, all five of the evaluated projects tracking
mobility were successful. IEG’s PPAR mission found that for Peru’s Lima Transport
Project, the number of passengers using Metropolitano BRT had grown to 525,000
per weekday, compared to 340,000 passengers per weekday recorded at the time of
project closing four years earlier.

Limited evidence is available on improved mobility of disadvantaged groups.
Altogether, only four closed and evaluated projects (two in Brazil, one in Nigeria,
and one in Colombia) presented evidence on improvement in mobility of the poor.
The reason for the limited evidence could that targeted interventions to improve
access for disadvantaged groups are yet to be more broadly applied, and support for
affordability improvement is still quite limited. The weak monitoring of the social
benefits is also a reason. While the percentage of dedicated urban transport projects
that include indicators on disadvantaged groups increased from 28 percent in FY06–
10 percent to 40 percent in FY11–16, in line with the evolving corporate mandate,
very few tracked results from the project interventions pertinent to specific
disadvantaged groups, such as improved women’s security or improved
affordability, or access and mobility for the disadvantaged. Nonetheless, IEG found
that all four projects which managed to improve the affordability of urban transport
services also reported results on improved mobility of the poor, thus reinforcing the
importance of affordability as a precursor to urban mobility for low-income users.

The World Bank Group did not manage to improve city-wide mobility, in large part
because demand management (shifting and avoiding travel demand) measures are
yet to be broadly supported and successfully implemented. Of the closed and
evaluated projects with mobility objectives, 75 percent were intended to achieve
city-wide mobility improvements. Nonetheless, 78 percent in fact measured mobility
within specific systems or geographic areas with the interventions. Similarly, at
completion, those projects were successful in improving local mobility, yet no
projects managed to improve city-wide mobility. The BRT projects observed
increased ridership or reduced travel times (by 20–34 percent) along the supported
BRT corridors. For conventional bus projects, bus speed in project areas and bus
priority corridors increased. For metro projects, although mobility improved for
users of a specific metro system supported by the World Bank Group was improved,
there is no evidence of mobility achievement outside of the system. Because the
World Bank Group has yet to broadly apply city-wide demand management
activities such as integrated planning or modal shifting policies within the urban

transport portfolio, it will be unlikely to see mobility improvements beyond the
areas treated with improved public transport supply or traffic management.


Drivers of Success and Failure
IEG found that projects which used a comprehensive approach to improve mobility
were more likely to be successful. For those projects that included demand
management measures, IEG found that 42 percent committed to mobility
improvement in the project development objective (PDO). On the other hand, only
13 percent of those projects without demand management had improved mobility in
the PDO. This discrepancy exists for projects in all modes of transport, except metro
projects, where mobility within the system is not affected by road congestion
(figure 3.5). Moreover, IEG found that when projects incorporated and implemented
demand management activities, 77 percent were successful in improving mobility.
By contrast, only 60 percent of projects which either did not incorporate or did not
implement demand management activities were able to improve mobility.

More to Mobility Improvement




Note: BRT=bus rapid transit; DM=demand management; PDO = project development objective.

IEG also found that the projects with a comprehensive approach achieved more
sustained outcomes. Two-thirds of projects with both supply and demand
management measures had low risk to outcome sustainability. Indeed, the main
risks to the sustainability of improvements in mobility were related to either
incomplete implementation of demand management measures, or to financial
unsustainability of the transport system, underscoring the importance of having
both supply and demand support to ensure a sustained outcome. Field evidence

                                                                       MOBILITY FOR ALL
from IEG PPAR missions suggests that lack of measures to avoid and shift travel
demand did pose a risk to sustained mobility benefits. In Mumbai, the Municipal
Corporation has invested about $28 million to expand area traffic control, with the
goal of complete city coverage by 2017. However, Mumbai has yet to adopt an
enforceable policy to restrict traffic through parking fees, user charges, and other
restraint measures. This means that the additional capacity created by new and
rehabilitated roads and the ATC system will be relatively short-lived because
demand is much greater than supply. In Senegal, the uncontrolled vehicle traffic
growth cancelled out the small gains from World Bank support for urban transport.
As rapid growth continues, support for both supply and demand becomes ever
more important to ensuring positive and sustained outcomes in urban mobility.

Participatory consultations with representatives from disadvantaged groups and
civil society are effective in designing and planning adequate interventions to
support targeted beneficiaries. Participatory consultations can inform social analysis
in a way that translates the needs and concerns of groups consulted into remedial
actions, measurable objectives, and relevant activities. In China’s Liaoning Medium
Cities Infrastructure Project, active participation of people with limited mobility in
the design and testing of universal design features generated positive feedback on
its inclusiveness from World Bank teams and national stakeholders. In Vietnam’s
Hanoi Urban Transport Project, the World Bank team consulted with representatives
from groups advocating on behalf of disabled persons. As a result, various features
and improvements were incorporated into the project. Tactile guideways, widely
used in Asia to guide the visually impaired, are also included in design, as well as
Braille maps of the BRT stations.

Resource availability and the team’s urban transport skills can influence project
performance, as illustrated by the treatment of disadvantaged groups. Two main
constraints reported by social development specialists and task team leaders to
mainstreaming gender are insufficient human resource capacity and budgets.
Projects that did particularly well in mainstreaming and reporting on gender either
benefited from a dedicated trust fund, such as the Umbrella Facility for Gender
Equality (UFGE), or from additional financing. Typically, these projects went the
extra mile in providing gender-sensitive diagnostics and gender action plans. For
example, the Morocco Urban Transport Sector DPL mobilized a $3 million Policy
and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grant to finance a pilot accessibility
project for persons with limited mobility. Gender training of social development
specialists and task team leaders improves the quality of gender programming and
reporting, as can be observed in the clustering of “good examples” around projects
that had social development staff in the project teams.

 Highlights
  The World Bank Group appeared to be over-optimistic about projects’ financial sustainability and
    economic viability at the design stage.
  The mass transit projects directly involving the private sector were more successful in achieving
   financial sustainability of operations than projects utilizing only the public sector.
  Overall, the World Bank Group has been successful in achieving its downstream environmental
   mitigation efforts, but these successes have often confined to the specific project area.
  City-wide environmental sustainability is more often achieved when the World Bank Group takes
   a holistic approach with both upstream and downstream support measures.



Financial Sustainability
Financial sustainability is critical to urban transport, because it guarantees that
systems can be operated while continuous investment in maintenance and
expansion (or in new systems) can be made. Financing depends on a limited set of
instruments, ranging from public budgetary allocations to user fees, tolls, parking
fees, property taxation, land value capture, and various forms of private sector
participation, including public-private partnerships (PPPs). Most cities in the world
face a financing gap in their urban transport systems, where revenues are
inadequate to cover recurrent expenditures and new investment (Ardila and
Ortegon 2015). Public transit tends to be particularly underfunded and faces
competition from car travel implicitly subsidized by untolled or underpriced roads
and parking (Ardila and Ortegon-Sanchez 2016).

The IEG study Improving Institutional Capability and Financial Viability to Sustain
Transport (2013) found financial sustainability to be a frequent challenge in World
Bank Group–financed transport projects. In particular, project analyses rarely took
into account the effect of underfunding maintenance on the flow of benefits.
Without comprehensive up-front analysis, clients may be ill-equipped to mobilize
sufficient recurrent finance for system sustainability. The study recommended that
the World Bank Group increase its focus on sustaining transport infrastructure and
services in project design. The study recommends that support for urban transport
include a comprehensive financial analysis of the overall urban transport system,
including fare integration, tariffs and subsidies, and the net impact on the poor.

QUALITY OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
The quality and comprehensiveness of financial analysis are critical to
understanding projects’ financial sustainability, and require a full analysis of
different revenues ranging from budgetary to direct beneficiary payments. Without
a clear understanding of the costs and revenues and a strategy to avoid financing
gaps, new or improved systems may well have difficulty meeting their operational,
maintenance, and investment needs. Yet of 46 World Bank mass transit project
assessment documents reviewed, less than 40 percent presented a financial analysis
(table 4.1). 1

Where a financial analysis was presented, the methodological approaches varied
widely, especially regarding costs and revenue assessment. 2 More than half failed to
take into account full operation and maintenance costs. Many projects with private
sector engagement did not examine the financial sustainability of publicly financed
aspects of the systems, which may include construction and maintenance.

Looking at 16 closed mass transit projects, none presented a financial analysis at
closing. Nonetheless, the majority did discuss financial viability (table 4.2). Of
projects that involved the private sector, none analyzed the financial sustainability
of systems, and none discussed public sector elements of UT systems.

IEG also found that time and cost projections made at the design stage were
optimistic. IEG found that about a quarter of closed dedicated urban transport
projects experienced cost overruns, averaging about 61 percent (figure 4.1). 3 Within
this set of projects, 57 percent sought additional financing, and the remaining
projects had increased costs covered either by the government or by other
development partners. Weak technical appraisal, design changes, increased
resettlement costs, exchange rate increases, and the emergence of other risks (for
example, political changes) all contributed to unplanned cost and time increases.
The Sub-Saharan Africa Region accounts for 35 percent of projects that experienced

cost overruns, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean and the East Asia and
Pacific Regions. Projects in the East Asia and Pacific Region (mainly in China)
usually did not seek additional financing from the World Bank Group. By mode,
70 percent of cost overruns occurred in road projects, followed by metro and BRT
projects. Proportionally, BRT projects had the highest average cost overruns at
86 percent.

Time overruns were more common than cost overruns. About three-quarters of
closed dedicated urban transport projects experienced longer-than-planned
implementation periods. Additional time was on average 2.5 years—and was most
frequent in projects with capital-intensive transport modes. The main reasons for
these delays were the complexity of project design and implementation, and internal
                                                             pressures to commit

At the same time, the social benefits were often not quantified and included in the
economic analysis either at the design stage or at the completion stage. Usually,
three types of benefits were discussed by the economic analysis:

     •   Type-I benefits are those affecting users of the system supported by the
         World Bank Group, such as reduction of transport costs and travel time.
     •   Type II benefits include increased road safety and reduced pollution, which
         affect not only direct users, but also other stakeholders.
     •   Type-III are those potential effects resulting from improved accessibility, such
         as access to health and education services, and employment opportunities.

IEG found that 75 percent of dedicated urban transport projects quantified type-I
benefits, 22 percent quantified type-II benefits, but none quantified type-III benefits
at the design stage. At the completion stage, the shares were lower. Thirty percent of
closed projects did not present an economic analysis, often because of lack of
availability of information at the time of the Implementation Completion and
Results Report or because of inability to find the original economic analysis model in
order to rerun it.

PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE URBAN TRANSPORT SECTOR
There is a wide spectrum of private sector participation (PSP) in urban transport
service provision, ranging from service management contract to “Turnkey.” 4 Often,
the PSP is described as an attractive alternative to public provision that improves
financial sustainability for at least one of several reasons:

     •   The private sector may mobilize private financial resources to provide needed
         investments in urban transport services and infrastructure.
     •   The participation allows the government to contract for services, committing
         it to stable financing over an extended period, from project construction
         through service provision and operation and maintenance.
     •   The private sector could mobilize capabilities yielding operating efficiencies
         not available through a public delivery model.

However, success in engaging the private sector depends on governments having in
place appropriate conditions including clear and stable market rules; sound and
predictable legal and regulatory environments; and well-designed projects,
including fair risk allocation. 5 The World Bank Group has a high level of support for
PSP in the sector: 38 percent of country strategy reviewed identified PSP as an issue.
At project level, PSP is found in 66 percent of dedicated projects.

CHAPTER 4
SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT
The World Bank Group facilitates PSP in urban transport, both “upstream” in
creating an enabling framework and “downstream” at the operational level.
Upstream support was provided primarily through dedicated projects. Such
upstream support included assistance in creating policy, regulation, or an enabling
environment for private sector involvement. Two main types of downstream
advisory support are provided: technical assistance from the World Bank, often with
support from the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (box 4.1), and
transaction advisory services provided by IFC AS. IFC AS is intended to help clients
develop and implement PPP schemes for urban transport systems including major
arterial highways or corridors (Amman, La Ceiba), BRT ( Cebu, Dakar, Manila), or
metro/light rail (Chennai, Manila). The World Bank Group also promotes direct PSP
in the urban transport projects that it co-finances. The private sector is often
involved in the operation and management of the system (and sometimes in the
ownership and operation of rolling stock) rather than the construction. By mode,
BRT and metro projects involve the private sector most actively (figure 4.2).

 Box 4.1. Partnership: The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
 The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) has enhanced the capacity and
 knowledge of World Bank Group clients and World Bank staff on public-private
 partnership (PPP) management and regulation. PPIAF was created in 1999, building on the
 1997 World Bank Group Infrastructure Action Program which aimed to improve the
 environment for private sector participation in infrastructure in developing countries.
 During the 10-year period spanning FY2007–16, PPIAF approved 47 urban transport
 activities worth $9.7 million, usually in the form of capacity-building programs and
 knowledge products.
 Urban railways were the main mode supported (28 percent), followed by conventional
 buses (19 percent) and BRT (15 percent). Other modes included urban roads and
 nonmotorized transport. The support was usually in the form of transaction advisory,
 capacity-building programs, and knowledge products. The top three Regions receiving
 PPIAF for the urban transport portfolio are East Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the
 Caribbean, and Africa. Colombia, the Philippines, and Vietnam are the countries that
 received the most regular PPIAF support. For example, In Vietnam, PPIAF contributed to
 the Ho Chi Minh City metro project financed by the Asian Development Bank, while the
 World Bank Group supported the city’s bus rapid transit. Still, although the World Bank
 Group’s investments in Brazil, China, and India constituted a third of the portfolio, PPIAF
 barely worked in those countries.
 IEG found that about 85 percent of the PPIAF’s capacity-building and knowledge activities
 in urban transport were effective in strengthening the technical capacity of World Bank staff
 and country decision makers, and likely extended those skills to their relevant institutions.
 IEG also found that only a third of PPIAF activities that were intended to inform lending
 actually did. For many activities, the result is unclear because of a lack of tracking and data.

Figure 4.2. Share of World Bank Group Urban Transport Projects Supporting Private Sector
Involvement




Over the past 10 years, about 40 percent of World Bank metro/urban rail projects
involved the private sector in operation of the mass transit systems co-financed by
the World Bank. Additionally, IFC and MIGA supported Istanbul’s and Izmir’s
metros in Turkey. Concessionaires usually took existing roads or railway assets
rehabilitated or upgraded by the public sector with funds borrowed from the World
Bank or IFC or guaranteed by MIGA. The World Bank Group was instrumental in
bringing in the private sector. Before the World Bank Group’s support, metro
systems in some of these cities were run by the public sector and often suffered from
weak efficiency and funding, and insufficient maintenance, renewal, and expansion
(box 4.2).

 Box 4.2. World Bank Support for Metro PPP in Brazil
 The World Bank supported the concession of three metro projects in Brazil: the Metro line
 4 project in São Paulo, Metro line 1 in Salvador, and the suburban rail in Rio de Janeiro.
 The first two projects were greenfield, designed as public-private partnerships (PPPs),
 and envisaged a turnkey civil works contract and, in parallel, securing a concessionaire
 for operations. The World Bank catalyzed and supported private sector involvement in all
 three cities. The World Bank’s involvement has been instrumental in bringing PPPs into
 metro projects, increasing access to finance, improving efficiency and accountability,
 reducing the public sector’s financial and operational management costs, and thereby
 making services more sustainable. The implementation of these projects was not always
 smooth. For example, in 2007 there was a fatal construction accident on Line 4. While the
 São Paolo Metro Line 4 and Rio de Janeiro suburban rail system cover operating costs
 with passenger fares and other revenue such as station concessions, the large up-front
 capital investment was financed by the public sector with the support of the World Bank.
 The transport system as a whole relies on substantial subsidies, with potential financial

 imbalances in both metropolitan areas. States have to amortize their up-front investment,
 and also provide other urban transport services.


IEG found that direct PSP in mass transit projects was more successful in achieving
financial sustainability of operations than projects utilizing only the public sector
(table 4.3). Though the evidence base is slim, the operational sustainability success
rate of mass transit projects with PSP was 44 percent compared to only 14 percent of
projects without PSP. In many cases, successful PSP in the operation and
management of the system, together with the World Bank Group’s support to
increase the capacity and quality of service, led to an expected increase in ridership
and usage. For example, all the closed BRT projects with PSP witnessed improved
quality of service. Successfully franchised BRT operations exist in Bogotá, Colombia
and Curitiba, Brazil, and this model was partially replicated in Lagos, Nigeria.

Note: BRT = bus rapid transit, NA = not available; O&M = operation and maintenance, PSP = private sector provision.

The urban road sector, by contrast, seldom involved the private sector, and
sustainable road maintenance has not been achieved. Though 64 percent of World
Bank urban transport projects had activities in urban road development, nearly 90
percent of road activities did not have PSP and only about 26 percent had explicit
support for sustainable road maintenance. At the same time, though programmed
road maintenance activities were generally completed, the sustainability of
outcomes was not necessarily assured. Projects achieved 92 percent of output targets
related to road maintenance, as measured by improved road conditions, establishing
road funds, and other indicators. In Senegal, despite project-level success in
improving road conditions, the sustainability of road maintenance funding and
capacity remains an issue. In 2016, eight years after project completion, the road
network had deteriorated as a result of inadequate funding for maintenance,

eliminating the project’s earlier road rehabilitation and construction achievements.
In Nigeria, the Lagos Urban Transport Project was successful in establishing a
Transport Fund for road maintenance. Yet the money allocated to the fund was
insufficient for sustained maintenance. The follow-on project, Lagos Urban
Transport 2, seeks to ensure that more resources are allocated to the fund.

Although each institution supports PSP in UT service delivery, collaboration
between the World Bank and IFC, and the World Bank and MIGA on engaging the
private sector in the UT sector is infrequent. Collaboration did occur between IFC
and MIGA: five MIGA operations are related to IFC Investment Services operations,
mostly in Turkey. Occasionally, (in Jordan, the Philippines, and Senegal) it appears
that IFC PPP advisory services complemented World Bank UT project activities. In
general, however, it appears that IFC and MIGA target different market segments,
both at the country level and within countries. World Bank work with the private
sector was concentrated in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, while IFC
investments and MIGA guarantees focused on Turkey. Turkey also exemplifies
World Bank Group market segmentation: IFC worked with creditworthy larger
cities, while the World Bank targeted smaller cities. Although project evaluations
suggest that the current model works, interviews with task team leaders indicate
that there are opportunities for a more synergistic approach. For example, the World
Bank could provide upstream support while IFC and MIGA provide financing and
guarantees. Indeed, upstream reforms provide the enabling environment for private
sector participation, and are a necessary precursor for downstream engagement. 6

Environmental Sustainability
Environmentally sustainable urban transportation can encourage use of public
transit and NMT, green vehicles, and fuel-efficient transport systems. An
environmentally sustainable UT system is essential to the quality of life and welfare
of urban populations.

At the same time, transport is a major source of pollution, accounting for half of
global oil consumption and nearly 20 percent of world energy use, of which about 40
percent is used in urban transport (IEA 2013). By 2025, under a business-as-usual
scenario, urban transport emissions are estimated to increase two-fold to nearly 1
billion annual tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, and 90 percent of growth in urban
transport emissions will come from private motorized travel. According to the
World Health Organization, about half of the urban population monitored in 1,600
cities across 91 countries is exposed to air pollution that is at least 2.5 times higher
than the recommended level (WHO 2014). Exposure to vehicle emissions,
particularly in urban areas with high traffic volumes and high concentration of air


36
CHAPTER 4
SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT
pollutants, is associated with various adverse health conditions, including heart
disease, stroke, chronic lung diseases, obesity, and lower respiratory infections
(Bhalla et al 2014). Increasingly, the resilience of urban transport systems to the
impact of climate change, including flooding, heat and extreme weather events, is
also being questioned. 7 The international community has scaled up its efforts to
tackle the global climate change challenges, the most recent effort being COP21,
which led to the Paris Agreement of 195 countries on GHG emissions mitigation and
adaptation.

The World Bank Group has moved quickly to translate the COP21 into concrete
actions, anticipating an increase in its climate financing to as much as 28 percent by
2020 in response to client demand. Correspondingly, the Transport and ICT GP has
committed to increasing to 35 percent the share of its own portfolio that supports
climate mitigation and adaptation. In particular, adaptation will be addressed
through investments in climate-resilient infrastructure to reduce the vulnerability of
transport services to natural disasters and other climate-related depreciation.
Mitigation activities will include provision of more accessible and efficient transport
services to reduce GHG emissions.

Public transport and NMT development have inherent environmental benefits. Yet
explicit mitigation and adaption measures beyond these investments bring
additional positive and important benefits to the environment. Accepting that
environmental sustainability will not be achieved solely through interventions in the
urban transport sector, this evaluation will focus on the extent to which the World
Bank Group contributes to environmental sustainability through its support of this
sector.

Environmental sustainability interventions include both measures to mitigate and to
adapt to climate change. In urban transport projects, the main focus of
environmental interventions has been mitigation of the deleterious effects of
transport (especially motorization) on the environment, rather than helping clients
to adapt to the consequences of climate change (figure 4.3). Typical mitigation
activities included upstream support for environmental policies and regulations and
capacity building of relevant institutions, and downstream support to establish air
quality management and monitoring systems or centers, implement conversions to
cleaner fuels, technologies and vehicles, and establish vehicle emissions inspection
facilities. Support for climate resilience through adaptation efforts has been mostly
provided through road construction and rehabilitation activities in roads-only and
conventional bus projects. Capital-intensive mass transit systems remain vulnerable
to climate events, but adaptation activities are included in these projects less often.

World Bank Group support, including mobilization of the GEF (box 4.3) and other
trust funds, allowed the successful preparation of environmental policies,
regulations, and strategies in 70 percent of the urban transport evaluation portfolio.
Positive instances of enhanced environmental regulation and capacity were reported
in Brazil, China, and Mexico. The China Wuhan Urban Transport project supported
the preparation of a Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy for Wuhan in 2007.
Following this work, new management regulations on motor vehicle emission
control were issued by Wuhan in July 2008. In Brazil, with the support of the GEF,
institutional capacity in sustainable transport at the national and local levels was
enhanced across the country. Moreover, various organizations cooperated through
GEF project activities to provide support for drafting Brazil’s 2012 National Urban
Mobility Law. In Mexico, the GEF project supported Mexico City in preparing the
first city-wide Climate Change Action Strategy in Latin America, including goals,
timetables, programs, and budget requirements, reflecting city governments’
commitment to reducing GHGs and pollution. However, within the overall urban
transport portfolio, there was no systematic measurement and reporting of the
impact of this upstream environmental support.

 Box 4.3. Partnership. Global Environmental Facility Trust Fund
 The Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Trust Fund provides support to help developing
 and transitional countries tackle the world’s most pressing environmental problems. With
 financing from 39 donor countries, GEF has helped finance project preparation, sector
 studies related to environment, and components of urban transport projects relating to
 institutional capacity building and nonmotorized transport (NMT). Projects proposed for
 GEF support must be country-driven, must follow GEF’s policy on public involvement,
 and should be consistent with both national priorities related to sustainable development

SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT
 and GEF priorities. GEF funds cover the incremental project costs of measures to achieve
 global environmental benefits.
 GEF-funded projects mainly supported nonmotorized transport (NMT) modes (nine
 projects), conventional buses (seven projects), and BRTs (five projects). There was only
 one metro project and no urban roads projects. About 70 percent of the projects had
 explicit environmental objectives. Those projects with environmental objectives achieved
 86 percent of their objectives, inducing policy changes favoring sustainable transport
 investments, improved environmental management capacity of cities, and reduced
 greenhouse gases (GHGs) and air pollutant emissions through the development of public
 transit and NMT.
 Similarly, with GEF support, pilot cities implemented more than 20 programs promoting
 environmental sustainability. A few documented cases presented catalytic effects. For
 instance, the China GEF–World Bank Urban Transport Partnership supported 14 cities on
 sustainable transport solutions, with activities including development of BRT and bus
 priority corridors, improvement of public transport services and NMT trips, developing
 transit demand management schemes, and designing transport-oriented development
 (TOD) plans. After completion of the pilot project, more than 60 nonpilot cities (the
 original target was 25) showed interest in implementing UT investment plans that
 promote public transport and NMT. Furthermore, carbon dioxide emissions over 10 years
 in pilot cities were lower than previous forecasts by 3.93 megatons.


The World Bank Group’s contribution to environmental sustainability through the
urban transport sector support is, overall, effective in local systems or areas with the
interventions. More than 70 percent of closed and evaluated projects tracking
environmental benefits contributed to reduced emission of GHGs or air pollutants.
Successful cases were found in Argentina, China, Mexico, Nigeria, and Peru. The
remaining projects considered the environmental benefits from the installation
and/or utilization of air quality monitoring systems or vehicle emissions inspection
facilities. Although roads-only projects seldom pursued GHG emissions or air
pollution reduction activities, public transit projects—particularly conventional bus
and BRT projects—were effective in achieving 92 percent of such targets. In 21
projects (70 percent) the reduction in GHG emissions or air pollution was limited to
specific project areas or systems directly affected by project interventions. In Peru,
for example, GHG transport emissions in the “El Metropolitano” Corridor
(supported by the Lima Transport Project and the GEF-Lima Transport Project) were
reduced by 33 percent. The carbon-dioxide-equivalent emission reduction 8 under
the Mexico–GEF Sustainable Transport and Air Quality project was also achieved
along project corridors.

Comprehensive support that includes both upstream and downstream
environmental activities increases the likelihood of achieving city-wide results. IEG
found that 70 percent of the cities receiving such comprehensive World Bank Group


                                                                                            39
                                                                                           CHAPTER 4
                                                                         SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT
support were successful in realizing environmental benefits to the city. Upstream
support has a low design cost, but reforms can only be effective if they are
adequately enforced. Under the China–GEF–World Bank Urban Transport
Partnership, for example, it was estimated that carbon dioxide emissions in the city
of Guangzhou were reduced by 2.1 megatons per year after the city increased
parking fees and applied car purchase and usage restrictions. These schemes only
cost $10 million to implement and had a marginal abatement cost 9 of $5 per ton. By
comparison, a typical BRT system has a marginal abatement cost of $489 per ton.
Santiago (Chile) benefitted from multiple World Bank Group operations during the
evaluation period, and a comprehensive reform program was implemented that
included traffic management, bus service contracting, incentives for operators to
acquire high-standard buses, and establishment of a coordinated transport and
infrastructure planning mechanism. These measures contributed to the reduction of
GHGs by 10.5 percent in 2006–09 with the intervention of TranSantiago , 10 and the
reduction of air pollutants by 48 percent, compared with the 2005 emissions
inventory for the metropolitan region.

By contrast, cities where the World Bank Group did not provide a comprehensive
approach did not achieve reductions in air pollution and GHG emissions. In the
absence of comprehensive and effective support, the realization of air quality
improvement and reduction in absolute emission levels in urban areas is quickly
offset by rapid motorization. For example, in Dakar, Senegal, actual 2008 levels of air
pollution were almost twice as high as 1998 levels, because of a higher-than-
expected influx in the number of private vehicles. The share of public transport also
fell by 13.5 percentage points in the same period. In the Philippines, potential gains
from NMT were offset by the lack of enforcement of travel demand management
measures. The combined modal share of NMT and public transport for trips
originating in Marikina actually decreased with the increased share of private
vehicle use.

approved in FY2016, six provided financial sustainability analysis in the PADs.
2For instance, in publicly financed BRT projects, only some took full account of the
maintenance cost of the entire BRT system including BRT corridors (roads, stations, buses),
while others did take maintenance into account.
3 Cost overruns are quite common in large infrastructure projects. There is a substantial
literature discussing the magnitude and causes, including Flyvbjerg (2007, 9–30) and
Cantarelli et al. (2010). IEG’s PPP evaluation observes: “World Bank PPP projects are more
cumbersome: they are flagged more frequently for slow disbursement and delays, being at
risk, subject to project restructuring, procurement, and safeguard issues….Leading factors
for delays and failure include overly complex project design, unrealistic timeframes and, at
times, the implementation of safeguards” (World Bank 2015, 107).
4The private sector is responsible for providing a complete UT system or service ready for
immediate use( i.e., system design, build, and operation).
5For a complete treatment of PPPs (in all sectors) see IEG’s 2014 PPP evaluation, Support to
Public-Private Partnerships: Lessons from Experience in Client Countries (FY02–12).
6This observation is consistent with the findings of IEG’s 2014 PPP evaluation, Support to
Public-Private Partnerships: Lessons from Experience in Client Countries (FY02–12).
7 “Adaptation and mitigation of urban transportation systems to climate change can be
defined as a form of risk management. …There are two fundamental options for risk
management in the transportation sector. One is by mitigation measures in cities around the
world that reduce globally the climate hazard factor that city and thereby reduce climate
risk…. The second option in reducing risk is adaptation” (Rozenzweig et al. 2011).

5. Urban Transport Institutional Development
 Highlights
  The World Bank Group supported institutional development in urban transport primarily through capacity
   building; more than 90 percent of the activities were successfully delivered, but fewer than half of these
   projects have shown evidence of their effectiveness.
  The urban transport portfolio is predominantly comprised of “one-time” projects rather than programmatic
   engagements over time. Institutional structural change in urban transport institutions is more likely when the
   World Bank Group engages continuously with the sector over a longer time period.

Urban transport management is complex and multidimensional, encompassing
several modes that are often administered by different agencies. Effective delivery of
urban transport services therefore requires that management and fiscal capacity be
adequate, decision making and implementation lines of accountability be clear, and
mechanisms for coordination and cooperation be in place. However, in developing
countries, many local governments lack the administrative and fiscal capacity to
deliver adequate services. In Ghana, for example, where urban challenges include
“slums, lack of basic services, underdeveloped manufacturing and insufficient
transport infrastructure,” the World Bank identified weak implementation and fiscal
capacity of local assemblies as key constraints to addressing these challenges. In
addition, urban transport management is often fragmented among several
jurisdictions. Exacerbating this situation in most client countries is a lack of
coordinating structures for planning, implementation, and oversight.

The World Bank Group supports urban transport institutional development
primarily through IBRD/IDA lending. During the evaluation period, the World
Bank provided four types of institutional development support for urban transport:

    •   general institutional capacity building within the existing institutional
        structure where support included management and human resources;
    •   fiscal capacity enhancement of urban transport agencies or municipalities
        responsible for urban service, including urban transport service delivery;
    •   strategy, regulation, and policy design (discussed in chapters 3 and 4); and
    •   structural change of UT institutions, including support for the setting up of a
        new leading urban transport agency.

The importance of institutional design is consistently recognized and supported by
urban transport operations. Institutional development activities that were generally
relevant to regional contexts and priorities were included in 235 World Bank urban


                                                                                                             43
                                                                                   CHAPTER 5
                                                    URBAN TRANSPORT INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
transport projects (87 percent). An exception was the Europe and Central Asia
region, where the World Bank did not provide any support for fiscal capacity to
countries, even though fiscal capacity was the most frequently identified constraint
to urban transport in project documents and country strategy documents. Support
for institutional development also varied across dedicated and nondedicated urban
transport projects; that is, dedicated projects tended to focus on transport-specific
agencies, while nondedicated projects focused on general municipal government
agencies. There the distribution of institutional development interventions between
transport modes was relatively even, with slightly higher support for planning,
fiscal capacity, and structural change from public transit projects (conventional bus,
BRT, and metro and urban rail) (figure 5.1)

Figure 5.1. Distribution of Institutional Development Interventions, by Mode




World Bank Group Support for Institutional Capacity Building
The World Bank Group’s primary approach for institutional development in the
urban transport sector during the evaluation period has been through general
capacity building within the existing institutional setup. In particular, the World
Bank focused on enhancing human resources and management capacity in
procurement, contract management, data collection and information management,
and engineering design. This was done through training, study tours, improvements
to procedures, and upgrading of systems. General capacity-building activities were
included in the design of 207 urban transport projects (77 percent). The urban
transport projects in the Africa Region included support for institutional capacity
building (80 percent), but using the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Program (SSATP)
to support policy development was insufficient (box 5. 1).

CHAPTER 5
URBAN TRANSPORT INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT

 Box 5.1. Partnership: Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Program
 The Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Program (SSATP) is a multidonor partnership hosted
 by the World Bank Group’s Transport Global Practice. It is governed by a Board with
 members from international financial organizations, beneficiary governments, the private
 sector, users and civil society, and the donor community. It has a unique position from
 which to help African governments develop and implement transport policies. The core
 team is small, comprised of a program manager based in Washington, DC and three
 thematic coordinators based in Nairobi, Kenya.
 SSATP's current strategic plan is narrowly focused. Urban transport and mobility is one
 of only three thematic areas of focus. Roughly one-third of SSATP’s 2015–18 budget is
 earmarked for urban mobility. Nine urban transport activities were undertaken by SSATP
 in the period 2008–15. However, annual reports and project completion documents did
 not provide any qualitative or quantitative evidence as to how the World Bank used these
 products. The review of the World Bank Group’s urban transport portfolio also noted a
 low level of reference to SSATP’s support. In general, the visibility of SSATP's outputs has
 been low, and dissemination and uptake have been slow.
 A key reason for the underutilization has been the changing direction of the World Bank’s
 own work in the Africa region, and the resulting inability of the SSATP to more directly
 link outputs to the World Bank’s urban transport projects and strategies. For the World
 Bank, there has been a missed opportunity to use the SSATP to help governments
 develop and formulate policies encouraged through World Bank projects. The World
 Bank also ceased allocating staff time to SSATP because of budget limitations, which also
 contributed to the diminishing synergies between World Bank urban transport operations
 and SSATP activities for urban mobility.


Dedicated urban transport projects provide institutional capacity-building support
specifically for urban transport–related agencies. Sixty-seven of the dedicated
projects (77 percent) directed capacity-building activities to transport agencies at the
local level, while 15 projects (17 percent) included capacity building to central
government urban transport agencies (typically the ministry of transport or a similar
agency). Projects in Africa most often included capacity building to the central
government (35 percent of projects compared to 12 percent for all other regions). In
Kenya, for example, both the Transport Sector Support and National Urban
Transport Improvement Projects provided support to the Urban Roads Authority
through training, provision of goods and services, and technical assistance. An
additional four projects (5 percent) provided capacity-building activities to both
central and local urban transport institutions.

Most capacity-building activities (90 percent) included in the design of urban
transport projects were delivered. A few countries with low institutional capacity
benefited from the support. For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a


                                                                                            45
                                                                               CHAPTER 5
                                                URBAN TRANSPORT INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
post-conflict country, the World Bank helped to improve institutional capacity to lay
the foundation for future development initiatives. In Bangladesh, all key
infrastructure investments, including urban transport for municipalities, were
carried out by central agencies before the support of a Municipal Services Project.
Subsequently, for the first time in the country’s history, all participating
municipalities were able to independently implement subproject investments.

Unfortunately, 20 closed and evaluated projects (51 percent) failed to present
evidence on improved institutional capacity. This could largely be attributed to the
weak monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework of institutional capacity
building applied at the project level. IEG found 334 key performance indicators
(KPIs) used by World Bank projects. These KPIs did not present consistent
measurement of capacity-building outcomes, and heavily focused on outputs. The
weakness of M&E was also evident in other types of institutional development
support. For example, 63 dedicated projects (56 percent) contained activities on
urban transport policies, planning, and strategies, but only 41 projects (36 percent)
tracked outputs. Far fewer projects provided evidence as to whether plans, policies,
or strategies were actually adopted. Another reason for the low level of success of
capacity-building support was that not all the planned capacity-building activities
were implemented. Inter-agency coordination was lacking (25 percent of the failed
cases) or clients did not prioritize the designed activities (25 percent of the failed
cases); these were the main reasons that project activities were not implemented and
why, consequently, effective capacity building did not occur.


World Bank Group Support for Fiscal Capacity Enhancement
Few dedicated projects address the fiscal capacity of urban transport–related
institutions in their design. Only five projects (4 percent) address the fiscal capacity
of a specific urban transport agency; two of these projects are still active. Two
projects in China illustrated the effect on fiscal capacity development. The Guiyang
Transport Project reported significant strengthening of public debt management.
After project completion, the establishment of a debt management system enhanced
government debt planning and management in and coordination with
district/county governments. The China-GEF-World Bank Urban Transport
Partnership project focused on the transfer of financial resources from central to
local governments. With the project’s support, a national public transport strategy
was prepared that requires all national agencies and local governments to give
priority to the development of public transport, integrate land use and public
transport development, and explore innovative financing mechanisms for public
transport.


46
CHAPTER 5
URBAN TRANSPORT INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Fourteen nondedicated projects (10 percent) address the financing capacity of local
government to provide local services. These projects were successful in enhancing
the fiscal capacity of local governments. For example, the India Urban III project
helped local government to raise funds through nonbudgetary sources (including
bonds, PPPs, and beneficiary capital contributions). In Lebanon’s First Municipal
Infrastructure project, the ratio of municipal revenues to government transfers
decreased, reflecting improved financial sustainability at the municipal level. Urban
transport projects also successfully supported local government infrastructure
management and planning in Indonesia. A series of infrastructure DPLs resulted in
an increase in the number of Board of Community Trustees with completed financial
audits.


World Bank Group Support for Urban Transport Institution Structural Change
Only 15 dedicated urban transport operations (13 percent) supported establishment
or capacity building of a new lead urban transport agency; the nondedicated
projects do not provide such support. This is a relatively low level of support, given
the many challenges to service delivery stemming from institutional fragmentation
and lack of coordination. Governance of the sector is typically fragmented, covered
by several agencies, often at multiple levels of government, with overlapping
responsibilities and jurisdictions. A lead agency can coordinate the various transport
institutions and local governments and resolve jurisdictional issues. This approach
to structural change is often recommended as a way to streamline urban transport
services. At the same time, establishing a new agency is typically beyond the
timeline of an individual project, hence requires continuous and sequential support
to enable clients to weather changing political conditions and foster stability in
program implementation. However, the portfolio consists mainly of “one-time”
engagements with any given city. The World Bank has only provided such
continuous support through its dedicated operations for urban transport
institutional development to nine cities: Buenos Aires, Ho Chi Minh City, Lagos,
Lima, Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro, São Paolo, Urumqi, and Wuhan.

Out of eight closed and evaluated operations supporting structural change in the
urban transport sector, four were successful. IEG found all the successful cases were
in the cities receiving continuous support from the World Bank. In Nigeria, the
Lagos Urban Transport Project (LUTP) supported the Lagos Metropolitan Area
Transport Agency (LAMATA). The project was implemented over eight years (with
an extension and additional financing) and followed up by LUTP 2. In Buenos Aires,
the World Bank supported the creation of a metropolitan transport coordination
agency through the Argentina Buenos Aires Urban Transport Project, approved in


                                                                                    47
                                                                                 CHAPTER 5
                                                  URBAN TRANSPORT INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
1997. This project was followed by three additional dedicated urban transport
projects, and, with this continuous engagement, the agency was finally established
in 2014 and became operational in 2016.

On the other hand, the structural change outcomes were usually weak when the
World Bank only provided one-time support, when the strong government
commitment was absent, and when implementation capacity was lacking. Tunisia’s
Second Transport Project failed to create the intended formal coordination,
management, and regulatory setup for Greater Tunis because the Minister of the
Interior did not support the Governors in their efforts to establish Transport
Authorities. In Ghana, Urban Public Transport Units were created within multiple
municipalities in greater Accra and later converted into local Departments of
Transport. Unfortunately, these nascent bodies were poorly funded and
understaffed.

IEG found that World Bank Group urban transport projects that usually involve
multiple implementing agencies provided a platform for interagency coordination,
but sustainability of efforts was assured only when coordination was
institutionalized, which is difficult to achieve within a project’s timeframe. For
example, the Bogotá Urban Services Project failed to establish planned formal
multisector coordination mechanisms within the implementation period. In the
Guangzhou city transport project, several urban transport agencies managed to
work together during preparation and implementation to set up traffic management
and safety systems, but the sustainability of the coordination was not assured.


Drivers of Success and Failure
Support for institutional development is more likely to succeed when the World
Bank Group is continuously engaged with the sector over a longer time. Among
evaluated projects, institutional development components were 100 percent
successful in projects with continuous engagement. It is also clear, based on
evaluative evidence over time, that successive projects benefitted from and built on
previous institutional development achievements (box 5.2).


 Box 5.2. Continuous World Bank Group Support Catalyzed Effective Institutions
 An example of World Bank programmatic support to a municipality is in Mumbai, India.
 The Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC), jointly owned by Indian Railways and
 the Government of Maharashtra State, had been established during the preparation of the
 Mumbai Urban Transport project (MUTP) to implement the suburban rail improvement
 component in the metropolitan region. The project design supported initiatives to bring



48
CHAPTER 5
URBAN TRANSPORT INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
 decision making for the suburban rail system closer to the users and local authorities, and
 to get Mumbai’s suburban railway system to be seen as a distinct business, with adequate
 funding. During implementation of the project, MRVC’s operations were strengthened
 with separate accounting and financial management systems. MRVC supported a large
 increase in suburban rail system capacity and upgrading of service. The project also led to
 the positioning of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority as the key
 agency responsible for major transport and land developments in Mumbai and an
 ongoing dialogue, often involving MRVC, between central, state, and municipal officials.


IEG also found that support for institutional development was more likely to be
successful when it met the client’s priorities and when the client showed strong
commitment and leadership. In Lagos, for example, the Commissioner for Transport
in Lagos State was highly committed to the project, and commitment was sustained
through two successive governors from different political parties. In Brazil,
decentralization of service provision to the states was part of an overall government
strategy (and in fact mandated in the new constitution). The World Bank’s urban
transport projects were in line with this strategy—providing support to the states
throughout the decentralization process—and proved to be relatively successful.

Systematic reporting and monitoring of institutional development activities and
their results are critical to understanding what works and what does not.
Insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of institutional development support
partly explains why its success rate is low even when activities have mostly been
completed. Of the urban transport projects that contained institutional development
objectives, almost all with low efficacy ratings for these objectives also had low
ratings for M&E quality. Without a strong M&E framework for institutional
development support, it will be difficult to reap the benefits of organizational
learning on this crucial condition for effective urban transport service delivery.

6. Beyond Projects: Knowledge and
Convening Power
 Highlights
  The World Bank Group adds important value beyond project financing, through multiple instruments
   ranging from training and study tours to international conferences to informal dialogue.
  The activities build on the World Bank’s knowledge and convening power to promote sectoral reform.
  Conferences, workshops, peer consultations, and study tours often promote South-South learning.
  The innovative Leaders in Urban Transport Program has trained more than 1,000 national and local
   officials, encouraging new projects and improved sector management while strengthening global
   professional networking among practitioners.


Sources of World Bank Group Value Added
World Bank Group investment in urban transport is quite small compared to the
overall volume of urban transport investment globally, not to mention the vision
laid out in its strategy for improved policies, systems, services, and oversight in the
sector. Yet in IEG case studies, stakeholder and counterpart interviews, and
literature reviews, indications were found that the World Bank Group’s influence
was disproportionate to its resource investment. These sources made clear there was
a strong noninvestment element that the World Bank Group brought to client
countries and to global interactions on urban transport. This element can be slotted
into three categories: (i) advanced knowledge and knowledge sharing; (ii) convening
and mobilizing power and policy influence; and (iii) international operational
expertise, including environmental and social practices. These elements of added
value were not systematically recorded or publicized, thus understating World Bank
Group influence, but were quite apparent in each case study country (table 6.1).


Advanced Knowledge and Knowledge Sharing
The World Bank's influence, through its knowledge activities, on institutional
development, sectoral policy and oversight, and technical practice goes beyond
projects (box 6.1). Through much of the period, the World Bank Group has been a
global leader in urban transport knowledge, which it has promoted through
multiple means including publications, training, study tours, and dialogue. The
literature review and discussions with stakeholders yielded numerous references to
publications and research carried out by World Bank Group staff and retirees.

 Box 6.1. Promoting South-South Learning
 IEG’s evaluation encountered several instances where the World Bank Group facilitated
 South-South learning to strengthen its impact, leveraging extra resources and global
 connections. In India, the task team leader of the Sustainable Urban Transport project
 mobilized a grant to facilitate peer-to-peer learning centered on a 10-day study tour for
 Indian officials. Indian participants were able to witness positive examples of transport
 planning and design in Bogotá, Mexico City, and London.
 The World Bank worked with the government of Brazil, which was committed to South-
 South cooperation, and leveraged resources from a multidonor trust fund, the South-
 South Experience Exchange Facility, to organize a number of urban transport study tours
 and conferences. A report from the Brazil country management unit notes 17 transport
 activities and 18 urban activities from FY10–18 under a South-South Knowledge
 Exchange collaboration. Often trust-funded and involving expert visits, peer
 consultations, workshops, and study tours in Brazilian cities, the knowledge exchanges
 included the following:
 2. Peru–São Paolo on urban rail and PPP metro project development
 3. Vietnam–Brazil on sustainable urban transport planning
 4. Brazil, China, Colombia, India, and Vietnam on urban transport and environmental
    management.
 5. Russia–Brazil major events on urban transport
 6. Mexico–Brazil on a Metropolitan Area Development project.

IEG observed cases where the World Bank Group’s knowledge and training
activities were formally incorporated into projects, and other cases where they
provided part of the World Bank Group’s overall value-added package. A key
example is the reach and credibility of the LUTP, which is an innovative training
program, pioneered by the World Bank, aimed at building capacity among urban
transport practitioners(box 6.2). The program’s influence was evident through
favorable references in case study interviews with many counterparts and
stakeholders. LUTP created a global network of professionals who exchanged
experience and ideas about good practice, enhancing South-South learning while
also augmenting the World Bank’s reputation as a source of knowledge and advice.
For example, IEG met officials in city and national agencies in China, Ghana, and
India who had attended the LUTP training and acquired detailed knowledge of the
experience of metro and BRT systems in Brazil and Colombia.


 Box 6.2. Leaders in Urban Transport
 In 2007, the World Bank launched the Leaders in Urban Transport Planning (LUTP)
 program, “to develop a more comprehensive understanding of urban transport planning
 among senior policy makers and planners in cities, provincial governments, and national
 governments.” Supported by the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF),
 the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), Korean Green Growth
 Trust Fund, and other donors and external partners, LUTP evolved into a series of
 interactive and case study–based workshops delivered in four languages. It involves a
 self-study phase as well as the face-to-face workshop. By early 2016, more than 1,000
 participants had participated in sessions in four languages in 50 countries.
 IEG’s team found very enthusiastic views in field missions among officials who had
 attended. Case study and staff interviews indicated that several BRT projects were
 initiated in countries following workshops, including Nigeria, the Philippines, Tanzania,
 and Vietnam. One interviewee credited the success of Lima’s BRT launch to staff
 participation in the course.

In interviews, clients indicated that they valued the integrated approach applied by
some of the World Bank Group’s urban transport projects. In China, the World Bank
introduced an “integrated corridor management” approach; issues including traffic,
safety, accessibility, and NMT became integrated parts of World Bank Group
projects, with strong demonstration effects. For example, Beijing, Shenzhen, and
Fuzhou municipal governments all applied this approach when developing their
urban transport systems. In Brazil, the World Bank’s engagement through ASA,
training, and project preparation promoted transit-oriented development,
encouraging high-density development near key transport arteries.

BEYOND PROJECTS: KNOWLEDGE AND CONVENING POWER
International operational expertise, including environmental and social practices.
The case studies suggested that clients value the World Bank’s operational expertise
and perspective in addition to its financing. In both China and India, the World
Bank’s attention to planning, safeguards, and supervision was appreciated. Clients
clearly valued the World Bank Group’s attention to environmental and social (E&S)
standards, even if some officials also found it taxing. In India, some observers saw
an inspection panel case on resettlement arising from the Mumbai Urban Transport
Project as a boon, because it “taught us how to deal with resettlement and
rehabilitation professionally.” 2 In China, the practice of installing noise barriers
along the inner ring roads under the World Bank Guangzhou Inner City Project was
adopted by the municipality. In Izmir, Turkey, IFC’s environmental assessment
brought agreement for a rerouting to “cut fewer trees.”

Further, the World Bank’s approach to M&E was more comprehensive than case
study clients’ practices, introducing new indicators, including indicators of social
and economic outcomes. For example, in India’s Sustainable Urban Transport
Project, the monitoring system under the project provided quantitative and
qualitative indicators for a BRT subproject presenting a comprehensive,
multidimensional view of project status and performance by route (with controls for
untreated routes), with full information on mobility (including mobility for women,
the disabled, and the elderly), emissions, safety, revenues, and property values. 3


Convening and Mobilizing Power and Policy Influence
In countries where the World Bank Group is engaged in projects, it is often also
engaged with government on sector strategy and policy, whether formally or as a
participant in internal government discussions. In the China, Ghana, and India case
studies, Ministry officials and members of the development community confirmed
that World Bank staff had engaged both formally and informally in discussions of
policy and strategy. The World Bank’s emphasis on a comprehensive approach,
involving policies and institutions and physical infrastructure, and its unique
knowledge resources and global experience, often afforded it a “place at the table”
anda role as leader in sectoral policy discussions. In China, the World Bank Group is
responsible for flagship knowledge products such as “Urban China” and “China
2030,” the recommendations of which were adopted by the Chinese government and
reflected in the National “13th Five-Year Plan.” The World Bank was also seen as a
valued link to knowledge and a convener of South-South exchanges. The World
Bank convened many international, regional, and national conferences on urban
transport during the period, bringing together multiple stakeholders and donors to
address common challenges. The World Bank cohosts an annual “Transforming

reputation also helps in mobilizing financing from government, donors, and private
financiers.

7. Conclusions
The World Bank Group has played a strong role in supporting urban transport
development in client countries. Continuous support has effectively enhanced the
capacity and quality of service delivery. The World Bank Group has promoted
private sector provision of services in ways that have strengthened their financial
sustainability. It has used its interventions to help clients mitigate environmental
harm from urban transport systems. World Bank Group interventions have also
enhanced institutional capacity to administer urban transport service provision. The
achievement of these intermediate outcomes should contribute to economic
development and the welfare of the disadvantaged. Further, though the World Bank
Group’s finance is small compared to the unmet need, it has proven its ability to use
its knowledge and convening power to spread good practices and promote South-
South learning.

Nonetheless, there are important gaps. There is a broad imbalance with regard to
low-income countries and, in particular, the Africa region, where the portfolio and
the focus on public transport have sharply declined. The World Bank Group has
paid insufficient and inconsistent attention to mobility of the disadvantaged. There
are missed opportunities for more comprehensive engagements that may yield
stronger benefits in mobility and environmental sustainability. And there are
opportunities to strengthen work quality in ex ante analysis, M&E, and
communications and collaboration between different parts of the World Bank
Group. Overall, the findings of this evaluation focused on four areas.


Balancing the Portfolio
The evaluation portfolio revealed some imbalances that merit careful attention. The
broader imbalance between middle- and lower-income countries is most evident in
Africa, where a sharply declining portfolio is compounded by the loss of expertise
that could contribute to a new generation of activity. The apparent mismatch in this
Region lies between portfolio and external conditions, with the fastest urbanization
of any region. Further, the second half of the review period (2012–16) saw a retreat
from public transport and NMT operations.


Including the Disadvantaged
Although World Bank Group urban transport projects often discuss challenges to
the disadvantaged, the portfolio does not reflect consistent attention in project


56
CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS
design to improve access for the poor, women, disabled persons, and elderly. Only
about 7 percent of urban transport projects had targeted interventions to meet the
special needs of women and only 10 percent had targeted interventions for disabled
persons and elderly. Although the cost of services is a common constraint for
disadvantaged groups, the project-level support to address affordability concerns is
often lacking, limiting the effects of the World Bank Group’s support of mobility
improvement for the disadvantaged. Ex ante analysis of impacts on women, and a
focus on security and amenities for women, were the exception rather than the
norm. Where targeted interventions were provided, projects seldom tracked the
impacts on these disadvantaged groups. The opportunity to mainstream support for
the disadvantaged, to routinely utilize affordability analysis, and to learn from
results are all project design features whose potential remains untapped.


Benefits of Comprehensive Engagements
Experience in mobility and environment suggest that the World Bank Group can
achieve more impact when it engages more comprehensively, working both
upstream (on policy and institutions) and downstream (on operations), and working
on both enhancing the supply of, and managing the demand for, urban transport.

   •   Mobility. World Bank Group projects that incorporate both travel demand
       management (avoiding travel and shifting modes) and supply measures were
       able to commit more to mobility and achieve more improvements, and were
       more likely to sustain outcomes than projects that focused only on supply.
       The lack of emphasis on demand management limited the benefit of
       increased supply. Key aspects of demand management include the
       integration of land use and transport planning and introducing incentives for
       modal shifting. Though demand management has proven less politically
       palatable, “package deals” of supply and demand improvements appear to be
       more effective.
   •   Environmental Sustainability. World Bank Group support for downstream
       mitigation through urban transport projects generated only localized impacts.
       Addressing environmental sustainability at a policy level, coupled with an
       investment operation, showed a better chance of environmental success.
       However, policy support can only be effective if it is enforced. Projects with a
       comprehensive approach, offering upstream and downstream support, were
       more likely to yield citywide environmental sustainability.

                                                                            CONCLUSIONS

Strengthening Work Quality
IEG found several indications of inconsistent work quality and practices that limited
the potential impact of World Bank Group urban transport interventions.

     •   The analysis of project financial viability, cost, and timing appeared
         frequently optimistic. Ex ante analysis often ignored an explicit consideration
         of subsidy, maintenance costs, and alternative options.
     •   Regarding project M&E, IEG found that data weaknesses and indicator
         inconsistencies across projects limit learning and accountability. For example,
         though many projects have some indicators of mobility, few have the same
         indicators, making comparisons difficult. Missing indicators, inconsistent
         indicators, absence of baseline measurement, absence of measurement over
         project life, and absence of sustained M&E of urban transport services beyond
         project life were common characteristics of the urban transport evaluation
         portfolio.

Communication (and coordination) between the institutions of the World Bank
Group appeared weak in urban transport engagements. Regarding private sector
participation, the PPP work of the IFC and MIGA in some cases appears to be
disconnected from relevant “upstream” work of the World Bank. Consequently,
there may be unrealized investment opportunities involving private service
provision of urban transport services. This finding is especially relevant to the recent
formal embrace of the “cascade approach” which gives priority to private sector
participation in infrastructure investments.

Appendix A. Methodology
Evaluation Questions
As established in the approach paper, 1 the overarching evaluation question was “To
what extent has the World Bank Group supported sustainable urban transport
development in client countries that contributed to city’s efficiency and economic
growth; environmental quality; the welfare of the poor and vulnerable groups; and
road/traffic safety?” The subordinate questions asked:

    •   Relevance: To what extent has the World Bank Group’s support for urban
        transport been relevant to client countries (and cities) and their poor, female
        and other vulnerable populations’ priority needs, as well as to local priority?
        This question focuses attention on the economic and development rationale
        for World Bank Group’s engagement in urban transport, its strategic
        objectives, its allocation of its resources and instruments in the context of
        country and city conditions, its tailoring of interventions to local physical,
        institutional and policy conditions, adapting them to the needs of
        disadvantaged groups, allocation of resources across cities, and its use of
        collaboration and partnerships where conditions merited.
    •   Effectiveness (Efficacy): To what extent has the World Bank Group been
        effective in achieving its objectives (improved accessibility and mobility;
        environmental sustainability; the welfare of the poor, women, and
        vulnerable groups; and road/traffic safety) with regard to urban transport
        development?
    •   Efficiency: To what extent are World Bank Group interventions in urban
        transport efficient from both program and institutional perspectives? This
        question aims to elicit the extent to which World Bank Group interventions
        (or the systems they supported) reached beneficiaries at a reasonable cost
        and were well-utilized and financially viable.
    •   Work Quality: To what extent has the World Bank Group achieved high
        standards in managing factors within its control and coordinating its work
        internally and externally? This question focuses on how well the World Bank
        Group designed and supported the implementation, executed the safeguard
        policies and tracked the results of its urban transport portfolio, and how well
        it used collaboration, coordination, or complementarities across the World
        Bank Group and with other players and partners.

As elaborated in Attachment 2 of the approach paper, 2 each of these questions has
subordinate questions that must be answered for a full a full and detailed response.

APPENDIX A
METHODOLOGY

Overarching Principles
Four central principles guided the evaluation design: (i) multilevel analysis, (ii)
theory-based approach, (iii) mixed-methods, and (iv) multiple “lenses” (figure 1).
First, the evaluation adopted a multilevel perspective as the assessments covered the
global, national, and city (or municipal) level of World Bank Group support to urban
transport. Second, the evaluation was grounded in a theory of change. The team
carefully constructed a theory of change reflecting how the World Bank Group’s
strategy and sectoral leadership posited that its interventions would contribute to
desired outcomes and impact. The emergent elements became focal points of the
evaluation, reflected in its chapter organization. The theory of change was
constructed iteratively and validated with key informants and counterparts, as well
as through the approach paper process. Third, the evaluation followed a mixed-
methods approach combining a range of methods for data collection and analysis
and applied triangulation to ensure the robustness of the findings. Finally, in
addition to the standard evaluative perspective, the team pioneered the application
of two “lenses” aimed to yield new, cross-cutting insights in delivery of public
services to the poor. In parallel, two teams from the Sustainable Services for the Poor
Strategic Engagement Area (SEA) prepared short reports applying their lens.

Overview of Methodological Design
The evaluation used nine methodological building blocks to generate evidence to
assess the development impact of World Bank Group’s support to urban transport
over the period 2007–16. These include:

Table A1. Evaluation Components
 Theory of Change
 1. Literature review             A focused review of the academic and professional
                                  literature (external and internal) on UT was conducted
                                  by a consultant and augmented by the team.
 2. Theory of Change              The team carefully constructed a theory of change
                                  reflecting how the World Bank Group’s strategy and
                                  sectoral leadership posited that its interventions would
                                  contribute to desired outcomes and impact. The
                                  emergent elements became focal points of the
                                  evaluation, reflected in its chapter organization.

                                                                      METHODOLOGY
                              MIGA guarantees. The team used micro-evaluation
                              data in the case of IEG-validated, evaluated closed
                              projects.
4. Key Performance            The team collected and analyzed level key performance
Indicators (KPIs)             indicators (KPIs) to assess UT interventions at the
                              output, intermediate outcome, and outcome levels.
5. Performance Assessment     Eight relevant Project Performance Assessment Reports
Reports (PPARs)               (PPARs), involving independent field-based IEG
                              project evaluations of UT projects, were carried out in
                              Argentina,China, India, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, and
                              Senegal .
6. Country Case Studies       Five field-based country case studies were undertaken
                              to understand World Bank Group urban transport
                              activities in country context over the full evaluation
                              period in Brazil, China, Ghana, India, and Turkey, . In
                              addition, desk reviews were conducted of six countries:
                              Argentina, Columbia, Morocco,Nigeria, Senegal,
                              andVietnam .
7. Interviews of World        The evaluation team conducted dozens of interviews
Bank staff, counterparts,     with World Bank Group staff. During the field visits
client beneficiaries, other   for country case studies and PPARs, a large number of
expert informants and         counterparts, clients, beneficiaries, other stakeholders,
stakeholders.                 and relevant experts were consulted.
8. Partnership Review         The team carried out Partnership reviews of two major
                              World Bank Group partnerships – the Public Private
                              Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) and the Sub-
                              Saharan Africa Transport Program (SSATP) – to
                              understand how effectively the World Bank Group is
                              utilizing them. (The Global Environmental Fund’s role
                              was regarded as integrated with that of the World
                              Bank Group, and is examined as part of the main
                              evaluation.)
9. Evaluative Lenses          The evaluation pioneered the application of two
                              “lenses” aimed to yield new, cross-cutting insights in
                              delivery of public services to the poor. In parallel, two
                              teams from the Sustainable Services for the Poor
                              Strategic Engagement Area (SEA) prepared short
                              annexes applying their lens, attached to the evaluation.
a. Behavioral Change          • The first focused on behavioral change and,
                                  specifically, modal shifting as a desired behavioral
                                  outcome of UT interventions.
b. Service Delivery           • The second focused on service delivery, a lens that
                                  was integrated into the evaluation framework.

THEORY OF CHANGE

Figure A2 summarizes the theory of change developed for this evaluation. It reflects
the relationship posited in World Bank Group strategies: how the activities and
inputs of the World Bank Group contribute to government and private sector
activities whose outputs could lead to developmentally significant outcomes and
impacts. Three themes emerged from IEG’s review of World Bank Group strategy
(as well as related literature and the portfolio), which form the basis of the three
chapters: Mobility for All and, specifically, for the poor, women, and disabled
persons; UT institutional development for better sector management; and
sustainable UT service delivery, covering both financial and environmental
dimensions.

PORTFOLIO REVIEW

This evaluation covers the entire World Bank Group portfolio (lending, AAA,
investment, advisory, and guarantees) either approved or closed/matured over a
10-year period from FY2007 to FY2016, which means those urban transport projects
approved prior to FY2007 but closed within the evaluation period were assessed as
well. Projects mapped to the sector and theme codes covering urban transport were
screened. For the World Bank projects, the codes are TC (urban transport), TZ
(General Transportation), BV (Public Administration-transportation) and theme
code 102 (City-Wide infrastructure and Service Delivery). For IFC, this included
activities with an Urban Transport code; however the list was modified after
consultation with key counterparts. For MIGA a keyword search yielded an initial
portfolio identification which was finalized in consultation with counterparts. Those
projects, with either objectives or activities in urban transport development, were
included in the scope of the evaluation. Objectives usually included improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of urban transport system, improving the institutional
capacity of planning, managing, and operating the urban transport system, and
improving the accessibility and mobility of the targeted beneficiaries including the
urban poor and the vulnerable groups. The activities include providing urban
transport infrastructure and multiple modes of urban transport services, as well as

travel demand management measures including traffic management and
institutional capacity-building and strengthening activities. It covers the portfolio
relating to public and private provision as well as public-private partnerships. It also
covers urban transport for both people and goods (freight), although the World
Bank Group does little regarding urban freight.

However, the portfolio selection excluded a number of related topics: intercity and
nonurban (for example,. rural) transport; urban planning and development activities
not involving a UT component; environmental and safety regulations and policies
not concerning UT; and efforts to extend nonurban transport services to
disadvantaged groups.

The portfolio review is based on the Project Appraisal Documents (PADs), IFC
Board Papers, MIGA President’s Reports, Implementation Completion and Results
Reports (ICRs), IEG’s ICR Reviews (ICRRs), Expanded Project Supervision Reports
(XPSRs), Project Completion Reports (PCRs), Project Evaluation Reports (PERs), and
Project Performance Assessment Report (PPARs). The broad evaluative categories
were:

     •     mobility-related outputs and outcomes arising from physical asset creation;
     •     regulatory and policy improvements;
     •     institutional capacity building;
     •     improving financial viability and improved city environment through project
           level climate mitigation and adaptation measures;
     •     benefits to the poor and vulnerable groups through project design targeting
           this group of beneficiaries.

The following portfolio coding template was used to classify projects.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPI) ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

Since all the World Bank Group’s investment projects have indicators (at the
outcome, intermediate outcome, and output levels) to measure the project’s
performance, the evaluation reviewed project-level key performance indicators


                                                                                             65

METHODOLOGY
(KPIs) to assess the performance of UT interventions at the output, intermediate
outcome, and longer-term outcome levels..

KPIs were classified under the following categories:

Access: Availability of urban transport services

     •   Number of beneficiaries
     •   Share of the population that has access to a bus station/transit stop within
         400m (400m is generally considered as a best practice) or within an x-minute
         walk
     •   Amount of public transportation infrastructure in the city/person: such as km
         of BRT or metro/person
     •   For disabled persons: presence of special ramps or other physical infrastructure
         facilities
     •   Information systems to ease access to the system (for the deaf, blind…) and
         real-time user information and applications
     •   Share of the population that has a smart card
     •   Percent of intermodal connectivity or integration of all transport systems

Accessibility: People’s overall ability to reach services and activities (reaching
destination). Improved access to urban transport (especially public transport) service
will lead to improved accessibility for transport service users which could be
measured by:

     •   Number of jobs or services or educational centers or other places reachable
         within x minutes
     •   Reduced average time (or cost)/trip of reaching certain jobs or services
     •   Reduction in travel time (include in accessibility if the indicator specifies to and
         from)

Mobility:

     •   Ridership
     •   Passengers/direction/day or hour or during peak time to compare ridership
         levels
     •   Reduction in travel time (include in accessibility if the indicator specifies “on”
         the corridor or road)
     •   IPK: Index of passenger per kilometer (also related to the productivity of the
         system)
     •   Average time/trip on the system
     •   Service speed

Reliability/Quality/Improved capacity of the system:

   •   Public transport frequency
   •   In terms of outputs: doubling of lanes, road extension, acquisition of additional
       buses (this will be a repetition from the Infrastructure output section)
   •   IPK: Index of passenger per kilometer (also related to the productivity of the
       system)– also in mobility
   •   Passengers/direction/day or hour or during peak time to compare ridership
       levels– also in mobility

Modal shifting:

   •   Possibly: Modal split change (before project 30 percent of the population used
       public transport, after project: 40 percent)

Affordability:

   •   Cost/trip
   •   Percent of household income spent on public transport

The following ratings scale was used:

team applied a coding and rating of the achievement of indicators. For active
projects only coding was applied to see trends in indicators

LITERATURE REVIEW

The evaluation team conducted a review of academic papers, reports, and
publications (including impact evaluations and systematic reviews) from academic
journals, multilateral banks, World Bank Group and other sources. The literature
covered different urban transport modes (for example, bus rapid transit (BRT),
conventional bus, nonmotorized transport or metro) or a single policy objective (for
example, modal shifting, pollution abatement, public-private partnerships, or
pricing). Recent World Bank reports on urban transport (for example Cities on the
Move and Cities on the Move—Ten Years After) were included in the review. Topics for
review, derived from the review of World Bank Group strategies, the theory of
change, the evaluative questions, and the approach, as well as initial informant
interviews and the Approach Paper literature review included:

     •   Google (https://www.google.com) for related reports from research
         institutes;
     •   Select databases that mainly provide real data, examples of interventions in
         study cities, and empirical results from field experiments.

Once the articles were identified and located, the following steps were undertaken:

     •   Overview: A quick review of articles was conducted via reading of abstract,
         introduction, the first few paragraphs, and the conclusion of each article.
     •   Categorization: Articles were categorized into topics and subtopics and
         chronologically within each subtopic.
     •   In-depth review and summarization: Identified relationships among studies:
         such as which studies were landmark ones that led to subsequent studies in
         the same area. Critiqued the research methodologies used in the studies, and
         distinguished between assertions (the author's opinion) and actual research
         findings (derived from empirical evidence). Summarized the findings and
         research results.
     •   A paper on the literature review was prepared. The topics were re-
         structured to inform specific chapters. A summary of the literature review
         and the bibliography used is provided in appendix D.

KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS

The team interviewed a range of informants, beginning with senior managers and
specialists (both current and retired) from the World Bank Group, extending to
academics, country experts, donors, and a variety of other stakeholders (government
officials, civil societies, beneficiaries etc.) conducted in the context of country case
studies and PPARs. Interviews with the World Bank staff in charge of the portfolio
of interventions in each country were also conducted (about 30 interviews were
conducted.) All interviews followed the template (attached below) and were guided
by the theory of change and evaluation questions. For each interview, detailed
written notes were taken and analyzed.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS (PPARS)

Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs) serve both accountability and
learning functions, and may be conducted at any point after a self-evaluation (ICR)
has been completed. Though they formally follow the same rating criteria as the
ICRR, PPARs are evaluations rather than a validation exercise, and they rely on a
broader set of evidence. For World Bank operations, the instrument stretches back
over 40 years, though its scope and function has evolved over time; IEG began to
conduct PPARs for IFC operations in FY16. Each PPAR conducts an independent

field-based evaluation of one or more lending operations. PPARs rely on a mixed
methods approach which usually includes (but is not limited to) a literature review,
portfolio analysis, and a country mission involving site visits and semi-structured
interviews with different stakeholders.

In addition to country case studies, nine PPARs involving independent field-based
IEG project evaluations of UT projects were carried out in following seven countries:
Argentina, China, India, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, and Senegal. The selected projects
covered urban transport modes including urban roads, BRTs, and metro projects as
well as private sector participation and GEF support.

CASE STUDIES

The five field-based country case studies for this evaluation sought to provide
evidence of World Bank Group performance in the country context, and to lend
insights on complementarities, synergies, coordination, and sequencing of work by
the institutions of the World Bank Group and its partnerships with other donors.
Country cases were also used to yield insights from field-level staff, clients at the
national and subnational levels, beneficiaries, other donors and other stakeholders,
and local experts.

In each case study, IEG first carried out desk work and interviews to establish an
initial understanding of the World Bank Group’s activities and contribution, and
how it fit into the government’s and the World Bank’s country strategy for the
sector. The field missions were used to further elaborate and validate this story,
filling in missing information required to understand how a variety of explanatory
factors (both positive and negative) contributed to observed outcomes. In the end,
the aim for each country was to have a highly credible and well-evidenced account
of the contribution of World Bank Group activities to urban transport outcomes.

The World Bank Group’s urban transport portfolio is spread among 88 countries. In
selecting countries for case studies, IEG applied criteria that included the intensity
and nature of the World Bank Group’s support to urban transport development in
the country; the mature status of at least part of the portfolio (to ensure a meaningful
assessment); and representation of different regions, income levels, sectoral
institutional and regulatory development, and degrees of urbanization. Based on
these criteria, 11 countries were selected for country case studies. Five of them
(Brazil, China, Ghana, India, and Turkey) were selected for field missions and the
remaining six (Argentina, Columbia, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, and Vietnam, )
were selected for desk review. Together, the 11 countries’ portfolios encompass

PARTNERSHIP REVIEWS

As established in the approach paper, the team conducted partnership reviews of
the two largest World Bank Group partnerships—the Public-Private Infrastructure
Advisory Facility (PPIAF) and the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Program
(SSATP)—to understand how effectively these partnerships had contributed to the
World Bank Group’s support for urban transport. . Over the course of the
evaluation, the team also conducted dozens of interviews with World Bank Group
staff, counterparts, clients, beneficiaries, other stakeholders, and relevant experts.

Selection The SSATP and the PPIAF were selected as longstanding providers of
technical assistance, capacity building and knowledge work in the transport sector.
While the SSATP focuses on facilitating policy development and related capacity-
building in the transport sector of Africa, the PPIAF provides catalytic support to
promote public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure, including the
transport sector.




                                                                                              77
APPENDIX A
METHODOLOGY
Scope The partnership reviews assessed the SSATP’s support to urban transport and
the PPIAF-supported activities in urban transport approved and implemented in
FY2007–FY2016.

Methodology The in-depth analyses of these two global and regional partnership
programs followed IEG’s framework for assessing global and regional partnership
programs (2007) and IEG guidance on mainstreaming partnership assessments
(2016). The framework is based on the OECD DAC criteria of evaluating
development effectiveness adapted to evaluating Global and Regional Partnership
Programs. The assessment uses two broad sets of criteria: a) the development
outputs, outcomes, and results of the program itself; b) the organizational
effectiveness of the program and how well the partnership is functioning. Being
tailored to the questions of the main evaluation, the focus of the assessment was
primarily be on the first, while the effectiveness of the partnerships was touched
upon to the extent that it was critical for the achievement of the program results.

In addition, to assess the effectiveness and utilization of PPIAF- supported activities
in urban transport, a desk review of a sample (20 out of 47 UT activities) was carried
out as well. A standardized assessment template/tool was developed and applied
for that purpose.

These partnership reviews were based on the desk review of programs’ key
documents: annual reports, flagship knowledge reports, tools and methodologies,
policy papers, and external evaluations. This was supplemented by interviews with
the program’s thematic team leaders, the World Bank Group task team leads,
donors, and partners.

WORLD BANK PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS (PPARS)

Project Performance Assessment Reports (PPARs) are independent field-based
project evaluations that serve both accountability and learning functions, and may
be conducted at any point after a self-evaluation (ICR) has been completed. Though
they formally follow the same rating criteria as the ICRR, PPARs are evaluations
rather than a validation exercise, and they rely on a broader set of evidence. PPARs
rely on a mixed-methods approach which usually includes (but is not limited to) a
literature review, portfolio analysis, and a country mission involving site visits and
semi-structured interviews with different stakeholders. PPARs are selected to
achieve sector and thematic representation of the entire World Bank portfolio.
PPARs provide feedback on what worked and what didn’t at a project level,
drawing on an independent perspective and sometimes broader stakeholder

                                                                            METHODOLOGY
consultations. PPARs are often undertaken some years after project closure,
providing evidence on sustainability and longer-term outcomes.

IEG selects projects to be evaluated by PPARs purposively on a number of criteria,
including the quality of the self-evaluation and its evidence base, the potential for
learning from an innovative operation, a rating dispute arising from validation of
self-evaluation, a very large operation, a potential safeguards violation, the ability to
contribute to other IEG products, or other opportunity for adding value. For Urban
Transport, three PPARs (two nondedicated project PPARs in China and one
dedicated project PPAR in Peru) used were part of IEG’s planned program for the
portfolio and six PPARs were selected to fill a gap in coverage of modes and
geography.

Ensuring Validity of Findings
Several principles were used to ensure rigor and consistency in evaluation design as
well as data collection and analysis. The theory of change was used as a basis for
understanding causal relationships between variables. For the portfolio, coding
consistency was checked across analyses. A case study template was developed and
provided to all case study leaders to ensure a common framework and evaluative
consistency across case studies. The case studies were internally reviewed to
enhance consistency. Furthermore, the team applied triangulation at multiple levels.
Evidence and conclusions from interviews were checked against information arising
from documents, ICRRs, PPPARs, and quantitative data from external sources, and
vice versa.

The evaluation team also used external validation at various stages of the evaluation
process. In particular, the team consulted its advisors both early and late in the
evaluation process. The team maintained a dialogue with key Management
counterparts of the World Bank Group institutions at points throughout the
evaluation to validate hypotheses, approaches, impressions, and preliminary
conclusions. Four peer-reviewers provided feedback at the approach paper and one-
stop stages. Finally, a variant on a “REACT” workshop was piloted under an agreed
plan where management drafted recommendations based on IEG findings.

Limitations
The portfolio posed certain distinct evaluability challenges given its diversity and,
for long-gestating infrastructure projects, relative youth. For the 10-year evaluation
period (including all projects closed 2007–16), IEG found only 44 evaluated and
validated projects mapped to the Transport GP or IFC, and 63 projects mapped to



                                                                                       79

METHODOLOGY
GP SURR or other GPs. Of the overall portfolio, 64 percent were road projects and 16
percent traditional bus projects, leaving a population of only six evaluated BRT
projects and 12 metro projects, distributed across multiple countries and regions.
Only five IFC advisory service projects and three IFC investment projects in UT had
been evaluated. Two relevant MIGA projects were evaluated; nor were any World
Bank Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) projects, for which there is no
validated evaluative system. Thus the evaluative challenge was to augment meager
results data with analysis of the patterns and content of the portfolio and the other
sources of evidence.

Clearly other challenges come from the a) the mixed nature of many noncore urban
projects where urban transport comprised only a minority of activities; b) the poor
conduct of M&E in many projects, with nonstandard indicators, lack of baseline,
intermediate or final data, and lack of follow-up monitoring after a project closed;
and c) the mixed nature of other, broader infrastructure projects that may have
included some element of urban transport in their activities, such as intercity,
regional or national roads projects. A final challenge was determining the outcomes
attributable to World Bank Group interventions in the context of government,
private sector, and other donor activities for large cities and larger clients.

Appendix B. Summary of Country Case Studies
Brazil Country Case Study

3. Country Context

With a population of more than 200 million people and a Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) of $1,775 billion in 2015, Brazil is the world’s fifth most populous and seventh
largest economy. Brazil has been rapidly urbanizing since the 1970s, with the share
of people living in cities increasing from 56 percent in 1970 to 86 percent in 2015.
Currently more than 90 percent of the country’s GDP is generated from cities. These
trends, accompanied by the preference of the rising middle class for private
vehicles—also encouraged by the government—propelled Brazil to become the fifth
largest automotive market in the world. The rapid urbanization process,
accompanied by insufficient planning, has resulted in road congestion, increased
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and concentration of poverty in peripheral areas.
These areas typically have little access to basic infrastructure and services, mobility,
job opportunities, affordable land, and housing.

Yet, the importance of urban mobility has been recognized by the Brazilian
government. High-flow bus priority schemes and busways, and urban and
suburban rail, were introduced in several cities under the coordination of the
Empresa Brasileira dos Transportes Urbanos (EBTU) since the 1970s. In 1984, the
train systems in São Paolo, Rio de janeiro, Salvador, and five other cities were
transferred to the newly formed Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos (CBTU).
After the constitutional reform of 1988, which emphasized decentralization, the
units of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador,) and Fortaleza were gradually
transferred to their respective local governments. However, the new Constitution
did not clearly redefine the distribution of functions between levels of government.
In 2015, the country moved to address the fragmentation of governance in
metropolitan areas by introducing the Statute of the Metropolis, which obliges states
to develop integrated plans for metropolitan development, coordinated with cities’
own plans.

The current institutional setting of urban transportation in Brazil involves
collaborations between federal, state, and city governments, within transportation
and related areas such as finance, urban planning, and environment. At the federal
level, the Ministry of Transport is responsible for the National Transport Policy, but
has no mandate regarding urban transport. The Ministry of Cities is responsible for
the National Policy of Urban Mobility. At the state level, State Secretariats for


                                                                                      81
APPENDIX B
SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
Transport are in charge of state transport policy. Railway assets are owned and
supervised by one or more different state companies. In Rio, São Paulo, and
Salvador, Secretariats have granted rail transport operation and maintenance in the
metropolitan regions to private concessionaires. Regulatory agencies, when in place,
regulate fares and control and enforce compliance with concession agreements.

4. World Bank Group’s Support

Three World Bank Country Strategies were developed during the review period.
The 2003–07 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) noted that providing ongoing
support to metro systems in the large cities would contribute to poverty reduction
by increasing access for the poor. The approach was in line with the government's
own multiyear plan (2004–07). The subsequent Country Partnership Strategy (CPS
2008–11) included improving public transport services in large and fast-growing
medium-sized cities, emphasizing the need to improve air quality. The CPS also
called for IBRD-IFC partnerships in structuring of public-private partnerships
(PPPs) in the urban sector. The 2012–15 CPS for the first time explicitly recognized
the importance of integrating transport into the broader context of city planning,
called for efforts to develop and implement strategies for promoting low-carbon
growth and climate change adaptation at the city level.

The country case study is based on a desk review and field mission of a sample of
the World Bank Group’s portfolio approved or closed during the period of FY2007–
FY2016 in Brazil. The study covered 12 projects and five additional financing (AF)
projects in three metropolitan regions—Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Salvador (SA), and Sao
Paulo (SP)—totaling slightly more than $4 billion: six in RJ, nine in SP, and two in
SA.

The World Bank’s operational support to the urban transport sector in Brazil has
evolvedwith the country’s needs. in the 1970s support came through three national
urban transport projects, implemented through EBTU for traffic management, BRTs,
and rail. In the 1990s, two projects supported the decentralization of urban rail
services in the States of SP and RJ. Thereafter, support has been primarily at the state
and municipal levels, and primarily for rail. By 2007, projects supporting urban rail
were well under way in RJ, SP and SA, but the World Bank’s support continued to
be substantial. In Brazil, urban transport has been one of the largest single
components in the country program (in which 75 percent has been devoted to urban
rail), if not the largest. Broader urban development support is minimal (about 4
percent).

                                                        SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
The rail projects primarily supported the purchase of trains and signaling systems,
as well as rehabilitation and new construction of track and stations. This was in line
with the request of the Brazilian government, which had gained experience in BRTs
and sought the World Bank’s technical support for rail projects that were needed to
meet the rapidly growing demand for transport. The projects also included
components to make the investments sustainable, such as fostering metropolitan
transport coordination committees; helping develop strategies for urban transport,
land use, and air quality; access and affordability components such as integrating
bus routes with train stations and support for the integrated ticket, Bilhete Unico;
and seeking private sector involvement in operations and investment.

5. Effectiveness

Implementation was not straightforward. Decentralization of metro services took
place partially and in stages. The major construction projects suffered from stop-
and-go institutional and financial arrangements. The projects themselves, especially
those involving civil works, were ambitious and faced delays, and in some cases had
to be scaled back or phased as a result of reduced funding from the state. The
timeframe for installing new signaling and control systems on lines already in
operation proved overly optimistic, and had to be slowed significantly to deal with
logistical difficulties and contractual issues with the supplier. The Salvador project
closed with a concessionaire lined up, but the arrangement fell through and the
metro project was restarted, after a hiatus, with a different company. Two rail
projects (Metro line 4 in SP, and Mass transit II in RJ) were extended, and received
additional financing for more equipment and components. The four closed rail
projects received ICR ratings of moderately satisfactory (MS), at least. In urban
development, the transport component of the SA project—a ring road and some
secondary/tertiary roads—remained unfinished at project closing but was
completed a year later. The restructured Rio de Janeiro project drops technical
assistance for Bilhete Unico and instead supports urban mobility plans for nine
municipalities in the metropolitan region.

Notwithstanding these challenges, there have been significant achievements,
particularly in delivering additional capacity in mass transit. Line 4 in Sao Paolo is
transporting 700,000 passengers/day (10 percent of the metro system’s traffic). It is
the first privately operated urban rail line supported by the World Bank, and the
first Brazilian PPP after the PPP law was enacted. Line 4’s extension to Villa Sonia is
under implementation and is projected to be completed in 2018 with a traffic of 1
million passengers/day. Similarly, Rio de Janeiro’s suburban rail transported more
than 659,000 passengers per working day in 2015 (up from 156,000 when the
concession took over in 1998) thanks to the efficiency of operations by the

concessionaire and the increased capacity brought in parallel. In Salvador, the
design of the World Bank’s project was aimed at creating access to the center from
poor areas in the North at Piraja. The line was eventually extended to Piraja in
December 2015, although this was done after the project had closed. In both São
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the World Bank’s support was helpful in mobilizing the
needed financing from the federal and state governments, and, for the São Paulo
projects, co-financing support from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.
The Inter-American Development Bank is a parallel co-financier in the São Paulo
Metro Line 5 project. The World Bank’s support catalyzed the private sector’s
involvement in all three cities and was helpful in resolving technical issues and
disputes with the contractors. Moreover, the drafting of Brazil’s 2012 National
Urban Mobility Law was supported by organizations cooperating on Global
Environment Fund (GEF) project activities. The law covered topics aligned to the
GEF’s thematic windows (nonmotorized transport (NMT), public transport,
integrated land-use planning, demand management, and freight). The World Bank
also promoted transit-oriented development (TOD) in Brazil to improve land use
planning around transit facilities.

The projects were successful in significantly raising capacity, but causing modal
shifts—to decrease congestion—proved much more difficult and beyond the scope
of these projects. The projects were successful in raising capacity significantly, but
there was no appreciable increase in modal share of mass transit. The increase in rail
capacity was, in the first place, addressing longstanding unmet demand, and
moreover was matched by rapidly growing urban populations. Although recent
World Bank projects have included pilots for multimodal/NMT options and designs
for complementary BRTs, World Bank staff questioned whether a modal shift can be
achieved without instituting both politically difficult policy options (reducing
incentives for automobile purchases, increasing fuel prices, rationalizing bus
services, and aggressively rationing private vehicle traffic in congested areas) and a
substantial further increase in mass transit capacity.

Affordability was a goal championed by the World Bank, but its implementation
may affect financial sustainability, while accessibility has room for improvement.
Only the Salvador Metro is 100 percent accessible, with elevators, and contour
tracking for those with visual impairment. São Paulo also has provision for
accessibility at several stations, but it is not 100 percent across the full system. In Rio
de Janeiro passengers on the suburban rail are predominantly from the lowest
income groups, and their comfort has also been vastly increased with less
overcrowding and gradual upgrade of the cars. The rail projects also supported
linking the train lines with feeder bus routes, and reflected targets to integrate
stations with bus routes, which were met. However, the State Secretariats have

enjoyed less success in rationalizing bus routes to reduce duplication with the train
lines. Supported by the development policy loan (DPL), the Rio de Janeiro
government is seeking to end permission-based awards, eliminate superfluous
routes, competitively tender for new routes, and publish bus operator performance.
A key feature of all three systems is the Bilhete Unico. Although the details vary
among the systems, passengers with a single ticket for a journey may freely transfer
from buses to trains and vice versa. Instituting the arrangement, which was
consistently championed by the World Bank, was challenging because of the
fragmented governance across metropolitan regions. However, the adopted scheme
is different from the approach recommended by the World Bank and is costly, has
created perverse incentives, and could exacerbate the financial sustainability issues.
Taking the transport system as a whole, there are substantial subsidies and potential
financial imbalances in the São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro metropolitan areas. States
have to amortize their up-front investment, and also provide other transport
services.

Broader initiatives integrating transport with land use are increasing but results will
take time. The early projects in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador did include
subcomponents for studies on integrated land-use planning but there does not seem
to have been any explicit use of the studies or follow-up. Also, the fragmented
municipal governance in metropolitan areas complicated coordination efforts, and
broadening projects may have been seen as a wasted effort. In more recent World
Bank operations, including additional finance projects, the Rio de Janeiro Integrated
development project, the GEF STAQ, and the Rio de Janeiro DPL, there has been a
more concerted push to support the development of land-use plans, complementary
multimodal transport projects, and TOD initiatives in line with the World Bank’s
evolving strategic approach. These efforts have long gestation periods; demonstrable
results will take time to emerge.

China Country Case Study
6. Country Context

The Chinese government set up a clear, sustainable urban transport agenda as one of
the national policies governing its urban development master plans. In April 2004,
Premier Wen Jiabao made it clear that “to give priority to urban public transport
development” was the correct approach for the country’s reality. In 2005, the State
Council issued a document endorsing the Ministry of Construction’s opinion on the
priority of urban public transport. In 2006, the Ministry of Construction, the
National Development Reform Committee (NDRC), the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Labor and Social Security issued their Advice on Economic Policy for


                                                                                    85
APPENDIX B
SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
Priority Development of Urban Public Transport, which clearly stated that public
transport is fundamental for a city. Like education and health care, public transport
was understood to be a basic public service provided by government. City
government and bus companies thus had the responsibility to provide inexpensive,
convenient, comfortable, and efficient urban transport (UT) services for people. The
Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011–15) mandated increasing the public transport modal
share to 40 percent for cities with a population over 10 million and aimed at creating
integrated transport systems.

7. World Bank Group’s UT Support

Evolution. The World Bank Group and the government of China have been
increasingly collaborating through UT projects. During the period FY 2007–16, the
World Bank approved or closed 40 urban transport projects in China (USD 5.61
billion in World Bank Group commitments), of which 65 percent were projects
under the Transport GP ($3.48 billion in World Bank Group commitments). Of the
40 projects, 12 were closed and 28 are still active. There were seven nonlending
projects in China, four core and three noncore. There were no IFC and MIGA
projects in China. While UT historically represented only 8 percent of World Bank
lending in the transport sector for China, it is now (2016) 36 percent of the portfolio.
World Bank support has given priority to large cities in the central and eastern
regions. The geographical evolution of the projects has been from the hinterland to
the coastal areas.

The World Bank’s UT engagement in China can be distinctly divided into three
generations. During the early 1090s the World Bank mainly supported construction
of city ring roads, which could be considered as the first-generation model of
engagement in China. Second-generation projects usually involved comprehensive
UT activities including conventional buses, traffic management, traffic police, and
road maintenance. The second generation then evolved to a corridor approach, in
which interventions are concentrated along a transport corridor to enhance visibility
and create a demonstration effect. The third generation is urban rail projects. The
World Bank is currently involved in three of these.

8. Effectiveness

World Bank projects helped improve mobility in Chinese cities, mainly through
increased urban transport infrastructure or services. Improved access was among
the project development objectives in only one project, while six projects had a sub-
objective of improved mobility. The sub-objectives were substantially achieved. For
example, in Wuhan Urban Transport Project (P069852), daily bus ridership increased

                                                                             APPENDIX B
                                                        SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
from a baseline of 2.59 million person trips in 2002 to 4.54 million in 2009, exceeding
the target of 3.9 million by 46 percent. The YouXiao road financed by Guiyang
Transport Project (P093963) provided a high-speed corridor to urban residents in the
Longdongbao area, which was separated from the core urban area by mountains
prior to the project. In Panzhihua [Sichuan Urban Development Project (P083322)],
the construction of 6.7km of Bing-Ren Road helped to link the residential area of
Renhe to the central business district and the recently completed Airport Access
Road to Duren Road (West) in Renhe. The rear section of the road thus opened up a
passage connecting Shizong District and Renhe District and constituted the first
road to the new Huacheng District, which will house 250,000 people. The road is the
main artery to the newly planned Ganbatang.

Various demand management measures contributed to improved mobility and
modal shifting. Quite a few projects introduced traffic management measures, for
example, area traffic control (ATC) systems in a number of cities. A study shows that
the implementation of ATC in Wuhan city area resulted in improvement of traffic
speed by an average of 11 percent, delays at intersections were reduced by 28
percent, and vehicles made 19 percent fewer stops before they passed an
intersection. Overall, the ATC system performed better in newly developed areas at
the urban edge, where vehicular traffic dominates, and less well in the urban center
where there are more pedestrians. ATC systems are performing better in a few
Chinese cities, such as Chongqing, Dalian, Qingdao, and Xiamen. These cities are
mountainous and do not have much bicycle traffic on their streets. Travel demand
management, such as parking management coupled with increased supply of better
UT service, prompted modal shifting from private vehicles to public transport. For
example, in the Uumqi Urban Transport project, public transport mode share as a
percentage of motorized trips increased from 65 percent to 70 percent by project
closure. In the Second Tainjin Urban Development Project, traffic mode sharing for
the bus system increased from 6 percent to 21 percent, exceeding the target of 12
percent. For Fuzhou Nantai Island Peri-Urban Development Project, modal share for
public transport, cycles, and electric cycles increased. However, private auto usage
also increased and walking decreased significantly.

The World Bank rarely got involved in the pricing of urban transport service, and
the affordability issue was taken care of by the government at all levels. In China,
public transport service is viewed as a public good and the price of bus and metro
service is set very low. The low price requires subsidy. Kunming municipal
government currently provides about 400 million RMB (US $58 million) to the metro
management company that manages two metro lines. Guangzhou municipal
government provides about 4.6 billion RMB (US $665 million) subsidy to the public
transport industry in 2015, a 35 percent increase from 2015. This includes a subsidy


                                                                                     87
APPENDIX B
SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
to bus and metro for cost recovery, a subsidy for discounted fares, and a subsidy for
the replacement of conventional buses with electric buses. In China, while
affordability of public UT service is being taken care of, two issues are of specific
concern: the sustainability and the efficiency of the subsidy schemes.

In terms of sustainability, in Kunming, the subsidy is about 0.9 percent of the current
municipal budget and in Guangzhou, the subsidy is about 3 percent of the current
municipal budget. The current subsidy level does not seem to be a heavy municipal
budgetary burden; however, it is projected to will increase along with a projected
ridership increase and when more metro lines are open for operation. Beijing, the
capital city, once implemented a 2 RMB flat rate for the metro service, and
eventually had to increase the metro fare because the subsidy required turned out to
be too expensive for the municipal government.

A second question is whether the subsidy is efficient, that is,targeting the right
people. Although the elderly and disabled persons are covered by discounted or
even free urban transport services, the poor in China are not usually included in
discount schemes because of the difficulty of tracking individual incomes. One
result is that the poor lose access to job opportunities because they cannot afford
transport service.

Consultation and citizen engagement led to a more inclusive design of UT projects.
A 2010 review of gender mainstreaming in the IBRD-financed portfolio found that
consultations with both men and women during project preparation strengthened
project design and improved outcomes. In the Liaoning Medium Cities
Infrastructure Project, the cities consulted socially disadvantaged groups, including
disabled persons who were given the opportunity to test the design of the
accessibility features of bus stops, intersections, and sidewalks. Consequently, the
project has significantly improved traffic convenience for disabled persons and
elderly, through such measures as dedicated seating and disability facilities such as
introduction of tactile strips on sidewalks for the blind.

There is little information on the contribution of UT activities to economic growth
and welfare improvement. Altogether, three projects provided information on this,
however, the achievement could not be solely attributed to World Bank Group
support. In Mianyang, the World Bank was involved in the construction of only a
small section of the connecting road in the economic zone. The project reported a
land value increase in the project area from 230,000 yuan to 3 million yuan per mu (1
hectare = 15 mu). The increased land value did not directly benefit area farmers. But
resettlement (when a rural area is converted to an urban area) helped farmers by
providing better homes and access to schools, hospitals, and job opportunities,

thereby improving their living conditions. The Fuzhou Nantai Island Peri-Urban
Development project had a significant impact on economic growth. The “product
value” of secondary industry in Nantai Island increased from CNY 21 billion to 56
billion.

9. World Bank Group’s Added Value Beyond UT Projects

The World Bank Group is perceived as the leader in the urban transport
development area. Many development partners, for example, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
and the European Investment Bank, among others, are working in UT development
in China. Because the market is huge, there is no competition. At the same time,
there is no formal coordination mechanism and no clear division of labor in the UT
sector in the donor community. The Ministry of Finance has had an annual seminar
with the World Bank, ADB, and other development partners. The World Bank plays
a leadership role in these discussions.

Mobilizing additional resources: The World Bank portfolio has an important
leveraging effect in China. Every US$1 from IBRD mobilized, on average, an
additional US$5 from government and other sources. The leveraging ratio for
operations addressing climate change is even higher at almost US$7 for every US$1
of IBRD financing.

Knowledge and learning: In 2012, the World Bank, in collaboration with the
Ministry of Finance, created a knowledge platform—the Transport Transformation
and Innovation Knowledge Platform (TransFORM)—to improve knowledge sharing
among local governments and transport practitioners. TransFORM’s aim is to help
make transport safer, cleaner, and more affordable in China and to share China’s
experiences with other countries. Under TransFORM, a network of practitioners has
been formed that is promoting innovative transport solutions and disseminating
lessons through media and online tools, workshops, city-to-city exchanges, and
distance learning training programs. The World Bank has had a positive impact both
through individual projects and upstream policy dialogue, contributing to the UT
policymaking agenda. Flagship studies such as “China 2030” and “Urban China,”
jointly authored by the World Bank and the State Council, were highly
acknowledged and appreciated by decision makers, and several recommendations
of the studies were reflected in the nation’s 13th Five-Year Plan. IEG’s mission was
informed that the World Bank “has a seat at the table,” is included in debate and
discussion, is well-respected, and has its views received enthusiastically. The
Chinese government values the World Bank’s contribution. Upstream, the World

Bank helps with policy. With continued dialogue, new regulations for design of city
blocks were introduced recently.

Learning/replication. Chinese cities are competing with each other to provide the
best urban transport options to their residents. In each city visited by the IEG
mission, IEG learned of peer-to-peer learning experiences. Officials from Shanxi,
Kunming, and Wuhan came to Guangzhou to learn about the noise barriers and the
double-glazed windows used in residential buildings along the ring road. Xi’an,
Nanjing, Shijiazhuang, Yichang, Huangshi, Dalian, and Qingdao came to Wuhan to
learn about its traffic management. The Chinese counterparts also appreciate the
technical innovation and hands-on learning from working with World Bank teams
during project design and implementation. Small and medium-sized cities, which do
not have much international exposure, particularly benefit from good project
management practices—procurement, financial management, and social and
environmental safeguard standards supported by World Bank–financed projects.
The good practice of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was also replicated in other
Chinese cities.

Ghana Country Case Study
10. Country Context

Ghana experienced a tripling of urban population between 1984 and 2014, to 14
million. Leading challenges include “slums, lack of basic services, underdeveloped
manufacturing and insufficient transport infrastructure.” (World Bank Urbanization
Review 2014) Productivity is constrained by unbalanced development, weak land
markets, lack of urban planning, and weak urban transportation planning and traffic
management. Poor urban infrastructure also poses a key challenge for exclusion and
service delivery. Cutting across these challenges is weak institutional capacity at all
levels of government but especially locally, where weak capacity and financing of
Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies (MMDAs) is a key gap. Provision
of transport infrastructure has generally been undertaken in response to
development, not in anticipation, resulting in piecemeal and inadequate provision.
Traffic management and planning are absent, and data that could guide transport
planning is rare. Nationally, “the road sector” is the destination of 99 percent of total
transport sector investment.

11. World Bank Group’s Support

The World Bank’s only major investment in urban transport during the evaluation
period was the Ghana Urban Transport Project (GUTP), which focused on the two

largest cities, Accra and Kumasi. Parts of the Kumasi engagement were later
dropped in the restructuring. Accra has experienced rapid, unplanned, extensive
growth and virtually no formal public transit. Instead commuters relied primarily
on minibuses (“trotros”) and taxis. Congestion, poor safety, and long wait and travel
times were among commuting woes.

At the time of appraisal, urban mobility was not a World Bank country priority (the
2004–07 country assistance strategy does not mention urban transport). Indeed,
much of the project preparation was done at the periphery of missions for other
projects or with trust funding. In addition to GEF funding, PPIAF was mobilized to
finance preparatory studies and a stakeholder workshop.

As conceived, the project had five main components, some with sub-components:

    •  Institutional Development ($13.6 million). This component sought to
       strengthen the capacity of national ministries (including Transport, Local
       Government, and, later, Roads and Highways) and agencies concerned with
       UT, transport operators, and local assemblies (MMDAs).
   • Traffic Engineering, Management and Safety ($26.9 million), including
      subcomponents on traffic management, area-wide traffic signal control,
      enforcement of traffic rules and education; and related design and
      supervision work. This component was led by l’Agence Française de
      Développement (AFD).
    • Development of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) System ($46 million), including
       infrastructure implementation in two phases, a program of stakeholder
       engagement and public relations, and overall management and
       operationalization of the BRT.
    • Integration of Urban Development and Transport Planning for Better
       Environment Management ($2 million) including support to the Ministry of
       Local Government and MMDAs to update development plans for Greater
       Accra integrating urban and transport planning, and support to a Strategic
       Environmental Assessment with emphasis on nonmotirized transport
       (NMT) and public transport.
    • Project Outcome Monitoring ($1.5 million) through evaluation of transport
       and social impact indicators, environmental indicators, and capacity
       development indicators.

financing between components, added the Ministry of Local Government as an
implementing agency along with the Department of Urban Roads, and extended the

project by almost two years. A second restructuring in 2015 extended the project to
the end of 2015 and reallocated some uncommitted funds to repairing flood damage.

13. Effectiveness

The Ghana Urban Transport Project (GUTP) sought to create a basis for better
delivery of transport services in Ghana’s two largest cities, Accra and Kumasi,
establishing a pilot BRT in Accra. Although the project achieved important progress
in establishing a regulatory and institutional framework for public transport, and a
model for private delivery of bus services, its identified objectives were largely
unachieved more than a year after closing.

Urban Transport Capacity Building. Key ministries (especially Roads and
Highways, but also Local Government) were paying more attention to urban
transport challenges. A coordinating council (UTAC) appeared to have been
functional throughout the project, and was used to resolve territorial issues between
ministries and agencies and to enhance coordination. Local government capacity to
plan and regulate public transport had a framework and some capacity through the
project through the initial establishment of Urban Public Transport Units within
multiple municipalities in greater Accra and later through their conversion into local
Departments of Transport. By agreement with the unions, these units (later
departments) were able to register trotros. Unfortunately, these nascent
“departments” were poorly funded and understaffed at the time of IEG’s visit,
consisting of one to three professional staff. In addition, the project appeared to have
involved a much higher level of stakeholder consultation than did other public
transport and infrastructure activities.

The establishment of GAPTE—the Greater Accra Public Transit Executive—created
a platform for harmonized regulation of new, formal bus service and a potential
base for future BRT service. GAPTE emerged as an intermediary between individual
MMDAs and the newly formed bus companies, owned by drivers’ unions. It too was
understaffed and underfunded.

Drivers’ unions dropped their initial opposition to BRT and formed companies
that were running buses along a “Quality Bus Service” route and were keenly
interested in expanding.

A solid base of analytic work existed that had identified eight candidate routes for
BRT in Accra and a sustainable business model for private provision of bus services
along future routes. However, there was no clear source of financing to capitalize on
the work.

Donor coordination worked smoothly, according to accounts from officials of AFD
and the World Bank. Overall, although a smaller player, AFD appeared to have
greater flexibility in timing and funding than did the World Bank.

At the same time, during the prolonged project life of GUTP, the project’s
development objectives were not achieved:

No BRT. The originally planned BRT line was abandoned after cost overruns in the
initial phase of construction. After the restructuring in 2012, it was decided to fall
back to a “type B” system of Quality Bus Service (QBS) following a route from the
Central Business District to Amasaman, taking advantage of the capacity of a new
roadway. The QBS did not offer segregated lanes, elevated platforms, or traffic
priority to buses, and therefore could not offer the time savings, safety, and
regularity that are key incentives for passengers to use BRT.

Different Ownership and Business Model for Buses. The project’s original
business model for bus ownership was not realized. In that model, existing
operators and owners of buses (or taxis) would form bus companies, buy buses, and
contract with government to operate those buses along designated routes.
Unexpectedly, the Government in 2015 agreed with the Swedish government for the
Transport Ministry to procure 242 Scania buses with concessional finance. Further, it
was the politically powerful unions that became the owners of bus companies. This
made the unions and their members supportive of BRT. However, it left out owners
of trotros and taxis, creating a situation where new buses compete with trotros on
the same corridor.

Institutional Arrangements: In the original project appraisal document (PAD), it
was envisioned that a Center for Urban Transport would serve as a knowledge
generation and advisory body, providing an institutional platform for monitoring,
evaluation and learning. although parliamentary legislation was passed authorizing
this, government funding never materialized. Under the project, the Center for
Urban Transport was created and staffed with consultants, but no government
funding was ever provided it, and it collapsed in early 2015.

Monitoring and Evaluation of Service Delivery: There was little evident ongoing
data collection. Government had budgeted M&E. Most baseline data were for the
abandoned BRT.

Traffic Management: Traffic management objectives were not achieved. Some
improvements had been made in signaling at key intersections. AFD support was
continuing.

SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
World Bank Work Quality: Design, Oversight and M&E. World Bank staff were
entrepreneurial in a difficult situation. Supervisory staff had to deal with
inconsistent political support and a changing ministry, the failure of the government
to provide the full measure of promised support, and a difficult institutional
environment.

IEG’s case study posed three questions about work quality:

     •   Was the original project design too complex and ambitious?
     •   Given that BRT costs were clearly underestimated, were these costs
         foreseeable?
     •   Should the World Bank have cancelled the project or more radically
         restructured it rather than continuing to finance it and twice restructuring it
         without changing the original development objectives (that includes
         introduction of a BRT)?
     •   Regarding supervision, in spite of evident problems related to a number of
         its identified objectives, since July 2013, progress towards achieving the
         project development objective (PDO) has always been rated “above the line.”

India Country Case Study
14. Country Context

Traditionally a rural country, India has undergone rapid urban growth with a
dramatic rise in urban congestion and pollution. The urban population is expected
to grow from 377 million in 2014 (about 32 percent of population) to 600 million (or
40 percent of its overall population) in 2031. 1 Nearly 100 million urban poor live in
slums without access to basic infrastructure and services. 2 With rapid urbanization
came rapid motorization. The growth of two-wheel vehicle motorization has been
one of the world’s fastest. Although Indian cities have far lower vehicle ownership
rates than their Western peers, in the past 10 years the number of motor vehicles has
more than doubled, contributing to congestion, pollution, more accidents, and
increased fuel consumption.

Indian cities are extremely dense, when compared to Western metropolises, and
urban road length has not caught up with motorization (vehicles have increased by
219 percent in the last decade, roads by only 124 percent). There were an estimated
196 million motorized vehicles in 2016. Nonmotorized means still comprise more
than a third of trips. Public transit has a substantial modal share of motorized transit
in megacities, led by Mumbai. However, only a minority of cities had public
transport systems in 2011. 3 Public transit is generally run by public entities, often

                                                          SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
parastatal organizations, and fares are generally heavily subsidized to encourage
affordability. In many cities, a large informal sector provides motorized services as
well. To make matters worse, most of the major roads and junctions are heavily
encroached and an uncontrolled variety of vehicles ranging carts to trucks clog
limited road space. Urban roads are characterized by poor traffic management, no
lane separation for motorized and nonmotorized transport, and many accidents.
Cities lack formal parking facilities, further contributing to encroachment. Only a
minority of cities had public transport systems in 2011. Public transport accounted
for just 18.1 percent of total trips to work, although its modal share is considerably
higher in megacities of more than five million. 4 The average speed of traffic fell
while the time of the average commute grew. With motorization and congestion,
road accidents grew to more than half a million per year by 2015 (most commonly
pedestrians and bicyclists) and air pollution became a top health risk, contributing to
elevated morbidity and mortality. 5 Meantime, driven partly by motorized transport,
petroleum consumption rose dramatically, from 7 million tons in 1981 to 56 in 2011,
with a negative effect on the balance of payments.

National Strategies. The government’s engagement with UT has been somewhat
limited by the Constitution’s categorization of urban development as a state
responsibility. The 10th five-year (200207) plan emphasized the need for clear
responsibilities and financing for urban transport. The 11th five-year plan “laid stress
on the need to upgrade the quality of urban infrastructure,” with a substantial gap
between plan and implementation. 6 UT is prominent in the 12th Plan (2012–17), with
an emphasis on increased investment in metro rail and bus rapid transit, stronger
urban governance, capacity building, building capacity for long-term strategic
planning, addressing the needs of the urban poor, and raising environmental
sustainability,” [T[he Government’s goal is to increase the share of public transport to at
least 50 percent of all motorized trips…. 7

UT came into much sharper strategic focus with the enactment of the National
Urban Transport Plan (NUTP) in 2006. 8 The NUTP aimed to achieve safe, affordable,
quick, comfortable, reliable, and sustainable access to jobs, education, shopping, and
recreation for urban residents, while addressing the twin menaces of congestion and
pollution. It reflected a desire to refocus urban transport on the mobility needs of
people rather than of private motor vehicles. NUTP works through the states,
providing them with financial and technical support. The 12th five-year plan
formally embraces the goals of NUTP. By 2014, when NUTP was revised, it
recognized UT’s contribution as both a cause and solution of “an urgent need to
conserve energy and land, control pollution and ‘greenhouse gas emissions’, and to
alleviate poverty.” 9 It introduces a “paradigm shift” it calls “avoid, shift and
improve” where avoid means limiting growth in demand, shift means modal

shifting from personal vehicles to other motorized and nonmotorized modes, and
improve refers to use of clean fuels and vehicle technology. It formally embraces
modern practices including: integrating land use and transport planning;
comprehensive mobility planning; Transit-oriented development; and
transportation demand management. 10

There are a number of other strategic and policy documents with elements of Urban
Transport strategy in them. The dominant program for much of the evaluation
period was the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM),
described by the World Bank as “the main vehicle for the Government’s urban
development and reform.” 11 Although JNNURM had urban transport within its
scope, it was focused on modernizing urban capacity rather than on any explicit
transport objectives. Urban transportation investments including roads, highways,
expressways, MRTS, and metro projects were eligible for funding under the mission.
The JNNURM identified 63 cities as eligible for its financing, including seven
megacities.

15. World Bank Group’s Support

World Bank Group Strategy. The World Bank Group has had three country
strategies during the evaluation period. The 2005–08 Country Assistance Strategy
(World Bank 2004) discusses urban transport as a “high risk sub-sector with
fragmented responsibilities, weak fiscal and implementation capacities of local
bodies, and complex safeguard issues.” The World Bank notes that “it is also
potentially high return, especially if an emphasis on management improvements
and traffic engineering helps defer high cost investments in mass transit and
flyovers. Bank lending support will be through pilots incorporated into operations
to support broader municipal reforms.”

The Country Strategy for the Republic of India FY2009–12, established “rules of
engagement” for UT in an annex that included support for a) the implementation of
the NUTP, with priority on NMT and public transport; b) cities developing mobility
plans with stakeholder consultation and interagency coordination for planning,
programming, and regulating or managing urban mobility; and c) projects and
components where fiscal sustainability is ensured.

The Country Partnership Strategy for India for 201317 includes “improved urban
transport services” under an inclusion pillar. Its specific indicator is increasing the
modal share of public transport “in targeted cities” from 4 percent in 2010 to
8percent in 2017. Although the CPS discussion of IFC activity is rather vague as to
specific projects, it is clearly supportive of “building infrastructure and assisting

                                                                             APPENDIX B
                                                        SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
public-private partnerships.” 12 IFC’s only identified UT activity in India during the
period was a PPP advisory in Chennai that was to provide operation and
maintenance of two lines of the Metro system. In the end, Chennai Metro abandoned
the PPP in favor of a more traditional arrangement, using the pricing information
from the bids as guidance for its budgeting.

Major UT Projects. Over the evaluation period, IEG identified a core World Bank
Group UT portfolio of one IFC advisory project, three core World Bank lending
projects, and two GEF grants, accounting for US$ 1.11 billion in financing and
expenditure (table 1). In addition, there were four noncore AAA projects with
significant UT components and six noncore UT lending projects, accounting overall
for $1.6 billion in financing and expenditure (most of it not on UT). Though the core
UT projects had a heavy focus on public transit rail and bus systems and traffic
management, the noncore projects mostly financed urban road construction and
rehabilitation as part of broader programs to build urban infrastructure and
institutional capacity.

Core projects were of two types:

    •   Multicomponent UT projects involving a large investment and complex
        issues. Such projects involve a major capital investment in a single large city
        and an effort to coordinate and integrate planning and management for a
        variety of transport services for a city.
    •   Institution building and demonstration projects, seeking to build national,
        state and local capacity and fund projects in secondary cities that
        demonstrate innovative UT approaches.

Noncore projects were more likely to support road or road-related infrastructure
construction or buses, mainly in support of broader urban capacity-building
objectives.

16. Effectiveness

Mumbai Urban Transport Project. The first MUTP project, valued at $542 million,
ultimately mobilized more than $70 million in government co-financing. It had a
large component to improve the suburban rail system, which formed the most
important transport artery of India’s largest city. It has a smaller component for road
improvement, traffic management, and conventional buses, and a separate
resettlement and rehabilitation component. It achieved vital capital and quality
improvements to the urban rail system that expanded its capacity in the face of
rapid demand growth. It also helped establish and build capacity of a dedicated
agency, Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC), to plan, develop, and


                                                                                      97

SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
coordinate rail transport infrastructure and services, and promoted institutional
strengthening at the state and metropolitan levels. It also contributed to the capacity
of the paramount municipal planning agency, the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional
Development Agency (MMRDA). There were no specific/direct demand
management measures initiated, but it maintained the modal share of public
transport at about 80 percent of motorized trips. The project helped to induce
needed focus and the direction to the progress of urban transport in Mumbai. In
addition to identification of prioritized transport infrastructure gaps to fill, the
project brought in modern insights, expert domain knowledge, and necessary
perspective on institution strengthening. It also introduced an effective organization,
MRVC, into urban rail transit. The project was overly optimistic about both time and
cost, and underestimated the complexity of resettlement, resulting in an Inspection
Panel intervention. Efforts to better interconnect bus and rail services failed, as did
intentions to improve bus travel time. The client greatly valued the knowledge
capital created through the World Bank’s assistance and the discipline and
transparency it brought to the various institutional processes such as procurement,
financial management and resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R).

MUTP 2A, a follow-up project in 2010, focused a $344 million loan on the suburban
rail system for further quality, safety, and capacity improvements, improved
maintenance capacity, and a dramatic improvement in energy efficiency. The project
also sought to improve oversight capacity of MRVC and Indian Railways, the
relevant national body. Although it achieved most of its objectives, it both
underestimated demand growth and the time and resource requirements. With a
third MUTP envisioned, overall the engagement shows an effective programmatic
approach.

Sustainable Urban Transport Project (SUTP). To support the new UT Policy, the
World Bank in 2010 launched the $105 million SUTP, “to promote environmentally
sustainable urban transport in India and to improve the usage of environment-
friendly transport modes through demonstration projects in selected cities.” The
project sought to encourage public transport in Indian cities (especially BRT),
demonstrate use of advanced IT applications; encourage smarter, safer, and better-
coordinated transport networks, and encourage and improve the safety of
nonmotorized transport, while building the capacity of government to support and
implement the national UT policy. SUTP has two components:

With co-financing from GEF and United Nations Development Program, the first
component provides technical assistance to the Ministry of Urban Development to
improve the national, state, and local capacity to implement the capacity-building

elements and the public and nonmotorized transport–related aspects of National
Urban Transport Policy (GEF funded and World Bank–managed.

    •   The second component (also co-financed) supports the design and
        implementation of demonstration projects in six selected cities (in five
        participating states), to create models of sustainable transport solutions for
        other Indian cities to replicate. This included three BRT systems, two
        Intelligent Transport Systems, and one public bike-sharing scheme.

IEG met officials of four subcomponents and made three site visits, concluding that
the overall design of the project was highly consistent with the NUTP and the
project was achieving many of its objectives (including demonstration effect and
capacity building), but it was also quite complex, with inadequate resources for
supervision, and had been overly optimistic in its estimated completion time.

Karnataka Municipal Reform is a 2006 $216 million project exemplifying a
statewide urban project with a $34 million road component for the city of Bangalore.
Although the project was modestly successful overall, it was overly complex and the
road component was weakly coordinated with the Transport GP. In fact, the road
component related neither to the NUTP nor to the other project objectives of
building fiscal management and service delivery capacity among local municipal
agencies and governments.

17. World Bank Group’s Contribution

World Bank Group has contributed substantially to India’s UT through major
improvement of its largest UT system (Mumbai suburban rail), through the
strengthening of national institutional capacity, and through important
demonstration projects. As a financially small player in the face of an immense
program of capital investment, the World Bank has had to be selective and has not
been engaged in most of the investments in the country. Nevertheless, it has had a
disproportionate influence, especially in promoting public transit, awareness, and
capacity building, and, to some extent, more integrated UT planning. Subprojects in
secondary cities appear to be having a significant demonstration effect for BRT and
intelligent transport (integrated public transit information) systems. Major program
vulnerabilities have included:

Excessive complexity of project design (in MUTP and SUTP) led to difficult
supervision, coordination problems, and lagging components.

SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
      •   Underestimation of project time, resulting in restructuring and late
          implementation. Specific issues include optimism regarding the pace of land
          acquisition, resettlement, and procurement.
      •   Inconsistent attention and approach to issues of access for disadvantaged
          groups, including women, the extremely poor, and, especially, disabled
          persons; as part of broader inconsistencies and weakness in M&E of system
          service delivery and benefits.
      •   Lack of, or limited, political assessment, often leading to endorsement of
          project elements with weak or absent political support, such as the SATIS
          component of MUTP and the Pune subproject in SUTP.
      •   Inadequate attention to fare and subsidy structure, with weak
          implementation of fare structure and system reforms.
      •   Weak coordination of the Urban (SURR) GP with the Transport GP in the
          domain of UT, evidenced by urban projects with UT investments only in
          roads.
      •   Other issues concerned lack of consistent attention to demand management
          (particularly to constrain rapid growth of personal motorized transport) and,
          in the case of MUTP, underestimation of demand.

IFC has had little apparent impact on UT in India, in spite of a well-executed but
ultimately unsuccessful transaction advisory project for Chennai Metro on an
operations and maintenance (O&M) PPP. The advisory was judged beneficial to
Chennai, but did not achieve a PPP transaction and thus had no market-building
benefit for future PPPs.

Because a major share of India’s urban transport budget is focusing on heavy rail
systems (Metro), the World Bank Group must ask itself where its comparative
advantage will beand how it can have the greatest impact on overall sectoral policy,
institutional capacity, and delivery of services. Pipeline projects in metro systems
raise questions as to whether there will be sufficient future resources for support of
other types of UT and integrating sectoral policy, regulation, investment and O&M.

Turkey Country Case Study

18. Country Context

Turkey is an upper middle-income country and the 16th largest economy in the
world. It has a population of more than 75 million people. Turkey experienced the
world’s second-fastest pace of urban growth between the 1950s and the 1980s. With
the rapid rise of income level, Turkey experienced a dramatic increase in car
ownership. Today, road traffic volumes have reached a level where traffic

                                                         SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
congestion is a serious problem in many cities. There is strong public support for
investing in mass transport systems in Turkey. There has been heavy reliance on
market forces in urban transport services -- dolmus (minibus) and taxi have been
two common UT mechanisms. The emphasis of the latest urban transport policies of
metropolitan municipalities has been to transfer from private vehicles to public
transit systems and to NMT modes like walking and cycling.

Metropolitan municipalities are responsible for UT provision and planning. During
the past two decades, Turkey has rapidly decentralized and devolved authority
from national to local administrations. Many central government responsibilities
were moved to municipalities beginning in the 1980s and further advanced in 2012.
Most of the municipalities have had difficulty coping with the increased
responsibilities and rapid urbanization.

In Turkey, multiple agencies are involved in UT development. Different plans are
produced, each with their own prioritized investments. Plans are often not costed,
and planned investments are also rarely linked to an assessment of the municipal
finances. Spatial plans often do not integrate transport planning principles and
environmental dimensions except in a couple of municipalities such as Istanbul
metropolitan municipality. Another common issue raised by public officials is that,
in reality, proposed transport systems (for example, light rail) may not be justified
by a realistic assessment of ridership, or that proposed UT is not cost effective. Many
secondary cities apply to build light rail systems cities because mayors find this type
of system appealing. There is an increasing demand for light rail without regard to
its cost effectiveness.

At the national level, in theory, the institutional setting for UT involves collaboration
between national and municipal governments. However, IEG interviews indicate
that different government agencies tackle different aspects of urbanization and
transportation without sufficient integration of responsibilities or coordinated
oversight. Interviews indicated that the government has the necessary laws and
rules to monitor plans but implementation is ineffective. As discussed in a recent
World Bank report, the link between national policies and local practices is weak,
creating challenges in UT planning, financing, and sustainable provision.

The central government is less likely to get involved in UT projects if the project
does not require government or international financing. If a municipality requests
financing for its transport projects, the evaluation and approval process are
classified into two types by project financing method: foreign credit or national
budget. In the case of foreign credit, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of
Development, and, finally, Treasury needs to approve the project. If the project is

SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES
financed by the national budget, the Ministry of Transportation drives the approval
process. For municipalities, Iller Bank (Bank of Municipalities) is the main source of
financing. However, the Iller Bank has not provided many urban transport loans to
municipalities so far. The World Bank has traditionally focused on providing loans
for projects mainly for drinking water, waste water, solid waste, etc.

19. World Bank Group’s Support

Overall, the World Bank Group country partnership strategies focused on
sustainable cities, specifically municipality reform, municipality financing, and
improved local service delivery. Among these topics, UT was not a specific focus.
During the period under review, there was only one formal World Bank activity
relevant to UT: the Turkey Urbanization Review: Rise of the Anatolian Tigers
presents Turkey’s urbanization experience and provides guidance on priority policy
issues, including city competitiveness, housing markets, urban transport, municipal
finance, and interagency cooperation. Although the World Bank did not have any
UT projects during the period, World Bank staff were in touch with municipalities.
The financing was mainly provided by IFC and MIGA. IFC’s and MIGA’s
investment in the Istanbul Metro was the first World Bank Group financing in
Turkey at a sub-national level without a sovereign guarantee. In Istanbul, the
projects aim to improve urban mobility and reduced travel times and traffic, thereby
contributing to urban productivity and private sector–led growth. Furthermore, the
ultimate objective is to reduce dependence on roads and motorways, thereby
reducing pollution and helping make Istanbul a more attractive location for
residents and business. Besides Istanbul Metro, MIGA supported Izmir’s marine
transport project and tramway and IFC complemented this with a traffic
management project and a rail car and tramway project. In Istanbul, IFC and MIGA
projects are under implementation. Financial and operational performance of the
Metro in Istanbul is generally good, comparable with advanced UT markets in the
world. In Izmir, IFC and MIGA projects are under implementation as well.

IFC and the World Bank established an understanding on how to support UT in
Turkey based on a market segmentation: IFC would focus on first-tier cities (big and
creditworthy cities) and the World Bank would focus on second-tier cities. Beyond
this, coordination among the two institutions seems to be formal. During the review
period this arrangement worked, however, the World Bank Group needs to have a
more comprehensive strategy and have better internal communication going
forward. Other IFIs who have also invested in the metro or light rail projects
indicated that they collaborate with IFC, and the relationship has been generally
good.

                                                         SUMMARY OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES

20. Effectiveness/Work Quality

IFC and MIGA contributed mostly through financing. IFC used its subnational
finance product. During the review period, IFC and MIGA supported UT in two of
the biggest cities, Istanbul and Izmir, focusing on metro and light rail. IFC was not
involved in the feasibility studies of the projects, given that the projects are put out
for international tender only after the government approves their technical and
financial feasibility. From an economic and social (E&S) perspective, IFC followed
its usual requirements, and other commercial lenders, including MIGA, relied on
IFC’s E&S work. Lenders acknowledged and appreciated IFC’s E&S standards,
whereas the municipalities did not consider this aspect as IFC’s special contribution
to the projects. The World Bank struggled to support UT through a lending project
during the period. The World Bank team consistently kept in touch with Iller Bank
and secondary cities in Turkey, but was not able to produce a UT lending project.
Interviews indicate that the World Bank struggled to support urban transport in
Turkey mainly because of its business model. The World Bank cannot directly
support municipalities (requiring a sovereign guarantee). Its projects require a
central government approval and the Treasury had higher priorities.

The World Bank Group will need to have a more comprehensive strategy and better
internal communication. First, the World Bank has just approved the Sustainable
Cities project, which includes Urban GP and Transport GP staff. This requires
effective communication and coordination arrangements among the GP staff, given
that the project is led by Urban GP but has a transport component. Second, IEG’s
interviews indicate that IFC recently has also been looking for opportunities in
secondary cities. To avoid stepping on each other’s toes, the teams should work in
close coordination. Lastly, there is a high appetite by IFIs to invest in UT in Turkey.
Close coordination and a common strategy will likely increase the World Bank
Group’s comparative advantage.

21. Enhancing World Bank Group’s Contribution

The World Bank Group can improve its additionality in the country, if it can support
central and municipal capacities, capacities related to urban transport planning,
provision, policy and guidance, especially in secondary cities. There is a strong need
to increase urban transport in Turkey, not only in the big cities but also in secondary
cities. However, a majority of cities struggle to produce urban master plans and their
capacity to decide on suitable modes of public transport is weak. At the national
level, the World Bank Group can support ministries (Environment and
Urbanization). For example, it is important that land use and master transport plans
be integrated, but there is no guidance from Central Government.

Appendix C. Project Performance Assessment
Reports Related to Urban Transport
Argentina Buenos Aires Urban Transport Project
The project was approved in 1997 and included an IBRD Loan of US$200 million and
additional financing for a further US$100 million which were fully disbursed. The
project was extended from 2003 to 2011 because of the 2001 economic and financial
crisis in Argentina, delays in implementation, and project restructuring with a scale-
up of investments.

When the project was appraised, Argentina was embarking on a large-scale
privatization of infrastructure. The poor state of infrastructure, large operating
deficits, and significant investment needs motivated the privatization of the
Argentinian railway system, including the Buenos Aires subway and suburban rail.
The project’s objectives were to support joint private sector-public sector initiatives
to improve the service quality and coverage of mass transit in metropolitan Buenos
Aires; support the implementation of the infrastructure improvement obligations
assumed by private concessionaires regarding the metropolitan Buenos Aires
passenger rail system; assist in improving traffic safety and urban transport(UT)–
related environmental quality in metropolitan Buenos Aires; contribute toward the
development of an integrated UT (road and rail) system for metropolitan Buenos
Aires, and assist in developing integrated urban transport strategies in the
metropolitan areas in Argentina, including Cordoba, Mendoza, Posadas, Rosario,
Tucuman.

Implementation was affected by the Argentina’s economic crisis in 2001. In 2002, the
Government imposed a freeze on public transport fares to keep them affordable.
Public transport subsidies increased steadily, making it politically difficult to
increase fares. Despite these large subsidies, the railway system deteriorated, the
result of many years of low investment and poor maintenance. In 2012, a suburban
rail line train crash, known as the Once tragedy, killed 51 people and injured more
than 700 in Buenos Aires. A decade of underinvestment and poor maintenance were
blamed, and allegations of corrupt practices in transport surfaced in the Argentine
media, including World Bank–financed contracts under the project. The government
took action prioritizing fleet renewal and maintenance of urban rail services,
reorganizing the transport sector, and dismantling the transport subsidy system.
Subway fares doubled from 2012 to 2014, but a social tariff was maintained for
certain categories of users (retirees and disabled persons). A new administration in

APPENDIX C
PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS RELATED TO URBAN TRANSPORT
2015 moved the metropolitan coordination agenda forward. The Metropolitan
Transport Agency (MTA) is an interjurisdictional body which coordinates and plans
transport policies and infrastructure in metropolitan Buenos Aires; it comprises the
national government, the provincial government, and the City of Buenos Aires.

IEG found the project objectives to be substantially relevant to the Government’s
development priorities and to the World Bank’s country strategies. Project design
reflected a comprehensive approach and was substantially consistent with the stated
objectives. The project provided financial support for the implementation, through
private sector participation, of the rehabilitation of the Buenos Aires subway and
suburban rail with the objective of improving the service quality and coverage.
Results were mixed, however; this objective is only modestly achieved. Substantial
results were achieved in improving traffic safety after construction of grade-
separated crossings at the suburban rail and road intersections. The project also
substantially contributed to improving the integrated UT system for Greater Buenos
Aires, through physical investments and institutional strengthening activities.
Results were substantially achieved in supporting the development of integrated UT
strategies in other metropolitan areas: Cordoba, Mendoza, Posadas, Rosario,
Tucuman. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the achievement of the
objective to improve urban transport-related environmental quality in metropolitan
Buenos Aires is assessed as negligible. Efficiency is rated “modest,” given the
significant time and cost overruns, which were partially to the effect of
administrative and operational inefficiencies. The overall outcome rating assigned to
the project is Moderately Satisfactory. The risk to development outcome is
significant: despite repeated increases in subway fares, additional funding is still
required to ensure the maintenance and operations of the Buenos Aires subway
system, and to finance capital investments. The institutional coordination for
transport planning has advanced at the metropolitan level of Buenos Aires;
however, its future sustainability is uncertain and needs to be addressed.

China Second Tianjin Urban Development and Environment Project
The China Second Tianjin Urban Development and Environment Project (Tianjin-II),
approved in 2003 in the amount of US$150 millionwas one of 65 urban development
projects approved by the World Bank during 2003–13 with commitments of US$7.3
billion in China.

The objective of Tianjin-II was to assist Tianjin in sustainably enhancing the
efficiency and equity of wastewater management and transportation systemsThe
project tackled the wastewater and transport sectors, focusing on improving
efficiency, expanding the service coverage, and benefiting low-income groups.

                                                                             APPENDIX C
                     PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS RELATED TO URBAN TRANSPORT
However, some activities turned out to be infeasible or less relevant at
implementation because of the changing local environment; these ended up being
either cancelled or replaced with lower-cost activities.

Project implementation was challenging. The effective date was delayed,
disbursements were slow, and two restructurings were required. Two one-year
extensions were needed to fully disburse the loan. That said, the project delivered
soundly built and well-finished components. The infrastructures built under the
project are also well-maintained. Project activities increased the wastewater service
area and supported the Yingcheng Wastewater Treatment Plant, the first plant in
China using the design-build-operate method. The Dagu Canal cleanup increased
hydraulic capacity of the canal to carry increased discharges of treated effluent and
storm water, which also improved the environment and prompted development
along the canal. Urban road works on Tianjin Middle Ring Road improved the
function of the ring road and improved the efficiency of the transport system by
helping alleviate congestion along the western, southern, and northeastern sections.

The technical assistance component supported under the project targeted
improvements in institutions, policy, and financing of the wastewater and transport
sectors, with potential for making larger impact at the city level. The project carried
out a study on the wastewater sector, and recommendations were implemented by
the Tianjin Municipal Government. Another study for the transport sector helped
establish a model to evaluate trip demand by route and a system to allocate and
manage bus routes on that basis. This contributed to an improved bus deployment
system and helped promote public transport.

The objective did not define the concepts of efficiency and equity. Nevertheless, IEG
found the project development objective to be relevant to China’s national goals and
to the World Bank’s partnership strategy. The design and implementation M&E
were defective. It led, for example, to the unconvincing claim that the increased
modal use of buses in the megacity from a 6 percent baseline of all trips to 21 percent
at completion was the result of a project that invested US$7.1 million in the bus
system. The equity aspect of wastewater management was not included in the
results framework, and it is unclear why more indicators were not measured.

It is evident that the project’s physical investments contributed to the enhanced
efficiency of wastewater and transport systems in the project areas in downtown
Tianjin and Binhai New District. The project’s contribution to the equity of these two
systems, however, was quite limited because most of its investments were in the
wealthier downtown, and there was limited investment in bus transport. It is also
difficult to make a direct linkage between the project investments and the


                                                                                    107
APPENDIX C
PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS RELATED TO URBAN TRANSPORT
improvements in the entire wastewater and transport sectors in Tianjin, because the
scale of the physical investments supported under the project was “supplemental”
and “corrective” when compared with the massive wastewater and transport
network in the city.

The economic analysis of the project roads investment shows that the investments
were worthwhile. The risk to development outcome is rated Low. Works in Tianjin
were completed to a high standard with ongoing operations and maintenance.
However, the residential and commercial development prompted by the Dagu
Canal cleanup will generate new sources of pollution, and extensive mitigation and
control measures are being implemented to sustain the successful environmental
cleanup of the canal.

World Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The unclear objective and
weak M&E and results framework reflect initial weaknesses. World Bank
performance during implementation was stronger and benefited from the timely
oversight of the World Bank’s Beijing Office. The World Bank’s teamwork was
viewed by the Borrower as “responsive” and “supportive.” Overall Borrower
Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Support by the central government in
Beijing was strong and consistent, but project preparation by the Tianjin Municipal
Government could have been more thorough. The municipal government did a
good job during implementation, using its own funds to finance a few activities
cancelled from the project and putting in place maintenance schemes for
infrastructure. As implementing agencies, the project management office (PMO) and
local departments completed assigned tasks knowledgeably and effectively.

In spite of a high return on project investment in urban roads, the overall outcome of
the project is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, because of the limited evidence of
enhanced equity and affordability of sewerage, limited evidence of contribution on
modal shifting to buses, lack of economic analysis for the project investment on
wastewater management; and lack of evidence on project efficiency.

China Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement Project
The China Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement Project (Chongqing
Small Cities) in the amount of US$180 million approved in 2005. Its objective is to
help emerging small cities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
infrastructure service delivery, so that they can accommodate rapid urban growth.

As in the case of the Tianjin-II project, there was no clear definition of “efficiency”
and “effectiveness” in the Project Appraisal Document; However, by focusing on

                                                                             APPENDIX C
                     PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS RELATED TO URBAN TRANSPORT
infrastructure improvements in the secondary cities in Chongqing, the project
objectives were relevant to the World Bank’s Partnership Strategy and the priorities
of the Chinese government. Both called for an environmentally sustainable
development process and for addressing the needs (infrastructure services being one
of them) of the poorer and disadvantaged people and regions. Project design was
aligned with the development objectives. The project focused on water supply, flood
protection, road improvement, and environmental sanitation. The 10 secondary
cities involved in the project were all fast-urbanizing areas.

Project implementation started well. Up to the project midterm review in 2010,
actual disbursements lagged only about three months behind those planned, a
notable achievement for local implementing agencies with no previous World Bank
experience. Disbursements slowed somewhat after the midterm review, but picked
up later so that the loan was almost 100 percent disbursed by the original closing
date of June 2012.

The project provided needed infrastructure services in the project areas, increased
the infrastructure service coverage to accommodate the growing population in the
cities and, in some cases, prompted local economic development. An impressive
example is the flood protection activity in RongChang County, which was
completed with high standard, was well-maintained, and has transformed the area
into a more developed commercial and residential center. Similar flood protection
works in other secondary cities in Chongqing are under preparation.

Though completed as planned, some of the project investments did not produce
high standard infrastructure pieces. In contrast to the Tianjin-II project, where the
infrastructure is well-maintained, under the Chongqing Small Cities project,
insufficient maintenance of the project infrastructure seems to be common, thus
posing risks to the sustainability of the project development outcome. The risk to
development outcome is rated Significant.

World Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The World Bank team
worked closely with Chongqing secondary cities in delivering the planned activities
on time, but it could have done a better job in defining a clearer project development
objective. Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Borrower
could have improved the sustainability of the project development outcome by
setting up a better maintenance arrangement. The overall outcome of the project is
rated Moderately Satisfactory.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS RELATED TO URBAN TRANSPORT

Indonesia Second Urban Poverty Project and Third Urban Poverty Project
IEG prepared a PPAR for the Second and Third Urban Poverty Projects (UPP2 and
UPP3) in Indonesia. These community-driven development (CDD) projects were
included in the noncore Urban Transport portfolio because the “improved services
for the urban poor” objective included, inter alia, investments in village roads and
bridges.

UPP2 was an expansion of the first Urban Poverty Project (UPP1), focused on
alleviating urban poverty and fostering greater involvement of the urban poor in
decision making. UPP2 had three development objectives. First, to establish (or
further support) representative and accountable community organizations to
provide services for the urban poor and increase their voice in public decision
making. Second, to make local government more responsive to the needs of the poor
through increased cooperation with community organizations. Third, to improve
financial and social services, especially infrastructure, for the urban poor. Co-
financing from the local governments’ own budgets enabled considerable leverage
of the World Bank’s contribution. UPP3 was implemented in parallel to UPP2 and
was a further geographical expansion to the remainder of the country, with similar
objectives. The project was to cover additional urban neighborhoods in 15 provinces
and, in addition, provided institutional assistance and grants to further strengthen
community organizations supported in the UPP1 and UPP2 areas.

Together, these three UPP operations, using combined IBRD/IDA financing of
US$473 million and government financing of US$ 345 million, resulted in a
significant investment in Indonesia’s urban community development. Since the
project closed, IBRD has committed another US$708 million to further strengthen the
program, and this work-in-progress will bring the World Bank’s cumulative
investment to more than US$1 billion, $ making the program one of the largest
poverty reduction initiatives in the world.

Virtually all supported districts completed community development plans with
projects prioritized by the communities. Boards of Trustees were democratically
elected and over a fifth of those elected were women. Links between communities
and local government were strengthened, resulting in additional and sustainable
local funding. A strong and transparent management information system (MIS) was
established. There were some shortcomings: insufficient evidence of project
efficiency, inadequate maintenance arrangements, and sketchy evidence of
improvements to the voice of the poor. Some areas where improvements can still be
made are in the role of women in civic affairs, better ways to create jobs, and
microlending and small business opportunities. The overall development outcome

                     PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS RELATED TO URBAN TRANSPORT
of both projects was rated moderately satisfactory. Risk to development outcome
was negligible to low. World Bank and Borrower performance were rated
moderately satisfactory.

The M&E system, of necessity, had to be extensive to cover the widespread
geographical locations of the beneficiaries and the large volume of data to be
collected. Because of this complexity, the system only became functional in mid-
2005, and did not start to generate values for most performance indicators until
more than three years after project effectiveness. Nevertheless, by closure the MIS
website was fully operational and provided ready access to program information. In
the end the system helped to identify and remedy issues of service quality,
incorporate better controls, fine-tune and target resources where they were most
needed, and improve transparency and strengthen public confidence in the
program.

India Mumbai Urban Transport Project
An IBRD loan of US$463 million and an IDA credit of US$79 million were approved
in 2002, with a borrower’s contribution of US$482 million. At appraisal, the total
project cost was estimated at US$945 million, while the final cost was US$1.128
billion. The project was extended from 2008 to 2011. US$92.7 million was cancelled
from the loan for activities not completed by closure and US$9.5 million from the
credit because of savings that accrued.

The Mumbai Metropolitan Region is one of the world’s largest urban areas and is
the major commercial center in India. At project appraisal, suburban rail services
were carrying more passengers than capacity, resulting in extremely overloaded
trains. The project development objectives were to facilitate urban economic growth
and improve the quality of life by fostering the development of an efficient and
sustainable transport system, including effective institutions, to meet users’ needs in
the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. There were three components: first, to improve
capacity and performance of the suburban rail system through service efficiency
improvements, procurement of rolling stock, and expansion of network capacity.
Second, to optimize the functioning of traffic signals, pedestrian facilities, traffic
improvement schemes, and parking controls, and to increase road network
functionality by improving two east-west link roads and eliminating the main road-
level railway track crossings. The bus system was to be improved through support
for organizational reforms, efficiency measures, and procurement of environment-
and user-friendly buses. The third component involved the relocation of more than
100,000 people affected by the project. At the time, this was the largest World Bank
urban resettlement project.


                                                                                    111
APPENDIX C
PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS RELATED TO URBAN TRANSPORT
The resettlement process encountered difficulties following complaints by project-
affected persons to the World Bank Inspection Panel in 2004; management
suspended disbursements of the road and resettlement and rehabilitation
components in March 2006. Disbursements were resumed in June 2006 after the
Board of Executive Directors accepted a 10-point action plan. By project closure,
virtually all households and 98 percent of the affected shopkeepers were
successfully relocated and a grievance redress mechanism handled more than 4,600
cases. This resulted in the end in a better project after management intervention and
considerable learning. World Bank procedures for resettlement and rehabilitation
are now being used in the Mumbai region for all subsequent infrastructure projects
involving relocations, whether funded by the World Bank or not.

Regarding the transport improvements, the average peak-hour rail passenger load
per train was reduced but fell short of the target because better services increased
demand mATC systems, thus reducing delays and improving traffic flows. In
addition, 644 low-emission, user-friendly buses were purchased. Only one of two
east-west roads was completed, because of protracted negotiations with project-
affected people, and was completed six years after the original completion date
using borrower funds. Some contracts were cancelled, including most pedestrian
crossings, because of reduced funding availability due to exchange rate fluctuations,
while the supply of 108 bogie assemblies for electric multiple-unit coaches had to be
deferred to the follow-on project. A significant achievement was development of a
Resettlement Division within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development
Authority for management of resettlement implementation. The authority, on the
other hand, did not succeed in persuading other stakeholders to establish a Road
User Charging Policy, but the government and stakeholders continue to discuss a
draft policy. This said, both the suburban rail and bus fares have been revised
upwards to levels agreed with the World Bank, but there does not yet appear to be
significant political support for radical reforms, such as congestion pricing, land use
reform, and parking restrictions. Meanwhile, air quality is deteriorating, in part
because of the rapidly increasing number of vehicles.

The outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. Objectives were mostly achieved,
albeit with moderate shortcomings. The risk-to-development outcome is rated
moderate because although a World Bank follow-on project is ensuring continuity
on the rail side and institutional capacity continues to be strengthened, the
authorities still need to agree on a comprehensive plan to restrain traffic in the
central area through policy reforms. Adequate attention continues to be given to
maintenance issues. Both World Bank and borrower performance are moderately
satisfactory. Shortcomings in achievements were largely the result of an
underestimation of the complexity of the project and of the time it would take for

                      PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS RELATED TO URBAN TRANSPORT
the resettlement component and the procurement function. The Mumbai
Metropolitan Region Development Authority initially had limited capacity, but was
strengthened considerably during the course of the project. There was no question
as to the level of commitment of all parties to the project.

Morocco Urban Transport Sector Development Policy Loan
This loan for €100 million ($136.7 million equivalent) was originally expected to be
the first of two loans in a DPL series. It was appraised in 2010 and closed in 2011.
The loan was fully disbursed in a single tranche upon effectiveness, thus giving it a
5-month implementation period. The second DPL did not proceed. Instead, a
Program-for-Results operation for an Urban Transport Program in the amount of
US$200 million was approved in 2015.

Rapid urbanization has imposed considerable pressure on Morocco’s urban
transport systems. Public urban transport remains inadequate, deficient in quality,
and functionally disorganized, particularly in terms of bus-tramway integration in
Rabat and Casablanca. Intermodal transport is inefficient, because operators see
themselves in competitive rather than complementary roles. Traffic accidents and
inadequate access to public transport have disproportionately affected the poor,
women, and persons with limited mobility. Morocco’s urban mobility issues are
partly the result of significant underinvestment in the sector. The lack of financial
sustainability has hindered the participation of new private operators, while current
ones have been unable to renew their fleet or expand services to meet rapidly
growing demand. Despite significant improvements, the capacity to manage the
urban transport sector still requires further strengthening, particularly at the level of
municipal authorities and their agglomerations.

The Morocco-Urban Transport Sector DPL had three specific objectives: (i) to
improve the governance of the urban transport sector, (ii) to increase the efficiency
and supply of services and infrastructure, and (iii) to improve environmental and
social sustainability of the sector. The government agreed to implement 10 Prior
Actions whose outcomes would contribute to the long-term goal of improving the
efficiency of urban transport in large cities, ultimately promoting economic growth,
social development, and quality of life in a sustainable way for urban citizens.

The relevance of the DPL’s objectives was substantial. The selection of its objectives
was based on a thorough analysis of the macroeconomic context and necessary
sector reforms, which helped to define the highest priority interventions for the
DPL. The three policy reform areas addressed were also well aligned with the
country strategy and the main sector priorities of the government. The relevance of



                                                                                      113
APPENDIX C
PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS RELATED TO URBAN TRANSPORT
the DPL’s design was modest. The DPL benefitted significantly from several years of
prior analytical and advisory work by the World Bank. Prior Actions built directly
upon the government’s own priorities and were causally well-linked to the targeted
outcomes, and were also critically needed to accelerate policy and institutional
strengthening measures, raise the profile of key issues, coalesce stakeholders, set
timelines, and monitor results. However, the additionality of the Prior Actions, and
the attribution of outcomes to the World Bank’s intervention, are not fully clear.
Many had already been identified and initiated by the government before the DPL’s
approval, which leads to questions related to the counterfactual. In the absence of
the DPL, would the reforms have proceeded anyway? If so, how significant is the
value-added of the DPL, apart from budget financing? Finally, the choice of using
solely the DPL instrument, without much-needed investment project financing or
technical assistance, detracted from the full achievement of a number of outcomes.

Achievement of the first and third objectives—to improve the governance of the
sector, and to improve environmental and social sector sustainability—was
substantial. However, achievement of the second objective—to increase the
performance and supply of urban transport services and infrastructure—was only
modest, mainly owing to the slow progress in addressing operational inefficiencies
and lack of financial sustainability of public transport in the urban agglomerations
of Greater Casablanca and Rabat-Salé-Témara. Taking into account the high
relevance of objectives and the modest relevance of design, the DPL’s overall
outcome is moderately satisfactory. Risks to development outcome are moderate.
Although the Ministry of Interior and its Division for Urban Mobility and Transport
have been playing a sector coordinating role and are supporting local entities with
increasing effectiveness, financial sustainability remains an important issue.

World Bank performance was moderately satisfactory. Although there were
weaknesses in project design, the World Bank has played a high-value role in
helping to formulate a strategy and improve the policy framework for Morocco’s
urban transport sector. Borrower Performance was moderately satisfactory. The
Government was highly committed to the DPL’s objectives throughout project
preparation and implementation. As the implementing agency, the Ministry of
Interior’s performance was strong; however, inter-ministerial coordination was only
partially achieved.

port of Nigeria. For many years, public transportation in Lagos has been fragmented
and unreliable, with multiple private operators, small, poor-quality vehicles, and an
unregulated environment. Chronic traffic congestion is a major problem.

The project supported the state government program which aimed to improve
transport services in the Lagos Metropolitan Area, particularly for public transport
users, especially the poor. The program was based on five sub-objectives:
improvements to the management of the Lagos metropolitan transport sector;
enhancement of the road network; more efficient public transport services; the
promotion of water transport, and the preparation for future phases of the urban
transport program. A key factor was support for the newly established Lagos
Metropolitan Transport Authority (LAMATA), which was empowered to plan an
integrated transport system for the Lagos State Government with a specific focus on
implementing and regulating mass transit systems. A transport fund was to be
established to eventually be able to cover transport infrastructure maintenance costs.

The credit financed road rehabilitation and maintenance to restore the main routes
over which the public transport operated. The transport fund was set up and by
2009 LAMATA was able to meet 60 percent of its operational funding requirements,
which is being further pursued in the follow-on project. The project implemented a
pilot bus franchise scheme which included consultancy support for a conceptual
framework and attracting commercial funds for the purchase or leasing of new and
high-capacity buses. There was no government subsidy for operating the scheme,
and it has been financially successful. Members of the National Union of Road
Transport Workers operated the buses supported by LAMATA and paid back the
loan in only two years. Select stakeholders, including union representatives, were
taken on a study tour to see bus and mass transit operations in Brazil and Colombia.
Later, this concept was expanded in a pilot bus rapid transit line (known as BRT-
Lite), the first in Africa. The infrastructure was funded by the State of Lagos, with
the World Bank helping to adapt the concept to African conditions and financing the
design of the BRT line at a relatively low cost. Public support is evident and
ridership has exceeded expectations. Overall, the project was pro-poor. Time and
money spent by poor households on bus travel was reduced, as was travel time and
waiting time per trip along project corridors, and passengers experienced fewer
transfers per journeys.

Relevance of the objectives is rated substantial, as is relevance of design, although it
was hampered by the failure to implement a results framework in the first few years
of the project. The quality of monitoring and evaluation was modest. The objective,
to improve the transport services in the Lagos Metropolitan Area in particular for

public transport users and for the poor, was substantially achieved, althouth the
ferry services had some shortcomings related to safety, and the lack of progress in
attracting private sector investment to the Lagos Ferry Services Company. Efficiency
is assessed as modest despite the likely high economic rate of return (ERR),
primarily because of the project’s operational inefficiency. The overall project
outcome is assessed as moderately satisfactory.

Risk to development outcome is considered moderate. The setting up of the
transport fund has been an important step in the right direction, and adequate
provision for maintenance of the BRT service has been provided. The follow-on
project is expected to close existing gaps toward achieving 100 percent cost recovery.
In comparison, the water transport services are cash-starved and insufficiently
attractive to the private sector. In general, there is still a degree of dependency on
World Bank funds in the follow-on project to maintain a stable situation. The current
economic situation in Nigeria is deteriorating with the lower international oil prices.

The project was subject to a review by the World Bank’s Quality Assurance Group in
2003 regarding whether the physical components might sidetrack the Lagos
authorities and the World Bank from the main objectives of promoting the
institutional and cost recovery improvements. Complexity did contribute to limited
progress in the initial years of implementation. However, the borrower, with WB
support, managed to improve the public transport service to the satisfaction of the
users, strengthen institutional capacity, and establish a cost recovery mechanism.

The World Bank’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory. During supervision
the World Bank sought ways to resolve various issues in a collaborative manner,
and provided technical assistance commensurate with project needs (though there
were perhaps too many separate studies). Procurement and financial management
procedures set the project on a sound footing and gave credibility to LAMATA.
Windfall savings were used opportunistically to finance the design costs of the BRT.
Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. The state government ensured approval
of the LAMATA legislation; provided support to empower, resource, and establish
it; and streamlined responsibilities within the government to better define its role
and mandate. Although there was insufficient counterpart funding early in
implementation, there was willingness to restructure the project and by closure the
state government had financed over US$100 million from the state budget and
transport fund. LAMATA made steady progress despite the challenging
circumstances, and demonstrated competence in complying with World Bank
procurement and safeguard requirements.

Lima Urban Transport Project
Lima was the first city in Latin America to pioneer a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system
in the early 1970s, and this experience was fed into the first modern BRT system in
Curitiba (Brazil). After Transmilenio in Bogota (Colombia) became a showcase to
spread the BRT system, a modern BRT system in Lima known as Metropolitano was
developed under the project.

The project was approved on December 9, 2003 with an IBRD Loan and GEF Grant
of US$45 million and US$7.93 million respectively. At completion, all of the IBRD
loan and 93 percent of the GEF grant was disbursed. The final project cost was
US$261.9 million, about 95 percent higher than appraisal (US$134.43 million). The
difference (US$171.90 million) was entirely financed by the Borrower, a substantial
increase over US$44.40 million at design. The project closed on April 30, 2011, 22
months after the planned completion date of June 30, 2009.

The overall project development outcome is rated satisfactory. Efficacy of the first
sub-objective “the establishment of an efficient, reliable, cleaner and safer mass
transit system” is rated substantial for tangible achievements in providing such UT
services through the BRT system. The second sub-objective, comprising “improving
mobility” and “accessibility for its population, especially in the peri-urban poor
neighborhoods,” is also rated substantial because of increasing traffic volume and
usage for commuting to the workplace and higher education. Although the benefit
for the poor might be less than for the nonpoor, and the very poor appear to have
benefited hardly at all, the project improved connections between the poor
residential areas in the northern and southern parts of Lima Metropolitan Region.
The overarching objective of “enhancing the economic productivity and the quality
of life in the Borrower’s municipal territory” has difficulties in measurement and
attribution, but substantial achievements for the other two sub-objectives are likely
to have contributed favorably to the overarching objective. Efficiency is rated
substantial, taking into consideration cost-effectiveness in comparison to similar
projects across different countries, through there were operational and
administrative inefficiencies, reflected in large cost and time overruns. World Bank
and Borrower Performance were both rated moderately satisfactory.

Metropolitano BRT’s fleet of high-capacity buses use compressed natural gas (CNG)
for fuel, which is unique among BRT systems around the world. The use of low-
polluting CNG and the modal shift from higher-polluting motor vehicles is seen to
have contributed to the overall decline in pollutants (such as PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and
NO2) in Lima during the past few years. According to the verified carbon standard
monitoring report (2015), it is estimated that more than 200,000 tons of carbon

dioxide emission reductions were achieved under the project for the past three years
between July 2011 and June 2014. Direct observation by the IEG mission also found
that an articulated bus and feeder bus have more carrying capacity than a traditional
minibus. They were also cleaner than other traditional modes of public transport.
Figure 2 shows a typical articulated bus and traditional minibus used in Lima
Metropolitan Region. In addition, from 2012, approximately 2,000 old and relatively
higher polluting micro and mini buses were scrapped by Protransporte. The project
planned to use GEF funds initially, but this task was taken over by Protransporte,
which committed more than $12 million to the effort.

An Inspection Panel investigation was carried out in response to a Request for
Inspection submitted by residents of the District Barranco within Lima Metropolitan
Region. The requesters claimed health and safety concerns from increased traffic
volume through re-routing, as well as inadequate consultations on an environmental
management plan or mitigation measures. The Inspection Panel’s investigation
report (2011) concluded that the project was not solely responsible for the adverse
impacts because of the general increase in traffic volume from economic causes, and
that the safeguards Category B was appropriate. However, the investigation report
also pointed to shortcomings in the analysis of impacts on pedestrian and vehicle
traffic flows beyond the BRT corridor; insufficient information provided to affected
residents in Barranco; nonimplementation of the appropriate re-routing traffic
pattern recommended in a 2005 traffic study; inadequate traffic impact analysis for
the Barranco area; and a lack of sound analysis on historic and monumental aspects
of this district.

In response to the Inspection Panel’s findings, the World Bank provided technical
assistance for traffic management through the consultations with residents in
Barranco. A traffic management expert proposed traffic detours so that pedestrian
rights were respected in the historic quarters. Protransporte officials informed the
IEG mission that no major complaints have been received following these
developments.

Senegal Urban Mobility Improvement Project
The project was the first of a two-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL), but trigger
conditions were not met and the second APL did not proceed. IDA financed
US$75.71 million of the actual project cost of US$156.92 million, with a cost overrun
of 152 percent from the original US$103 million. The project was appraised in 2000
and closed in 2008 after a delay of two years and nine months.1

                     PROJECT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS RELATED TO URBAN TRANSPORT
Senegal’s transport sector is of high strategic importance to the Senegalese economy,
yet the government has had difficulty meeting the demands for service, particularly
for the poor, who are most dependent on public provision of urban transport
services. The dual challenges of providing adequate access to transport and
reversing the growing crisis in urban mobility have increased in the absence of
integrated land use policies and with the worsening of urban sprawl. Financing of
transport infrastructure is overdependent on public funds, and private financing
remains limited. When public funds do get allocated they focus on construction and
neglect maintenance of deteriorating infrastructure. The project development
objective was to improve the safety, efficiency, and the quality of urban mobility in
the metropolitan area of Dakar and road safety in Thiès and Kaolack. This was to be
achieved through activities involving road rehabilitation and construction, railway
upgrading, minibus replacement, air quality improvement, and institutional
strengthening.

The relevance of the objectives of the Urban Mobility Improvement Project (UMIP)
was substantial. The goal of improving urban transport mobility was aligned with
both World Bank and government strategies. The relevance of project design was
modest. The choice of an APL was questionable, because it was predicated on the
lack of implementation readiness for some of the project’s key components. A highly
complex design was assigned to a very weak implementing agency that had just
been created. The results framework was based on overoptimistic assumptions and
did not take into account the continuing rapid growth of vehicular traffic, which
cancelled out the project’s benefits.

Achievement of the project’s objectives of safety, efficiency, and quality of urban
mobility were substantial, modest, and modest, respectively. Road safety improved
and the minibus leasing component was successful, but the deterioration of the road
network accumulated rapidly, owing to lack of road maintenance, scarcity of
required funding, and use by overloaded trucks. Outcomes related to the railway
upgrading were not achieved; suburban railway operations were in a worse state
when the project closed. Environmental outcomes were only partially achieved.

The project’s efficiency was modest. Cost overruns were high. The economic internal
rate of return at completion was probably improperly calculated because it was
based mainly on significant time and cost savings from traffic improvements, yet the
Implementation Completion and Results Review states that the cost of congestion
increased by 32 percent between 1998 and 2008, when the project closed. Procedural
and procurement inefficiencies, government indecision, and the lack of counterpart
funds led to major implementation delays. Institutional strengthening achievements
were modest. The Executive Council of Urban Transport in Dakar (CETUD) remains


                                                                                   119

insufficiently equipped for sector planning, management, and regulatory tasks. The
government decided to reorganize CETUD in 2000, even before UMIP became
effective in 2001; after much study, CETUD’s restructuring was still being
implemented in 2015—15 years after the initial decision.

Overall, the project’s development outcome is rated unsatisfactory. Risks to
development outcome are high. The lack of road maintenance funds could only be
expected to cancel out the project’s achievements related to road rehabilitation and
construction; however, renewed support is being provided under the ongoing
Senegal Transport and Urban Mobility Project. The World Bank’s performance is
unsatisfactory. The project was neither adequately appraised nor ready for
implementation when it was presented to the Board of Executive Directors.
Supervision was ineffective, despite some improvements after the midterm review.
The borrower’s performance is unsatisfactory. Many parts of the project were
incomplete, despite three closing extensions. The government’s wavering
commitment, ill-timed decisions, periodic inaction, and lack of counterpart funding
severely weakened prospects for achieving the project objectives. CETUD, the
project executing agency, was weak and still needs significant strengthening and
resources before it can adequately perform the important planning, management,
and regulatory roles that it has been assigned.

Appendix D. Issues Identified by Literature
Review on UT Challenges and Bibliography
Background, Chapter 1
URBAN MOBILITY FOR ALL

•   Global Objective, SDG
•   Transport development and planning is important to development, poverty alleviation,
    urban congestion, climate change and pollution mitigation, public health and safety
•   Rapid urbanization increases urgency.
•   New methods and technologies can improve traffic and demand management and make transport
    greener.

URBANIZATION TRENDS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

•   Urbanization is a critical global trend and challenge. Rapid urbanization is led by developing
    countries. Urban population will double by 2030 and urban area will triple.
•   There is a positive link between urbanization and economic development and poverty reduction.
•   Higher productivity in urban areas stems from agglomeration economies.
•   Agglomeration diseconomies include traffic congestion, air pollution, pressure on natural
    resources, as well as higher labor, property, policing, and other costs. With urbanization these
    problems grow, and can retard growth and attenuate benefits of urbanization.
•   Poverty is now growing faster in urban than in rural areas, and over a billion people live in urban
    slums.
•   Efficient urban transport, supported by strong institutions, is a cogent development objective.

URBAN PLANNING AND TRANSPORT PLANNING

•   A bias toward personal motorization in planning and infrastructure investments increases
    congestion and time lost to delays, reduces accessibility, and negatively affects productivity.
•   Urban form is heavily influenced by transport systems. Arterial roads are often managed in a
    fragmented and uneconomic way.
•   Proper planning can contribute to a balance between various modes of urban transport. Modal
    coordination at stations is essential, and the poorer areas need to have good accessibility.
•   Land use and planning policies should integrate transport planning, including freight transport.
•   A compact city form enables people, particularly the poor, to access jobs as well as educational
    and health services more easily.
•   Sprawl and piecemeal development disproportionately disadvantage the poor. Spatial
    disconnection of the urban poor from opportunities is an important contributor to poverty.
•   Transit-orientated demand (TOD) encourages residential and commercial centers designed to
    provide a relatively high density, compact and mixed-form, and to provide access to transit in a
    pedestrian-friendly environment. This leads to a sustainable urban form.
•   TOD requires strong institutions, political will, and planning capacity to pursue.



                                                                                                    121
APPENDIX D
ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY LITERATURE REVIEW ON UT CHALLENGES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
•     City form can be limited by geography. Population density is highest in Asian cities.
•     Though there will be continued growth in the megacities, it is becoming clear that the greatest
      growth will be in smaller and medium-sized cities.
•     National transport strategy reviews have shifted focus from megacities to general issues affecting
      cities of all sizes.

URBAN TRANSPORT CHARACTERISTICS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRY CITIES: MODES

Informal Sector Road Passenger Transport

•     The informal private sector predominates in the provision of urban road passenger transport. Most
      informal operators are fragmented and opportunistic, operating chaotically and dangerously. In
      many developing cities the sector is subject to minimal regulation
•     Vehicle and operator size are generally small, as operators face difficulties obtaining finance.
•     These operations tend to be poorly integrated into the wider UT systems.
•     Taxi routes offer greater flexibility to users than formal bus lines. Dangerous motorcycle taxis are
      also common in many countries in Africa and Asia.
•     Private operations are characterized by a multiplicity of vehicle ownership arrangements. The
      driver typically has the operational responsibility, paying a daily rental to the owner.
•     Attempts to recapitalize the industry have had mixed success. S. Africa ran out of funds.
•     Informal unions and organizations can become politically influential, flouting government
      regulations, avoiding taxation, and neglecting safety.
•     In Asia, informal transport is characterized by diverse modes including buses, minibuses, taxis,
      tuktuks, songtaews, and motorcycle taxis, but also ride-sharing on converted trucks and jeeps.
•     In India there are 10 million rickshaw drivers, in Bangladesh 2 million.
•     Rio de Janeiro has witnessed an explosion of minibus/van services over the past few years,
      connected to declining public bus service quality and coverage. A study comparing policy
      alternatives found that users benefited most from improved formal mass transit. Policies to foster
      a competitive environment for delivery of both informal and formal services were also shown to
      benefit users. Legalizing the informal sector was found to benefit users only slightly.

Public Sector Road Passenger Transport

•     In most developing country cities, public passenger road transport services cannot cover
      operating expenses with fares. Companies often receive insufficient public financing to maintain
      a satisfactory level of service.
•     A more liberal approach to private sector entry has increased supply by means of competitively
      tendered franchises. Successful franchised operations are evident in Bogotá and Curitiba.

Bus Rapid Transit

•     Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) has since taken off as an alternative form of mass transit in developing-
      country cities. It is a bus-based system where the buses have dedicated lanes with terminals, stops
      and shelters, as well as traffic management preference measures.
•     The more expensive “gold-standard” systems feature off-board fare collection, same-level
      boarding, and passing lanes at bus stations.
•     Less expensive systems do not meet these criteria and cater to lower volumes of passengers.


122
                                                                                               APPENDIX D
                         ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY LITERATURE REVIEW ON UT CHALLENGES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
•   Global best practices may not work in all circumstances, and customization is often desirable.
•   A phased approach, focusing on early service delivery, can build support. It is important to
    develop a BRT network as opposed to single corridors, but the first phase is to ensure delivery of
    a pilot scheme demonstrating the advantages of the mode.

Rail Transport and Metro Systems

•   Beyond an arguable threshold traffic volume, rail is preferable for moving large numbers of
    people. Commuter services in the Mumbai Metropolitan Area convey 7.9 million passengers
    daily, with the world’s highest-density passenger services.
•   Most of the world’s urban mass transit systems cannot cover operating costs, let alone capital
    expenses, through fare box revenues. On average, 25 percent of metros’ operating expenditures
    are not funded by fare box income.

Chapter 3: Mobility for All
URBAN POVERTY AND SOCIAL EQUITY

•   Urban poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, manifested through the spatial segregation of
    the poorest areas characterized by inadequate public services and deficient infrastructure.
•   Provision of mass transportation is often inappropriate in terms of affordability and availability,
    restricting usage by the poor. Transportation infrastructure in the name of urban renewal and
    economic development programs often marginalize the urban poor.
•   Transport subsidies are widely used to help the poor, but they are difficult to effectively target
    and vulnerable to misuse and capture by wealthier users, and they are difficult to sustain.
•   Rising land and property prices in city centers force people in the low-income group to make
    complex trade-offs between residential location, travel distance, and travel mode.
•   Lower levels of transport services provided in areas with a higher density of poor people impedes
    their mobility, access, and earnings potential.
•   Design of UT services also disadvantages other vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and
    disabled persons, from accessing services. Appropriate legislation can facilitate progress.

NONMOTORIZED TRANSPORT

•   Nonmotorized transport (NMT) (walking, cycling, and cart) is clearly very significant for the
    poor. The urban poor walk much more than the nonpoor. Overall, NMT accounts for
    approximately 37 percent of urban trips worldwide, dominated by short walking trips.
•   A high proportion of people rely on NMT, yet planning and financing of relevant services lags.
•   The popularity of the bicycle varies, with low usage in Africa and Latin America and greater
    prominence in Asia. Cycling is dangerous in some cities’ congested urban conditions.
•   Some projects have promoted NMT through a more cycle- and pedestrian-friendly environment
    and supportive investments. The design of intermodal transfer points also brought opportunities
    to improve pedestrian safety. Overall, however, NMT has a long way to go.

TRANSPORT SAFETY AND SECURITY

•   Data on urban road accident fatalities and injuries is rare. Most datasets are at the national level.



                                                                                                       123
APPENDIX D
ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY LITERATURE REVIEW ON UT CHALLENGES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
•     High-income countries of Western Europe mostly have accident rates of between 3.5 and 6.0 per
      100,000 people, and are declining. Developing country experience is much worse. Latin
      American fatality rates range between 13 and 21 per 100,000 people, China and India rates range
      between 16 and 17, and African countries rates are 28 to 35 per 100,000 people (WHO).
•     Piecemeal information from individual studies shows the vulnerability of pedestrians. Children
      and the elderly are the most vulnerable pedestrians.
•     Reasons for traffic accidents include excessive speed, failure to use protective measures such as
      seat belts and helmets, poor road design, lack of pedestrian crossing facilities, drinking and
      driving, and poor vehicle impact protection. Cities may present additional hazards including the
      absence of lane demarcation, informal markets and street hawkers encroaching on the road
      reserve, and informal taxis picking up and dropping passengers unsafely.
•     The safe systems approach involves designing the entire transport system—including road
      engineering, user behavior, vehicle safety, policing, and accident response—to protect people
      from death and serious injury. WHO embraces this philosophy.
•     Progress was limited where authorities did not commit to change their approach or invest
      resources.
•     Railway safety is also a concern. Mumbai’s railway system records between 10 and 12 fatal
      accidents daily due to people illegally crossing the tracks, falling from overcrowded carriages, or
      being electrocuted trying to ride on top of the carriage roofs.

ADDRESSING URBAN TRANSPORT SUPPLY AND DEMAND

•     While car ownership rates in some advanced economies approach saturation, motorization
      continues unabated in developing countries, driven by economic growth and rising incomes. By
      2050 the number of motor vehicles worldwide may reach 2.6 billion, and China alone is expected
      to have 800 million private automobiles. There has been also an explosion in the growth of
      motorcycles, scooters, and mopeds, especially in Asia and Africa. In Laos and the Philippines
      two-wheeled motorized traffic comprises 78 percent and 43 percent of all traffic, respectively.
•     Efforts to address congestion by building more roads are soon overwhelmed by increases in the
      numbers of vehicles induced by the improvements. The alternative is to contain sprawl, create
      more compact, pedestrian friendly cities, and reduce vehicle kilometers travelled.
•     Societal values in China and other countries emphasized car ownership as a “rite of passage” for
      the middle class. Pro-car government policies in the form of favorable tax policies and
      government incentives encouraged motor vehicle purchases to boost domestic vehicle
      manufacturing. Cheap imported secondhand vehicles from Europe boosted sales in Africa, while
      in Peru 80 percent of the vehicle stock was imported secondhand from the USA or Japan. In Latin
      America ease of credit contributed to rising rates of car ownership. Subsidized transport fuel in
      many oil-producing countries also distorted supply and demand relationships.
•     Congestion reduces mobility for road users in cars, and even more for public transport users,
      because transit routes characteristically follow the highest-volume arteries. High levels of
      congestion and high latent demand for travel result when motorization outstrips expansion of
      roadways. The condition exists in nearly all developing countries.. When a new urban highway is
      opened it may be congested from the start because of the latent demand.
•     Though the impossibility of providing enough road space for unrestricted private car use is
      increasingly recognized, demand management is generally weak. Conscious restrictions of the
      amount of road space provided is rare. Curitiba in Brazil set an example of accommodating travel
      demand management through its land use plans.

                        ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY LITERATURE REVIEW ON UT CHALLENGES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
•   An increasingly popular strategy to restrict travel demand (aimed at reducing vehicle air
    pollution) is restricting access into an urban cordon area based on the last digits of the license
    number or on pre-established days or periods of the day (usually peak hours). The main
    disadvantage to this system, although it works short-term, is that if it becomes permanent,
    residents begin buying second cars to get around the ban, often old, more polluting cars.
•   Congestion pricing is a system of charging users higher peak charges. This can take the form of
    road tolls, and bus and metro fares. Application of congestion pricing to urban roads is currently
    limited to a few cities in developed economies. There are four types of systems: a cordon around
    a city center with charges for crossing it; areawide congestion pricing, a city-center toll ring, and
    corridor congestion pricing, whereby access to a lane or facility is priced.
•   These schemes vary in sophistication, but require high traffic management and electronic skills as
    well as good law enforcement. Critics of the measures cite harm to businesses and shops in
    restricted areas, and impacts on neighborhoods adjacent to the area. Others argue that poorer
    people will be most affected financially. Public discontent in several cases (such as Manchester,
    England) has led to rejection of congestion pricing schemes.
•   Not surprisingly, applications in the developing world have been few. Hong Kong SAR, China
    conducted a pilot project between 1983 and 1985 with positive results, but public opposition
    prevented the scheme from becoming permanent. Since 2009 officials in Beijing and the southern
    city of Guangzhou, China, have repeatedly aired the idea of introducing congestion charges but
    faced complaints about inequality. Governments afraid of appearing to stray from socialism are
    sensitive to accusations of favoring the wealthy. This is now changing in Beijing, where officials
    face traffic jams and appalling air pollution that have resulted in public outcry. Whether this
    outweighs public opposition to congestion charges remains to be seen.
•   Demand management measures such as enforcement of parking restrictions also proved
    politically unattractive.

MOBILITY AND SECURITY FOR WOMEN

•   Safety and accessibility are major issues for women. In Mumbai, women-only carriages and
    female police on trains were seen to be a step forward, but respondents complained about
    overcrowded carriages, poor and unclean toilet facilities, and poor lighting at intermodal transfer
    points. Regarding other modes, women complained about taxi drivers who were sometimes
    harassing. They considered buses to be relatively safe, but found that pedestrian infrastructure
    was either lacking or inadequate.
•   Measures to improve women’s security include adding lighting to improve personal security,
    encouraging engagement police to penalize offenders, and incentives for franchised public
    transport operators.
•   Commitment of clients is key to substantial improvements in safety and security. Lack of
    commitment is exemplified in the limited resources made available for road safety, lack of helmet
    requirements for motorcycles, and lack of crash barriers at dangerous locations. Positive measures
    include the converse of the above, as well as the undertaking of road safety audits, incentive
    schemes to encourage local governments to finance road safety measures, and requirements that
    new vehicles meet appropriate safety standards.

Chapter 4: Financial and Environmental Sustainability
FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY

•     Complexities arise from the multiplicity of objectives pursued in urban transport and by the
      institutional separation of road infrastructure from operations, of infrastructure pricing from costs,
      and of roads from other modes of urban transport.
•     The literature finds that prices for all modes should reflect full social costs (including congestion
      and environmental externalities), and subsidies should be targeted to strategic objectives. This
      generates sufficient funds for asset maintenance and replacement, and avoids distortions in modal
      choices.
•     Road maintenance financing in developing countries has improved over the past decade with the
      establishment of more second-generation road funds, financed by fuel levies and managed by
      boards representing the interests of the road users. First-generation funds relied on earmarked
      revenues, with no oversight board and lacking financial rules and regulations.
•     However, such funds are likely only to cover national and provincial roads. The allocation of the
      funds collected to city roads suffers.
•     A continued reliance on deficit financing leads to uncertain and uneven flows of funding.
      Municipal tax revenues in developing countries are typically inadequate, and have to cover a
      wide range of demands. In practice, property taxes—seen as the backbone of local taxation—
      seldom account for more than 20 percent of local revenues.
•     Other revenue sources are often not used, including personal income tax surcharges, subnational
      value added taxes, payroll taxes, transfers from central or state governments, and PPPs.
•     In principle, local borrowing could finance capital expenditures, but creditworthiness is an issue,
      especially for secondary cities. Several approaches have been tried to overcome this, with only a
      limited impact, and sometimes a crowding-out of private finance.
•     Countries that subsidize fuel encourage greater car ownership, contributing to congestion and
      pollution. Conversely, high taxes on fuel encourage movement to more fuel-efficient vehicles and
      transport modes. Subsidizing car ownership (for example, through low-interest loans) may
      stimulate the local auto industry, but leads to high externality costs and does not benefit the poor.
•     Some cities directly or indirectly subsidize public transport, but better-off inhabitants may benefit
      more than poorer ones.
•     Fuel subsidies may be used to encourage the use of particular fuels such as propane gas or
      compressed natural gas. The reality in many developing country cities, however, is that the
      vehicle fleet is often old, with inefficient technology. Policies to offset these deficiencies include
      incentives to scrap old vehicles, and restrictions on the importation of secondhand vehicles.
•     Poor traffic management may arise from inadequate financing mechanisms to channel funds, and
      too much emphasis on building new infrastructure.
•     Various new fees, generically known as value capture, are being tried. For example, impact fees
      are designed to recover the external costs needed to pay for infrastructure provided by public
      authorities. The drawback is that there can be a considerable margin of uncertainty about exactly
      what infrastructure should be associated with a new development, so of necessity such fees are
      negotiated. The establishment of new town corporations allows a developer to recover the costs
      of infrastructure through land and property sales. Lease or sale of unused urban land can also
      provide a contribution. Ethiopia has introduced a law that mandates 90 percent of the proceeds of
      municipal land leasing combined with borrowing against land collateral. A pitfall here, as learned

    in China, is that the temptation to convert rural land to urban by this mechanism can result in
    sprawl. Sale of development rights is another option, in whichthe municipality charges a preset
    fee for additional floor space beyond the normal maximum density. Such fees have been used in
    Sao Paulo, Brazil and Mumbai, India. All these concepts need proving.
PPP
•   Expectations for large-scale private investment did not materialize. Most transport projects were
    seen as risky. Those projects that were pursued focused mainly on middle-income countries in
    Latin America and East Asia, where governments were more supportive and had the capacity to
    engage effectively with the private sector, so risks were perceived to be lower.
•   A review of such projects in six countries concluded that apart from the physical achievements,
    the positive outcomes of PPPs included technical and managerial innovation and capacity
    building of both the countries’ private and public sectors.

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

•   Mobility faces critical challenges in tackling climate change.
•   Over the past decade, there was a strong emphasis on environmentally sustainable urban
    transport: decreasing the volume of air pollutants, particularly lead in gasoline and fine particulate
    matter, as well as volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen.
•   Reducing transit-generated air pollution reduces deaths from asthma, upper respiratory illnesses
    and cancer, though results are difficult to measure because of the difficulty of establishing
    attribution.
•   Considerable progress has been made in eliminating lead in vehicle fuel. Between 2005 and 2011,
    the number of countries selling leaded gasonline shrank from 81 to six.
•   Nonetheless, as of 2010, the reported contribution of developing countries to global warming was
    increasing, and China had overtaken the United States as the chief greenhouse gas emitter.
•   According to WHO, about half of the urban population monitored in 1,600 cities across 91
    countries is exposed to air pollution that is at least 2.5 times higher than the recommended level.
•   Motor vehicles are a major contributor. The United Nations estimated that 600 million people
    worldwide in urban areas were exposed to dangerous levels of traffic-generated air pollutants.
•   Typical measures supported by development banks to reduce vehicle-related air pollution have
    been aimed at better traffic management (including prioritizing public transport), improved
    vehicle inspection and maintenance programs, encouragement of the introduction of technologies
    to suppress emissions and reduce fuel consumption, as well as fiscal measures.
•   Pollution from motorbikes has steadily increased, especially in Asia, but lower-polluting four-
    stroke engine motorcycles have begun replacing two-stroke engines.
•   Other environmental issues affecting cities, including noise pollution and aesthetics and visual
    intrusion, have garnered only limited attention.
•   Regarding the use of alternative fuels, there has been progress, but as yet not a major
    breakthrough. Use of compressed natural gas (CNG) has increased but is confined to bus fleet
    operations in a few cities. A modern public bus, with conventional diesel fuel, nevertheless emits
    only half the carbon dioxide of a small car, per passenger km traveled.
•   Appalling air quality conditions along bus corridors can be dramatically improved with
    investments in buses with recent technology. Since 2006 many developing countries adopted
    stricter standards for sulfur content in diesel. Many countries have committed to new vehicles
    meeting the latest (Euro 4) standards.

•     Liquid biofuels can be used in existing vehicles. The IEA estimates that biofuels account for
      about 1.5 percent of global transportation fuel consumed. Biofuels generate about a third less
      greenhouse gases than gasoline, but the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has suggested
      that they contributed to high food prices and hunger. Research is ongoing to produce biofuels
      from nonfood sources.
•     Advocacy can be important in improving the city environment, but measuring results is difficult
      because of attribution problems.

Chapter 5: Institutional Strengthening in Urban Transport
•     Urban transport interventions are often complex and multidimensional. Responsibility for these
      modes is spread across different agencies, administrative boundaries, and levels of government.
•     Holistic solutions, a common strategy, and strong coordination among the various authorities
      involved are desirable. In many cases the root cause of urban dysfunction is a lack of coordinated
      structures for planning, implementation, and management and a chronic lack of capacity in these.
      As a result, sub-optimal projects are planned and pursued in isolation from their potential impacts
      on other projects.
•     In cases where large urban projects have been realized or a metropolitan transport authority was
      established, there has been a strong political champion who was able to foster public awareness
      and capture public imagination. Curitiba’s transport system in Brazil was promoted by a strong
      city mayor. Similarly, the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority (LMATA) was established
      with strong support of the Commissioner for Transport in Lagos State.
•     Because so many people are affected by transport systems in a city and so many people are
      directly or indirectly employed in the operation of transport infrastructure and services, any
      change is a highly sensitive matter. Reforms need to be demonstrated as effective and the public
      needs to participate in the decision-making process. Change creates both winners and losers. The
      challenge is to ensure that the losers are well informed and that their specific concerns are
      communicated and addressed in the overall design. Because political leaders come and go, it is
      important to ensure that there is political agreement and broad stakeholder ownership This is
      especially important where the gestation periods of transport projects are lengthy.
•     Regarding the setting up of LMATA (or any metropolitan authority), this can take some time.
      Delays arose in recruiting skills staff, role clarification, overcoming turf projection by local
      authorities, legislative strengthening, and generating greater buy-in and a common vision.
•     Stakeholder participation requires transparency to minimize opportunities for corruption, improve
      governance, and allow for complaints, suggestions, and grievances to be heard.
•     However, there is no single approach to establishing an effective lead agency. Instead, the
      approach must adapt to different political and administrative philosophies. To perform effectively
      such authorities need financial independence and clear decision-making authority over all public
      sector funds being spent on transport in the respective metropolitan area.
•     Building capacity in urban transport is a slow process that must be tackled continuously through a
      spectrum of projects. It can benefit from technical assistance components of investment projects.
      Though these have traditionally been focused on ensuring that the financial, procurement, and
      safeguards aspects of the projects are adequately handled, there is often scope for more
      specialized knowledge-building, and for trips for key stakeholders to observe best practices in
      other developing countries (South-South learning).

Appendix E. Summary of Partnerships Review:
PPIAF and SSATP
Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility’s Support to Urban Transport
The scope of this review is the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility’s
(PPIAF’s) urban transport portfolio approved between fiscal years (FY) 2007 and
2016. The objective is to assess how the World Bank Group has used its partnership
with the facility to leverage its capabilities and resources in dealing with global
challenges in urban transport.

PPIAF was created in 1999, building on the World Bank Group’s Infrastructure
Action Program (1997) with the aim of improving the environment for private
sector participation (PSP) in infrastructure in developing countries. PPIAF’s
mission is to help eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable development by
facilitating private involvement in infrastructure, including but not limited to urban
transport and pursuing universal access, climate change adaptation and mitigation,
and urbanization. PPIAF seeks to strengthen institutions and legal systems, and to
promote high standards of governance, competition, the protection of investments,
and sound dispute resolution mechanisms. Activities are financed through grants
for eligible countries and sectors encompassing policy formation and support to
legal and institutional reforms; advisory to select the best model for infrastructure
service delivery, risk allocation, and PPP design; support to stakeholders and
beneficiaries; and design and implementation of pioneering projects. A Sub-National
Technical Assistance Program (SNTA) under PPIAF also helps local authorities to
improve creditworthiness and develop capacities to access market-based financing.

PPIAF’s support to urban transport. Between FY 2007 and FY 2016, PPIAF
approved 813 activities totaling $174.8 million in commitments, mostly for
multisector projects (43 percent). Transport (16 percent) was the second most
important single sector after energy (21 percent). Out of the $28.2 million approved
in 131 transport activities, a third ($9.7 million) was approved in 47 (eight active,
two cancelled) urban transport activities (6 percent of PPIAF funding) not only to
support global and regional projects, but also at least 20 single countries.

Almost half of PPIAF’s funding in urban transport promoted strategies for PSP
and capacity building to manage it. According to PPIAF’s own classification,
almost a third (11) of the 47 urban transport activities supported infrastructure
development strategies, intended to guide governments on options for expanding


                                                                                   133

private sector participation in infrastructure. A fifth (8) supported Government
capacity building for the design and execution of PSP arrangements and for the
regulation of private service providers. A sixth (7) provided advice on the design
and implementation of specific policy, regulatory and institutional reforms. Six
activities supported pioneering transactions, and six focused on the identification
and international promotion of emerging best practices in PSP in infrastructure.
Only one activity was for consensus building. Eight activities were approved as
technical assistance to subnational authorities (SNTA), mostly providing support to
access financing for infrastructure improvements without relying on sovereign
guarantees. As for other sectors, the World Bank Group executed most of the general
PPIAF activities in transport and urban transport. In about 20 percent of SNTA
activities in transport and urban transport, unlike other sectors, recipients
participated in executing the projects.

Unlike support to other sectors, support to transport and urban transport was
regionally diversified. While other sectors mainly focused on Africa, urban
transport provided the greatest support to East Asia and Pacific (25 percent) and
Latin America and the Caribbean (21 percent). Greater support stood out in
Vietnam, Colombia, and the Philippines, as well as in middle-income countries.
Low-income countries received less support and fragile countries did not receive
any. The main mode supported in individual countries was urban railway (28
percent), followed by conventional buses (19 percent) and bus rapid transit (BRT)
(15 percent).

PPIAF’s achievements in urban transport. A sample of 20 activities (14 closed)
totaling about $4.9 million was selected to reflect the PPIAF’s urban transport
portfolio in the period. Sampled projects mobilized $3.2 million more in counterpart
funds from governments, transport companies, and other development banks and
donors. The 20 activities (17 PPIAF, three SNTA) cover eight single countries or have
global or regional scope. Most activities financed technical assistance (11), followed
by capacity building (5) and knowledge dissemination (4).

Supported technical assistance and capacity-building activities responded to
evident needs in the sector. The PPIAF provided greater support to less urbanized
countries. It was aligned with the World Bank’s strategy in urban transport for the
period, but repeatedly financed activities in Colombia, Vietnam, and the Philippines,
while the World Bank Group used a third of its commitments in China, Brazil, and
India. However, like the World Bank Group, PPIAF mainly supported institutional
and regulatory framework (75 percent) and urban transport supply increases (25
percent), leaving demand management partially unattended to. Furthermore,
although the designs of knowledge activities highlighted the potential benefits —

                                                                               APPENDIX F
                                         TWO LENSES: BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND SERVICE DELIVERY
environmental benefits, safety, security, and support to vulnerable groups—those
were rarely objectives. More importantly, most activities’ designs had a clear vertical
logic. Still, in a few cases, objectives were not direct outcomes, but depended on
associated projects or lacked the activities and funding allocation to reach them.
Because PPIAF’s support is demand driven and usually results from other
development financing institutions’ dialogue with government counterparts, PPIAF
activities were usually utilized to complement other projects. About 80 percent of
PPIAF’s activities in urban transport either supported investment loans or co-
financed greater projects.

Available information indicates that most outputs were not only delivered (93
percent), but also with good quality. The Facility used its own supported learning
materials to develop capacity-building modules and workshops. About a third of
the activities that intended to inform lending actually did it. A quarter of the
activities did not inform other projects, and in the remainder of cases, it is unclear
because of a lack of information and proper tracking. Furthermore, although 90
percent of the activities discuss their implications on affordability and accessibility
for vulnerable groups or environmental protection, only 10 percent measure those
results.

PPIAF’s activities usually achieved short-term outcomes, but upstream technical
assistance was not as successful as capacity-building and knowledge dissemination
activities achieving longer-term goals. Technical assistance mostly comprised PPP
pre-feasibility and option studies as well as policy, regulatory, and institutional
reform support. While most TA activities informed the supported projects and
authorities, only about 40 percent fully achieved their outcomes. The other 60
percent did not lead immediately to implementation because delays put its
effectiveness at risk. About 85 percent of PPIAF’s capacity building and knowledge
activities were effective in strengthening the technical capacity of World Bank staff
and country decision makers, and likely allowed to extend it to their agencies.

Challenges during the implementation of PPIAF activities were quite similar to
those of World Bank–supported projects. The most persistent issues were delays,
generally related to procurement processes. Activities were usually scheduled for an
implementation period of just over a year, but delays extended average execution by
about 6 months. Task team lead rotations hindered the pace of implementation,
particularly in continued engagements. Low quality of intermediate outputs caused
cost overruns in cases where task team leads needed to invest more time in quality
control. In other cases, becaise PPIAF’s approval process does not require a financial
closing, the search for co-financing delayed the project’s implementation. Clients
were actively involved as participants in capacity-building programs and providing

feedback and support for the outputs of technical assistance. Successful activities in
capacity building and technical assistance were able to sustain partnerships and
bring new partners.

Key findings and lessons. PPIAF acted as a facility to create and spread knowledge,
through sponsoring research activities and dissemination of lessons learnt from its
funded projects. PPIAF’s learning and knowledge products have fed a knowledge
hub about all aspects of PPPs: i) rationale; ii) required legal and institutional
framework for successful introduction; iii) identification, structuring, and design of
projects; and iv) management of PPP contracts and transactions. PPIAF activities
have granted the World Bank and the task team leads the convening power to
influence decisions by participating in discussions regarding specific projects,
reforms, and policies, where they have informed local authorities about similar
experiences and best practices, and have brought together the public sector with
potential investors.

Still, more World Bank Group task team leads might use PPIAF resources to
promote the origination of and support to ongoing urban transport projects. The
PPIAF focused its resources in urban transport on three countries and a few projects,
spurred by the active participation of the task team leads of those countries. Still,
there is an unmet demand for technical support and private sector participation in
the construction, renovation, management, and maintenance of urban transport
infrastructure. The financial cap to supervise projects hampers task team leads’
commitment to the supervision and successful completion of the activities, and the
uncompensated time investment imposed by application procedures may deter
them from applying for resources. Task team leads’ perception suggests that a
rationalization of the application procedures, the strengthening of PPIAF’s
application processing capacity, and alternatives to the capped expenditure on
PPIAF project supervision may encourage a more widespread use of the Facility.

Knowledge products and capacity building are likely to be more effective in
achieving project objectives than targeted technical assistance, but further
operational efforts and incentives for more committed supervision could improve its
effectiveness. Technical assistance activities have faced all types of implementation
challenges. It is necessary that PPIAF and the World Bank Group ensure that task
team leads and project teams have the incentives, expertise, and time to commit to
technical assistance.

Finally, an enhanced M&E framework could help to identify lessons, inform of
necessary changes, and mobilize more resources. During the evaluation period,
PPIAF’S monitoring tools have become more informative, demonstrating an

advance in the learning curve. Nonetheless, monitoring enforcement is limited, as
evidenced by a lack of detailed information about specific implementation issues,
and an excessive reliance on perception. A mechanism to perform a systematic and
longer-term follow up of the outcomes of supported activities is not in place yet.
PPIAF has definitely built on its own technical assistance work, but further efforts
would help increase its contribution to the origination of new loan operations.

Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program (SSATP)’s Support to Urban
Transport
This partnership review assesses the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program’s
(SSATP) support to urban transport in 2008-15. It aims to inform IEG’s evaluation of
the World Bank Group’s support to urban transport on how well SSATP has
contributed to policy development and capacity building related to urban transport
in the Africa region; and to what extent this regional partnership program helps the
World Bank Group to advance the urban transport agenda.

The SSATP is a multi-donor partnership hosted by the World Bank Group’s
Transport and ICT GP. Governed by a Board that has the participation of
international financial organizations, beneficiary governments, the private sector,
users and civil society, and the donor community, it is in a unique position from
which to help African governments develop and implement transport policies. The
core team is small, with the program manager based in Washington, DC, and three
thematic coordinators based in Nairobi.

The core SSATP activities in urban transport carried out in the period of 2008-15 can
be categorized as: (i) tools and methodologies: developing new tools and practical
approaches in addressing different aspects of urban transport; (ii) knowledge
products: generating and sharing evidence-based knowledge and knowhow across
SSATP member countries; and (iii) capacity building: developing the capacity of
policy makers in the transport sector through workshops. Nine activities in urban
transport were undertaken in the period 2008-15 by SSATP.

The program’s current strategic priorities— regional integration, road safety, and
urban mobility— are well-adjusted to the changing global and regional context and
make the program well positioned to help its member countries. The program
should be given credit for its current focus on urban mobility as a critical issue to
address over the next four years in the region. As interviews with the program
stakeholders revealed, initially the demand from national governments and donor
interest were not high. Local authorities mostly lacked the necessary knowledge,
and had limited capacity and financial resources to deal with issues of urban



                                                                                    137

mobility. However, the program’s efforts to put urban mobility on the agenda paid
off: increasingly urban mobility receives more attention from global and regional
development partners and client countries. The partners, for example the African
Development Bank, also noted the growing demand for policy advice in urban
mobility that the program could fill. The program is in a good position to contribute
to SDG goal 11- Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and
sustainable. However, there was no qualitative or quantitative evidence in annual or
completion reports regarding how its products were used by the World Bank. In
general, the visibility of SSATP's outputs has been low, and dissemination and
uptake have been slow.

A key reason has been the increasing divergence of the World Bank's own work—
that is, its declining regional portfolio and its concentration on roads—and the
resulting inability of the SSATP to link its outputs more directly to the projects and
strategies of the World Bank. For the World Bank, there has been a missed
opportunity to use the SSATP to help governments develop and formulate policies
that it was encouraging through its projects. Prior to 2005, the World Bank
contributed to the SSATP through the allocation of staff time, which was welcomed
by the other contributing partners and stakeholders. Used by the SSATP to engage
team leaders working on Africa projects, the linkage reportedly facilitated cohesion
and synergies in the work of the SSATP and the World Bank. However, after the
World Bank ended this practice because of budget limitations, concordance between
World Bank operations and SSATP activities have been progressively reduced.

SSATP has taken steps in recent years to rationalize its program, and to improve
its monitoring and evaluation systems. Its current strategic plan is focused, with
only three themes. One of these is urban transport and mobility and roughly one-
third of its 2015–18 resources are earmarked for urban mobility. Richer future
outcomes may be realized by taking steps to more closely link SSATP policy work
with the World Bank's projects on the ground, and those of the other agency
partners—the European Union, the Islamic Development Bank, and the African
Development Bank, by aligning programs in target countries, and possibly by
sharing personnel.

Appendix F. Two Lenses: Behavior Change and
Service Delivery
Behavior Change
The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) established three Strategic Engagement
Areas (SEAs) around which it has organized part of its work program. Sustained
Service Delivery for the Poor is one of these SEAs (the others are Inclusive Growth
and Environmental Sustainability). As part of the work in the Sustained Service
Delivery for the Poor SEA, IEG developed a protocol to evaluate behavior change
activities in World Bank projects—in diagnostic work and at identification, design,
and monitoring and evaluation stages in a project’s life-cycle.

This note introduces a framework for behavior change that focuses on targeted,
demand-side interventions for inducing behavior change to support achievement of
development outcomes. The framework is focused on beneficiaries. It questions
whether or not projects identified beneficiaries and whether or not diagnostic work
was undertaken to learn what factors influence people’s current behaviors (for
example, service use) and to understand likely barriers to achieving a project’s
desired outcome. The framework categorizes interventions or activities that target
individuals’ behavior (demand-side interventions) and analyzes the results
framework to assess the design and implementation of behavior change
interventions. Finally, IEG’s behavior change framework captures the reporting of
outputs and outcomes associated with behavior change activities and behavior
changes. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) can help provide feedback during
implementation and provide lessons learned for future project design (table F.1.).

An example of a behavioral intervention is the use of incentives for service up-take
or providing needed information and awareness through education and
promotional campaigns. This is not to say that supply-side interventions, such as the
provision of additional resources (for example, bus rapid transit or roads) or
changes in the technology of production (such as increasing efficiency of the
transport system), do not change individuals’ behavior. Infrastructure projects
satisfy excess or latent demand for services simply by providing access. But these
projects don’t generally address constraints to service uptake beyond physical
access. To sustainably deliver services to the poor, the beneficiary has to be front and
center. Directly targeting demand-side behavior addresses these challenges by
acknowledging individuals’ decision-making processes and the implicit trade-offs
required of individuals. For example, bus rapid transit intervention, which provides


                                                                                    139
APPENDIX F
TWO LENSES: BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND SERVICE DELIVERY
infrastructure and targets the ease, safety, or convenience of using public transport,
contains both a supply-side intervention and a demand-side behavior change
intervention.

The underpinnings of the framework are rooted in research—both, standard
neoclassical economics and behavioral economics—that shows behavior change is
dependent on communication, resources, information and incentives, social factors,
and psychological factors. Which is why we called the framework CRI2SP (figure
F.1).

 Figure F.1. CRI2SP Framework




Methodology
A random sample of 75 World Bank urban transportation projects was drawn from
the larger urban transportation portfolio under review by an IEG sector evaluation.1
The results presented below are based on an examination of 48 project reviews.2

The main objective of this review was to (i) explore the extent to which information
on behavior change is available in project documents; (ii) analyze how behavior
change is described and operationalized in the documents; and (iii) assess the
quality of the information provided in project documents. The review considered all
information contained within project appraisal documents (PADs), implementation
completion reports (ICRs), and implementation completion report reviews (ICRRs).
Although the focus of the work was on the design phase, certain information was
taken from the ICRs and ICRRs (for example, to compare behavior change outcomes
and outputs in the results framework to those measured at project closure). No

                                                                              APPENDIX F
                                        TWO LENSES: BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND SERVICE DELIVERY
analysis of correlation between outcomes and the presence of behavior change
interventions was conducted. All data collected by the review are available in an
Access database.

There are limitations to drawing inferences from a review of project documentation
only. Supplemental information from interviews with task team leads and country
case could provide additional evidence of behavior change interventions or the
details of interventions mentioned in project documentation. It is likely that
behavior change activities are not fully fleshed out in project documents, or that they
are implicitly incorporated into project design but not explicitly included in project
documents, or that supporting activities were provided by others in cooperation
with the World Bank (and thus may not be captured in project documents).

Amount and Extent of Behavior Change in World Bank Documents
The discussion that follows provides basic summary statistics and examples of
behavior change interventions in the urban transportation sector.

Identification and Diagnostics of Behavior Change in Project Documents
Diagnostics help inform project design by identifying the targeted beneficiaries and
intended behavioral change. Understanding beneficiaries’ needs and patterns of use
and determining physical and behavioral barriers to achieving project goals are
critical to sustainably delivering services.

The poor were the primary beneficiaries identified in urban transport projects --
project development objectives either explicitly targeted the poor or projects
indirectly targeted the poor by focusing on public transportation. Without explicit
targeting, the actual beneficiaries may not be the poorest. IEG’s review of
transformational engagements found that middle-class users benefitted the most in
the Bogotá bus rapid transit project. The literature finds similar evidence for urban
metro rail; for example, Cook et al. (2005) find that the poor are often unable to
afford even subsidized metro rail fares.

Limited beneficiary-specific diagnostic work was conducted to determine factors
that would contribute to successful shifts to public transportation or safer road
behavior. Only six projects (of 48) conducted targeted diagnostic work. For example,
the Lima Transport Project cites lessons learned from previous experience —
participatory approaches and community involvement provide legitimacy and
public acceptance—and was specifically designed in collaboration with civil society.




                                                                                    141
APPENDIX F
TWO LENSES: BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND SERVICE DELIVERY
While formal diagnostic work was rarely conducted on individuals’ patterns of
service use, barriers to service uptake, or other aspects of demand-side determinants
relevant to urban transport, the broad reasoning of a need for a shift from private to
public transportation was generally present in project documents. Transport-related
behaviors and barriers to achieving certain behaviors were primarily identified or
discussed as part of the background information in project design documents (for
example, sector issues, background section, and country context). The two most
common behaviors identified as needing change were overreliance on private
vehicles and unsafe road behaviors of both drivers and pedestrians.

Lack of resources was the most commonly noted sector issue—both the lack of
infrastructure and the lack of enabling conditions (for example, institutional
capacity, regulatory framework) necessary to operate an effective, efficient
transportation system. Project documents also noted long work commutes, multiple
modal transfers leading to high costs of transportation, and restricted access to bus
depots and train stations as barriers to public transport use. In one project, technical
assistance was provided to improve passenger convenience and information
through more efficient and user-friendly ticket issuing.

Background information on both driver and pedestrian behavior identified three
contributing factors to increased traffic accidents: (i) lack of infrastructure (such as
protected street crossings or grade separations and barriers to physically segregate
pedestrians and vehicles); (ii) rapid motorization and traffic congestion; and (iii)
limited institutional capacity for traffic management.

Design and Implementation of Behavior Change in Project Documents
In the sample of urban transportation projects reviewed the projects’ development
objectives primary sought to achieve (i) increased efficiency and effectiveness of
urban transportation systems; (ii) improved urban mobility and accessibility; or (iii)
improved quality, coverage, reliability, affordability, and safety of urban
transportation.

Eight of 48 projects reviewed contained a statement of behavior change in their
project development objectives (table F.2). Six of these were cofinanced with grants
from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). These projects were classified as
“modal shift” for the purposes of the behavior change review. The behaviors noted
in project development objectives were (i) shifting to environmentally friendly (less
energy-intensive) modes of transportation and (ii) shifting to public transportation.
Project development objectives with a statement of behavior change include:

      •    Increase urban mobility in targeted areas in Hanoi by: (i) increasing the use
           of public transport in two existing corridors and one new one, thereby
           increasing corridor capacity; and (ii) reducing travel times by all modes
           between the city center and the west and northwest sections of the city (west
           of West Lake). The GEF strategic objectives are to promote a shift to more
           environmentally sustainable transport modes and urban development plans,
           and to promote the replication of these approaches in the country and
           region.
      •    Improve personal mobility in cities in Ghana, through a combination of
           traffic engineering measures, management improvements, regulation of the

           promoting a shift to more environmentally sustainable transport modes and
           encouraging lower transport-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in
           Accra.
      •    Assist the borrower in enhancing the economic productivity and quality of
           life of residents of Metro Manila by (a) improving the operational efficiency

           transport and nonmotorized transport.

Note: A total of 50 projects of the 75 randomly selected projects have been reviewed. One project was a duplicate; one had
insufficient information to analyze (no project appraisal document). Data converged by the 48th project reviewed.

Whether or not a project’s objective expressly articulated a behavior change at the
individual level, activities which could plausibly be linked to a modal shift or road
safety were sometimes found elsewhere in project documents, primarily in the
detailed project description (components and subcomponents). As
noted,affordability, awareness, comfort, convenience, incentives, reliability, safety,
security, and reduced travel time are all factors that could influence an individual’s
decision to choose one mode of transport over another. Activities supporting any of
these factors, or activities supporting other types of behavior change interventions
were rarely found in project documents. Those found were classified using the IEG’s
framework (table F.3).

The review found limited evidence of “targeted behavior change” activities in urban
transport projects. The majority of projects focused on the supply-side —“pulling”
passengers into the transport system with more and better resourced agencies,

roads, and integrated public transportation systems. The introduction of BRT, for
example, will pull additional users into the public transportation system; however, it
may not lead to a modal shift (outcome) or a reduction in carbon emissions (impact).
Tackling the perception that public transportation is for the poor would require a
targeted behavior change activity (World Bank 2014).

All but one project contained a resource activity. Half of all projects were resource-
based only, with only supply-side interventions (that is, infrastructure or enabling
conditions). Half of all projects had one CRI2SP intervention in conjunction with
resources and half had multiple interventions (for example, psychological and
communication) (table F.3).

Communication and information were the most prevalent CRI2SP activities (after
resources) associated with urban transportation projects. Communication serves as
the backdrop to activities that are intended to change behavior. Information is
differentiated from communication by how information was delivered; it can be
presented as fact in a formal setting (information-based) or it can be conveyed in a
more relaxed manner (communication-based). Project documents cite various types
of communication and information interventions with little information on the
content of the activities. For example,

      •   public education campaign;
      •   promotional activities;
      •   public awareness campaign road user education;
      •   safety awareness campaigns;
      •   road user education program; and
      •   information provided in schools and by radio, billboard, traffic televisions,
          workshops, mobile vans with messages, advertisements, or cartoons.

                                        TWO LENSES: BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND SERVICE DELIVERY
Public awareness campaigns and promotional activities (communication) were the
most often cited behavior change interventions in urban transportation projects. As
stated previously, little to no information is provided on the content, delivery
mechanism, or audience of these activities. Most often they are one of many
activities listed under a component or subcomponent of a much larger project.

Promotional activities, awareness campaigns, or road user education activities were
generally small components of larger infrastructure projects, such as the Urumqi
Transport Improvement Project or the Senegal Urban Mobility Improvement Project.
In these projects, the emphasis was on resources; that is, resources were used to
reduce the number of fatal accidents or injuries on roads. Investments included
enhancing road safety through physical segregation of pedestrians and motorized
vehicles (such as construction of foot bridges, speed bumps, traffic signals, zebra
crossings, improved sidewalks, and parking management). Project documents
contained little information on the content of the communication activities.

A negligible number of projects included activities targeting social factors, such as
cultural beliefs or socially accepted behaviors. Five projects identified social
obstacles in the urban transport sector (three modal shift, one transport safety, and
one that addressed both). In two projects, social factors were addressed in project
design.

   •   In Peru (Lima Urban Transport Project), evidence from a focus group
       suggested that low bicycle uptake could be explained by a lack of personal
       and traffic safety, poor infrastructure, and preconceived ideas against bike
       use. Project design included improving the physical condition of the existing
       network; carrying out a promotion campaign on bike use; and restarting the
       microcredit program (Plan Bici) so that small bicycle-based entrepreneurs
       coud buy bicycles. The project’s design to increase bicycle use was prepared
       in a participatory manner. The promotional strategy to change cultural norms
       was a multipronged promotional strategy. The promotion of bicycle use was
       designed to target a diverse group of populations and uses to help facilitate a
       cultural shift in the belief that bicycles are for the poor only.
   •   In India (Efficient and Sustainable City Bus Services), the project focused on
       women, promoting bus ridership by addressing barriers “currently
       obstructing their mobility” such as personal safety, convenience of bus
       schedules, depot layouts, and behavior of conductors and drivers.

Psychological factors account for ways in which a project influenced individuals’
behavior through cognitive processes (and limitations) such as perception, stress, or
hassle. Incentives and psychological interventions (Peru and Brazil) were generally


                                                                                    145
APPENDIX F
TWO LENSES: BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND SERVICE DELIVERY
paired with resource interventions. As noted above, resources can influence
behavior by making public transportation safer, more reliable and easier to use, that
is, more attractive.

Although this “resource-psychological” type of intervention is not in the spirit of
“low cost-high impact” nudges of individuals used to overcome cognitive biases,
they do work on individuals’ mental models and were coded as psychological
factors in this review of project documents. For example,

      •   the objective of the São Paulo Trains and Signaling Project was to improve the
          level of service provided to urban rail tra nsport users in the São Paulo
          Metropolitan Region in a safe and cost-efficient manner. The project
          identified low-income urban households as the beneficiaries (as the main
          users of public transportation) and discussed the potential for modal shift
          from increasing the quality of the system—new passenger rail cars providing
          greater comfort and more frequent trains reducing wait time, thereby
          increasing the attractiveness of the rail system. By far, the largest impact was
          expected to be from increasing the mobility (access to the system) of low-
          income individuals.

A missing link between these interventions and possible success is the link between
diagnostic work and design. The little diagnostic work done to identify behavioral
barriers to, say, modal shift or transport safety rarely resulted in a targeted
intervention to address said barrier (figure F.1). Twenty-eight (28 of 48) projects
identified a barrier to either modal shift or transport safety and designed an activity
to address the barrier. Of the 28, 20 were infrastructure projects.

Results frameworks at approval captured behavior change outputs and outcomes to
a greater extent than did monitoring and evaluation. There was little monitoring of
behavior change activities during implementation (table F.4.)

Note: Many projects which were infrastructure-only also included outcome indicators associated with increases in modal
shift (from private to public transport). These are outcomes, which are due to behavior changes, that were not accompanied
by an explicit intervention to “push” individuals to change their mode of transport.

Service Delivery Lens: Application to Urban Transport
BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

IEG has organized its evaluation work program (FY17–19) into three Strategic
Engagement Areas (SEAs): Sustained Service Delivery for the Poor, Inclusive
Growth, and Environmental Sustainability. These SEAs were introduced to generate


                                                                                                                        147

deeper insights across evaluations to enhance dialogue with the World Bank Group
in an effort to better influence its work. The SEAs cover a large share of the World
Bank Group’s efforts that are directed toward achieving sustainable development
outcomes.

This appendix presents the application of work undertaken by IEG to develop a
Framework for the Evaluation of Service Delivery (a critical component of the
Sustained Service Delivery SEA) for the Urban Transport Evaluation. The purpose of
this exercise is to provide descriptive statistics and information to help identify how
appraisal documents conceptualize key service delivery concepts, as reflected in the
IEG Working Paper and Framework (IEG 2016) to evaluate Service Delivery in
sector evaluations (see figure 1). It is important to note that IEG’s Framework for the
Evaluation of Service Delivery (IEG 2016) provides a comprehensive frame covering
the range of variables to be addressed and taken into account with a view to
designing an effective system of service delivery. The original plan and protocol
(figure 2) were simplified to maintain the expected delivery timeline of the Urban
Transport evaluation as well as two other sector evaluations currently underway
(Water and Sanitation, and Essential Health Services).

The simplified, specific evaluation questions to which this revised approach
responds, are:

      •   To what extent is information on Service Delivery contained in project
          appraisal documents?
      •   How is Service Delivery described and operationalized in appraisal
          documents and what is the quality of this?

Methods
The simplified analytical protocol was applied 3 to a randomly selected sample of 68
World Bank investment operations 4 drawn from core World Bank operations
identified by the urban transport evaluation.5 Content from appraisal documents
was compiled in an Access database to facilitate ease of handling, visualization, and
analysis. One evident limitation of this method is that appraisal documents may not
explicitly address or adequately discuss every aspect contained in the framework;
for example, documents may not discuss elements that are already being supported
or implemented by the client (government), but which form part of the service
delivery ‘chain.’ Thus, finding that appraisal documents do not describe a service
delivery concept does not mean that nothing has been done within the broader
delivery effort outside the World Bank project to address it. However, where the
exercise consistently notes the absence of discussion of key service delivery

concepts, it does raise questions, at a minimum, about the adequacy of the planning
document.

TO WHAT EXTENT IS INFORMATION ON SERVICE DELIVERY CONTAINED IN PROJECT APPRAISAL DOCUMENTS?

IEG reviewed a sample of 68 appraisal documents to determine whether key service
delivery concepts (figure 1) were discussed. Analytical assessments were also made
of relevant information identified through the review and appraisal process. The
subsequent sections describe the information related to the key, over-arching
concepts covered in the framework as follows: enabling conditions, inputs,
implementation, outputs, and outcomes. In each instance descriptive statistics
related to figure 1 (and revised analytical protocol—see figure 2) are provided.

Almost all projects in the sample refer to upstream engagement with a view to providing
support for policy development, regulatory frameworks, or institutional
mechanisms. However, appraisal documents provide varying levels of detail about
specific capacity-building topics or activities to be supported. Consequently, it is not
possible to quantify the number of operations supporting specific areas of interest
such as monitoring and evaluation, budgeting, procurement, or public financial
management. On the other hand, documents clearly identify the proposed recipients
of capacity development, including policy makers, and other ministry and
municipality officials. It is notable that those further down the chain in the provision
of urban transport services, such as operators (of rail or bus) or traffic officers, are
typically excluded from consideration or direct support through World Bank
projects. We recognize that capacity building for these front-line service staff may be
addressed in some other manner or mechanism (for example, directly by central or
municipal government), or may have been deemed to be unsuitable for World Bank
support for one reason or another. Regardless of the reason for their exclusion from
support, the appraisal documents do not reference or otherwise explain how
capacity down the line is ensured.

Delivery challenges in urban transport are discussed in every appraisal document
reviewed with reference, for example, to sector concerns such as financing,
management, coordination, capacity, or adequacy/quality of infrastructure. More
specifically, issues such as inadequate traffic management practices, lack of
intermodal coordination, aging of or inadequate roads or fleet, and safety concerns
were discussed. The lack of qualified human resources (that is, technical capacity) at
the central ministry or service manager level (metro transit authority) is noted as a
consistent constraint in nearly every document reviewed (98 percent). Lack of
accountability (including the lack of accountability of front-line service staff) is also
identified as a pronounced challenge for effective service delivery (63 percent). That
said, and having identified such constraints, the documentation does not typically
identify specific challenges experienced by front-line service staff, nor their specific
capacity-building needs

Beyond the broad sector challenges, limited attention was placed upon contextual
conditions that might impinge upon effective delivery of urban transportation
services (i.e. bicycle, bus, rail, or roads). Only eight of the 69 appraisal documents
(12%) noted contextual conditions, which were then addressed in the design of the
operation as follows: political interference (one project); governance or corruption
issues (one project); issues with informal transport providers (one project); and
cultural attitudes or behaviors that would need to change to address either safety
concerns or modal shifts (five projects). The fact that relatively few appraisal
documents either discuss or engage with contextual issues can be interpreted as a
shortcoming based on the observation that technical or logistical solutions are not
sufficient to address delivery challenges (Kim 2012; Asis and Woolcock 2015).

IEG also reviewed whether specific beneficiary groups are targeted in the appraisal
documents, and whether project design was sensitive to the needs and demands of
citizen beneficiaries (and the heterogeneity of their needs) in order to be consistent
with World Bank Group policies. Twenty-eight appraisal documents (41 percent)
explicitly articulated an intention to reach disadvantaged groups as part of the
Project Development Objective (PDO) or as “Project/Targeted Beneficiaries.”
Among these 28 projects, ’the poor’ was most frequently identified (25 projects),
followed by women (seven projects), disabled persons (five projects), and the elderly
(three projects). Of these 28 projects, a needs analysis or social assessment was
conducted in 23 instances. Based on these exercises, identified needs or demands of
beneficiary groups were addressed, at least to some extent, in project design. Thus,
when specific needs were identified and understood, appropriate planning
occurred. However, as this was evident in only 28 of the 68 projects reviewed, this
suggests a gap in the content of appraisal documents with reference to the

aspirations of the World Bank Group strategy. It also suggests a requirement for
greater attention to be paid to the potentially diverse set of needs of passengers or
riders (service users) as represented, for example, by disabled persons, the elderly,
children, and/or women.

Almost all appraisal documents acknowledged cost issues for urban transport, with
specific reference to capital/investment costs (94% of projects), and to a lesser
extent, operations and maintenance costs (70%). Documents often commented on the
adequacy (or inadequacy) of the budget to cover the system needs and, in many
cases, documents suggest operating costs are or will be below expected revenue
generation. A minority of projects clearly discussed a cost recovery mechanism (40
per cent) such as user fees, charges, license fees, or fuel levies. Considering the
importance of sustainability, more extensive discussion and analysis of operations
and maintenance costs, and cost recovery mechanisms, may be an area for future
focus in Urban Transport.

 Rationale for selection of model                          13 (19%)

Information was collected to quantify the type of model(s) employed in operations
and whether a rationale was provided for the selection of the model. Because this
exercise was restricted to the appraisal document, information was not collected
with reference to how the model worked in the particular context, nor to outcomes
achieved. Table 4 shows the implementation models identified in the appraisal
documents that would be employed for metro, bus, road, and rail, noting that many
projects supported multiple subsectors. Appraisal documents varied in the level of
detail about the arrangements and in who (central government, municipal
government, private sector) had responsibility for regulating, financing, operating,
maintaining, and monitoring. Few documents provided an explicit rationale
describing why that implementation model was selected (13 out of 68), although the
rationale may have been implied in the discussion of sector context. As such, the
descriptions that follow are purely illustrative.

As per table 4, most models contain a hybrid of shared responsibility between
central and municipal government. Within the sample reviewed, most projects use
either government provision or public-private partnership; there is little pure
private sector provision. Bus and road were more frequently delivered via
government provision, while metro and rail more often employed public-private
partnerships.

Illustrative examples of government provision of urban transport include:

    •   In roads, central government manages the national road network, and
        provides capital funding and some maintenance funding. Municipal
        governments manage the urban road network and often have significant
        responsibility for maintenance funding.
    •   In commuter rail, central government creates a public sector rail company,
        and provides capital funding and operating budget. The public sector rail
        company operates and maintains the rail service.
    •   In metro, central government approves the municipal government’s plans for
        a metro/subway system, or may have provided some capital funding, with
        the municipal government providing the majority of funding and creating a
        municipal agency to operate and manage the metro/subway system.
    •   In bus, central and/or decentralized government provides capital funding
        and creates a municipal agency to operate bus services. The central and/or
        decentralized government may regulate the sector by determining the hours
        of services, the routes, and scope of responsibilities.

Illustrative examples of public-private partnership in urban transport include:

    •   In metro, the central and/or decentralized government provided capital
        funding and owned the infrastructure and rolling stock. Private sector
        provided metro services under concession contracts.

      •   In bus, the central and/or decentralized government provided capital
          funding and is responsible for construction of bus system infrastructure (BRT
          corridors, bus terminals, and depots). The private sector provided equipment
          (bus fleet, fare collection system, maintenance services) and delivered bus
          services under concession contracts. In some cases, the central/decentralized
          government also established a public sector entity to regulate and monitor the
          bus services.
      •   In roads, the central and/or decentralized government owned and managed
          the road networks but contracted out road maintenance (routine, periodic, or
          emergency) to the private sector. In a small number of cases, central
          government contracted out toll road operations to the private sector.
      •   In commuter rail, the role for the central and/or decentralized government
          was provision of capital funding for infrastructure and rolling stock. Private
          sector provided rail services under concession contracts.

Private provision was not used to implement roads or commuter rail, or
metro/subway. In the five instances where private provision was used for bus
services, there was no public transport sector in place. In these cases, there was no
funding or regulation by the government, and bus services (in the form of
minibuses) were operated by individual owners or operators.

 Inclusion of Service monitoring system                    43 (63%)

A majority of projects (63 percent) supported the development of a monitoring
system (beyond project-specific monitoring), which is another way to evaluate
delivery (or to process conditions related to delivery). Most of these systems would,
if they became operational, relate to: environmental monitoring (air quality,
emissions), passenger information, or traffic management and road safety.

Few projects (16 percent) included reference to accountability or other mechanisms
designed to allow citizens (service users) to provide feedback on services.
Mechanisms that were evident include: an SMS text reporting system through which
users can report service delays, cleanliness of vehicles, issues with stations or driver

behavior, and fare ticketing problems; a website and dedicated telephone line for
complaints and suggestions; and creation of a permanent consulting council that
included NGOs to discuss progress for public transport. Operations containing these
mechanisms noted the potential for understanding whether passenger expectations
were being met, facilitating communication among stakeholders, or resolving
problems. Given that most appraisal documents identify lack of accountability as a
constraint on delivery, it is surprising that such a limited number of operations
explicitly identify the presence of mechanisms that will allow for customer or
beneficiary accountability and feedback.

IEG reviewed project indicators (outputs and outcomes) to establish what, from a
service delivery perspective, projects sought to track and achieve.

At a basic level, almost all project designs include indicators to track service delivery
outcomes (See table 7). Indicators of utilization (53percent) and quality (68 percent)
were most often tracked in the sample of urban transport operations analyzed.
Satisfaction was set to be tracked in only 22 percent of cases (we note, however, that
some authors—for example, Fiszbein, Ringold, and Rogers 2011—have suggested
that tracking satisfaction levels may not be reliable because expectations in
development contexts may be low, promoting beneficiaries to report a high level of
satisfaction).). Affordability (3 percent), and reliability (4 percent) were rarely
included as indicators to track service delivery in the sample reviewed. Table 7
provides examples of relevant indicators in projects, and provides detail where there
is disaggregation by beneficiary group.

Projects predominantly monitor transport performance (59 projects) with reference
to the number of trains running during peak and off peak hours, end-to-end travel
time on bus rapid transit corridor, and road conditions. Efficiency is monitored with

reference to improved bus fuel efficiency, passengers per sq. km on rail, or volume
(i.e. volume of traffic). Forty-nine projects also included intermediate
outcome/outcome indicators in the results framework that measured outcomes
more directly experienced by the beneficiaries, such as: increased perception of
safety in walking and cycling; level of user satisfaction with transfer terminals;
transport share of household expenditure. However, few projects planned to collect
data disaggregated by beneficiary groups. Only one project contained a transport
related output in relation to disabled persons or elderly (i.e. bus stops with
enhanced accessibility).

How is Service Delivery Conceptualized?
Capacity development in support of effective service delivery is predominantly
conceptualized (within the appraisal documents reviewed) as upstream engagement
involving support restricted to the higher-level public sector agency staff. Capacity
development in urban transport projects supported by the World Bank does not

                                                         TWO LENSES: BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND SERVICE DELIVERY
typically address the needs of front-line service staff (for example, operators of rail,
bus, and traffic police).

Appraisal documents present sector challenges with a focus upon the ministry or
municipal government, but lack detailed discussion of financial sustainability. Most
documents provided technical solutions without addressing conditions that would
impinge upon effective delivery of urban transportation services. Some authors have
pointed out “every environment has its own distinct social and political
characteristics, and solutions have to be either drawn from, or adapted to them”
(Brixi, Lust, and Woolcock (2015, vi). When these aspects were described in
documents, they were addressed within the project design and arrangements.

Few projects established mechanisms to solicit ongoing feedback from service users,
and few projects plan to track disaggregated, beneficiary-related outputs and
outcomes. We conclude that without the insights gained from beneficiaries, it is
difficult to address relevant delivery-related challenges and, as a consequence, to
maximize improvements in citizen well-being. Focusing more upon the users of
transport aligns with the World Bank Group’s broader guidance on the importance
of social inclusion (World Bank 2013) and Systems of Cities: Harnessing Urbanization
for Growth and Poverty Alleviation (World Bank 2009), which envisage a more deeply
integrated voice of citizen beneficiaries.

1The review was limited to World Bank projects because IFC investments and MIGA
guarantees often lack explicit design elements, given the nature of their business models.
2Fifty projects were reviewed. One project was a duplicate and dropped. Another had no
documentation for review. Coding stopped when convergence was achieved, which
occurred at 48 projects.
3A research analyst familiar with the original Service Delivery Framework completed the
task in its entirety to minimize any issues of interpretative inconsistency that may arise due
to the use of the new approach.
4AAA, policy loans, or Additional Financing were not reviewed. The random sample
drawn for this exercise was 75 operations out of 104 operations contained within the UT
evaluation. Sixty-eight operations were analyzed, because Project Appraisal Documents for
seven operations could not be found.
5 IFC advisory and investment services were excluded from the sample because the
framework as a whole has less applicability to the IFC, focusing upon a broader system and
sector, beyond the scope of the IFC. We also note that the same sample was used for this
work and parallel work under the Strategic Engagement Area in relation to behavior
change, with a view to promoting further synergies for a planned chapeau product that will
draw upon and contrast findings across sectors and services.
6It is clear that system-level indicators such as reliability or sustainability are not
appropriate aspects to disaggregate by beneficiaries. However, coverage could be.
