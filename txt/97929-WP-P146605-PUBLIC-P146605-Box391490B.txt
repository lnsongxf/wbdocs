Executive Summary	                                                                                               8

Introduction	11

I.	    Economic growth and redistribution have generated significant poverty reduction in Brazil’s RMs	         14
A.	    GDP has consistently grown in RMs since 2004 but slightly slower than at the national level	             14
B.	    Economic growth has most benefitted the poor, resulting in declining inequality across and within RMs	   15
C.	    Monetary poverty has decreased considerably, especially in the North and Northeast,
	      but vulnerability remains a challenge	                                                                   16
D.	    Upward economic mobility has been strong in Brazil’s RMs	                                                17
E.	    The poor and vulnerable face specific challenges to their upward mobility	                               19

II.	   Labor markets, demographic changes, and transfers have been key to poverty and inequality reduction	     21
A.	    Labor income drove poverty and inequality reduction in Brazil’s RMs	                                     21
B.	    Improved labor market outcomes and policies increased labor incomes	                                     25
C.	    Gender differences persist in labor outcomes across RMs	                                                 25

III.	 Increased access to a range of services has almost eliminated multi-dimensional poverty	                  28
A.	 Access to basic goods and services is approaching universal coverage in RMs	                                28
B.	 Equitable access to quality education remains a problem	                                                    29

IV.	 Spatial inequities are pronounced within RMs – heightened by constrained mobility	                         33
A.	 Core municipalities have lower levels of poverty and higher access to services than peripheries
	 but are also more unequal	                                                                                    33
B.	 The effect of urban mobility on these spatial differences warrants further analysis	                        34

    Executive Summary


    I
         n the 20th Century, Brazil rapidly urbanized and is
         now not only an urban nation but a metropolitan
         one. Brazil’s sprawling regiões metropolitanas (metro-
    politan regions, or RMs, which are municipal clusters) are
    now home to almost 50 million people and much of the
    country’s economic vitality. The RM spatial level and its
    supporting governmental institutions have thus become
    critical to Brazil’s future development. While challenges
    remain for tackling deprivation in rural areas, poverty in
    Brazil is now predominantly urban. More than six in 10
    Brazilians in extreme poverty were living in urban settings
    as of 2012. Of these, over a fourth was concentrated in the
    10 largest RMs.

Brazil’s largest RMs achieved laudable progress both                 service delivery and safety nets (including the Bolsa
in poverty reduction and shared prosperity between                   Família cash transfer program).

     institutional structure in urban Brazil that has strong
     bearing on the design and implementation of policies,
     programs, and projects requiring coordination (Melo and

     acute challenges exist in getting municipalities, RM agen-
     cies, states and the federal government to work together
     toward common social and economic goals. While met-

     this level of governance directly impacts service delivery
     efficiencies and therefore strongly relates to policies re-
     garding poverty, vulnerability, and shared prosperity in
     urban settings.

    Box 1. States, municipalities and metropolitan regions in federal Brazil


    Article 25 of Brazil’s constitution, enacted in 1988, gives states the right to create metropolitan structures. This was a
    shift from the 1967 constitution, which had placed metropolitan regions under federal authority. While giving states
    the authority to create such bodies, the current constitution does not set any further requirements regarding their
    structure or funding.

    Further complicating the situation is that the 1988 constitution also established municipalities as full federation
    members. That is to say, the more than 5,000 municipalities that are scattered across Brazil today are not subordi-
    nated to states or to any structure created by states. They enjoy the same autonomy and sovereignty.

    While municipalities within an RM have a vested interest in working together given their proximity, any action
    undertaken by a metropolitan agency must be specifically agreed to by all municipalities involved. Incentives to
    coordinate vary considerably. The political economies of municipalities and metropolitan regions and their capacity
    to coordinate are thus determinant factors of success.

to 74% in Rio de Janeiro. Furthermore, there are large dif-
ferences in the racial composition of the RMs. While the
citizens of the RMs in the North and Northeast of Brazil
predominantly self-identify as pardos (mixed origin), the
RMs located in the South and Southeast have larger pop-
ulations that call themselves brancos (white). Across RMs,
the share of the population that self-identifies as pretos
(black) is relatively low, ranging from 3% to 12%, with the
exception of Salvador, where the figure is 27%.

Addressing challenges will require coordinated ac-
tions at the federal, state, metropolitan, and municipal
levels. Due to the federal nature of the country, Brazilian
states and municipalities have strong autonomy and sov-
ereignty. This in turn has major bearing on the implemen-
tation of policies that require all levels of government to
work together. In spite of the complexity of coordination,
metropolitan regions offer potential for poverty reduc-

          erty and vulnerability to more salient challenges. Since                                     in 2012
          2004, extreme poverty using the global line ($1.25 PPP
          per day) fell by over half, to reach 2.5% in 2012. Similarly
                                                                                                       15.6% are poor
          strong results are seen with regional lines but with inci-                                   38 % are vulnerable
          dence levels classifying a larger share of the metropoli-
          tan population as poor. Indeed, using the regional lines
          for extreme ($2.5 PPP) and moderate ($4 PPP) poverty, poverty is seen falling by two thirds and half, respectively,
          to reach 6.3% and 15.6% in 2012. While a similar reduction is seen with vulnerability, close to 40% of metropolitan
          Brazilians continue to live in a state of vulnerability to poverty as measured with the $4-$10 PPP lines.

          In recent years, R$70 and R$140 per capita per month, administrative poverty lines defined for the Bolsa Família
          and Brasil Sem Miséria programs, have been increasingly used in place of official poverty lines. Thus, the monetary
          poverty measures considered in the rest of this study refer to individuals, unless noted otherwise, with per capita
          household incomes between the following thresholds: poverty–below R$140, extreme poverty and the extreme
          poor–below R$70, the moderate poor–between R$70 and R$140, vulnerable–between R$140 and $$291, and mid-
          dle-class–R$291+.10 Cost of living is not taken into account in order to be consistent with national methodologies of
          measuring poverty in Brazil. As such, poverty comparisons between Brazil RMs and Brazil are likely more favorable
          for the former given that the cost of living in metropolitan areas is generally higher than average. The same applies
          for regional differences, particularly the South/Southeast and North/Northeast divide. See Annex 6 for more infor-
          mation about poverty lines in Brazil and see Annex 5 for a comparison of results adjusting and not-adjusting for
          cost of living.

          and vulnerability but levels vary substantially across thresholds.

     10  SAE recently updated its definition of the middle class in Brazil, raising the threshold income to R$291 per capita. It also defined three
     types of “middle class:” lower-middle class, R$291-441; “middle” middle class, R$441-R$641; and higher middle class, R$641-$1,019 (SAE, 2013).
     Vulnerability is defined as income per capita between R$140 and R$291. http://www.sae.gov.br/site/?p=17351#ixzz2h0ho0ALf.

       Box 3. Social Programs in Brazil’s RMs


       The Brazilian Government is implementing multiple programs to fight multidimensional poverty. These programs
       include Bolsa Família and Segurança Alimentar. Many are run by the Ministry of Social Development (MDS, Ministério
       do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate à Fome) as part of the Brasil Sem Miséria plan, which began in 2010. The flagship
       program against poverty, the conditional cash transfer (CCT) scheme Bolsa Família, dates to 2004. It provides R$70/
       month money to households in extreme poverty (based on an extreme poverty line of R$70 per month), with an
       additional R$30-32 for each child in the family. This can be higher based on conditions fulfilled by the family. The
       purpose of Bolsa Família and other CCT programs is to provide additional income to families that are below a given
       income threshold, provided that they fulfil certain conditions that help future human capital accumulation and over-
       all development. In the case of Bolsa Família, these conditions include school attendance for children between the
       ages of 6 and 17, participation in maternal and child health courses provided by the Health Ministry, and remaining
       up to date on vaccinations. Furthermore, households must have a child under the age of 17 or be expecting a child.

       A major portion of the extreme poor in Brazil’s RMs receive benefits from Bolsa Família, but the moderate poor are
       largely left out in some RMs. Percentages of RM populations receiving benefits from Bolsa Família range from 10%
       (Curitiba) to 31% (Fortaleza). This represents over 40% of registrants in the CadUnico in each RM. In seven out of
       the 10 RMs, the extreme poor are the majority of recipients of BF. This means that a large portion of the neediest is
       receiving social support. However, in RMs in the North and Northeast, which have some of the highest poverty rates,
       there may be little room left for the moderate poor to also benefit from social assistance. In these RMs, the share of
       the extreme poor registered in CadUnico but not receiving Bolsa Família benefits is lowest, but the gap between the
       moderate poor and extreme poor not receiving benefits is largest. In greater or lesser form, this pattern exists across
       RMs. This may be what is reflected in the reduced access to services and educational attainment of the moderate
       poor, discussed in section C.D of this report.18

          Box 4. Tax incentives and business registration simplification for reducing informality


          Micro and small enterprises (MSEs) play an important role in Brazil’s economy, employing 67% of the labor force and
          contributing 20% to the GDP, according to IBGE.19 MSEs are also critical for RMs’ development, employing about 60%
          of the workers in the largest RMs (RAIS and CAGED, 2013). Studies show that simplification of business registration
          procedures and streamlining of tax systems encourages MSEs to formalize, while formalization in turn leads to job
          creation and increases firm productivity, which could have positive implications for poverty reduction and shared
          prosperity. This pattern is especially important for RMs where informality continues to be a main issue, particularly
          for the poor and vulnerable.

          Prior to the mid-1990s, the complexity of the Brazilian tax system presented a serious constraint to MSEs’ growth
          and development and helped create high informality. To address this problem, the Brazilian Government imple-
          mented a new simplified tax system for micro (annual gross revenues up to R$120,000) and small firms (up to
          R$720,000) in 1996.20 Known as the SIMPLES, its goal was to reduce cost of doing business, facilitate tax payments
          and broaden the tax base. This hope was that this would facilitate growth of small, labor-intensive firms and enable
          them to compete with large firms. For that reason, SIMPLES explicitly excluded from program eligibility all activities
          that by law require the employment of professionals from regulated occupations.

          SIMPLES established a new progressive tax rate system that combined federal, state and municipal taxes into one.
          Businesses using SIMPLES were able to substitute up to eight taxes and social security contributions for a single tax
          rate on their annual gross revenues, with rates varying from 3% to 5% for micro-enterprises, and from 5.4% to 7% for
          small firms (Fan et al. 2008).21 Moreover, while the state and municipal taxes—the Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mer-
          cadorias e Prestação de Serviços (ICMS) and the Imposto Sobre Serviços (ISS)—were initially not included in SIMPLES,
          states and municipalities could enter into agreements with the Federal Government to transfer to it the collection
          of the corresponding taxes through an increase in the SIMPLES rates (Fajnzyblber et al. 2011).

          Several evaluations of this reform showed a significant positive impact on firm formalization leading to job creation
          and increased firm productivity (Monteiro and Assuncao, 2006; Fajnzyblber et al. 2011). Monteiro and Assuncao used
          the 1997 Urban and Informal Economy Survey (ECINF) which covered 40,000 firms in the Brazilian state capitals and
          metropolitan areas and applied difference-in-difference estimation method. They found that the SIMPLES reform
          increased formality by 13 percentage points, which in turn stimulated investment and switching of the firms from
          short-term to long-term projects. Fajnzylber et al., using the 1997 and 2003 ECINF and implementing a regression
          discontinuity analysis, also found that SIMPLES led to significant increase in formalization of enterprises. Moreover,
          formalization was associated with job creation, increase in capital intensity, and productivity.

            Other countries in LAC have implemented innovative reforms to encourage formalization of businesses. For exam-
            ple, Mexico in 2002 enacted the Rapid Business Opening (SARE) reform, which reduced the average number of days,
            procedures and office visits required to register a business. Evaluation of that reform using discriminatory analysis
     19 20 21
            showed that it significantly increased the number of formal businesses and generated wage employment (Bruhn, 2013).

     20  The definition of micro and small enterprises was amended in 2006: a firm was considered micro if its annual gross revenues were equal
     or less than R$240,000, and it was considered small if its annual gross revenues were between R$240,001 and R$2,400,000. In 2011, the pres-
     ident of Brazil proposed to increase the ceiling from R$240,000 to R$360,000 for micro firms, and from R$2.4 million to R$3.6 million for small
     firms. http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-business/tax-changes-for-small-businesses-in-brazil/#
     21  The taxes and contributions covered by SIMPLES included (1) corporate income tax (Imposto de Renda das Pessoas Jurídicas–IRPJ); (2)
     tax on industrialized products (Imposto sobre Produtos Insutrializados–IPI ); (3) social security contribution to fund unemployment insurance
     and other social programs (Contribução para o PIS/PASEP); (4) social security contribution on net profits (Contribução Social sobre o Lucro Liqui-
     do–CSLL); (5) social security contribution (Contribução para o Financiamiento da Seguridade Social–COFINS); and (6) employers’ social security
     contributions (Contribução para a Seguridade Social a cargo de Pessoa Jurídica).

          Box 5. Minimum wages in Brazil and its RMs


          Brazil’s first minimum wage was enacted in 1936 by President Getúlio Vargas. Following Courseuil and Servo (2002),
          Brazilian research on the topic can be divided into three groups: (1) papers that estimate the effect of minimum
          wage on wage distribution, (2) papers that investigate the relation with income distribution, and (3) papers that
          analyze other effects on the labor market.

          One possible challenge for empirically studying the effects of changes in the minimum wage is to determine a coun-
          terfactual or a control group that was not affected due to the simultaneous nature of changes for all individuals. For
          this, the literature has tended to concentrate on wage distribution analysis focusing on employed workers or, when
          analyzing issues related to poverty, doing these using aggregated measures. Barros et al. (2001) use PME data to identify
          who is affected by the minimum wage. Following individuals from 1995 to 1998, they decompose variation in pover-
          ty level and show that components of the minimum wage not related to labor markets significantly reduced poverty.

          Firpo and Reis (2007) show that a continuous increase of the minimum wage above inflation between 2001 and
          2005 caused a reduction in wage inequality from 30% to 60%, depending on the inequality measure used. Such
          effect on inequality is also found in Jales (2012) for the period between 2001 and 2009. In this paper, the author
          proposes a methodology for estimating the latent distribution of wages in the absence of the minimum wage policy.
          Using this framework, the author finds that the reduction in wage inequality was accompanied by an increase in
          unemployment and a reduction of the formal sector of the economy that consequently reduced labor tax revenues.

          Another topic in the literature begins with the creation of regional wage floors in 2000.24 Five states enacted this
          policy: Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, and Paraná. Moura and Neri (2008) present ev-
          idence of the impact for the first years of regional wage floors in Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul, finding that
          the floor is not binding for most of the firms paying lower salaries. Courseuil, Foguel and Hecksher (2012b) estimate
          the impact of wage floors on Parana and São Paulo using PNAD data and the methodology developed by Abadie,
          Diamond and Hainmueller (2010) known as synthetic control. They find positive effects on income and employment
          but only for some occupations. The establishment of regional floors also presents opportunity to use additional
          econometric tools to study poverty and unemployment. It further underlines the necessity of bringing a geograph-
          ical lens to the analysis, because regional floors can change wage distribution distinctly by state and occupation.

          Looking at RMs to assess how changing the minimum wage could affect wage distribution for the present analysis,
          the authors implement a regression discontinuity design (RD) for each of the RMs using the PNAD and following
          Lee (2008) and Lee and Lemieux (2010). The results show that for all except Rio and São Paulo, there is a peak
          around the minimum wage value. This shows that a large share of workers have their incomes concentrated at the
          minimum wage level and therefore changes in its level can substantially affect the labor market for the employed.

          Given the bunching of workers around the minimum wage line across RMs, a second step in the analysis involves
          looking at the possible effects this policy could have around the cut-off of wages distribution. The inference is
          that a worker receiving the minimum wage would expect his or her own wage to be exactly or barely above the
          minimum wage value. Thus, the authors of the present report look at the cut-off generated by the minimum wage
          value (wage demeaned equals wage less minimum wage values) to estimate the effect of the minimum wage on
          formality, schooling years, the probability of the head of household being a man, and access to assets. The results
          show a strong discontinuity when formality is used as a dependent variable, echoing the results of Jales (2012). This
          means that the implementation of a minimum wage policy against low wages has the adverse effect of reducing
          the proportion of formal contract vacancies in the labor market, particularly in RMs where wages are concentrated
          around the minimum wage or below it. However, no impact is found on other outputs when restricting the analysis
          to the occupied population.

     24



     24  Regional floors vary but can’t be lower than the federal mandatory statutory minimum wage. Moura and Neti (2008) document how
     some firms do not pay the wage floor in spite of the law.

 Females continue to have worse labor outcomes than
 males across indicators such as hourly wage, infor-
 mality, labor force participation, unemployment, and
 part-time employment. But, since 2004, the differences
 in rates between males and females of all of these indica-
 tors except for hourly wage have lessened. However, the
 fact that the difference in wages slightly increased over
 the same time period indicates that progress towards
 gender equity in the labor market is not extending to fi-
 nancial outcomes. When controlling for factors that may
 affect wages, such as migration status, union affiliation,
 weekly hours worked, informality, age, and education, the
 wages that women living in RMs earned was significantly
 less than men’s. In fact, being a woman was the largest
 determinate of the variables considered, and, alarmingly,
 this negative effect increased, especially for poor women,
 from 2004 to 2012. (See Annex 15.) Continued gender
 segmentation in labor markets may also contribute to
 these differential outcomes, which show a higher share of
 women in services and a significantly larger share of men
 in industrial employment (Figure 21).

             Box 6. Measuring non-income-based levels of social welfare in metropolitan Brazil


             Though its philosophical roots reach back to Aristotle, non-monetary approaches to welfare only became prevalent
             within economic literature in the late 20th century, following Amartya Sen’s seminal Tanner Lectures on basic ca-
             pability equality delivered at Stanford University in 1979. Since then, various approaches to measuring well-being
             through non-monetary indicators have been applied to assess poverty and inequality in developing countries. One
             such indicator is the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), developed by Sabina Alkire and James Foster. The MPI
             examines the intensity of deprivation across indicators that are believed to be closely linked with well-being, such as
             education, housing conditions, and the accumulation of assets. When a household lacks access to a certain number
             of these basic services or goods, it is considered to be “multi-dimensionally poor.” (See Annex 9.)
             Alkire et al. (2014) argue that the MPI can directly compare well-being outcomes between urban and rural locations.
             However, evidence suggests that for a more precise understanding of well-being, the MPI should be tailored to
             the location. Generally, income-based poverty lines correspond to different levels of well-being in urban and rural
             settings due to different market structures in those areas and generally underestimate urban levels of poverty. This
             makes the MPI an important component to compare settings.29 However, to characterize urban poverty beyond its
             comparability with rural settings, the MPI should be tailored to factors relevant to life in cities. Having “access” to
             a particular service is not enough in an urban setting, where population density may impinge on quality of such
             services as sewage, water and trash, and where lapses in service are more problematic. To enhance the urban MPI,
             indicators of quality of life in urban settings that are not as applicable in rural settings, such as home eviction rates,
             lack of transportation, and exposure to crime should be considered. However, to date there is no good repository
             of such information.
             In order to tailor the MPI to urban settings in Brazil, more and better data is needed. The national household survey
             (PNAD) is limited in sample size and scope of questions asked during the interview, while the Census faces a similar
             issue of question scope and comes out only every 10 years. Data being gathered by municipal and state govern-
             ments and service providers are therefore key to better tracking and understanding basic well-being in urban Brazil.
             Policy makers need to adopt systems to easily share and connect these data so as to create a more comprehensive
             picture of well-being at a more disaggregated geographic level. Alternatively, specific surveys can be undertaken in
             order to directly collect this type of data. Since 2008, the state of Minas Gerais has been doing this in its Travessia
     29 30
             program, which uses the MPI to target areas most in need of funding and technical assistance to provide services
             and access to housing.30

         Box 7. Quality of education indicators have improved in RMs


         All RMs increased average years of education and reduced educational inequality between 2004 and 2012. Across
         metropolitan Brazil, average years of education increased by 1.1 years. In 2012, the Distrito Federal and the largest
         RMs, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, achieved the highest average educational attainment rates (more than 9 years),
         while Recife (8.2 years) and Fortaleza (7.6 years) had the lowest. All RMs performed better than their respective
         states in both 2004 and 2012, with the rates differing most for the middle performers. In general, the RMs with high-
         er levels of educational attainment had lower levels of educational inequality.31 (See Figure 25.) This indicates the
         importance of increasing educational attainment, particularly in lagging RMs such as Recife and Fortaleza, where
         the education Ginis were 0.32 and 0.36, respectively.
         Grade repetition and drop-out rates have improved across RMs but there is still variation among RMs. From 2005 to
         2012, every RM lowered its rates of dropouts and grade failures for elementary education. On average, RMs cut the
         dropout rate by half to reach just 3% and decreased the grade failure rate by 4 percentage points to 10% in 2012.
         (See Figure 26.) These rates are similar to those seen across all of Brazil. In 2012, RMs with the highest grade failure
         rate also had the highest dropout rates. This was notably true for Salvador, which had a grade failure rate more
         than 60% higher than the overall RM rate and, despite improving the most over the time period, retained one of the
         highest dropout rates across RMs. The reverse applied in the best-performing RMs. For instance, São Paulo’s dropout
         rate was under 1% and its grade failure rate was half that of all Brazil RMs. The reason why some RMs (notably São
         Paulo) have lower failure rates could be related to a policy called Progressão Continuada (Continued Progressions)
         or Aprendizagem em Ciclos (Learning in Cycles). In São Paulo, this policy allows students to fail only at the end of a
         school cycle (fifth grade or ninth grade). The program has been effective in cutting drop-out rates, but its impact on
         learning is controversial.
         Looking at an index of school infrastructure and teacher training rates shows that, on average, schools located in RMs
         improved and performed slightly better than schools overall. The main reason is that the RMs’ municipal schools
         perform better than municipal schools overall. Differences between the performances of state schools are more
         limited. Between 2007 and 2012, school infrastructure and teachers’ training rates improved across RMs. Especially
         impacting training was a substantial increase in teachers’ access to higher education. As of 2012, São Paulo and
         Belo Horizonte performed well in both infrastructure and teacher training. Rio de Janeiro performed better than the
         Brazil RM rate in infrastructure but below the Brazil RM rate in training. Meanwhile, RMs located in the Northeast
         all performed below the Brazil RM average in both.

            Box 7. Quality of education indicators have improved in RMs (cont.)


            Still, inequity in access to quality education – a key vector of upward mobility – is particularly concerning in RM set-
            ting. More than 60 percent of the upper class and over 15 percent of the middle class children go to private schools
            in the largest metropolitan regions of Brazil (Figure 27). Not surprisingly, these rates are even lower for the children
            residing vulnerable and poor households, hovering respectively at less than 10 and 5 percent. Across metropolitan
            areas, opting for private school is the most prevalent in the North and Northeast RMs, where close to 90 percent
            of the upper class send their children to private schools and the rates even increase for the poor and vulnerable
            households. These results suggest that school quality is a particularly prevalent issue in the RM of Recife, Fortaleza
            and Salvador, although private school enrollment rates are also significant in the RM Belém and Rio.

    most dangerous RM in Brazil, has become the safest.
    The murder rate doubled dramatically in the RM Fortaleza, while in the RM Recife, it fell by close to one third of the
    2008 rate. Recife’s success in reducing homicides may reflect Pernambuco state’s Pacto Pela Vida, a public safety
    initiative that began in 2007 and has 138 different programs. The state’s large reductions in poverty and inequality
    (the largest across all RMs) may also have played a role, as various studies have linked poverty and inequality to
    crime rates. (See Fajnzylber, Lederman, and Loayza, 2002 and Poveda 2011.) Given the changing dynamics of crime
    and the relatively high homicide rates across the country, more research into security programs such as the Pacto
    Pela Vida or Rio de Janeiro’s Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora (UPP – Pacifying Police Unit) and their effect on social
    welfare would help policy makers tackle both issues of crime and of poverty and inequality facing Brazilians. While
    governments at the national and state level have started to invest in better monitoring and evaluation systems of
    crime and violence, more remains to be done to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the numerous citizen security
    programs developed over the past couple of years. To do so will require not only information pertaining to the
    incidence of crime and violence but also disaggregated information on the programs themselves such as geo-refer-
    enced funding amounts, police force capabilities, crime reporting, and the dates of implementation or scale-up of
    any actions to account and disentangle the effects of those interventions.

          Transport infrastructure figures prominently in Brazil’s development strategy. In 2013 the State of São Paulo allocat-
          ed almost two thirds of its fiscal budget to the sector, with over 22% alone earmarked for the expansion and oper-
          ation of the Metro in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (RMSP). Road and rail investments in urban mobility rank
          among the top investment priorities in Brazil’s large cities. These programs have traditionally focused on improving
          efficiency, reducing emissions, and promoting the competitiveness of cities. But more recently, policies aimed at
          addressing the needs of the urban poor and other underprivileged groups are increasingly gaining a salient role
          in the transport agenda. Corseuil and Pereira (2012a) shows that the monthly transport costs of the lowest decile
          represented over 20% of their income v. 15% on average, and 13% for the highest decile in 2009.



     34  In particular, the use of administrative registries such as the
     RAIS or the CadUnico in connection with the census and commuting
     data (using GTFS data of public transportation) offers much potential
     to refine the analysis in metropolitan and peri-metropolitan settings.
     Exploratory cross-sectoral discussions confirm the possibility of such
     analysis and its relevance for Brazil. (TBC)

      Box 9. Towards more inclusive urban transport: The RMs São Paulo and Rio (cont.)


      Over the last 20 years, state and metropolitan governments have combined policy and infrastructure initiatives to
      provide the more disadvantaged with improved access to opportunities. On the policy side, municipal and state au-
      thorities subsidized peripheral residents’ using the integrated fare scheme known as “Bilhete Unico Integrado” (BIU).
      As a result, the share of household income in RMSP dedicated to transport fell by half for the moderate and extreme
      poor to 9% and 13%, respectively. The BUI policy and associated investments in public transportation have enabled
      low-income people to travel more often and access previously unreachable districts in the search for higher-paying
      and better-quality jobs and opportunities. The impact evaluation for the inter-municipal BUI in the Metropolitan
      Region of Rio de Janeiro (RMRJ) shows, for instance, that the policy increased the number of formally employed
      people in the municipalities with BUI, particularly in peripheral areas.

      On the infrastructure side, significant investments in the suburban rail/metro network increased physical accessi-
      bility to formal jobs, particularly in peripheral areas. In the RMSP, 150,000 low-income families gained access, on
      average, to an additional 2.5 potential jobs within a 45-minute radius as a direct effect of Metro Line 4 implemen-
      tation. In addition to large-scale transport projects, Brazilian cities have in the last few years experimented with
      models of mobility consisting of medium- and low-capacity systems aimed exclusively at integrating low-income
      no-go areas into the fabric of the city. Examples of such “pro-poor” transport infrastructure can be found in the RM
      Rio, such as the aerial cable car system (teleferico) in the informal settlements of Complexo do Alemão and Providên-
      cia, and the Rubem Braga elevator connecting the Metro with a favela in a central district. On a daily basis, each of
      these modes serves between 8,000 and 10,000 people residing in low-income neighborhoods. While more nuanced
      analysis is needed to assess the impact on job creation35, land value and uses, and other welfare outcomes, these
      systems have undoubtedly enhanced citywide accessibility and transport mode choices in formerly underserved
      communities. Perhaps more importantly, the new integration and connectivity have increased a sense of belonging
      among residents of the favelas.

     Conclusion


     T
              he last decade brought significant welfare gains
              to metropolitan Brazil. Solid growth in these
              economic powerhouses helped drive extreme
     poverty down from 4.7% in 2004 to 2.3% in 2012 and pov-
     erty from 14.7% to 4.7%. The incomes of the bottom 40
     grew by 7.7% a year, compared to 4.7% for the RM mean.
     Moreover, there were signs of income convergence, as the
     traditionally poorer Northeastern RMs experienced faster
     gains in both poverty reduction and shared prosperity
     than the other seven RMs. Overall, growth and higher la-
     bor incomes were the catalyzing force behind these gains,
     accounting for 95% of the fall in extreme poverty. Howev-
     er, in the three RMs in the Northeast (Fortaleza, Salvador
     and Recife), redistribution also played an important role.

     Still, while poverty has fallen to just 4.7% in metropol-
     itan Brazil, a significant number of people (2.6 million)
     remain poor and an even larger number of people (6.5
     million) are vulnerable to sliding back into poverty.
     Furthermore, despite their impressive gains, the three
     northeastern RMs and northern RM Belém remain the
     poorest, with poverty rates exceeding 8%, almost double
     the average for metropolitan areas. These four RMs also
     have the lowest levels of access to sanitation and second-
     ary education, and the highest levels of private school en-
     rollment for middle and upper class children—suggest-
     ing significant quality problems in their schools. While
     these RMs made important progress in reducing income
     inequality, there are important spatial differences within
     them. Poverty remains higher in their inner peripheral
     municipalities compared to their core capital cities and la-
     bor market opportunities less attractive (lower wages and
     higher informality). The socioeconomic gaps between

     Annex 14. Oaxaca-Blinder Recentered Regression (RIF) for
     core/inner periphery and core/outer periphery of the RMs of
     Brazil’s North/Northeast and Southeast, 2010




     Let’s consider two groups: A and B. The overall change in the distributional statistic v of per capita income Y overtime
     can be defined as:

     Where F is the cumulative distribution. Following Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2007, 2009) we can add and subtract the
     counterfactual distribution statistic                  for obtaining the Oaxaca-Blinder distribution



     where					                                          is the structure effect or the difference due to changes in coefficients
     and 				                                          is the composition effect or the difference explained by changes in charac-
     teristics between the two groups.

     The standard Oaxaca-Blinder method (Oaxaca, 1973; Blinder, 1973) is a particular case of the above equation where we
     decompose the difference in mean wages. Typically applied to analyze difference in wages (for instance, between men
     and women), it can be interpreted as follows: if the wage structure of the reference group was held constant, how much
     of the gap could be explained by the differences in characteristics?

     However, the traditional OB method presents limitations. Indeed, while decomposing the mean is fairly straightfor-
     ward, thanks to the statistical properties of the expected value, decomposing quantiles is not. In the former, thanks
     to the law of iterated expectations (an extension of the law of total expectations— LTE), the estimated coefficient of a
     simple OLS regression can be interpreted as the effect of a chance on the mean value of the covariate on the uncondi-
     tional mean value of the dependent variable. On the other hand, the coefficient in the conditional quantile regression
     can only be interpreted as the effect of a change in the mean value of the covariates on the T th conditional quantile of
     the dependent variable, as the law of iterated expectation does not hold. Instead, the two-step method introduced by
     Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2007, 2009) replaces the dependent variable Y by the recentered inﬂuence function RIF(y;v)
     of the statistic ν. The recentering consists of adding back the distributional statistic ν to the inﬂuence function IF(y;ν):
     RIF(y;ν) = ν + IF(y;ν)..37 Hence we can apply OLS to obtain regression coefficients from RIF transformed variables and
     go back to the standard Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions. This allows generating counterfactuals for any distributional
     statistic like quantiles and Gini.

     In the present analysis, we apply the two-step method to provide a more granular view on the metropolitan dynamics
     between the center of the metropolitan region (i.e., its capital), the inner periphery of the metropolitan region, and its
     immediate outer periphery. Previous works have used mean decomposition methods to explain disparities between
     urban and rural areas (Ravallion and Wodon, 1999), and between regions and within regions (López-Acevedo and Sk-
     oufias, 2010). A more recent paper explores its application to intra-city welfare taking the case of Bogotá (Aguilar and
     Yepes, 2013). To the best of our knowledge, the application of the RIF method in combination with the Oaxaca-Blinder
     decomposition has not been used to look at metropolitan spatial disparities.

means that measures of inequality that are derived from
household survey data may not adequately capture the
full magnitude of changes in inequality if top earners
are not represented in the samples. However, since the
shared prosperity measure places close to no weight
on anyone above the 40th percentile, nonresponse of
top earners has a relatively small effect on the measure.
When the rich completely drop out of the survey, the
“bottom” 40 percent will somewhat overstate the location
of the 40th percentile, but the effect of this on the mean of
the bottom 40 percent is much smaller than the change in
the mean of the distribution and the measure of inequal-

one-room apartments running back from the street along
both sides of a narrow passageway).

The IBGE’s favela definition itself is problematic. There are
many settlements “of 51 or more shacks” that have gone
unnoticed by the authorities, either because they are ad-
jacent to another favela, between two conjuntos or in a
particularly remote area. “Located on public or private
property” is meaningless, because all housing is on pub-
lic or private property, and this definition doesn’t speci-
fy whether the land is being occupied legally or illegally.
“Characterized by disordered occupation” only applies to
some favelas, because others consist of very ordered vil-
las – classic workers housing on both sides of a narrow
passageway with utilities and drainage running down
the center of it, for example. As for “without the benefit
of public services,” it is well-known that older favelas are
fully serviced (for instance, in Rio), whether as a result of
government upgrading or the hard work of its residents
(Perlman, 2009).

The prevalence of subnormal agglomerations is induced
and compounded by Brazil’s large housing deficit. Indeed,
like other countries in LAC, Brazil faces an acute problem
of housing scarcity, evident in the 8 million- unit “housing
deficit” in 2011—a climb from 6.4 million units in 2005. Of
this, 90% relates to the lowest income bracket. For many
Brazilians, especially the poor, high property prices have
made housing unaffordable, and poor households may
in fact pay a higher price in slum areas relative to formal
dwellings due to the low supply elasticity of housing in
those areas (Abramo, 2003). For instance, according to a
recent study by the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB, 2012), around 62% of families in São Paulo found it
too expensive to own a house.
