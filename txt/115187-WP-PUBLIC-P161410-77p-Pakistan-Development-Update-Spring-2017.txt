ongoing reforms       emerging concerns suggest that renewed policy emphasis is required on
                      macroeconomic stability—to prevent the country from losing the impressive gains
                      achieved over the past four years—and other structural reforms such as those
                      required in the energy sector. While the fe deral government necessarily carries the
                      majority of this burden, provincial governments also have a part to play. The special
                      sections of this update analyze some of the speciﬁc challenges facing Pakistan’s most
                      populous province, Punjab, including increasing own-source revenue, equipping
                      youth with employable skills and ensuring the poor share in the beneﬁts of growth.
                      Punjab, along with federal and other provincial governments, is also confronted with
                      the urgent task of lifting agricultural productivity and addressing distortive subsidies,
                      which are impeding growth.

                            expected 6.1 percent in FY17. Services, which comprise 59 percent of the economy,
                            are expected to grow at a steady 5.6 percent in FY17. See Section A1 for an extended
                            discussion of the real sectors of the economy.

The ﬁscal deﬁcit is         Very soon after the country successfully completed the IMF EFF program, Pakistan
growing for the ﬁrst        has seen a weakening of several of the macroeconomic indicators that improved
time in three years         under the program. The country’s ﬁscal balance is a key example. After falling
                            signiﬁcantly over the past three years, Pakistan’s consolidated 1 ﬁscal deﬁcit increased
                            to 2.4 percent of GDP in H1FY17, 0.6 of a percentage point higher than in the same
                            period last year. This was largely due to weakening growth in federal tax revenues and
                            a signiﬁcant contraction in federal non-tax revenues. Consolidated expenditure
                            increased by 11 percent, albeit largely in growth-enhancing development spending,
                            while total revenue fell by 0.7 percent. This represents a signiﬁcant reversal of the
                            federal government’s consistent ﬁscal consolidation effort. See Section A2 for further
                            discussion of ﬁscal accounts.

The trade deﬁcit is         The current account deﬁcit widened in the ﬁrst nine months of FY17 after exports
increasing, partially       declined by 1.2 percent and imports increased by 14.2 percent compared with the
offset by                   same period in FY16. The decline in exports, which continues a downward trend that
remittances, CPEC           began in FY15, was largely driven by textiles, which comprise 59 percent of total
and other ﬁnancial          exports. Structural bottlenecks within Pakistan combined with low growth in
ﬂows                        destination markets resulted in weakened textile exports at both the high and low
                            ends of the value chain. The signiﬁcant trade deﬁcit was partially offset by
                            remittances. Remittances, which are historically a major source of import ﬁnancing,
                            are also starting to taper off, declining for the ﬁrst time in over a decade. This was
                            largely driven by deteriorating economic conditions in GCC countries, which account
                            for almost two-thirds of Pakistan’s remittances. Remittances from GCC countries fell
                            by 4.5 percent in Jul-Mar FY17. The overall balance recorded a deﬁcit of US$1.1
                            billion during Jul-Mar FY17 compared to a surplus of US$1.5 billion in the same
                            period in FY16. Consequently, Pakistan’s ofﬁcial reserves fell from a high of US$18.1
                            billion in June 2016 to US$16.5 billion by the end of March 2017, equating to only
                            3.6 months of goods and services. See Section A3 for further discussion on the
                            balance of payments.

Inﬂation increased          Inﬂation has remained within a tolerable range and the State Bank of Pakistan has

                            8.6 percent during H1FY17, mostly driven by the textiles sector, although loans are
                            evenly distributed across working capital, ﬁxed investment and trade ﬁnance. Bank
                            proﬁtability is weakening in a low interest rate environment and as government debt
                            declines, but remains healthy. See Section A4 for further discussion of monetary
                            policy and the ﬁnancial sector.

towards external         growth, however, will rely upon sustained progress on structural reforms—
shocks                   notwithstanding the speed bumps experienced in H1FY17—and further
                         strengthening of the international economy. Despite declining remittances, Pakistan
                         is, on balance, beneﬁtting from low oil prices, thus a sharp increase in international
                         prices would worsen the trade deﬁcit and present ﬁscal risks in the form of an increase
                         in energy subsidies. See Sections B1 and B3 for discussion of the outlook and risks
                         respectively.

After making             Since coming to power in 2013, Pakistan’s government has implemented an ambitious
meaningful gains in      economic reform program. As a result, external and internal macroeconomic balances

momentum is              taxation, the energy sector and the business environment. As the government nears

                         resurgence of circular debt. FBR performance in tax collection is below target, after
                         several years of very strong performance. Reforms in areas that require collaboration
                         between federal and provincial governments remain challenging. Reform momentum
                         will need to continue to maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate growth. See
                         Section B2 for a further discussion on the status of structural reforms.

                         they remain only 25 percent of their estimated potential. The World Bank estimates
                         Punjab’s revenue pote ntial at Rs. 432 billion, compared with an actual collection in
                         FY16 of Rs. 108 billion. This tax gap is driven by a mixture of tax policy and
                         administration shortcomings. Particular challenges include: jurisdictional overlaps
                         between different levels of government; large tax exemptions; low compliance;
                         weaknesses in tax administration; and weak coordination among provincial
                         administration bodies. The most signiﬁcant tax gaps are associated with the General
                         Sales Tax on Services and the Urban Immoveable Property Tax, which could vastly
                         increase their collections by eliminating exemptions, increasing the range of services
                         or properties subject to the taxes, and thro ugh more accurate data on the services
                         sector and property valuations. See Section C1 for further discussion of Punjab’s tax
                         gap.

Skills development       Skills development and training is another policy area in which provinces play an
could improve the        important role—made particularly urgent by Pakistan’s emerging demographic youth
employability of         bulge. Despite robust growth in Punjab over the past decade, the province’s economy
Pakistan’s growing       has struggled to create enough jobs for its growing youth population. Although the
youth population         young in Punjab are better educated on average, they are more likely to be
                         unemployed or informally employed than their older counterparts. A key constraint
                         to productive employment is the lack of relevant skills. Conscious of this, the Punjab
                         government is in the process of signiﬁcantly expanding the Technical and Vocational
                         Education and Training (TVET) ecosystem to deliver training on a large scale. After
                         half a million individuals were trained in FY16, it is expected the government could
                         well meet its target to train two million by 2018. There is limited evidence, however,

                        outcomes. Further policy efforts are therefore required to ensure that training meets
                        minimum quality standards and is relevant to employers’ needs. Additional actions
                        may be required—public employment services or wage subsidies, for example—
                        which could be trialed and evaluated to identify the most effective interventions. See
                        Section C2.

presents enormous       South Asian countries have increased agricu ltural yields and shifted labor to more
potential for growth    productive sectors over the past decade, Pakistan’s agriculture sector has lagged
through increased       behind. It continues to be a crucially important sector in the economy, accounting for
productivity            21 percent of GDP, 44 percent of the labor force and 78 percent of the country’s
                        export (directly and indirectly through food, textile, and leather) earnings in FY16. In
                        recent years, however, the sector has underperformed, growing at less than 3 percent
                        in each of the past ﬁve years. Limited water availability combined with low user
                        charges and limited water storage creates signiﬁcant water stress. Agricultural
                        productivity is considerably low; as crop yields per hectare and per cubic meter of
                        water are far lower than international benchmarks. These problems are not always
                        eased by existing agricultural subsidies. Punjab’s vast wheat procurement system
                        generates signiﬁcant distortions, stimulating extra production of a crop that is already
                        overstocked and discouraging diversiﬁcation. The cost of the program is signiﬁcant,
                        with direct costs estimated at Rs. 35 billion a year. See Section C3.

                        educational enrolment and maternal health outcomes, the gap in access between the
                        rich and the poor has increased over time with much of the improvement

emerging region       Not only did the region continue to exhibit steady growth of 6.8 percent, but it is now
                      also the fastest growing emerging-market and development economy (EMDE) region
                      in the world. 2 With India accounting for most of this performance over the past three
                      years, South Asia has been exceeding its long-term growth average of 6 percent (2000-
                      14)3 and enjoying strong domestic demand. The region’s limited global economic
                      integration—while likely constraining its long-run growth—has also served to protect
                      it from negative external spillovers in recent years. Regional growth has also been
                      supported by: (i) consistently low commodity prices; (ii) infrastructure investment; (iii)
                      accommodative monetary policy supported by low inﬂation; (iv) ﬁscal policies that
                      aim to lower structural deﬁcits; and (v) some progress on structural reforms.

                      on lowering expenditures while revenue mobilization efforts yield minimal results

Pakistan’s economy        Pakistan’s economy is among the top performers of South Asia with GDP growth
continues to grow         expected to reach 5.2 percent in FY17,5 a substantial increase from 4.7 percent in
as warning signs          FY16. Despite this strong overall growth, external and ﬁscal balances have
emerge                    deteriorated in the past nine months. Pakistan has seen a weakening of several of the
                          macroeconomic indicators during the ﬁrst 9 months of FY17 that improved as a result
                          of the reforms implemented at federal and provincial level during the last three ﬁscal
                          years. During this period current account deﬁcit has widened due to weak export
                          performance and a marginal decline in remittances. These developments suggest that
                          renewed attention and effort are warranted to protect Pakistan’s hard-won
                          macroeconomic stability.

Growth is driven by       Nevertheless, Pakistan’s economic growth is expected to accelerate in FY17. In
growing conﬁdence         addition to the general conditions favoring economic growth across South Asia,
and domestic              Pakistan enjoyed increasing consumer and investor conﬁdence, in part as a result of
consumption               the successful conclusion of the IMF EFF program. In late 2016, the country also
                          tapped into international markets by issuing a US$1 billion 5-year Sukuk bond with a
                          lower interest rate than a similar bond issued two years ago.6 The economy was further
                          supported by strong domestic consumption, some recovery in agricultural production
                          and a marginal recovery in foreign direct investment (FDI) ﬂows.7 Recent debates in
                          media have underscored ﬂaws in Pakistan’s measurement of GDP and needed
                          improvements (see Box 1).

        Box 1: Updating the Methodology and Source Data for Pakistan’s GDP Measurement
There are several concerns with the GDP’s measurement methodology and data sources:
    · The input/output (I/O) tables used for GDP calculation were last updated about 26 years ago. In addition,
        the Census of Manufacturing Industries (CMI) is updated infrequently meaning that the Large-Scale
        Manufacturing (LSM) index is unable to capture the entry of new players in the market. Further, the index
        is based on poor data collection mechanisms and covers only 15 of 22 sectors, all of which likely results in
        an underestimation of industrial activity in the economy.
    · The GDP in Pakistan is reported at factor cost while the international norm is to report it at market prices,
        making is hard to make cross-country comparisons. Furthermore, there is a signiﬁcant disparity between
        Pakistan’s two GDP datasets (factor cost vs. ma rket price) with no uniform historical trends.
    · International good practice suggests that national accounts need to be rebased every ﬁve to seven years to
        account for structural changes in the economy. Pakistan’s last rebasing occurred in FY06, suggesting a far
        longer gap than international standards.
    · In addition, quarterly or regional GDP is not published in Pakistan; both can be useful for policy making.
    · It would be pertinent, therefore, to review comprehensively the institutional framework, the resources and
        source data used, and the compilation techniques at both current and constant prices. This could inform a
        strategy to update the measurement methodology, maintain a regular rebasing schedule and strengthen the
        capacities of national and provincial statistics bureaus.


Private                   Pakistan’s growth, on the demand side, is historically led by consumption, which
consumption               comprised an overwhelming 92 percent of GDP in FY16. Consumption in absolute

                          5 Financial year in Pakistan runs from July to June.
                          6 The interest rate on the 5-year Sukuk bond raised in October 2016 was set at 5.5 percent, 75 bps lower
                            than the 6.75 percent paid on the same instrument in late 2014.
                          7 This was mostly due to a one-off ﬂow of US$469 million from Netherlands in end-2016.

despite relatively    increase in average monthly household expenditure in the past 10 years.8 In a sign of
weak remittance       falling poverty, the composition of expenditure has also changed over this period with
inﬂows during         households across all quintiles spending 6 percentage points less on food each month
FY17 to date          and more on items such as transport and communication, rent and utilities, and
                      recreation and entertainment.9 More recently, however, remittances—an integral
                      component of Pakistan’s household consumption—have fallen by 2.3 percent in the
                      ﬁrst nine months of FY17 compared with growth of 5.8 percent over the same period
                      in FY16. Government consumption is the second-largest contributor towards
                      demand-side growth, at 11.8 percent of GDP in FY16.10

Investment and        On the other hand, the economy continues to suffer from low investment and savings

languish,             14.6 percent of GDP. While these rates are low, even by regional standards,11 multiple
constrained by        structural factors explain this performance. Drivers of Pakistan’s low investment rate
long-term             include an uncertain security situation and the global slowdown affecting FDI. Entry
structural factors    and administrative barriers in various sectors and an overall high cost of doing
                      business have also constrained investment. A relatively detailed assessment of
                      Pakistan’s trade competitiveness was undertaken in the PDU in fall 2015
                      (https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/22926/Pakistan0
                      development0update.pdf ?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). On the savings side,
                      consistently low real interest rates and, more recently, withholding taxes on ﬁnancial
                      transactions partially explain low savings rates. However, historical reasons include: (i)
                      a lack of ﬁnancial deepening in the economy;12 (ii) a high dependency ratio which
                      translates to very high levels of consumption;13 and (iii) low labor force participation.14

 slowing slightly       percent of LSM. On the other hand, LSM growth was supported by sugar

                        fertilizers, which together make up ov er 30 percent of LSM. These segments
                        performed well on the back of improved energy supplies, demand from ongoing
                        infrastructure projects, and a recent uptick in private sector credit. Cement and steel
                        were particularly strong performers as private ﬁrms invested in capacity expansion 21
                        to meet robust local demand both from public and private projects. Other positive
                       signs in FY17 include: (i) the introduction of new car models by local and foreign
                       manufacturers; (ii) major acquisitions in various sectors by foreign ﬁrms; and (iii) a
                       favorable sugar position from higher production and international prices.

 Services—the          The services sector is the largest and most reliant contributor towards supply-side
 dominant sector in    growth with its share in GDP reaching about 59 percent in FY16.22 The sector itself
 the economy—          is expected to grow by 5.6 percent in FY17, a similar rate to the 5.7 percent growth
 continues to grow     in FY16. Growth in the sector remains healthy due to the recovery in agriculture
 steadily              and steady growth in industrial activity, and is supported by the transport sector.

                       also expected to grow based on higher sales and imports of commercial vehicles
                       and petroleum products23 in addition to the additional demand created by CPEC.
                       On the other hand, the communications sector is expected to remain subdued and
                       uncertain banking sector proﬁtability might keep overall growth of finance and
                       insurance in check in FY17. Growth in general government services is also expected to
                       continue owing to announced increases in government sector employees in the
                       FY17 budget, allowing the overall services sector to maintain its steady growth

The federal                Total revenues during H1FY17 declined—for the ﬁrst time in ﬁve years—by 0.7
government’s               percent on the back of timid growth in federal tax collection and a huge 36 percent
spending restraint         contraction in federal non-tax revenues. On the other hand, total expenditure
could not overcome         registered growth of 10.7 percent. Encouragingly, the federal government continued
a signiﬁcant decline       to hold recurrent spending under tight rein—federal recurrent spending grew by only
in revenue                 2.6 percent during H1FY17 compared with 3.7 percent in the same period last year.
                           But this was not true for provincial governments—provincial recurrent spending
                           increased by 15 percent compared with the previous year, likely due to an increase in
                           public sector wages. Relatively weak revenue performance, together with healthy
                           overall expenditure growth, resulted in a primary deﬁcit (excluding interest payments)
                           of 0.5 percent of GDP during H1FY17, as opposed to a surplus of 0.4 percent in the
                           same period last year.

Slow growth in FBR         In contrast with recent trends, total revenue of the consolidated government
revenue has driven         declined in the ﬁrst half of FY17 due toa weak performance by the Federal Board
poor overall revenue       of Revenue (FBR). FBR revenue grew by 6 percent during H1FY17, just one-third
performance                of the increase witnessed in the same period last year (Table 2 ). The collection
                           amounted to Rs. 1,467 billion, equating to 41 percent of the FY17 revenue target.
                           Recent history suggests that an achievement ratio26 of this magnitude in the ﬁrst half
                           of the year is likely to result in a signiﬁcant gap with the year’s target. If this holds
                           for FY17, a conservative estimate shows projected growth in FBR revenues for
                           FY17 at around 4 percent.27 FBR collection would need to grow by almost 25
                           percent in the remaining six months of FY17 to achieve the budgeted target—a
                           daunting challenge for the federal tax machinery. On the other hand, taxes collected
                           by the provincial governments grew by 20 percent during the period under
                           analysis—a strong result, but still shy of the 29 percent growth in FY16.

FBR tax collection         During the ﬁrst six months of the ﬁscal year, collections from direct and indirect
accrued primarily          taxes grew by 8.4 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. Growth in direct taxes during
from customs duties        the ﬁrst half of FY17 is an improvement on the contraction of 3.4 percent in
and direct taxes           Q1FY17. Nevertheless, this performance is not encouraging in comparison to the
                           same period in FY16. Moreover, within indirect taxes, customs and federal excise
                           duty grew by 22 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Robustness in customs duties
                           can be attributed to an increase in imports (particularly transport, food and
                           machinery),28 and higher tariffs on some items.

The main driver of         Sales tax performance showed the most deterioration—a decline by 2.3 percent over
the FBR’s revenue          H1FY16—and was the main factor in slow growth of FBR tax collection.29 This
shortfall was a            underperformance can be traced back to relief measures aimed at supporting export
decline in sales tax       sectors and agriculture30 announced in the federal budget FY17. Furthermore, sales
collection                 tax revenues were affected by plummeting petroleum revenues due to lower prices




                          26 This is computed through dividing actual collection under FBR revenues in a given period during a
                             ﬁscal year by the budgeted target for that ﬁscal year.
                          27 The targeted growth in FBR revenue stipulated in the Federal Budget 2016-17 is 16.7 percent.
                          28 Merchandise imports grew by 6 percent in H1-FY17 as opposed to a contraction of 9 percent same

                             period last year.
                          29 The share of sales tax in FBR taxes stood at 39 percent, down from that of 44 percent in H1FY15.
                          30 These include zero-rating of export-oriented sectors (textiles, leather, sports goods, surgical goods and

                             carpets); exemption of 7 percent sales tax on pesticides; reduction of sales tax on urea from 17 percent
                             to 5 percent; and doubling of the turnover threshold for cottage industry.

                               and changes to the tax regime.31 The decline in cigarette production following the
                               increase in excise duty also reduced sales tax revenues.

Non-tax revenues              Non-tax revenues posted Rs. 249 billion, representing a contraction of 32 percent
fell by 32 percent            or Rs. 116 billion compared with H1FY16. Reduced SBP proﬁts and Coalition
due to falling                Support Fund (CSF) inﬂows appeared to be the main reason behind this signiﬁcant
central bank proﬁts,          decline (Table 3 ). The former has been affected by the continued low interest rate
dividend incomes              environment, while in the case of the latter Pakistan did not receive any CSF
from SOEs and                 disbursement until end-December 2016.32 Dividends from state-owned
defense receipts              enterprises (SOEs) have also declined substantially due to reduced corporate
                              proﬁtability of state-owned enterprises, including that of oil and gas SOEs.33 The
                              revenue collected under the discount retained on crude oil and the windfall levy
                              declined for the fourth consecutive year due to prevailing low domestic petroleum
                              prices. Similarly, royalties on gas and oil declined due to a price effect. Provinces,
                              on the other hand, generated growth of 13 percent in non-tax revenues in
                              H1FY17, though this was lower than in the same period in FY16.




                              31  This performance is attributable to two factors: (i) SRO 490(I)/2016 notifying ad-valorem tax rates
                                 w.e.f. July 1, 2016 for this sector from previously a ﬁxed rate regime; and (ii) fall in average domestic
                                 petroleum prices during H1FY17 (Rs. 64.6 per liter) compared to same period last year (Rs. 75.8 per
                                 liter).
                              32 However, during February-March 2017 Pakist an has received US$550 million under CSF.
                              33 Due to the government’s decision to keep domestic petroleum prices unchanged for most of the ﬁrst

                                 half of the year despite a surge in international crude oil prices.

Consolidated                Total expenditure of the consolidated government (excluding statistical
government                  discrepancy34) during H1FY17 grew by 8.1 percent, lower than the 9.0 percent
expenditure growth          growth witnessed in the same period last year (Table 4 ).35 The federal government
was contained by            increased its recurrent expenditure by less than 4 percent for the third consecutive
low growth in               year. Interest payments and pensions grew modestly during H1FY17 compared with
federal recurrent           the same period last year, whereas federal grants to SOEs declined by almost Rs. 20
spending                    billion.36 On the other hand, defense spending and public order and safety
                            expenditures increased signiﬁcantly, as a result of augmented security-related
                            spending.

Development                 Both federal and provincial governments continue to increase development
spending continues          expenditure and, if this spending is executed well, it could provide much-needed
to grow, particularly       stimulus to the economy. The federal government continued to direct signiﬁcant
at the federal level        resources towards Public Sector Development Program (PSDP)-related
                            development spending. Fede ral PSDP grew by 27 percent during H1FY17,
                            consistent with last year’s trend. In contrast with the federal government, provincial
                            governments increased PSDP spending by a moderate 11 percent. This behavior

                            34 Statistical discrepancy for H1FY17 has been recorded at positive Rs. 57 billion (compared to a negative
                               Rs. 9 billion in H1FY16) and has, therefore, increased the size of total expenditure.
                            35 Nonetheless, total expenditure of the consolidated government including the statistical discrepancy

                               during H1FY17 grew by 10.7 percent – more than double the 5.0 percent growth registered during the
                               same period last year.
                            36 As of April 19, power sector circular debt reached Rs. 329 billion or 1.0 percent of GDP. The

                               government, in the short run, is contemplating imposing a special levy on electricity bills to adjust
                               some of these receivables. However, in the event that most of this debt is ultimately absorbed into the
                               budget, the expected ﬁscal deﬁcit for FY17 may rise by 0.5 to 0.75 percent of GDP, also leading to a
                               similar increase in the level of public debt.

                         may be the logical effect of almost ﬂat growth in federal transfers to the provinces
                         in H1FY1737 compared with H1FY16. Among th e provinces, Punjab’s spending
                         was similar to that of H1FY16, Sindh and KP spent almost 50 percent more while
                         Balochistan underspent by almost half.

The provincial           The federal government’s ﬁscal deﬁcit of 2.5 percent of GDP was only marginally
governments have         covered by the provincial governments, who registered a combined surplus of only
generated a surplus      0.1 percent of GDP for the ﬁrst half of the year. Given this trend, the budgeted
of just 0.1 percent of   assumption of a provincial surplus of Rs. 339 billion, or 1.0 percent of GDP at the
GDP                      end of FY17, is unrealistic, particularly given the tendency of provincial spending to
                         increase during the third and fourth quarters of the ﬁscal year.

Public debt is           Public debt declined in the ﬁrst half of FY17, and is expected to continue declining
declining in FY17        throughout the ﬁscal year and beyond if ﬁscal consolidation efforts continue. As of
                         end-December 2016, total public debt stood at 62.8 percent of GDP,38 0.6 of a
                         percentage point lower than the December 2015 stock of 63.4 percent (Figure 3).
                         In line with historic trends, domestic debt dominated the stock. In a positive
                         development, the government drew down the deposits held with the banking sector
                         (including SBP)39 to repay the maturities due during Q2FY17. On the other hand,
                         foreign currency public debt to GDP ratio decreased by 0.4 of a percentage point
                         during this period due to exchange rate stability, translational gains 40 and higher than
                         expected nominal GDP compared with that in H1FY16. Nonetheless, government
                         borrowed substantially from commercial banks41 during H1FY17. In October 2016,
                         Pakistan successfully issued an international Sukuk bond of US$1.0 billion42 with a
                         maturity of ﬁve years. The proﬁt rate was 5.5 percent—the lowest ever in Pakistan’s
                         history and 125 bps lower than that on the same-maturity Sukuk bond issued in
                         November 2014.




                         37 These transfers constitute 80-85 percent of total provincial revenues, thus any shortfall in federal tax
                            collection directly impacts the spending levels by provinces.
                         38 Total public debt remains above the 60 percent threshold stipulated in the Fiscal Responsibility &

                            Debt Limitation Act 2005.
                         39 Government deposits contracted by Rs. 374 billion during Q2FY17, as opposed to an accumulation

                            of Rs. 407 billion during Q1FY17.
                         40 Translational gain/loss implies the appreciation/depreciation of US dollar against major currencies. In

                            Pakistan, external loans are contracted in various currencies but disbursements are effectively
                            converted into PKR. As PKR is not an internationally traded currency, other currencies are bought
                            and sold via selling and buying of USD. Hence, the currency exposure of foreign debt originates from
                            two sources: USD/other foreign currencies and PKR/USD. The former exchange rate risk is called
                            translational gain/loss.
                         41 Among these, the most notable is a US$700 million one-time disbursed commercial loan by China

                            Development Bank. This is a medium-term loan for BoP support under CPEC with a maturity of 3
                            years and an interest rate of 3 months LIBOR plus a ﬁxed rate spread of 3.28 percent.
                         42 Against the initial expectations of raising US$500 million.

position                       A continuing decline in exports, lower coalition support fund (CSF) receipts,
deteriorated slightly          rising imports and a contraction in workers’ remittance inﬂows were the key
in Jul-Mar FY17                drivers of this increase in the current account deﬁcit. However, ﬁnancial
despite signiﬁcant             inﬂows from steady foreign direct investment (FDI) and loan receipts from
widening of the                commercial borrowing and international ﬁnancial institutions (IFIs) partially
current account                eased this growing external pressure. This resulted in an overall deﬁcit of
deﬁcit                         US$1.6 billion for Jul-Mar FY17 comparedto a surplus of US$1.1 billion in
                               same period last year. Consequently, Pakistan’s ofﬁcial reserves receded from a
                               high of US$18.1 billion at end June 2016 to US$16.5 billion by end March 2017,
                               which equate to 3.6 months of imports of goods and services. Pakistan’s
                               nominal exchange rate and credit ratings remained stable during Jul-Mar FY17.

The current account        Pakistan’s current and capital account recorded a combined deﬁcit of
deﬁcit widened             US$5.9 billion during Jul-Mar FY17—an increase of 161.0 percent y-o-y. The
largely due to a           deterioration in the current account was primarily driven by the trade deﬁcit,
growing trade              as exports continued to decline and imports picked up drastically during the
deﬁcit                     ﬁrst nine months of FY17. The current account also suffered from a decrease
                           in CSF ﬂows in Jul-Mar FY17, and a fall in remittances as low international oil
                           prices continued to affect public spending in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
                           economies, which account for two-thirds of Pakistan’s remittance inﬂows.

Exports continued          After contracting for 10 consecutive quarters between Q4-FY14 and Q1-FY17,
to decline, led by         exports experienced moderate q-o-q growth of 0.9 percent and 0.8 percent in
falls in the textile       the second and third quarters of FY17. But this growth was not enough to
sector                     overcome the fall in the ﬁrst quarter; overall, exports suffered a contraction of
                           1.4 percent (y-o-y) in Jul-Mar FY17. This decline is broad-based, particularly
                           focused in the textile and food sectors. Textile exports, with a 59 percent share
                           in total exports in Jul-Mar FY17, fell by 2.7 percent. This decline was observed
                           in both the high and low ends of textile value chain except for bed wear, tents

                          & canvas, and readymade garments, which beneﬁted from both higher
                          international prices and a higher quantum exported during Jul-Mar FY17
                          (Figure 4). However, the overall decline in textile exports reﬂects the weak
                          economic situation in destination markets, as well as persistent structural
                          bottlenecks in the domestic economy.

Imports increased         After experiencing a contraction in FY16, imports recorded growth of 14.2
as Pakistan               percent in Jul-Mar FY17. The major import groups, including food, transport,
imported larger           and petroleum, experienced positive growth with petroleum products and
quantities of oil and     imports of power generation machinery growing at 22.0 percent and 11.7
capital goods             percent, respectively. Growth in machinery group imports reﬂected the impact
                          of CPEC-related machinery imports. A gradual buildup of domestic economic
                          activity has also kept petroleum imports high despite a signiﬁcant fall in the unit
                          price of imported petroleum products.

started to taper off     occasion since FY04 that remittances have contracted (y-o-y) for three
                         consecutive quarters. Despite this decline, these ﬂows continue to play a major
                         role in curtailing the current account deﬁcit by ﬁnancing about 41.5 percent of
                         the import bill in Jul-Mar FY17 (Figure 5 ). Remittances from the GCC
                         countries, which accounted for 63 percent of remittances during Jul-Mar FY17,
                         have started to contract due to the decline in public investments in these
                         economies as oil prices remain depressed. Remittance ﬂows from the GCC
                         countries decreased by 4.5 percent in Jul-Mar FY17 compared with an increase
                         of 8.0 percent in Jul-Mar FY16. Remittance ﬂows from the UK and the US—
                         which are also signiﬁcant—also experienced a slowdown during Jul-Mar FY17,
                         falling by 8.5 percent and 7.0 percent, respectively.

neutral policy stance        throughout the ﬁrst three quarters of FY17. This approach was adopted in response to
during Jul-Mar FY17          some increase in inﬂation an d pressure in the current account. As a result, the real

 Money supply (M2)           Broad money (M2) expanded (Y-o-Y) by 13.6 percent by end-March 2017, compared
 growth picked up            to 13.5 percent in the same period last year ( Table 6 ). This marginal improvement in
 slight during Jul-          M2 came along due to increase (Y-o-Y) in Net Domestics Assets (NDA) of the
 Mar FY17                    banking system despite a signiﬁcant decline of Net Foreign Assets (NFA) in this
                             period. Higher government borrowing from State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and better
                             private sector credit in Jul-Mar FY17 contributed to this rise in NDA during this
                             period. The currency deposit ratio deteriorated for a second consecutive year during
                             Jul-Mar FY17 albeit at a much lower pace.

Net domestic assets           The higher government borrowing during Jul-Mar FY17 from SBP along with higher
grew by 16.2 percent          growth in private sector credit was primarily responsible for this expansion in NDA.
in Jul-Mar FY17               During Jul-Mar FY17, the government borrowed Rs. 802 billion from SBP compared
compared with 12.8            with a retirement of Rs. 535 billion in Jul-Mar FY16. Higher government borrowing
percent in Jul-Mar            from SBP was marginally offset by Rs. 98 billion net retirement from scheduled bank
FY17                          borrowing during this period. The main reason behind government resorting to
                              borrowing from SBP was to meet its additional budgetary requirements and repay a
                              large volume of maturing Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) in the ﬁrst quarter of
                              FY17.

Private sector                As a result of net retirement of government borrowing to scheduled banks and low real
demand for credit is          interest rates, the private-sector credit in the ﬁrst 9 months of FY17 has grown at a
picking up on the             faster pace than a year ago. It expanded by Rs. 562.0 billion, mostly comprised of loans
back of a growing             to the private sector (Rs. 429.2 billion). The improvement in credit off-take was fairly
economy and the low           broad-based, as it was spread over a number of sectors including manufacturing, ship
cost of borrowing             breaking, trade and commerce, real state, and other businesses (Table 7 ).

                    b.           Inﬂation
Inﬂation increased               Year-on-year inﬂation rose at the start of FY17 to reach 4.9 percent in March 2017
throughout the ﬁrst              after reaching its lowest level in 13 years in FY16. Average headline inﬂation increased
half of FY17, but                from 2.6 percent in Jul-Mar FY16 to 4.0 pe rcent in Jul-Mar FY17, driven by both
remains within a                 supply- and demand-side factors (Figure 10). A pick-up in aggregate demand was
tolerable range                  accompanied by supply-side factors such as: higher international prices of key
                                 commodities (including crude oil and industrial inputs); a recovery in the prices of
                                 major food items (palm oil and rice); an increase in regulatory duties; and other ﬁscal
                                 measures to increase tax mobilization.43 Nevertheless, the current trend suggests that
                                 inﬂation will remain at about 5 percent due to the consistent supply of perishable items,
                                 stable exchange rate, and the government’s absorption of higher international oil
                                 prices. However, risks include upward adjustments of the gas tariff and uncertain
                                 global oil prices.




                                 43   The government changed the duty structure by: (a) replacing 5 percent FED with ﬁxed rate of Rs. 1
                                      per kg of cement; (b) increasing FED on cigarettes; (c) enhancing FED on beverages from 10.5 to 11.5
                                      percent; (d) imposing regulatory duty on powdered milk; and (e) increasing the rate of sales tax on
                                      certain ingredients of poultry feed from 5 to 10 percent. Following these changes, the prices of
                                      cigarettes and cement rose by 17.5 and 5.8 percent in Q1FY17, compared with 16.3 and -0.9 percent,
                                      respectively in Q1FY16.

Both food and non-                                   The increase in inﬂation was driven by a moderate increase in both food and non-
food prices                                          food prices to 5.0 percent and 4.9 percent respectively y-o-y to March 2017 (Figure 11 ).
increased                                            Within the food category, some food items experienced substantial price
moderately                                           increases. For instance, the prices of tomatoes, potatoes, and gram wholei ncreased
                                                     by over 20 percent y-o-y to March 2017 due to reduced domestic production driven
                                                     by weather patterns44. In addition, seasonal (Eid-related) demand contributed to
                                                     higher food prices while supply constraints arose from stricter payment controls for
                                                     cross-border trade, which particularly affected Pakistan’s trade of fresh fruits,
                                                     vegetables and other perishable items with Iran and Afghanistan. Consequently, fresh
                                                     vegetables exhibited the most prominent inﬂationary pressure in the CPI food basket
                                                     (Figure 12). The key factors driving non-food inﬂation included: alcohol and
                                                     beverages, housing costs, water, electricity, gas and fuels, education and health.

However, maturity                       The growth in private sector credit has been evenly distributed across working capital,
proﬁles remain                          ﬁxed investment and trade ﬁnance segments. Overall, however, the cautious view on
persistently skewed                     longer-term economic performance is persisting among ﬁnancial sector sources, users
to the short-term                       and intermediation. About 36 percent of overall loans to private sector ﬁrms are
                                        categorized as long-term or ﬁxed investment, but this ratio is lower for the
                                        manufacturing sector, at 31 percent. The manufacturing sector represents 59 percent
                                        of total loans.

The banking system                      The key driver of robustness in the banking sector in recent years has been a shift in
remains robust                          the risk behavior of banks from private sector loans to risk-free government
based on standard                       securities. The banking sector has achieved sizable growth, driven primarily by
solvency indicators,                    increased government borrowing, but this trend is reversing. Commercial banks hold
but the stock of                        about Rs. 6.4 trillion of government domestic debt as of December 2016, which is
government debt is                      about 40 percent of their total assets ( Figure 14 ). Even with the recovery in private
declining                               sector off-take, the outstanding stock of government debt continues to signiﬁcantly
                                        reduce the risk-weighted assets of the banking system. As a result, the sector’s capital
                                        adequacy ratio remains strong at 16.2 percent as of December 2016.

 1.        Outlook
 GDP is projected                     Pakistan’s economy is projected to grow by 5.2 percent in FY17 ( Figure 17). On
 to grow at 5.2                       the demand side, the outlook for near-term growth will primarily be supported by
 percent in FY17,                     public and private consumption, aided somewhat by a moderate increase in
 reaching 5.8                         investment. Pakistan’s low investment-to-GDP ratio is expected to improve
 percent in FY19                      marginally in FY17 due to CPEC-related infrastructure projects and other public
                                      investment ( Figure 18). These projects are also ex pected to contribute to the
                                      domestic construction industry and expand electricity generation. Improved
                                      electricity availability may, in turn, suppo rt growth in the industry and services
                                      sectors. For details, see Table 9 .

a key risk              to natural disasters, political events and terrorism. The recent issue of Panama
domestically            papers has enhanced political risks and created some policy uncertainty. The
                        upcoming national election in 2018 may affect reform momentum and
                        macroeconomic policy orientation. Slower progress in much-needed structural
                        reforms would weaken growth prospects and discourage private investment. A
                        stable Rs./US$ nominal exchange rate has resulted in appreciation of the real
                        effective exchange rate (REER). This can erode Pakistan’s export competitiveness.
                        Furthermore, protracted global economic weakness, especially in the Euro area
                        due to Brexit could negatively affect exports.

                        positive for Pakistan, being a net oil importer. Conversely, a sharp increase in oil
                        prices will worsen the trade deﬁcit and could increase energy subsidies.

accelerate growth.       Privatization efforts have stalled, which has also affected the broader reform efforts
                         in the electricity sector, with the resurgence of the circular debt. FBR performance
                         in tax collection is below target, after several years of very strong performance.
                         Reforms in areas that need improved collaboration between federal and provincial
                         governments remain challenging. Reform momentum will need to continue to
                         maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate growth.

                         generation capacity, but they need to be accompanied by investments in
                         transmission and reforms to improve the performance of the distribution sector. An
                         improved regulatory environment in the electricity sector is a precondition to attract
                         private investment – reversals to the reforms implemented over the past few years
                         would create uncertainty in the sector and affect private sector investment. Planned
                         reforms in the gas sector—that will allow for increased supply from imports and
                         improve sectoral performance—will need to be pressed home vigorously.

                                        needs are also signiﬁcant in other areas where the provinces have sole responsibility.
                                        As a result, there is a need for increased coordination between the federal
                                        government and the provinces in policymaking and the implementation of reforms.

                                            Box 2: Circular debt in the electricity sector
 Circular Debt (CD) or payables to generators is a symptom; unless its underlying causes are addressed, it
 will continue to reappear. In June and July 2013, the government cleared the entire CD stock of Rs. 480
 billion but, by the end of FY13, it had reemerged to the tune of Rs. 266 billion. In September 2015, the
 government introduced a comprehensive CD management plan to gradually reduce ﬂows and eliminate the
 stock. The privatization of distribution companies (DISCOs) was a key action proposed to tackle the ﬂow
 and the stock simultaneously. The CD plan, however, has struck some challenges in implementation. The
 DISCO privatization process has stalled, subsidy and tariff issues have not been addressed in AJK, FATA
 and Baluchistan tube-wells, NEPRA determinations have been suspended and DISCO performance has
 been below expectations. Consequently, as shown in the chart below, account receivables and payables
 continued to accumulate. As of December 2016, CD (deﬁned as payables to generators) reached Rs. 374
 billion, equivalent to ﬁve months of power purchase price (Figure B2).

 Lower fuel costs provided some relief as negative monthly Fuel Price Adjustments (FPAs) are not being
 passed on to subsidized consumers. This has helped the government in meeting ﬂow targets and maintain
 the CD level within manageable limits during FY15 and FY16. Suspension of FY16 tariffs, on the other
 hand, meant that capacity charges and transmission and distribution margins have not been adjusted to
 reﬂect changes such as capacity additions, rupee depreciation and inﬂation. The payables data for the ﬁrst
 half of FY17 show that circular debt is increasing at an accelerating rate as international crude oil prices are
 increasing. Consequently, the beneﬁt of lower crude oil prices is beginning to diminish and circular debt is
 expected to increase further in the coming months.

mixed                  listed in Annex A.

Pakistan has had       Pakistan has made signiﬁcant progress in re ducing poverty over the past decade. Based
great success in       on the poverty line set in 2001, the percentage of people living below the poverty line
reducing poverty       decreased from 34.6 percent in FY02 to less than 10 percent in FY14. Moreover, these
                       gains in income were shared with everyone; even the poorest 5 percent of the population
                       saw real improvements. Data from the household income and expenditure survey (HIES)
                       show that in the year 2001, some 14 percent of the population had a real per capita
                       expenditure level of Rs. 550 per person per month. By 2014, this was down to just 2
                       percent. In April 2016, the government announced a new national poverty line, which
                       sets a higher standard for wellbeing at the poverty line, identifying 29.5 percent of the
                       population as poor.

Maternal and infant    Pakistan is moving in the right direction—albeit slowly—on reducing maternal and infant
mortality rates are    mortality rates and delivery through skilled birth attendants. The infant mortality rate fell
also slowly            from 80 to 66 deaths per 1,000 births between 2005 and 2015, while maternal mortality
improving              fell from 249 to 178 per 100,000 live births. Life expectancy at birth has also improved
                       for both males and females. Overall, the proportion of births attended by skilled birth
                       attendants has increased to 58 percent in 2014-15 from an earlier 37 percent in 2006-07,
                       and the overall proportion of women who had given birth during that last 3 years and had
                       made at least one antenatal care consultation also increased from 56 percent in 2007-08
                       to 73 percent in 2014-15.

Nutrition and water    Rates of stunting (a nutritional deﬁciency also called chronic malnutrition), however, have
& sanitation           remained extremely high, and have not changed much over recent decades—Pakistan
outcomes have          now has the third-highest number of stunted children in the world at 43.7 percent, and

improvement over       safe drinking water and availability of adequate sanitation facilities, Pakistan needs to
the last decade        prioritize improvements in these services. The current situation of water and sanitation
                       facilities is clearly insufﬁcient to reduce stunting. Although the number of households
                       with access to an improved water source has remained more or less stagnant over the past
                       15 years, the percentage of households with access to piped water or tap water has reduced
                       over time. The proportion of households with access to piped water fell from 29 percent
                       in 2005 to 27 percent in 2010, while the percentage of households with access to tap water
                       fell from 34 percent in 2005 to 32 percent in 2010, and to a further 27 percent by 2015.
                       Sanitation facilities also show a similar picture, where the percentage of households with
                       a ﬂush toilet has increased from 52 percent to 73 percent between 2005 and 2015, but the
                       proportion of households that have a ﬂushing toilet connected to a piped sewerage system
                       is still less than one quarter.

Signiﬁcant gains       While education indicators improved in the early 2000s, they have largely stagnated since
were achieved in       2010. For instance, literacy rates increased from 53 percent to 58 percent between 2005

                       enrolment rates for middle and secondary school still remain low at 62 percent and 58
                       percent, respectively, in 2015.

                       other hand, appears to be ﬂat-lining across the same indicators. Child immunization was
                       lower in 2015 than it was in 2005 (45 and 46 percent, respectively) and the gross primary
                       enrolment rate also fell from 82 percent in 2010 to 79 percent in 2015. The proportion of
                       fully immunized children from 12-23 months has also steadily increased from 2006-07
                       from 76 percent to 82 percent in 2014-15, while the proportion of children suffering from
                       diarrhea has also decreased from 11 percent in 2006-07 to 9 percent in 2014-15. Stunting
                       in Sindh also remains very high, at 48 percent in 2014. Sindh also continues to face large
                       differences in urban and rural outcomes, which are most stark in water and sanitation
                       where only 31 percent of rural households have a ﬂushing toilet compared with 97 percent
                       of urban households. Only 23 percent of Sindh schools are equipped with basic facilties

                       making little or no progress on enrolment rates and the quality of learning outcomes.
                       Baluchistan has struggled to increase its particularly poor outcomes, seeing a deterioration
                       in learning outcomes (only 33 percent of year 5 children could read a story in 2014) and

education and the      to male literacy is steadily improving, with seven literate women for every ten literate men

1.       Mobilizing revenues for the development of Punjab
 Even after a concerted effort to increase revenues over the last ﬁve years, Pakistan nonetheless faces a
 signiﬁcant challenge in ﬁnancing its development needs with a low tax to GDP ratio. The federal government
 has set a revenue target of 14 percent of GDP by FY20, the achievement of which will require continued effort
 from both federal and provincial governments. Punjab’s revenue collection from its major taxes is currently
 around 25 percent of their potential of Rs. 432 billion, suggesting an estimated tax gap of Rs. 324 billion.46 This
 gap is driven by a mixture of tax policy and administration shortcomings, including: jurisdictional overlaps
 between different levels of government; large tax exemptions; low compliance; weaknesses in tax
 administration; and weak coordination among provincial administration bodies. The most signiﬁcant tax gaps
 are associated with the General Sales Tax on Services, the Urban Immoveable Property Tax, and transaction
 taxes (stamp duty and capital value tax), which could vastly increase their collections by eliminating exemptions,
 expanding the tax net, improving the quality of data and ICT reforms.

 While Pakistan’s         Pakistan’s overall tax-to-GDP ratio improved from 9.5 percent in FY11 to
 revenues are             12.4 percent in FY16. During this period, provincial tax to GDP increased from 0.4
 growing, further         to 1.0 percent (Figure 21), aided by the transfer of collection authority of some taxes
 efforts are needed—      to the provinces, and by some policy and administration reforms. However,
 including by Punjab      additional efforts are required to ﬁnance Pakistan’s development n eeds. In particular,
                          the country’s most populated and rapidly-urbanizing province of Punjab faces
                          signiﬁcant capacity gaps in revenue mobilization, which may hinder its development
                          agenda.47 The province’s tax and non-tax revenues currently account for around 18

                               around 28 percent of estimated provincial GDP, Punjab is considered the bread basket of the country,

                              percent of total expenditure ( Figure 22 ). The majority of this own-source revenue
                              comes from taxes (69 percent), predominantly the services sales tax, stamp duty,
                              property-related taxes (urban immoveable property tax and capital value tax), and the
                              motor vehicle tax (Figure 23, 24). Most of these taxes have recently been devolved
                              to the provinces and are generally recognized as buoyant tax bases.

Punjab’s taxes could          According to recent estimates, actual collection from Punjab’s six largest taxes is only
generate far more             25 percent of its potential, suggesting there is a huge opportunity for increasing own-
revenue                       source revenues. The government could more than double its revenues by eliminating
                              the tax gap on its major taxes: the General Sales Tax on Services, the Urban
                              Immoveable Property Tax, and transaction taxes ( Table 10 ). The province can
                              further mobilize revenues by tapping key non-tax bases, and rationalizing or
                              eliminating nuisance taxes.

The tax base is               The key challenges related to Punjab’s revenue mobilization are: (i) policy or
narrow due to a mix           jurisdictional overlaps between federal, provincial and local governments, (ii) large tax
of tax policy and             exemptions, (iii) low compliance, 48 and (iv) weaknesses in tax administration and
administration                coordination across the province’s revenue bodies. Relevant departments, including
challenges                    ﬁnance and the revenue authorities, lack the requisite skills to carry out tax policy
                              research or analysis. Furthermore, tax evasion is made easy by the absence of efﬁcient
                              coordination mechanisms to share data between departments (although there have
                              been isolated efforts towards automation), as well as the lack of economic, sectoral,
                              and taxpayer data at the provincial level. As a result, the government has an
                              incomplete picture of the tax system and its potential. It is not surprising, therefore,
                              that Punjab’s revenue collection has generally fallen short of targets. A brief analysis
                              of the potential in key taxes is presented below 49.

                                 although the province’s economy is gradually shifting towards the services sector. The province faces
                                 increasing unemployment (from 5.7 percent in FY10 to 6.3 percent in FY15), particularly among urban,
                                 young and female populations.
                              48 On the one hand, there exists a large undocumented economy that remains outside the tax net

                                 (Pakistan’s estimated shadow economy is 34 percent of the GDP—larger than average of 31 percent
                                 for the 162 countries (Schneider, F 2012, “The Shadow Economy and Work in the Shadow: What Do
                                 We (Not) Know?” IZA Discussion Paper No. 6423, March 2012). On the other hand, those who are
                                 in the tax net ﬁnd it difﬁcult to pay taxes (as evidenced by the country’s deteriorating rating on the

                                 identiﬁed tax potential (collections in FY2016 were Rs. 8.9 billion, close to the potential of Rs. 9.6
                                 billion in FY2013, estimated by Pasha (2014)). Relevant potential analysis using updated data is under

                                          in 2012, GSTS collections have increased from Rs. 26.8 billion in FY12 to Rs. 59.0
                                          billion in FY16—an increase of over 100 percent in four years. The
                                          telecommunications and ﬁnancial sectors together contribute about 50 percent of

The increase is due            The services sector is rapidly growing and is the largest contributor (over 60 percent)
to strong                      to Punjab’s estimated GDP.51 Following the devolution of authority to collect GSTS
performance of the             to the provincial government, Punjab increased the tax base by expanding GSTS
service sector and             coverage to more than 100 services (as of FY16) compared with 43 in FY12. The
policy and                     government to slightly reduce the overall tax rate from 17 to 16 percent (with the
administration                 exception of the telecommunications sector, which is taxed at 19.5 percent)52. The
reforms                        PRA is in the process of improving its tax administration capacity, especially through
                               automation, taxpayer education and awareness, enforcement, and improved human
                               capacity.

But actual GSTS                The current tax collection (Rs. 59 billion) is estimated to be well below its potential
collections are only           of Rs. 198 billion,53 largely on account of compliance and administrative
around 30 percent of           shortcomings. The non-telecom sectors (banking and insurance, business services,
their potential                and construction sectors) represent a signiﬁcant potential source of additional tax
                               revenue ( Figure 25). Methodologically, these estimates are based on an analysis of
                               tax liability under the current Punjab GSTS law (FY16; including exemption,
                               deduction, credits etc.) 54 and GSTS statutory rates. It assumes an 80 percent
                               compliance rate, which is on par with OECD and EU countries. 55 Some of the sectors
                               where there is potential are highlighted in Figure 26.

Exemptions are                 The losses associated with exemptions suggest signiﬁcant erosion of the tax base. The
creating signiﬁcant            construction and telecommunication sectors, for example, have explicit exemptions
losses                         that cost an estimated Rs. 25 billion and Rs. 2 billion, respectively ( Table 11 ).

                               53 This includes an estimated Rs. 47 billion that Punjab allows as a credit for federal GST paid on goods

                                  that are used as inputs to services in Punjab. This credit (based on current interpretation) is a liability
                                  for Punjab that is not yet repaid by the federal government.
                               54 The tax liability was determined by using an adjusted input-output table, updated sectoral ﬂows of 51

                                  sectors (100 percent of services in these sectors are assumed as taxable), and provincial economic

                                  Pakistan economic survey, State Bank of Pakistan, and estimates of income by province.

                          b.       Urban Immoveable Property Tax (UIPT)

The UIPT is a                      Administered by the Punjab Excise and Taxation Department, the UIPT collected
particularly under-                Rs. 8.6 billion in FY16, equating to 3 percent of own-source revenue (OSR), or 0.061
utilized revenue                   percent of Punjab’s GDP. Punjab’s UIPT collects far less than those in comparable
source for Punjab                  countries and regions, in terms of proportion of total revenues as well as share of
                                   GDP (e.g., Turkey has property tax to GDP ratio of 1.46 percent, Malaysia 1.1
                                   percent, South Africa 0.37 percent, and India 0.48 percent56). This is mainly due to a
                                   large difference between market rates and ofﬁcial valuations, large exemptions, and
                                   incomplete computerization of tax rolls (only six districts’ records have been

                         30 percent. These collections can be further increased by 10 percent to Rs. 99 billion
                         (Figure 30) by pairing reduced rates with improved collection efﬁciency measures
                         (e.g., digitizing and bunching together tax payments).




                         57 During November 2016 to February 2017, a survey was conducted in 6 districts (Lahore, Faisalabad,
                            Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Multan and Sialkot) to ascertain market values and rent of a stratiﬁed random
                            sample of 1,505 properties, selected from property records. The survey values and property records
                            data were used to calculate valuation rates on the pattern of valuation tables. These valuation rates are
                            then used to calculate Annual Rental Value and tax liability for a sample of 168,131 properties. Then,
                            revenue forgone on account of exemptions is calculated for 2.2 million properties for which
                            computerized records are maintained by the authorities. In the next step, the tax liability for the
                            province is calculated using the ratio of the total tax demand of 6 districts and the provincial tax
                            demand. Keeping in view that higher valuation would be phased in over time, the tax potential
                            estimates are computed using assessment ratios of 0.65 and 0.75.

                         59 The approach to gap estimation assumes: (a) assessment is undervalued due to adherence to notiﬁed

                            valuation threshold; (b) collection efﬁciency is stable over time at 92 percent; and (c) tax administration
                            imposes high compliance costs on taxpayers. The property valuation assessment (values /sales prices)
                            was conducted through a survey of 501 stratiﬁed random sample properties (e-Stamp database) from
                            ﬁve districts (Lahore, Faisalabad, Layyah, Sargodha, and Bahawalpur).

Collections from AIT                     Regardless of positive growth in collections over the past ﬁve years (from Rs. 717
remain 90 percent                        million in FY11 to Rs. 1.39 billion in FY16— Figure 31), the agriculture sector pays
below its estimated                      only about 0.04 percent of its income in tax (estimated at Rs. 3,664 billion in FY15,
potential                                current). The potential revenue from AIT is estimated at Rs. 14.5 billion, assuming
                                         full compliance and that farmers receive about 70 percent of the market price for
                                         most non-perishable crops. By incorporating non-compliance and the limitations in
                                         tax administration, the authorities can reasonably collect Rs. 7.2 billion under 50
                                         percent compliance, and Rs. 4.3 billion under 30 percent compliance. These estimates
                                         are based on an analysis of agriculture income of the representative farm, per acre,
                                         and AIT as per the ﬁrst schedule (area-based) and the second schedule (income-
                                         based). The greater of the two (area-based or income-based) is then used to arrive at
                                         the applicable AIT of the farm, and potential AIT. The data related to production and
                                         acreage of over 60 different crops grown in 36 districts of Punjab (covering grain,
                                         fruits, vegetables, oil seeds, pulses, etc. ) was used. It was collected from the
                                         Government of Punjab and other analytical studies (farm gate prices and cost of

                        Rs. 510 per person in selected occupational categories, the tax potential for all workers
                        totals around Rs. 12.6 billion, whereas for non-agriculture workers it is estimated at
                        Rs. 4.4 billion. The potential from the corporate sector is between Rs. 276 million
                        and Rs. 350 million under different assumptions. 60

A medium- to long-      Reform efforts to date have achieved important outcomes, leading to improved ﬁscal
term approach is        outcomes. However, for sustainable impact, there is a need to build momentum and
required                introduce properly sequenced tax policy and administration reforms to best exploit
                        the province’s tax potential.

There is a need to    Several of the taxes discussed in this section share common reform needs. With
reform tax policy and respect to tax policy, collections woul d beneﬁt from eliminating exemptions,
administration        improving deﬁnitions and expanding the sectors or groups covered by each tax.
                      Increasing the consistency and coverage of taxes in these ways (coupled with effective
                      impelmentation) could provide the government scope to reduce tax rates,
                      while increasing revenues. To improve tax administration, the government could
                      invest in gathering and then regularly updating its datasets, including accurate
                      property valuations. Tax payments could be better facilitated, including through
                      electronic means, databases could be integrated across relevant provincial
                      government agencies and a multi-year capacity development plan could be developed
                      for the three revenue bodies of the province – PRA, ETD, and BOR..

The Government of       By focusing on both tax and non-tax revenues, the government’s strategy takes a

                        60 Per SECP data, in FY15, Punjab accounted for 49 percent of new incorporations. It is assumed this
                          as true across all of the classiﬁcations of paid-up capital, and conservatively applied a rate of Rs. 5,000
                          to all companies in that category (Assumption 1). Second assumption is that 2/3 of the companies in
                          that category are with less than 5,000,000 paid-up capital, and 1/3 are larger. Thus we consider 2/3 to

2.             The 2 million challenge in Punjab: skilling the youth bulge
Punjab, the largest and most populous province in Pakistan, is experiencing a youth bulge with the share of
young people (between the age of 15 and 24 years) increasing at a faster rate than that of other age groups.
Young people currently make up about 36 percent of the working age population (between the age of 15 and
64 years) and an additional two million young individuals reach working age every year. In order to harness this
youth potential for a demographic dividend, it is crucial for the economy to be able to absorb these workers
into the labor market and involve them in productive activities. This requires both accelerated economic growth
enabling sufﬁcient job creation and the enhancement of human capital in the work force to be more productive
in the labor market. In recognition of this, the Government of Punjab in its “Punjab Growth Strategy” and
“Punjab’s Skill Development Sector Plan 2018” has set an ambitious target of achieving 8 percent annual GDP
growth and training 2 million young individuals by 2018, and has demonstrated its commitment to provide
access to better quality employment. This note aims to highlight the discussion on skills and employability of
young people in Punjab, review current efforts by the Government of Punjab and its progress, and discuss
areas of continued and further investment in growth-conducive and employment-generating policies.

                                 among women and youth. In addition to higher job insecurity, informal sector

Punjab                        agriculture provides opportunities for unpaid family work and self-employment
                              for women in rural areas, employment opportunities for urban females, who are
                              on average more educated, are scarce. Indeed, the FLFP rate decreases with
                              educational attainment, except for those at the very highest education level
                              (Figure 36), likely because those with mid-level education do not receive sufﬁcient
                              returns (wages) or have the economic necessity to justify labor market participation
                              that may involve substantial social, as well as economic, costs. Bleak earnings
                              prospects can also discourage women from participating in the labor market: over
                              50 percent of employed women are unpaid compared with 14 percent of men;
                              women are largely engaged in agriculture and manufacturing, which are low-paying
                              sectors, and there exists a large gender wage gap. Furthermore, most agricultural
                              workers and close to half of those engaged in the non-agricultural sector work
                              among females work from home. This seems to corroborate the argument that
                              female labor market activities may be underreported in surveys and that household
                              responsibilities, combined with social norms and mobility constraints, are major
                              barriers to labor market activities.

market challenges                Among those who do participate in the labor market, young people are more likely
                                 to be informally employed without a contract (Figure 37), or to be in unpaid work.
                                 Stark gender differences also still exist among young people, with these outcomes
                                 being far worse among females. The difﬁcu lties in school-to-work transitions and
                                 labor market challenges can be in part explained by inadequate job preparedness
                                 because of the poor quality and lack of labor market relevance of education. This
                                 is exacerbated by lower demand for young workers due to their lack of experience
                                 and the presence of social networks through which the majority of recruitment in
                                 Punjab takes place.62 The fact that the majority of employers search for workers
                                 through social networks and referrals tends to amplify labor market inefﬁciencies.

                          employment and earnings) in both developed and developing countries: better
                          education and technical skills tend to lead to higher earnings through formal

                          promoted. However, the incidence of TVET in Punjab remains relatively low at
                          about 14 percent.67 Men are more likely to complete vocational education than
                          women. The incidence of vocational education is slightly lower among youth than
                          among adults, probably because many young individuals are still in school and
                          access to vocational training may not have increased over time. In recognition of
                          the limited access to training opportunities, policy efforts for skills training have

market relevant              job for over half of them. With the rapid scaling-up of training, efforts to measure
training                     employment outcomes or assess the process of job searches have been limited.
                             Currently, the TVET system has limited support for supplementary intervention,

3.      Modernizing agriculture in Pakistan
Agriculture continues to be an important sector in Pakistan, both politically and socioeconomically, accounting
for almost 21 percent of total GDP, employing 44 percent of the labor force and providing 78 percent of the
country’s export (textile, food, and leather in FY16) earnings, either directly or indirectly. In recent years,
however, the agriculture sector’s performance has declined relative to its potential: below 3 percent over the
past ﬁve years, and turning a negative 0.19 percent in FY16.74 Agriculture is beset by numerous challenges,
including a lack of availability of modern cultivars, the slow rate of technological innovation, increasing land
fragmentation, limited diversiﬁcation, and insufﬁcient investment in and maintenance of infrastructure. Related
to these challenges are institutional and policy issues pertaining to Punjab’s enormous public wheat
procurement program, which has created market inefﬁciencies, excess supply and a high ﬁscal burdens for the
provincial government.

Agriculture is an        Within agriculture, arable crops represent 37 percent of agricultural GDP, livestock
important sector for     59 percent, and ﬁshing and forestry 4 percent. In Pakistan, there are some 8.3 million
the economy, but is      farms, of which 82 percent are owned and the remaining 18 percent are owned-cum-
experiencing             tenant and tenant farms. While 89 percent of these farms have fewer than 5 hectares
declining growth         (ha), nearly 82 percent of the cropped area is irrigated and agriculture is by far the
                         largest user of water. Despite its importance, agricultural performance in recent years
                         has been disappointing, with only 3.3 percent annual growth over the past decade
                         compared with over 5 percent in the 1980s and over 4 percent in 1990s.

And the sector faces The major factors underlying this poor performance include sluggish growth in
numerous challenges productivity in recent years, the slow rate of technological innovation and i       l mited
                     adoption of progressive farming technologies, the non-availability of essential inputs
                     such as certiﬁed quality seeds, fertilizer and water (especially to the tail-enders),
                     declining public investment in research and technology development and its
                     extension, limited investment in construction and maintenance of infrastructure,
                     marketing and trade restrictions, and a high incidence of pest and livestock diseases.
                     In addition, the majority of the farms are small in size, yield gaps are large relative to
                     potential (as demonstrated by progressive farmers in Pakistan and farmers elsewhere
                     such as India, Thailand, China, etc.), both input and output markets are inefﬁcient,
                     the focus of agriculture is only on four major crops, and yields vary largely across
                     different agro-climatic zones. These challenges are aggravated by poor rural
                     infrastructure, inefﬁcient extension services, and poor access to capital and ﬁnancial
                     resources by small and medium farmers. The absence of effective regulatory regimes
                     constrains private investment in the supply chain and seeds, leading to market
                     inefﬁciency.

Regional peers are      Looking at the regional context, the share of the agriculture sector in national GDP
increasing crop         of countries in Southeast and East Asia, such as Vietnam and China, has declined
yields at a faster pace over time—and at a much faster rate than in Pakistan. At the same time, these
                        countries have made major strides to increase yields of their important crops, while
                        Pakistan has lagged in its attempts to do likewise. Similarly, government expenditure
                        on the agriculture sector, both as percentage of total outlays and as a percentage of

                         74 Cotton production remained 27 percent below the previous year’s production and 35 percent below
                           the target of 15.5 million bales. This was driven by a combination of factors, including a prolonged
                           cold spell and severe pest attacks that, as a result of non-availability of resistant seeds, led to crop losses
                           mainly in Southern Punjab and Sindh. In addition, the depressed price of cotton may have reduced
                           farmers’ incentive to invest in good quality pesticides and inputs.

                     a.        Challenges from water stress, low yields, and limited
                               diver siﬁcation

Water availability is          Not only is Pakistan classiﬁed as one of the world’s most water- stressed countries, it
under stress, with             is also dependent on a single river system. The surface irrigation system in the Indus
demand expected to             delta suffers from rapid infrastructure degradation caused by insufﬁcient maintenance
soon outstrip supply           and repair expenditure, in addition to pollution of surface and groundwater from the
                               excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers. The surface water infrastructure has
                               extremely low user charges and lacks an effective asset management plan. Moreover,
                               the Indus basin is vulnerable to climate change76 compounded by water storage
                               problems. Total dam storage in Pakistan represents only 30 days of average demand,
                               compared with 220 days in India and 1,000 days in Egypt. The demand for water is
                               likely to reach 261 million acre-feet (maf) by 2025, whereas supply is likely to stagnate
                               at around 150 maf (barring the impact of climate change), resulting in a shortfall of
                               about 111 maf.77 In this situation, the conservation of water by containing losses and
                               improving productivity becomes the only viable option besides the construction of
                               water storage facilities and increasing water pricing.

And productivity               Apart from water stress, productivity is also considerably lower in Pakistan than in
remains below par              other countries. Crop yields, both per hectare and per cubic meter of water, are much
                               lower than international benchmarks (Table 15). This is due to excessive reliance on
                               traditional irrigation methods (ﬂood irrigation) combined with the basic absence of
                               pricing of surface water, which together cause huge water losses due to overuse,
                               excessive run-off, deep percolation and evaporation. It not only damages the land
                               quality (water-logging) but also reduces crop yields, as excessive water leaches

Crop yields are                Yield growth of the four major crops80 has slowed since the 1990s. For example, rice
growing too slowly             yields grew at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent in the 1960s, falling to 2.9 percent in
                               the 1990s and just 1.7 percent in the period 2000-10. A similar pattern can be observed
                               in wheat, with average annual yield growth of 3.6 percent in the 1960s, 3.1 percent in the
                               1990s, 0.9 percent in the period 2000-10, and negative 0.4 percent in the period 2011-15.

Agricultural reform        There is substantial scope for accelerating broad-based agricultural growth by
at a fundamental           stimulating productivity, technology and innovation; better water management; an
level is now crucial       improved regulatory regime and agricultural trade policies; and a smarter subsidy
                           regime. Fundamental reforms in agricultural research and extension systems,
                           marketing of crops and livestock products (market reforms) as well as water
                           management policies and institutions, could provide greater efﬁciency to the sector.

                  b.        The burden of the wheat procurement program in Punjab
The Government of          The Government of Punjab operates the largest wheat procurement system in
Punjab operates a          Pakistan, whereby the Food Department procures wheat at the announced support
large wheat                price and releases it to registered ﬂour mills. This system is ﬁnanced via budgetary
procurement system         allocations including bank borrowing,84 with the support price consistently on the
                           rise. Over the past decade, the price at which the government procures wheat has
                           risen by 225 percent, and in 2016 it stood at Rs. 1,300/40kgs (US$310/metric ton),
                           well above the international price of wheat (fob of US$180/ton and estimated cif
                           Lahore of US$238/ton). This policy distorts farmers’ incentives, by encouraging them
                           to produce more of a crop that has become increasingly inferior over time (as incomes
                           have grown), and for which there are already excess stocks. The policy also increases
                           the prices paid by local consumers across the country for ﬂour and generates high
                           carryover stocks that are vulnerable to spoilage and pilferage. An export subsidy
                           policy of US$120 per ton was announced in June 2016 with traders seeking an
                           additional US$60 per ton. However, even these generous export subsidies have not
                           been effective in encouraging signiﬁcant levels of wheat exports.

The system comes at Often deemed to be ineffective in stabilizing prices and making wheat more
huge costs, both    affordable, the wheat procurement system is plagued with patronage and rent-seeking,
direct and indirect with smaller farmers particularly disadvantaged. The entire cost of the program is
(Table 16)          enormous, with the direct costs of buying, storing and releasing wheat at a ﬁxed price
                    over the year estimated at Rs. 35 billion annually.85 Indirect costs are also substantial
                    and include physical losses due to poor storage and high spoilage; pilferage; over-
                    production of wheat and a consequent under-production of other higher value
                    commodities; diversion of credit from the banking system; and a disincentive for the
                    private sector to build storage facilities that would also be available for other crops
                    besides wheat.

between 2001 and              the 46.2 percentage points in KP but faster than the 30.8 percentage points in Sindh
2014                          and the 14.4 percentage points in Baluchistan. Punjab had the lowest poverty rate
                              throughout this time period. Similar to the rest of Pakistan, the largest poverty
                              reduction in Punjab (4 percentage points per year) occurred between FY02 and FY06,
                              which is the period when GDP per capita growth rose rapidly and peaked at 5.5
                              percent in 2005. Since then, as growth has slowed, poverty has continued to decrease
                              but at a slower pace. Among the poor, welfare has also improved, bringing the poor
                              closer to poverty line, hence reducing the amount of resources needed to eliminate
                              poverty (Figure 43).

an increase in paid                15.3 percentage points among female workers (Figure 45). Among men, this shift was
employment                         accompanied by a move from agriculture into industry: by FY14, 26.5 percent of rural
                                   men worked in manufacturing, up from 19 percent in FY02, whereas rural women
                                   tended to stay within agriculture, but towards paid work (Figure 46). In urban areas,
                                   the shift towards paid employment was less signiﬁcant, but there was a shift from
                                   low-skilled services into manufacturing, among both men and women.
