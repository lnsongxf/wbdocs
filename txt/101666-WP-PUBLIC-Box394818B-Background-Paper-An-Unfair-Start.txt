       Summary

                   De s pi t e r a pi d e c on om ic gr ow t h , i n e qua l i t y
                   i s i nc r e a s i ng i n I n d on e s i a . After recovering
                   from the Asian financial crisis in 1997/98, Indonesia’s
                   real GDP per capita grew at an annual average of 5.4
                   percent between 2000 and 2014. This robust rate of
                   growth helped to halve the poverty rate from 23.4 percent
                   during the crisis down to 11.2 percent by 2015. However,
                   between 2003 and 2010, consumption per person for the
                   richest 10 percent of Indonesians grew at over 6 percent
                   per year after adjusting for inflation, while for the poorest
                   40 percent it grew by less than 2 percent per year. This
                   disparity in consumption between different income levels
                   has, in turn, given rise to a sharp increase in the Gini
                   coefficient over the past 15 years, increasing from 30 in
                   2000 to 41 in 2013.

                   Inequality of opportunity, when not everyone has access
                   to the same opportunities in life, accounts for one-third of
                   all consumption inequality. Access to opportunities—such
                   as adequate health facilities and good quality schools—
                   impact whether children are able to cognitively and
                   physically develop, which in turn affects whether they can
                   acquire the skills needed to find well-paying jobs. Thus,
                   inequality experienced at birth perpetuates inequality in
                   later life.

       T h e mo s t a ppa r e n t c on t r i bu t or t o                    schools without electricity or running water. Another
       i n e qua l i t y of opp ort u n i t y i s ge o gr a ph y:           example is that rural households are mostly (95 percent)
       e a s t e r n I n d on e s i a l ag s be h i n d t h e r e s t       able to access primary health care facilities, such as
       of t h e c ou n t ry i n a l mo s t a l l h e a lt h a n d           polyclinics or Puskesmas, but only 70 percent are able
       e duc at ion i n dic at or s . People living in eastern              to access hospitals.
       Indonesia, particularly in Maluku and Papua, have much
       more difficulty accessing primary health care, hospitals,            T h e e duc at ion l e v e l a n d i nc om e of

       and skilled delivery services, and even those who can                t h e hous e hol d h e a d m at t e r s om e w h at

       access public health centers (Puskesmas) are unlikely to             i n de t e r m i n i ng a c h i l d ’ s ac c e s s t o

       find ones with proper facilities. Schools in Maluku and              opp ort u n i t i e s , bu t t h e ge n de r of t h e

       Papua are further away from homes, less likely to have               hous e hol d h e a d d oe s n o t. As parents become

       access to electricity or proper sanitation facilities, and           richer and better educated, their children are more likely
       less likely to have high quality teachers. Papua is the only         to have access to higher quality health and education
       region without universal access to primary school (SD),              services. There are also improvements in intermediary
                                                                            outcomes such as stunting and educational test scores.

       to the nearest village with a primary school. Thus, children
                                                                            or outcomes between male- and female-headed

       The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) was                           arises from the fact that the weights used to aggregate

       monetary measures of poverty by considering overlapping                consumption expenditure (or, implicitly, its dual, the
       deprivations su ered by people at the same time. The                   incomes used to ﬁnance consumption). Under the law
       index identiﬁes deprivations across the same three                     of one price, and given relatively weak assumptions on
       dimensions as the HDI and shows the number of people                   preferences, relative prices are equal to the rate at which

        On average, more than 10 percent of schools in Indonesia
        do not have access to electricity and most are located
        in Papua. In fact, more than one in three schools in Papua
        does not have electricity. The lack of electricity in a school
        poses major problems, resulting in a lack of good lighting
        and the inability to use multimedia equipment such as
        the use of overhead projectors and computers. This
        means that lessons are delivered less e ectively than
        in schools that are able to use technology and various
        multimedia equipment.

           ACCESS TO WATER IN SCHOOL BATHROOMS IS STILL A CHALLENGE IN INDONESIA WITH THE RESULT THAT
          STUDENTS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISEASE. On average, 18 percent of schools in Indonesia do not have running
          water in their bathrooms. Some regions, such as Maluku and Papua, have double the level of schools without water
          in their bathrooms compared with Java and Bali. UNICEF (2005) contends that the lack of clean water and sanitation
          in schools jeopardizes the quality education, as clean water and sanitation are both essential to protect children’s
          health and their ability to learn at school. In this sense, they are as vital as textbooks to a child’s education. No water in
          bathrooms means that students do not wash their hands after they have been to the toilet, or wash their hands before
          they eat. This is highly unsanitary and increases the potential for the spread of diseases such as diarrhea and typhoid.

          is important in ensuring that students are not only learning theories, but also exposed to practical work. On average,
          70 percent of junior secondary schools in Indonesia do not have access to a laboratory. Urban and rural di erences
          and di erences across a region are only 10 percent at most. This is worrying as it means that most Indonesian students
          do not have the facilities to enable them to do well in science. In fact, Indonesia’s OECD Pisa 2012 and 2015 results
          reveal that 15-year-old students in Indonesia (or those who are expected to be in the last grade of junior secondary
          school) score badly in science compared with other countries in the region.

          E N R OL L E D. While most households do have primary schools in their village, nonetheless on average 2.5 percent
          of children fail to enroll in primary school (Figure 9b and Figure 14a). Therefore, the challenges in enrollment may go
          beyond supply constraints. Furthermore, household per capita consumption also reveals that children from households
          with higher per capita consumption are more likely to be enrolled than those who come from households with lower
          per capita consumption. This further points toward demand-based constraints.

       the examination scores of students aged 10-15 years of age, it is evident that students whose parents have lower levels
       of education have lower test scores than those who have parents with higher levels of education. Similarly, students
       who come from poorer households have lower test scores than those who come from households with higher levels
       of consumption. All this means that some children cannot gain the same advantages from schooling, even if they have
       access to schools.

         G A P S S T I L L E X I S T. People living in eastern Indonesia, especially those living in Papua, are more likely to experience
         di culties in accessing primary health care. More than 25 percent of Papuans still face challenges in reaching primary
         health care services such as polyclinics, Puskesmas, Puskesmas Pembantu, or a physician’s practice. As expected, the
         poorest deciles are more likely to have di culties in accessing primary health care than richer deciles, possibly due to
         the fact that rural areas mostly consist of poorer households.

 as running water and electricity. More than one in four Puskesmas in Maluku and one in 10 in Papua do not have a doctor,
 compared with the national average of one in three. One in 25 Puskesmas in Indonesia does not have access to running
 water. This means that water is either obtained from a well, or even possibly from an unprotected source. Meanwhile, on
 average in Indonesia, one in 50 Puskesmas does not have electricity, and Papua has the worst access with more than one
 in four Puskesmas having no access to electricity.

        OPPORTUNITY MATTER MOST
        IN INDONESIA?




        WHILE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES ARE IMPROVING, THERE ARE OBVIOUS REGIONAL DISPARITIES WITHIN
        INDONESIA AND IN COMPARING INDONESIA WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. On average, 4 percent
        of children in Indonesia have never been immunized, and the numbers are especially high for Papua with almost
        18 percent of children never having been immunized. Lack of access to health care may also explain the high level
        of maternal mortality. In 2013, Indonesia’s maternal mortality ratio was almost four times of that of Vietnam’s, a country
        with a lower GDP per capita than Indonesia. In Indonesia, 190 out of 100,000 mothers die in childbirth, compared with
        49 in Vietnam (World Development Indicators).

        WHILE CHILDREN FROM HOUSEHOLDS WITH A HIGHER PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION ARE LESS LIKELY NOT TO
        BE IMMUNIZED, THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AS SOME CHILDREN EVEN IN THE RICHEST DECILE
        HAVE NEVER BEEN IMMUNIZED. Almost 8 percent of children from the poorest decile compared with 1 percent of
        children from the richest decile have never received any form of immunization. Immunization plays a signiﬁcant role

        of children have poor education, and health access and poor transportation. By contrast, only 1 percent of children in
        urban areas have all three negative indicators. Therefore, the solution in rural areas may not necessarily lie in creating
        new schools or health care facilities, but rather in improving the transportation infrastructure so that people are able
        to get to these facilities more easily. Meanwhile, interventions for urban areas that focus on improving transportation
        services will be less e ective in improving access to health and education, as only 5 percent of urban children who
        lack access to health and education also lack access to transportation.

       is less than 1 percent in Java/Bali. Lack of good roads means that it takes longer for goods to be delivered, and makes
       the delivery of perishable goods more challenging. Moreover, lack of good roads means that travel will also take longer,
       whether this is to schools or to health care centers. Therefore, good road infrastructure plays a crucial role
       in development as it better connects people with services, food, and markets.

          people and is signiﬁcantly higher in eastern Indonesia. Interestingly, Nusa Tenggara is in need of more bridges than Papua,
          with 35 percent and 28 percent, respectively. Bridges are particularly useful in connecting people and services. The
          existence of a bridge can signiﬁcantly cut the time needed for distribution and allow people to access services more easily.

          this level for households in the highest decile. Di erences across households may stem from the fact that poorer
          households are mostly located in rural areas, while richer households tend to be mostly located in urban areas.

         the percentage of households without access to regular transport to their local district government o ce. On average,
         27 percent of households in Indonesia have no access to regular public transport to their local district o ce. As
         previously, eastern Indonesia has the worst access to a public transportation system, with 55 percent of households in
         Papua and 49 percent of households in Kalimantan without regular transport to the district o ce. What is interesting is
         that, looking at the per capita consumption decile, there are no signiﬁcant di erences across deciles.

       Annex: Data And Methodology

       This paper examines inequality in Indonesia, more speciﬁcally inequality of opportunity. It utilizes three di erent
       analytical tools to examine inequality through di erent dimensions.

       1. INEQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY DECOMPOSITION
       One way to analyze inequality of opportunity is to use decomposition analysis. Decomposition analysis essentially
       looks at how an individual’s current per capita consumption is a ected by various factors. The sample consists of
       households in which the head of the household was born after 1948. This person’s household per capita consumption
       is used to predict their welfare. Then a range of their circumstances at birth are examined to see which aspects have
       led them to have the per capita consumption expenditure that they have today.

       2. DASHBOARD APPROACH
       The second analysis is done through a dashboard approach, which essentially provides di erent indices for each
       dimension. The dashboard approach allows for comparison of achievements (or deprivations) across di erent groups.
       For instance, it analyzes whether there are any signiﬁcant di erences between: access to schools for those living in
       urban/rural areas, di erences between those who have male/female headed households, di erences based on the
       education attainment of the parents, di erences across di erent parts of Indonesia, and whether there are di erences
       by decile measured based on consumption expenditure. The dashboard approach therefore considers the marginal
       distribution between achievements (or deprivations) across di erent groups.

       3. ASSOCIATIONS VENN
       Following Ferreira and Lugo (2012), this paper also examines the correlation between achievements (or deprivations)
       graphically through the use of Venn diagrams. It essentially aims to answer whether individuals who score negatively
       in one dimension also score negatively in other dimensions. For example, the associations between physical access to
       education, health, and transportation services, or education, the presence of a midwife, and unskilled delivery. These
       correlation/associations have important implications for program design and targeting.

       This paper utilizes data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), which provides reliable information on relevant
       dimensions such as health status, anthropometrics, education and consumption. IFLS is a panel survey so it allows for
       the examination of individuals over time, which in turn allows for the analysis of individuals’ consumption expenditure
       or education outcome in relation their circumstances at birth. The National Socioeconomic Survey (Survei Sosial
       Ekonomi Nasional, or Susenas) and the village potential data (Potensi Desa, or Podes) are also used to examine the
       existence of public infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools.
