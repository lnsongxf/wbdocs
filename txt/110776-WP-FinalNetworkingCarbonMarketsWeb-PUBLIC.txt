           This Discussion Paper was prepared by the author for the World Bank Group’s
       Networked Carbon Markets (NCM) initiative. It describes the rationale, objectives and key
                                  elements of the NCM initiative.


      It is expected that the proposed concepts and components outlined in this Paper will evolve
       based on discussions with stakeholders, further technical work, and negotiations under the
                       United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.


       This is the second iteration of the Paper, which is ‘live’ and will continue to be updated to
                               capture the evolution of the NCM initiative.

The way in which MV is applied to the transaction process        Multiple Trading Partners—Holding Accounts
can take a range of different forms, leading to differing        in Country B Registry
results. The following examples in this Section 5.1
illustrate the point, which is then elaborated in Section 5.2
and Annex D. In the first example, the asset retains its
original form of unit; in the second example, the asset is
converted into another unit, either that of the importing
scheme or jurisdiction, or some form of ‘transaction unit’.

Unit Retains Original Domestic Form
In the first example, when the mitigation outcome asset
from Country A is transferred to Country B, the Country A
unit ends up in the Country B registry, in the account
of the Country B buyer. This approach may be simpler
if the buyer and seller have only a small number of
trading partners. Subject to any other import restrictions
that might apply, MV might be applied to determine
the value of the unit, thereby preserving the integrity of
trade. The mitigation value would therefore be reflected
in the discounted co-efficient of each mitigation outcome
transferred. If the buyer/seller have a number of trading
partners, retaining the original form of the domestic unit

48 This  might include an index based on reference to a global emissions budget, or similar concept, discussed later in this Section.
49 For illustration, the Index could be based on a basket of, say, the average of MV assessment outcomes for all the jurisdictions engaged in
Networking, weighted according to their respective GHG emissions. Note however, that indices all have their own method of calculation and
the Index could be constructed in any one of many different ways.
50 Whether these ITUs themselves would be tradable, or simply notional units for the purposes of facilitating transactions, is another issue

that is touched on briefly in Section 5.3.

87 Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is machine-readable and human-

readable. The design of XML focuses on documents, but it is widely used for other purposes and hundreds of documents formats using
XML have been developed, as XML is commonly used for the interchange of data over the Internet. Briefly by way of background, XML is an
application of Standard Generalised Markup Language (SGML). SGML is an ISO standard—ISO8879:1986 Information Processing—Text and
Office Systems—Standard Generalised Markup Language, which was derived from IBM’s Generalised Markup Language (GML). SGML was
originally designed to enable sharing of machine-readable large project documents in government, law and various industries. With growth in
the World Wide Web, SGML was seen as offering solutions to some development problems.
