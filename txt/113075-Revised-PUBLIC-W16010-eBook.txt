     Lesson 1: Although Utilities in Africa in General Underperform, There Are
           Relatively Well-Performing Utilities Operating in the Continent	             93
     Lesson 2: Customer Performance Is Relatively Weak Even among the
           Best-Performing Utilities	                                                   94
     Lesson 3: The Major Drivers of Water Utility Performance Are Linked to
           the Cost of Service, While an Enabling Environment as Reflected in
           Good Economic Management also Matters	                                       94
     Lesson 4: Improving Water Coverage in Africa Will Require Large Investments
           that Will Have to Be Mostly Paid for by Government Funds	                    95
     Lesson 5: Specific Measures Are Needed to Ensure that Progress in Financial Cost
           Recovery Does Not Translate into Less Affordable Services	                   96
     Lesson 6: Availability of Data is Critical to Assess Performance and
           Guide Sector Planning	                                                       96

Foreword

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to achieve universal and equitable access to
safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all by 2030. The SDGs are also calling on
more sustainable use of water resources through, amongst others, improving water quality
by reducing pollution by halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially
increasing recycling and safe reuse. These goals and targets are very ambitious, especially
since the region was not able to meet either the water or the sanitation Millennium
Development Goals.
  Between 2000 and 2015, access to piped water in Africa increased, but the urban popu-
lation grew even faster. This resulted in the decline of piped water on premises as a pri-
mary source of water supply from 40 percent in 2000 to 33 percent in 2015. One of the
reasons for the decline in piped water access is that many utilities are not able to cover
their basic operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. This results in insufficient funds to
keep up the service levels for existing consumers, let alone for new consumers.
Government funds in such environments often have to pay not only for the expansion of
access, but also to cover part of the O&M costs, which crowds out investments to connect
new customers.
  This report tries to look into how African utilities are performing. The study used a panel
data of 120 utilities throughout low- and lower-middle income countries in Africa utilizing
the Bank supported IBNET toolkit and database. The study also includes a set of case studies
of the best performing utilities in the continent. The report also investigates the drivers of
utility performance. This will help governments in the design and implementation of water
projects and sector reforms in urban environments as achieving the SDGs in the fast growing
cities of Sub-Saharan Africa will require a massive effort to ensure that more people get
access to sustainable and affordable services.
  The key findings of the report were shared with the ministers of Finance of Africa during
the Joint Bank-Fund Annual Meetings in October 2016. These key findings included that util-
ities in SSA show overall weak performance, especially with regard to customer perfor-
mance. The case studies, however, show that there are well performing utilities. At the same
time, using larger datasets, it is clear that sector reforms in combination with changes in the
economic environment in which utilities are operating (referring to for instance civil service
reform, energy policies, and land use planning, improvements in public investment plan-
ning) can help to improve the efficiency of water utilities in Africa. But as there is large gap
in service coverage, especially with regard to wastewater collection and treatment (as few
utilities in the sample provided these services), the region would need to invest significantly
in the sector if the SDGs are to be met.

        We hope that this publication will add information to the debate on how to most efficiently
      and effectively increase access to affordable water and sanitation services in the cities of
      Sub-Saharan Africa, and provide the reader with an informed view on the workings of the
      water utility sector to synergize international efforts in the region.

Overview

Africa’s urban population is growing rapidly. Between 2000 and 2015, the urban population
increased by more than 80 percent to 373 million people. Although access to piped water
increased (from 82 million urban dwellers with piped water in 2000 to 124 million in 2015),
African utilities were not able to keep up with the rapid urbanization as reflected in the
decline of piped water on the premises as a primary source of water supply in percentage
terms. The urban population served with piped water on the premises declined from
    percent in 2000 to 33 percent in 2015.1 The total population with improved services
40  ­
increased, but most of that increase came from an increase in the access to piped water off
premises and self-supply. Government funds often have to pay not only for expansion of
access, but also to cover part of the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, which crowds
out expansion investments. These government transfers also provide utilities with few
incentives to improve their financial performance.
  This report looks into how African utilities are doing using a data panel of about 120 utili-
ties in low- and middle-income countries in Africa, which represent about 53 percent of the
urban population served by piped network services and covered 14 countries in different
parts of Africa. The most notable exceptions in the analysis were Ethiopia and Nigeria—
which had only one or two years of data available at the time of analysis.
  Utility performance in Africa is in general weak, although there are well-performing utili-
ties. The performance of African utilities in the data panel has shown some improvements
between 2010 and 2013. Utilities in the sample were able to slowly improve water coverage,
but overall coverage stood at only 60 percent. Access to sewerage services is in its infancy in

    Africa with very few utilities providing such services. The O&M costs are highly variable in
    Africa—ranging from less than US$0.23 per cubic meter of water sold to US$2.07. The vari-
    ance of utilities’ performance within and between countries is very large. This is, for the
    most part, because water and wastewater services are affected by local factors. These factors
    can vary widely between utilities and include factors such as the distance to the water source
    and the effect on the cost to store and transport water, the quality of the water source and
    the need for treatment, and design standards, among others. Yet, more general policies in
    the country (for example, energy subsidies and labor policies) also affect the cost of O&M. As
    virtually everywhere water tariffs are set on the basis of the O&M cost of water, controlling
    costs is a major element in making the service more affordable.
      A data envelopment analysis (DEA) showed that although there are some relatively effi-
    cient utilities in Africa, they make up a small minority of utilities. The majority of utilities
    register an efficiency of 0.30 (which is far below the highest score of 1), showing significant
    options for improvement. As the fixed cost component in water (and wastewater) service
    provision is very large, the design (but also environmental, water quality, public health, and
    other) standards under which water infrastructure is constructed will determine the cost of
    the services for decades to come. Hence, it is important to undertake a proper least-cost
    analysis when investment decisions are made to ensure that the benefits and costs of such
    investments are properly analyzed because the financial, organizational, and social implica-
    tions of such investment decisions will be felt for many decades. DEA tests also show that
    governance may be a significant driver of water utility performance in Africa and that atten-
    tion to improving governance may be key to improving performance in water utilities.
      The increase in O&M costs of water services between 2010 and 2013 has been accompanied
    by an increase in the affordability of water services. This suggests that in many utilities, even
    in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is some scope for balancing the goals of revenue sufficiency and
    affordability more in favor of the former as government subsidies will otherwise need to
    increase rapidly in some countries. This is especially important because in 2013 a little less
    than half the utilities in the sample were not able to cover their O&M costs with their reve-
    nues. The high dependence on subsidies has major consequences. It crowds out investments
    in the sector, but it also results in serious equity concerns as those with piped water services
    tend to be more likely to be households with higher incomes. The case studies undertaken
    show that there are relatively well-performing utilities, but that even those that are perform-
    ing well with regard to operational and financial performance show weaknesses in providing
    customers with high-quality services (as measured in type of service level, reliability, and
    water consumption levels), especially when compared with global benchmarks.
      The context in which utilities operate matters. Collecting data on the institutional and
    socioeconomic context in which utilities operate matters. Regulation is often seen as a tool
    to ensure better governance in the sector.2 In low-income countries a regulator results in
    better customer performance, but does not extend to other forms of performance, such as
    operational performance or water coverage. This may be expected, because the objective of


2   Performance of Water Utilities in Africa
a regulator is to provide “customer protection” to existing customers (and hence the focus is
on providing minimum levels of customer service) but does not necessarily focus on
improvements in financial and operational sustainability or improvements in coverage com-
pared with utilities without a regulator.3 Service provision at the local level will increase
accountability and improve utility performance. Yet, the financial and operational perfor-
mance of utilities is not statistically different from the performance of other forms of service
delivery. As for customer performance, there are statistically significant differences: district-
or municipal-based service delivery shows better results. Yet, coverage lags behind in
municipal- or district-based service delivery compared with other levels of service delivery.
This may be partially explained by the impact of economic development on a utility’s perfor-
mance. If customers have access to more piped water to consume, the benefits of piped
water are more apparent compared with other water supply sources.4 This focus on improv-
ing the infrastructure will require, in the short term, more investments in the sector to
improve water coverage and a level of water consumption that sets piped water apart from
alternative water sources.
  The organization of water services affects utility performance. Economies of scale and
scope matter. Analysis of the large data sample shows that size matters, but that being too
big has a negative impact on performance. Economies of scope are evident. Utilities that
provide water and wastewater services in low-income countries tend to show slightly higher
levels of water coverage (as can be expected as sewerage coverage is provided sequen-
tially after a certain level of water coverage has been achieved). But customer performance
(or  ­
     service quality), operational performance, and financial performance are also higher
when sewerage services are provided in tandem with water services.
  Using large utility performance datasets to explain the drivers of utility performance
shows that the various aspects of what is considered good utility performance are very much
interrelated with feedback. The different aspects of performance affect one another. Higher
customer service quality has a positive impact on water coverage, whereas financial perfor-
mance may affect operational performance and water coverage, suggesting that funding is
necessary to improve access and measures to improve operations in the utility. In the case of
improving water access, the level of economic development matters, but also the quality of
economic management, especially for smaller utilities that may depend more than the large
ones on external funding to increase access, and hence enhance their revenue base. The
most interesting findings are that water coverage is directly influenced by customer perfor-
mance (that is, service quality). Better economic management and higher gross national
income (GNI) growth have a positive impact. In most cases there is no link between a utility’s
financial performance and water coverage—with the exception of large utilities in low-­
income countries (although the effect is small). This suggests that most utilities are not able
to improve access through improved financial performance but depend on external funds to
do so. This finding was confirmed by the case study utilities as most of these utilities needed
some external funding to make progress in improving access. Finally, as many of the

    performance indicators are composite indexes, using a single indicator, the most important
    may be the O&M cost per cubic meter sold. We found that tariffs essentially are driven by the
    O&M costs and to a lesser extent by the collection efficiency. Hence, minimizing the cost of
    services and improving the efficiency with which utilities collect their revenues will explain
    how well they are able to manage their financial performance.
      Another interesting finding is the impact of operational performance and customer perfor-
    mance on financial performance. Better operational performance tends to have a positive
    impact on financial performance; but the opposite is true for customer performance. The
    better the customer performance, the lower the financial performance. This may link to the
    cost associated with improvements in the different aspects of performance. Financial per-
    formance has a positive impact on operational performance too, although the effect seems
    weaker than the other way around.
      There is evidence that unobserved utility-specific heterogeneity explains a large portion
    of  the total variance, which would call for the large-scale collection of additional utility-­
    specific variables, for example, information on local conditions (topography, distance to the
    raw water source, whether the utility gets water primarily from groundwater or surface
    water, quality of the raw source, age of the infrastructure, access to alternative water source,
    and so on) and organizational and institutional data.5 Hence, much more and detailed infor-
    mation on utility operations and the context in which the utilities operate is required to
    explain with more clarity what drives individual utility performance. However, such data
    collection comes at a price with regard to the cost of collection and the willingness of utili-
    ties, regulators, and other stakeholders to provide such information; there is a trade-off to be
    made between data to be collected and analyzed and the cost of doing so.


    Notes
    1.	 The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization (WHO) Joint Monitoring Programme has
       served with piped water a total population of 153.4 million in 2015 (compared with 74.5 million in 1990), as there is also
       a small part of the rural population being served with piped water. The rural population with piped water increased in
       absolute numbers from 15 million to 29 million between 1990 and 2015, and piped water coverage remained more or less
       constant over the 1990 to 2015 period, at around 15 percent.

    2.	 Countries that have a regulatory agency in place show higher indexes for public sector management and institutions
       (as measured by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment [CPIA]) as there is reference in the definitions of CPIA to
       the existence and functioning of regulatory agencies in the quality of public administration definition (part of the public
       sector management and institutions overall index).

    3.	 It is unclear whether this is the result of the higher service levels, higher labor costs (as labor efficiencies coincide with
       higher staff cost per employee), the existence of higher transaction costs for the utility operators, or a multitude of other
       factors.

    4.	 In places where there are abundant alternative water resources, demand for piped water will always have to compete with
       these alternatives. Hence, when planning investments in piped water, this should be considered and a detailed demand
       analysis should be undertaken to investigate the demand for piped water in such environments.

    5.	 The IBNET Toolkit includes organizational data, but in this round of data collection in Africa, this information was not
       ­
       consistently collected by the task teams, and such information was not available in many of the regulatory reports. Hence,
       this information is not included in the analysis.

Chapter 1   Objective of the Study

            Africa’s urban population is growing rapidly. Between 2000 and 2015, the urban population
            increased by more than 80 percent from 206 million to 373 million people. Although access
            to piped water increased over the period (from 82 million urban dwellers with piped water in
            2000 to 124 million in 2015), African utilities were not able to keep up with the rapid urban-
            ization as reflected in the decline of piped water as a primary source of water supply in per-
            centage terms. The urban population served with piped water on the premises declined
            from 40 percent in 2000 to 33 percent in 2015. The total population with improved services
            increased, but most of that increase came from an increase in the access to piped water off
            premises and self-supply. This means that the performance of water utilities has been seri-
            ously lagging behind as there seems to be no lack of demand for improved water supplies.
            One of the reasons for the decline in piped water access is that many utilities are not able to
            cover their basic operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and hence are not able to generate
            sufficient funds to expand access. Government funds often have to pay not only for expan-
            sion of access, but also to cover part of the O&M costs, which crowds out expansion invest-
            ments. This dependence on government transfers at the same time does not provide utilities
            with many incentives to improve their financial performance.
              The overall decline in performance has not been investigated in much detail. As a result,
            the drivers of success in utility performance are still rather elusive for two major reasons.
            The first is a lack of agreement on what constitutes good performance. Utilities are supposed
            to provide services that are efficient, affordable, and sustainable. Yet, to simultaneously be
            able to provide affordable and sustainable water services has proven to be difficult as these
            different goals often result in conflicts and trade-offs. Having financially sustainable water

            Performance of Water Utilities in Africa                                                     5
    services that cannot be afforded by the majority of the population and as such are only
    accessible to the most well-off may not be desirable for a service that has important public
    health benefits. Yet, a service that is affordable but not financially sustainable tends to set
    utilities on a path of inadequate maintenance that results rather rapidly in low service qual-
    ity for which consumers are not willing to pay and hence will stall the willingness of poten-
    tial customers to connect and the willingness of existing customers to pay for piped water
    services. Hence, different emphasis on different aspects of what constitutes good perfor-
    mance may result in widely varying performance assessments.
      Second, because of lack of empirical work, there is little clarity on what drives performance
    in utilities. Water utilities in Africa are diverse. Utilities differ in their institutional setup
    (ranging from national utilities to decentralized companies working at municipal levels),
    organization, and reporting requirements. In view of the large number of utilities all over the
    world, the wide variety in geographic, hydrological, economic, social, institutional, politi-
    cal, and cultural differences, and changes over time and space, this lack of empirical work
    often means that sector professionals apply results from one utility or one country (often
    utilities in developed countries) to utilities in other countries with, often, very different
    institutional, political, and economic environments.
      The objective of this assessment is to inform Bank and government policies and projects
    on the drivers of utility performance by

    •	 assessing the performance of a sample of African utilities and benchmarking their per-
      formance against one another;

    •	 investigating the drivers of utility performance and determining how this affects the way
      that the government and Bank staff design and implement water and wastewater projects
      and policies; and

    •	 helping to increase the monitoring and evaluation capacity in utilities using the data
      available and benchmarks for performance in Africa as a baseline for water utility perfor-
      mance in Africa.

      The report describes the main outcomes and lessons learned from the assessment that
    identified and analyzed the main features of water utility performance in Africa. The
    report includes the following chapters. Following this introduction, chapter 2 describes
    the methodology used in the study, including details on the data collection process.
    In  chapter 3, the study team undertook a trend analysis of utility performance of the
    ­
    sector. The team had to weigh the advantages of providing shorter time series that cover
    larger groups of utilities or longer time series with a limited number of utilities. Chapter 4
    examines the efficiency of utilities using a DEA while also using an absolute performance
    approach. Chapter 5 investigates the effect of institutional factors on utility perfor-
    mance. This is followed in chapter 6 by an econometric analysis of the drivers of utility
    performance, using various definitions of utility performance. The results from the
    econometric models are then triangulated with a set of case studies of five utilities

Chapter 2   Scope and Methodology

            When looking into the performance of water utilities in Africa, one has to bear in mind that
            Africa is a large continent with significant differences in institutional setup of water sectors,
            access to and quality of water resources, and levels of economic development across and
            within countries. Much of that variation will be lost in aggregating information. Yet, taking
            into account all these utility-specific differences will result in a set of case studies that make
            it hard to compile any of the findings into more general lessons learned. This study is part of
            a larger study that also looks into the performance of electricity utilities. The electricity
            study used a case study approach and together with this water assessment will allow for a
            better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the different study approaches.
              A well-performing utility is a utility that is able to provide high-quality water and/or waste-
            water services to its customers in a sustainable manner. This definition of a well-performing
            utility includes elements of good financial and operational performance, but also universal
            access to water and wastewater services that are affordable to all. The analysis will look at
            three elements to define a well-performing utility: financial performance, customer per-
            formance (an index that covers the quality of access to water services), and operational
            performance. Water coverage is looked at separately because in many cases investments to
            support an increase in access to water and wastewater services are mostly funded by gov-
            ernment and hence not fully under the control of the utility.
              Another point to consider is that water coverage has increased rapidly over time in Africa.
            Between 1990 and 2015, Africa’s population grew from 510 million to 989 million—an increase
            of 94 percent. Population growth in urban areas was even higher—increasing by more than



            Performance of Water Utilities in Africa                                                        9
     169 percent between 1990 and 2015. Even though the proportion of access to improved ser-
     vices increased from 48 percent in 1990 to 68 percent in 2015, access to piped water barely
     changed and still stood at 15 percent in 2015 according to the UNICEF–WHO Joint Monitoring
     Programme (JMP). This means that access to piped water services on the premises in urban
     areas decreased from 43 percent in 1990 to 33 percent in 2015. At the same time, the absolute
     number of people with access to piped water services on the premises increased from
     74 million to 153 million between 1990 and 2015 in Sub-Saharan Africa.1 Simultaneously, the
     number of utilities in Africa has increased significantly as more and smaller towns estab-
     lished utilities and a larger number of these smaller towns were included in the International
     Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) sample.
       The team combined a desk study using existing data from IBNET with fieldwork under-
     taken by task team leaders (TTLs) in Africa to collect additional operational and financial
     utility data. This ensured a sufficiently large panel to undertake analysis to determine (a) the
     drivers of good utility performance and (b) the scope of efficiency improvements in these
     utilities that could be achieved.
       The data collection by the TTLs was most effective in western Africa where data was col-
     lected for the period 2010 to 2013 for Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau,
     Niger, and Senegal. In addition, data for the same time period was collected for the
     Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, and
     Zambia mostly by mining reports and databases from regulators, the IBNET team data col-
     lection efforts, and, in the case of Mozambique, through TTL project reporting. Data from
     Ethiopia and Nigeria were collected previously by the IBNET team managed by the Water
     and Sanitation Program; but data collection efforts have just started in these countries and
     hence only include one or two years of observations. The team used the IBNET Toolkit to
     ensure that the data collected was comparable. By the end of the data collection period, the
     team had access to 306 utilities from 41 countries covering a period of up to 20 years of
     observations. However, the data panel is unbalanced, with some utilities represented in the
     database with only one year of observations and others with up to 20 years. Some utilities
     provide very detailed information while others provide much less information. The data
     was provided voluntarily by the utilities and this—in combination with differences in the
     quality of the data collected—results in variations in what data is being submitted and can
     actually be used by the study team. The data was collected by TTLs from the utilities with a
     first quality check from the TTLs and a second quality check from the IBNET team. The
     quality assurance methods are discussed in appendix C.
       For the analysis, the team used a balanced panel (that is, a set of utilities that remains
     unchanged over the period under review). The team used datasets that included a subset
     of the dataset covering a shorter period (2010 to 2013). This balanced panel will, however,
     exclude large parts of Africa (especially utilities in countries like Ethiopia and Nigeria
     where data collection has just started and where there are only one or two years of
     data  available). The analysis also excluded utilities from Namibia and South Africa2 as


10   Performance of Water Utilities in Africa
these are upper-middle-income countries whose utilities perform at a different level than
most, if not all, other utilities in the region. Where possible, and as far as data availability
allowed, the team also analyzed institutional factors. Despite the exclusion of many coun-
tries, the panel data sample represents a large part of the African population served with
piped water; partially because access to piped water in countries like Ethiopia and Nigeria
is still rather low. The JMP estimated that 149 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa had
access to piped water in 2013; when excluding upper-middle-income countries like
Botswana, Mauritius, Namibia, and South Africa, the population with access to piped water
on the premises drops to 108 million. The database between 2010 and 2013, excluding the
upper-middle-income countries, covers a total population served with piped water of
58 million (equivalent to 55 percent of the people served by piped water according to the
JMP), of which 41 million use piped water through house connections (including sharing of
these house connections). Hence, the people covered in the database cover a very large
part of the total population in Africa with access to piped water. Table 2.1 below describes
the sample of utilities in detail.


Performance Analysis
The analysis starts with a sector status report looking at the performance of the balanced
panel of 119 utilities in Africa. The sector status report provides data on how these 119 utili-
ties have been performing between 2010 and 2013 on different elements of performance. The
team undertook a performance analysis by defining three different indicators: operational
performance, financial performance, and customer performance.
  Operational performance was defined as the unweighted average of three indicators:
metering, nonrevenue water (NRW, as measured in cubic meters per connection per day), and
staff efficiency (which measures how much revenues are collected for each U.S. dollar spent
on staff costs). Table 2.2 shows the benchmarks that were used to calculate how far utilities

     deviate from those benchmarks set at the best 25 percent of the sample being used. Scores are
     between 0 and 1. If the utility is achieving the benchmark value, a value of 1 is assigned; in
     case the utility achieves below the benchmark the utility achieves a score of below 1—the
     further away from the benchmark, the lower the value. A global benchmark was also calcu-
     lated using the data analysis from the second IBNET Blue Book (Danilenko et al. 2014) using
     the best 25 percent of a sample covering 2006–11.
       For financial performance, the operating cost coverage ratio (OCCR) was used. The African
     benchmark of the best performing (25 percent) utilities was 1.19; whereas the global bench-
     mark stands at 1.38.
       Customer performance was defined as the unweighted average of three indicators: popu-
     lation per connection, reliability, and affordability. The population per connection is looked
     at as a proxy for service levels. When utilities provide only household connections, the pop-
     ulation per connection tends to be relatively low (slightly above the average household size).
     Yet, sharing of connections is common in Africa through the provision of standposts, the use
     of water kiosks, and sharing of house connections with several households. Table 2.3 shows
     the benchmarks that were used to calculate how far utilities deviate from those benchmarks
     set at the best 25 percent of the sample being used. The same methodology is used as
     described above in the operational performance measurement.
       Finally, a water coverage performance indicator that measures how the utilities are
     performing in providing access to water services was included. Although there are utilities
     in the sample that provide wastewater, the number of utilities that provide wastewater ser-
     vices is limited and moreover, those that provide wastewater services provide services to
     only a very small population. Hence, this service has not been included. Yet, if it had been
     included, the performance would have lagged significantly behind global benchmarks. Even
     without taking wastewater coverage into consideration, Africa’s top utilities provide water
     to 77 percent or more of the population in its service area, compared with a global bench-
     mark of 100 percent.
       In addition, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) was undertaken to measure the relative
     efficiency of utilities. The DEA creates a performance index from indicators—referred to as
     inputs and outputs in the DEA literature—that can be related to other factors that drive
     performance. Under basic DEA, a water utility is regarded as a relatively efficient utility if
     its observed inputs can be scaled to yield outputs that equal or exceed any combination or

scaling of what other utilities’ observed inputs yield. Productive efficiency was assessed
through DEA. Water billed was considered as the major output while number of staff and
number of connections are considered as inputs.


Institutional Performance Analysis
The institutional assessment used the data panel for 2010 and 2013 because institutional
performance is a variable that does not vary too widely over time. Collecting organizational
data from utilities turned out to be difficult (that is, the response rate was very low). So a set
of more general institutional data was used, such as type of service delivery (national,
regional, or municipal service delivery), the presence of an (independent) regulatory
agency, and the scope of services (that is, utility provides only water or provides multiple
services). A simple t-test analysis was used to test several institutional factors of the utilities’
institutional context and their effect on a number of performance indicators.


Drivers of Utility Performance Analysis
The focus in this analysis is on three indicators of performance: the first one assesses
utilities’ financial performance and is defined as a binary variable. More precisely, a utility
is considered to be financially well-performing if its OCCR is equal to, or greater than, 1.19.3
The second indicator measures the quality of service. The so-called customer performance
indicator is the average of three indicators as laid out above: population per connection
(as proxy for service level with a level of less than 8.3 set as the African benchmark), reliabil-
ity as measured by hours of water supplied (African benchmark of 21.6 hours per day or
more), and affordability (with water costing consumers less than 1.22 percent of GNI). The
customer performance index is measured on a 0–1 scale, with a higher value of the indicator
indicating better performance. The third indicator, assessing utilities’ operational perfor-
mance, is calculated as the average over three indicators: staff efficiency (takes the value 1 if
equal to or higher than 4.21), metering (takes the value 1 if equal to 100 percent), and NRW
(takes the value 1 if equal to or lower than 0.205 m3 per connection per day). Finally, the
team used water coverage where a top-performing utility has a coverage of 77 percent or
higher. The team found that the correlations between the four indicators are positive but
very small. The lack of, or rather small, correlation between the four indexes indicates,

     for instance, that being financially a good performer does not necessarily correlate with the
     fact, or imply, that the utility provides a good service to its customers. The performance
     indicators thus have to be analyzed separately because the drivers of utility perfor-
     mance  are  not closely correlated; hence, improvements in financial performance do not
     automatically translate to improvements in customer performance and vice versa. The team
     then tried to estimate the drivers of performance using econometric techniques.


     Case Studies
     In chapter 3, the team analyzed five case studies to determine whether the findings in the
     econometric analysis could be validated by the individual case studies. To ensure some sim-
     ilarity in case studies, the team was asked to undertake the same case studies as those
     undertaken by a similar study conducted by the Electricity Team—looking into the drivers
     of performance of electricity utilities in Africa. The case studies were those of Burkina Faso,
     Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya (Nairobi), Senegal, and Uganda. The selection of the case studies
     was not at random, and hence there are certain characteristics that differ from the sample
     as used in the econometric analysis. All these utilities are large, and serve more than
       million people (compared with the typical utility in the econometric database of about
     1 ­
     115,000). The five utilities are all—with the exception of Nairobi—national utilities. National
     utilities are not very common in Africa and they tend to be mostly located in western Africa.
     Yet, all five case studies refer to large utilities. Because all these utilities provide services to
     the capital city, they tend to have a longer history than the typical utility in Africa. The case
     studies show how these five utilities are doing in terms of providing services to clients
     (to make the results comparable with those of the Electricity Study), while also triangulat-
     ing the results from the econometric models presented in chapter 6.


     Notes
     1.	 The increase in access to improved water sources (which includes not only piped water, but also other forms of improved
        water services such as access to protected wells and springs, rainwater) as defined by UNICEF-WHO Joint Monitoring
        Programme saw a much sharper increase from 242 million in 1990 to 669 million in 2015.

     2.	 Including Namibia and South Africa may skew the performance to such levels that are not necessarily realistic measures of
        good performance for utilities in other parts of Africa.

     3.	 To avoid possible errors due to misreporting and the presence of outliers, we removed from the sample observations below
        the 2.5 percentile and above the 97.5 percentile in the OCCR distribution.

Chapter 3   Performance of Utilities in Africa:
            Trend Analysis

            The team undertook the analysis for the panel with the shorter time series but larger number
            of utilities. The trend analysis excludes utilities from Namibia and South Africa as these are
            upper-middle-income countries whose utilities perform at a different level than most, if not
            all, other utilities in Africa.
              When analyzing the data, three dimensions of performance will be examined: opera-
            tional, financial, and customer performance. Operational performance will look into how
            well the utility manages its operations. The financial performance is measured in terms of
            how effective the utility is in generating revenues from its operations, and using these rev-
            enues to cover its operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Finally, customer performance
            is assessed. The objective of a utility is to provide customers with high-quality water ser-
            vices and (to a much lesser extent) wastewater services. The quality of its water services is
            measured by its ability to provide access to water users, but also the level of services it can
            provide to its customers.


            Operational Performance
            NRW. Operational performance of utilities is often measured using nonrevenue water (NRW).
            As can be seen in figure 3.1, NRW as a percentage of water production has declined between
            2010 and 2013. Nevertheless, the NRW stands high compared with global benchmarks. but
            the figure shows the variation between utilities in keeping NRW under control. The NRW as

                                              O&M Cost per Cubic Meter Sold. The median O&M costs per cubic meter sold increased from
                                              US$0.76 in 2010 to US$0.86 in 2013. This rapid increase seems to be mainly the result of
                                              higher labor costs, resulting from both a decline in staff productivity and an increase in staff
                                              cost per employee. The O&M cost per cubic meter sold is significantly higher in low-income
                                              countries in the sample, which may be the result of the smaller sample of reporting utilities
                                              in middle-income countries and/or the result of economies of scale in utilities in low-income
                                              countries (figure 3.5).
                                                 When looking at the size of the utility and O&M cost, some evidence of economies of scale
                                              was found. The smallest utilities have the highest O&M cost per cubic meter sold. In the period
                                              between 2010 and 2013, the typical small utility had an O&M cost of US$0.96 per cubic meter,
                                              compared with US$0.71 for medium-size utilities and US$0.79 for large utilities (figure 3.6).


                                              Average Revenues per Cubic Meter of Water Sold. The increase in O&M cost per cubic meter
                                              of water sold is coinciding with rising average revenues per cubic meter sold from US$0.71
                                              in 2010 to US$0.85 in 2013. Hence, utilities charge more when the O&M costs increase but
                                              not necessarily the full increase in O&M costs—hence, passing costs to consumers is not
                                              standard practice in Africa.
                                                 Average revenues per cubic meter sold (proxy for tariff) is strongly correlated with O&M
                                              cost per cubic meter sold. Yet, average revenues per cubic meter sold is highest in small util-
                                              ities, but the trend over the last four years also shows that the typical utility saw minor

                                                smallest utilities charge their customers.
                                                  Although tariffs can be high, the effect of high tariffs can be partially mitigated by lower lev-

                                                quite high levels of cross-subsidies—where nonresidential water users usually have a more

       Table 3.1 shows how the bottom and top performers among utilities are doing. There are
     two important observations. The first is that operating cost recovery rates do not really
     change when income levels increase. Even the best-performing utilities do not cover more
     than about 140 percent of total O&M costs. This is standard around the world—whether ana-
     lyzing utilities in developing or developed countries. The Blue Book 2014 confirmed this
     trend of more or less stagnant levels of cost recovery also at the global level. This means that
     most utilities cover only basic O&M costs plus a little extra.
       The second observation is that this operating cost recovery ratio is—even when looking at
     the top performers—very low in relation to the cost structure of water and wastewater
     services. Whittington et al. (2009) estimate that the economic cost of conventional water
     and wastewater infrastructure is US$2.50 per cubic meter2 (at a discount rate of 10 percent3
     in 2006 prices), assuming very low opportunity cost of raw water and very limited external-
     ities associated with the discharge of treated wastewater,4 which would translate to more
     than US$3 in 2013 prices. Hence, with typical O&M cost of water and wastewater of US$0.86,
     operating cost recovery is likely to cover only a fraction of the actual economic costs of water
     services. Even the best performers are very far from being able to cover the financial and
     economic cost of the services. This is not just a trend happening in Sub-Saharan Africa; it is
     common around the world.
       Water supply services are provided in a complex environment in which various objec-
     tives in the provision of water and wastewater services are at play. With low levels of per
     capita income, people are often too poor to actually consume much piped water (let alone
     pay for wastewater collection) and this lack of capacity results in a very small revenue
     basis for the utility. This affects financial performance and makes utilities highly depen-
     dent on government funding to pay for part of the O&M costs, crowding out investments
     and slowing the growth in access to (quality) water (and wastewater) services. As incomes
     rise, more can be spent on water (in absolute terms), which improves the financial footing
     for utilities. However, this is not what we see in our database, possibly because of the lim-
     ited number of utilities in middle-income countries. Even though water consumption lev-
     els are going up when countries’ gross domestic product is increasing, the total revenues
     per capita do not see an increase despite these higher water consumption levels.

                                                   OCCR measured in billed and collected revenues is smaller in middle-income countries

                                                     At the same time, as economic development accelerates and water consumption
                                                   increases, the nature of the service changes. In low-income countries, water utilities
                                                   mainly provide water supply services with little emphasis on dealing with the wastewater
                                                   flows that accompany the provision of water supply services. Yet, in middle-income
                                                   countries, wastewater collection becomes a more important additional service as higher
                                                   incomes mostly coincide with higher per capita water consumption. When countries
                                                   grow even richer, this collected wastewater is to be treated and disposed of against
                                                   increasingly high environmental standards. Danilenko et al. (2014) found that the OCCR—a
                                                   sign of financial health of utilities—in a global sample (of more than 1,800 utilities) barely

                                                   A rapid trend analysis over the period 2010 to 2013 shows that utilities in Africa saw an
                                                   increase in water coverage (see figure 3.11). This is not in line with the data provided by
                                                   the JMP that saw at best a stagnation of piped water coverage. Yet, it should be taken into
                                                   account that the service area of a utility may not coincide with the urban areas as defined

                                                service (which is only a small number of utilities). This is a challenge because wastewater
                                                coverage already lagged far behind that of water coverage—with possible adverse effects
                                                on water quality in the region as the lack of wastewater coverage increases public health
                                                risks and the occurrence of water pollution.
                                                   The slow increase in water coverage also coincided with very modest progress in the
                                                quality of services provided. The decline in wastewater coverage, noted above, is one man-

                                                reflected in (a) the low levels of per capita water consumption (at around 56 liters per cap-

                                                in improvement in service levels (the number of people per connection declined slowly to
                                                10.6). The low levels of water consumption are especially prevalent in low-income coun-
                                                tries and are linked to the common practice of sharing water connections. This sharing of
                                                connections is the result of both supply and demand constraints. The prevalence of
                                                increasing block rates in tariff setting will not provide consumers with much of an incen-
                                                tive to consume large quantities of water (even if the water services are available). As water
                                                metering is fairly widespread in the sample of utilities, consumers are able to have some
                                                control over their water use and, hence, may restrict consumption to avoid paying the
                                                higher block tariffs.
                                                   Figure 3.13 shows the very low levels of total consumption in utilities in low-income
                                                countries. Even in the upper 10 percent (top decile) of utilities, consumers use only 100 lcd.

                                                needed for all residential water uses. In 2013, slightly under 50 percent of the households

                                                    levels of 77 lcd. This low level of consumption means that the revenue-generating potential
                                                    of many utilities is small, especially as overall water coverage is low. The typical consumer
                                                    (both residential and nonresidential) in the sample of utilities pays less than US$15 per year
                                                    for the service. Yet, the overall cost of producing water is mostly fixed, leaving the utilities
                                                    often cash-strapped.
                                                      Supply constraints also play a role: most utilities have only limited production capacity—

                                                    median water production was 88 lcd compared with 96 lcd in 2010). As can be seen in

                                                    is slowly declining. In middle-income countries, the production is much higher: closer to

     Conclusions
     Coverage has increased slowly between 2010 and 2013. Overall coverage rates are slightly
     above 60 percent in the service areas of the utilities covered in the sample, suggesting that
     the utilities are not able to serve large parts of the population in the areas they are responsi-
     ble for.
       The combination of relatively high O&M costs of water (and even more so wastewater)
     services and the increasing affordability of water services suggest that, in many utilities,
     even in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is some scope for balancing the goals of revenue suffi-
     ciency and affordability more in favor of the former as government subsidies will otherwise
     need to increase rapidly in some countries.
       A little less than half the utilities in the sample are not able to cover their operating and
     maintenance costs through their revenues. The high dependence on subsidies raises ques-
     tions about the equity of such subsidies that tend to disadvantage those not yet connected
     to piped network services.6
       The variance of utilities’ performance within and between countries is very large. This is,
     for the most part, because water and wastewater services are locally provided. These local
     factors can vary widely between utilities and include factors such as the distance to the
     water source and the effect on the cost to store and transport water, the quality of the water
     source and the need for treatment, and design standards, among others. Yet, more general
     policies in the country (for example, energy subsidies and labor policies) also affect the cost
     of O&M. The O&M costs vary widely in the sample, from less than US$0.23 to more than
     US$2.07 per m3 sold. The actual O&M costs can vary even more when utilities with less than
     four years of data are included in the sample. In that case, O&M costs vary from US$0.12
     per m3 of water sold in Nigeria to more than US$4.75 in Cape Verde (because of dependence
     on desalinated water).
       The implication of this large variance on performance is that specific local circum-
     stances have a major impact on revenue sufficiency and affordability. Policy makers will
     need to understand how the variation in the costs of water and wastewater services affects
     the balance between the objectives of revenue sufficiency and affordability7 in their pric-
     ing policies. This will require much more information and research than is currently
     available.
       Finally, as the fixed cost component in water and wastewater service provision is very
     large, the design (and other) standards under which water infrastructure is constructed
     will determine the cost of the services for decades to come. Hence, it is important to
     undertake a proper least-cost analysis when investment decisions are made to ensure
     that the benefits and costs of such investments are properly analyzed. The financial, orga-
     nizational, and social implications of such investment decisions will be felt for many
     decades.




30   Performance of Water Utilities in Africa
Notes
1.	 Owing to the high incidence of shared connections, through house connections and public taps, the often-used indicator of
   staff per 1,000 connections is not used. In addition, as the number of connections was not collected systematically, the
   actual number of utilities providing this information results in biased results.

2.	 It should be noted that these estimates are highly variable. For instance, in places where water has to be hauled over long
   distances or where water scarcity is a reality, the costs can be significantly higher.

3.	 This assumes that, for utilities, financing is available against international market rates, whereas it is also assumed that no
   particular country risks are included.

4.	 There is some trade-off between wastewater treatment costs and externalities associated with discharge of treated waste-
   water. The higher the levels of wastewater treatment, the lower the externalities associated with the discharge of treated

Chapter 4   Performance of Utilities in Africa:
            Composite Performance Index

            This analysis used the same sample as the previous analysis.1 Three composite performance
            indicators that, respectively, measure different aspects of customer performance, financial
            performance, and operational performance are used. The theory suggests that good opera-
            tional performance translates into better financial performance because of a reduction of
            the operation and maintenance (O&M) cost. Good financial performance allows the utility to
            generate excess funds that could—once the utility generates sufficient cash to pay for O&M
            costs, depreciation, and debt service—be used for improvements to service levels or water
            coverage (see figure 4.1). The hypothesis is that once the customer experiences improved
            service level, the utility will be able to generate more revenues that then can fund further
            improvements in operational and/or customer performance.


            Calculation of the Composite Performance Index
            For each of the two performance indexes measuring operational and customer performance,
            we calculated a composite index that provides some insight into the various aspects of
            performance. The major reason for setting up a composite index is to gain a wider perspec-
            ­
            tive of the situation, while being aware of the pros and cons of using composite performance
            indexes (for more details, see box 4.1).
              The criteria for a well-performing utility with regard to operational performance relate to
            behaviors that are under management control, including metering, nonrevenue water (NRW)

are able to meet global benchmarks in operational performance. In general, African
benchmarks are about 10 percent below global benchmarks when evaluating operational
performance.
  When disaggregating operational performance trends by country (again using the subset
of utilities with data from 2010 to 2013), 116 utilities in 14 countries can provide operational

      Box 4.2.    Cross-Subsidies in SDE and ONEA


      Senegal’s increasing block tariff structure has a subsidized social tariff for levels of
      consumption below 20 m3 (CFAF 202; US$0.40) per two months. There is also a regu-
      lar tariff for consumption from 21 m3 to 40 m3 (CFAF 697.97; US$1.39), and a “dissua-
      sive” or discouraging tariff for consumption above 40 m3 (CFAF 878.35; US$1.75). The
      dissuasive tariff is designed to be a disincentive for excessive water use. It can be seen
      that the tariff for household consumption of less than 20 m3 per 60 days is less than
      a third of the regular tariff, and less than a quarter of the tariff for consumption in the
      top block. Bills are sent every two months based on meter readings, and Sénégalaise
      des Eaux (Senegal) (SDE) can cut off water supply for nonpayment.a

      Nonresidential, nongovernmental customers must pay the higher tariff regardless of
      amount consumed. As of 2013, just 7 percent of SDE customers were classified as non-
      residential, down from 33 percent in 2004. High tariffs could be a contributing factor
      to this trend. Government customers pay more than twice the high tariff—their tariff is
      CFAF 1,868.88 per m3 (US$3.72 per m3). The structure has been like this since 2007. In
      that year, the government agreed to raise tariffs for government customers by 70 per-
      cent, while keeping tariffs for other customers constant. This was introduced as a way to
      keep domestic tariffs from rising while still ensuring cost recovery for Société Nationale
      des Eaux du Sénégal (SONES) and SDE. In 2015, domestic tariffs were also raised—the
      lowest tariff block was raised by 4 percent and other rates were increased by 9 percent.

      Office National de l’Eau et de l’Assainissement (Burkina Faso) (ONEA) subsidizes
      consumption for basic needs by charging much higher tariffs for what it regards to be
      excessive consumption. ONEA’s tariff for the first consumption block (up to 8 m3 per
      month) is just 18 percent of the tariff for consumption in excess of 30 m3. This subsi-
      dized tariff is US$0.39 per m3, compared with US$2.16 per m3 for consumption above
      30 m3. The latter is designed to be a disincentive for excessive water use. There are
      two other residential tariff blocks—above 8 m3 and up to 15 m3 (US$0.89), and above
      15 m3 and up to 30 m3 (US$1.06). The standpipe tariff is equal to the basic needs tariff
      (US$0.39 per m3).b Nonresidential tariffs help cross-subsidize. They are set at US$2.16
      per m3 regardless of amount consumed. Industrial customers account for 5 percent of
      consumption by volume.

Water Coverage
When water coverage is also taken into account, the picture does not change significantly.
Because of lower access to piped water coverage, Africa is lagging behind global benchmarks
(figure 4.13). Progress is made—faster than in other dimensions of performance. It can be
seen again that the variation within countries can be very large as a result of more decentral-
ized service delivery and the inclusion of many less-established utilities in the sample

                                                lower coverage rates than utilities that have been in business for decades, which shows

                                                Africa than in other parts of the world.
                                                  The overall performance index shows that performance has improved marginally between
                                                2010 and 2013 (figure 4.16). In tables 4.2 and 4.3, the best-performing utilities with regard to
                                                operational, financial, and customer performance are shown for the sample for 2013 by type
                                                of service delivery. The results show that some of the best-performing utilities in Africa are
                                                the ones you have probably never heard of. It should be noted that different definitions of
                                                performance will result in very different lists of well-performing utilities.
                                                  Different definitions of performance will result in different rankings whereas the use
                                                of  weightings for different forms of performance will also result in different rankings.
                                                Yet, many utilities—even among the best-performing—show some variation in perfor-
                                                mance, not only between utilities but also within the same utility over time. This points
                                                to utilities being relatively vulnerable to factors that can affect their performance quite
                                                dramatically.
                                                  As can be seen in table 4.3 utility performance also varies between smaller and larger util-
                                                ities. Smaller utilities typically have lower scores than larger utilities, but once utilities are
                                                much bigger that benefit becomes less obvious. We will look into the importance of econo-

                                                       basic DEA, a water utility is regarded as a relatively efficient utility if its observed inputs can

                                                          ­performance. Analysis of relative performance was conducted for water and wastewater pro-

                                                          people living in the service area of  the utilities. The sample utilities served more than
                                                          85 ­million ­people during 2013. All available observations from these utilities for each year for
                                                          the period 2010–13 were used in the analysis. The detailed methodology is provided in

                                                          (IBNET) data. Water billed was considered as the major output while number of staff
                                                          and  number of connections were considered as inputs representing labor and capital,
                                                          respectively. DEA assigns a number between 0 and 1 to each water utility which describes
                                                          how efficient the utility is in transforming capital and labor inputs into water output
                                                          relative to other utilities in the sample. In this scheme, 1 signifies that a utility is efficient
                                                          when compared with the other utilities in the sample. Hence, DEA efficiency is relative
                                                          to the  other utilities in the sample and may not indicate superior performance in a
                                                          broader context.
                                                            A water utility is regarded as a relatively efficient utility if its observed inputs can be scaled
                                                          to yield outputs that equal or exceed any combination or scaling of what other sample

improvement. This is not unexpected as most African utilities are not yet mature in terms of
coverage, service levels, and consumption levels—often experiencing rationing—and hence
inputs less easily translate into outputs. Zambian utilities tend to perform the best in terms
of both absolute performance and DEA, and at the same time Zambia is a middle-income
country with relatively high coverage and consumption levels compared with many other
utilities in Africa. It is important to notice that Mali Water (SOMAGEP) also keeps a high level
of performance, despite its recent (2008) split with the National Electricity Company,
Electricité-de-Mali, EdM, that apparently provided some indirect support to water opera-
tions in earlier years. Senegal SDE also shows up in the list of more efficient utilities, but not
as systematically as the utilities in Mali and Zambia. DEA tests also show that governance
may be a significant driver of water utility performance in Africa and that attention to
improving governance may be key to improving performance in water utilities.


Notes
1.	 The countries included in this sample are Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Niger, Tanzania, and Zambia.
   The more complex the indicator becomes, the more likely it is that not all utilities report the data. Hence, the sample loses
   more than half of its national utilities, whereas the only municipal utilities in this sample come from Tanzania.

2.	 Affordability is measured as the revenues per capita per year as a percentage of the GNI per capita in the country. The higher
   the ratio, the more people have to pay for water and the less affordable the service is. It should be noted that piped water
   access is rarely equally distributed over a country, and most piped water is provided to urban areas, and within these urban
   areas, more into richer than lower income neighborhoods. Affordability may have an upward bias and actual affordability
   may be lower than the calculation provided here.

Chapter 5   Performance of Utilities in Africa:
            Institutional Factors

            The IBNET Toolkit includes organizational data, including data on human resources poli-
            cies, business planning, and so on. Yet, collecting this data turned out to be more challeng-
            ing than collecting operational and financial data. We have some data on the use of private
            sector participation in utilities, but the response rate with data on HR policies, planning pro-
            cesses, and customer service was in general very poor, which can result in serious sample
            biases. Hence, as theory suggests that institutional and organizational factors play an
            important role in the delivery of water services, we will use the case study approach (in
            chapter 7) to take a look into these organizational data where possible. In addition, the team
            collected data—outside the primary data collection effort from secondary sources—that
            included information on politics and governance at the country level, the role of regulation,
            the role of different service models (national versus subnational levels of service delivery),
            and the scope of service delivery (for example, utilities providing only water services).1 The
            impact of economic development on utility performance was also tested. The team tested
            several indicators from the Polity Project, but none of these indicators showed any statistical
            significance. This may be linked to the fact the utilities and the countries in which they are
            located are not a random sample, and hence may show too little variance with respect to
            many of these indicators to generate statistically significant results.

     Role of Economic Development
     Economic development has a positive impact on customer performance indicators as can be
     seen in table 5.1. In middle-income countries, water coverage is higher than in low-income
     countries, and so is the quality of the service provided. Interestingly, operational perfor-
     mance is better in low-income countries and significantly so. This result may be linked to the
     relatively small number of utilities in middle-income countries included in the sample.
     Financial performance when measured with the operating cost coverage ratio (OCCR) is not
     significantly different between low- and middle-income countries; the variation within
     countries with respect to this indicator tends to be large.
       Economic development translates into more consumers (that is, higher water coverage)
     using more water (that is, higher water consumption), and as such the annual revenues
     per capita increase rapidly, giving the utilities a more significant revenue flow. In the
     sample of African utilities, the median per capita total water consumption is only 52 lcd
     in low-income countries compared with 92 lcd in middle-income countries. When look-
     ing at residential water consumption—with a much smaller sample as not all utilities dis-
     aggregate consumption data—total residential water consumption is only 32 lcd in
     low-income countries, compared with 78 lcd in middle-income countries. This low resi-
     dential consumption provides utilities with a very small revenue basis, but the very low
     consumption also may make it less compelling for water consumers to use water and/or
     connect to the supply compared with other water sources at least with regard to service
     delivered. Hence, increasing coverage and residential consumption may be needed to
     improve customer and financial performance in the long run. If customers have access to
     more piped water to consume, the benefits of piped water are more apparent compared
     with other water supply sources. This focus on improving the infrastructure will require,
     in the short term, more investments in the sector to improve water coverage and a level
     of residential water consumption that sets piped water apart from alternative water
     sources (and in line with WHO public health standards of residential water consumption
     of at least 50–100 lcd). This increase in investments requires major improvements to
     ensure that the sector can absorb these investments and use the capital invested more
     efficiently, including but not limited to (a) detailed analysis of demand for piped water to

exceed their full life-cycle costs; and (c) transparent financing policies that underpin bet-
ter investment selection.


Role of Regulation
Regulation has been promoted as a tool for improved utility performance while protecting
customers. The sample contains three forms of regulation: (a) through government
ministries or departments; (b) regulation by contract; and (c) a regulatory authority or
agency. The presence of a regulatory agency is not necessarily randomly assigned across
countries. In the sample, regulators were present in Niger (western Africa) and Kenya,
Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia (eastern and southern Africa). As most regulating agen-
cies are active in countries where regional- or district-level utilities are active, the sample
contains many utilities under the regime of a regulatory agency and very few under any of
the other types of regulation.
  A t-test analysis shows that having a regulatory agency in place does not automatically
result in better performance. With regard to customer protection, regulation is effective in
Africa. As can be seen in table 5.2, service quality is higher in utilities under a regulatory
regime than in those that are not. Yet, with regard to water coverage, which includes potential
customers, utilities under a regulatory regime show lower water coverage than those that do
not have such a system in place. With regard to financial and operational performance, utili-
ties with regulation perform poorer than those without a regulator in place. This is linked with
the fact that the average size of a utility (as measured in population served) under a regulatory
regime is about 204,000 compared with 2.5 million for those utilities whose performance is
not supervised by a regulatory agency. The difference in scale may be part of the explanation
why having a regulator in place results in lower financial and operational performance.


Role of Service Delivery Models
The Dublin principles defined in the 1990s made the point that water utility services should
be delivered at the lowest appropriate level of government. The sample contains three
types of utilities: (a) national; (b) regional; and (c) municipal. National utilities are mostly

     concentrated in western and central Africa. The median size of these utilities shows a large
     variance. The typical municipal utility serves 87,000 people, the typical regional utility
     serves 261,000 people, and the typical national utility 2.7 million people. Hence, there is a
     huge difference in size and likely economies of scale between these different utilities. All the
     municipal service providers in the sample are located in low-income countries and regional
     utilities are present in both low- and middle-income countries. The effect of decentralization
     will be examined only in low-income countries.
       The results of the effect of decentralization on utility performance are shown in table 5.3.
     It should be noted that only three countries2 in the sample use municipal or district service
     delivery and they are all located in low-income countries. The results show the same ambi-
     guity in results as found in Estache (1995). As far as financial performance is concerned as
     measured by the OCCR, the effect of municipal service delivery is similar to that of utilities
     that deliver services through regional or national utilities. Customers from municipal utili-
     ties spend significantly less on water than consumers served by other types of utilities. This
     lower spending comes at a price as customers consume less water. As tariffs are not signifi-
     cantly different from other types of utilities, water services provided by municipal utilities
     are much more affordable, which explains most of the better customer performance linked
     to municipal utilities.
       Similar to Estache (1995), the team found that decentralization tends to have a negative
     impact on labor productivity. Yet, even though national utilities tend to have higher labor
     productivity (fewer staff per 1,000 people served), the employee costs are significantly
     higher, with the result that the share of labor costs in total operating expenses does not nec-
     essarily decline with improvements in labor productivity (table 5.4).
       Levels of decentralization are highly correlated with certain Country Policy and
     Institutional Assessment (CPIA) indicators3 as can be seen in table 5.5. Municipal service
     delivery is highly correlated with four CPIA cluster indexes, which themselves are also
     highly correlated. The question arises whether municipal service delivery is more likely to
     occur when the overall economic environment is more conducive or municipal service
     delivery builds a more conducive economic environment.

a. We used staff per 1,000 people for two reasons: (a) the number of missing observations on staff per 1,000 connections is
relatively high and especially prevalent in western Africa and (b) sharing of connections is relatively high in many utilities—
either the sharing of house connections or the dependence on public taps. This results in high staff numbers per connection,
as there are relatively few connections compared to an environment where most households do not share connections.

  Customer performance is especially weakly correlated to the quality of the country’s polit-

management and institutions are correlated with better customer performance (and hence
higher service quality). Water coverage—mostly the result of large investment programs—is
correlated (albeit weakly) to better economic management and structural policies. Yet, the
effect is negative; higher scores for economic management and structural policies are

       Financial performance is weakly correlated with higher scores of structural policies, and
     public sector management. Operational performance is correlated with higher scores of all
     CPIA cluster indicators, but the correlations are still rather weak. More research is needed to
     understand how the political and institutional country environment affects utility perfor-
     mance, beyond these highly aggregated country indicators.


     Economies of Scale and Scope
     In many countries, there is a trend to agglomeration, to essentially enable utilities to benefit
     from economies of scale in service provision. Hence, the performance of larger utilities (util-
     ities with more than 1 million people served) and of those that serve smaller populations
     have been compared.
       Tables 5.7 and 5.8 show that the effect of scale on utility performance by size of utility is
     not showing a straightforward picture. Customer performance (that is, service quality) is
     lower in large utilities than in smaller utilities, but medium-size utilities do better than the
     smallest utilities. For operational performance, a similar pattern of a concave relationship
     can be seen.
       Yet, water coverage is not significantly different between smaller and larger utilities. The
     effect of scale on utility performance is much more difficult to detect. The size of the utility

Conclusions
A utility operates in a particular local context. Although an attempt was made to collect
organizational data that reflect the characteristics of the particular utility, these data were
difficult to collect as the response rate was low (possibly because the team collected a rela-
tively large set of data). Hence, the team used a set of national-level factors that describe the
general environment in which utilities operate at the country level. In follow-up work, it is
recommended that more attention is paid to collecting organizational data from utilities, as
this may help improve the understanding of how institutional and organizational factors
affect utility performance. As seen in previous chapters, the quality of governance seems to
matter for good utility performance.
  Institutional factors play a role in driving utility performance but not necessarily always
in the way that is predicted. Regulation is often seen as a shortcut for ensuring better
governance in the sector.4 Yet, the analysis shows that having a regulatory agency in
place does not automatically produce better results for customers. In low-income coun-
tries, the presence of a regulator results in better customer performance, but having a
regulator in place does not extend to other forms of performance, such as operational
performance or water coverage. This is as expected because the objective of a regulator is
to provide “protection” of existing customers (and hence focuses on providing minimum
levels of customer service) but does not necessarily focus on improvements in financial
and operational sustainability or improvements in coverage compared with utilities
without a regulator.5
  Decentralization’s normally held assumption that service provision at local level tends to
increase accountability and improves utility performance is only partially borne out by the
analysis of the utilities. The financial and operational performance of utilities is not statisti-
cally significantly different from other forms of service delivery. As for customer perfor-
mance, there are statistically significant differences: district- or municipal-based service
delivery shows better results. Yet, coverage lags behind in municipal- or district-based ser-
vice delivery compared with other levels of service delivery.
  The team also looked into the presence of economies of scale and scope. The effect of scale
was not easy to detect in the sample, but that might have to do with the fact that there were
few very large utilities in the sample and these tend to be mostly concentrated in the cate-
gory of national utilities. However, economies of scope are evident. Utilities that provide
water and wastewater services in low-income countries tend to show slightly higher levels
of water coverage (as can be expected because sewerage coverage is provided sequentially
after a certain level of water coverage has been achieved). But customer performance (or
service quality), operational performance, and financial performance are also higher when
sewerage is also provided.

       Finally, the level of economic development matters. Economic development translates
     into more consumers using more water, and as such the annual revenues per capita increase
     rapidly, giving the utilities a more significant revenue flow. If customers have access to more
     piped water to consume, the benefits of piped water are more apparent compared with other
     water supply sources. This focus on improving the infrastructure will require, in the short
     term, more investments in the sector to improve water coverage and a level of water con-
     sumption that sets piped water apart from alternative water sources. At the same time, as
     economic development accelerates and water consumption increases, the nature of the ser-
     vice changes with more emphasis on wastewater collection and treatment, which will add
     additional expensive investments to be funded. In the provision of water and wastewater
     infrastructure, lock-in effects of infrastructure, technology, and product design are a major
     challenge. In Africa, where a major part of the infrastructure necessary to meet water and
     wastewater demand is still to be built, the range of alternatives is considerably larger than
     elsewhere, but will require the adoption of better urban and regional planning, more effi-
     cient water, wastewater, and drainage systems, and improvements in investment planning.
     However, to move in this direction, major barriers, especially institutional and cultural bar-
     riers, must be overcome.

Chapter 6   Drivers of Utility Performance: Panel Data

            The panel data of 119 utilities used in the previous chapters is used in this analysis. As
            mentioned above these utilities represent a significant proportion of the population that
            was served by piped water in 2013: 58 million out of 108 million people. As possible drivers
            of performance, a number of country-specific and utility-specific characteristics were
            tried. The variables that proved to be significant and that were kept in the final version of
            the models are shown in table 6.1.
              The different forms of utility performance are weakly correlated, as can be seen in
            table 6.2. This may be a surprising result because the hypothesis laid out in figure 4.1
            translating good operational performance into better financial performance is hence not
            borne out by the econometric analysis. Such an improvement allows the utility to gener-
            ate excess funds that could—once the utility generates sufficient cash to pay for operation
            and maintenance (O&M) costs, depreciation, and debt service—be used for improvements
            to service levels or water coverage. The hypothesis is that once the customer experiences
            improved service level, the utility will be able to generate more revenues that then can
            fund further improvements in operational and/or customer performance. This virtuous
            cycle seems to be far from robust when analyzing the data of close to 120 utilities. Table 6.2
            shows that there is a weak, albeit statistically significant, correlation between financial
            performance and operational performance. There is also a weak correlation between
            financial and customer performance, but it is negative, suggesting that better customer
            performance (in terms of better quality of service) is correlated with lower levels of finan-
            cial performance. Access to water services is not correlated to financial performance.

     Yet, water coverage and quality of service levels are correlated; hence customers seem to
     be more willing to connect when service levels are higher.
       The relatively weak correlation between different performance indicators may be sur-
     prising when assuming there is a linear relationship between them, in which better opera-
     tional performance results in better financial performance which in turn can result in better


62   Performance of Water Utilities in Africa
service delivery to the customers. Yet, this linear approach does not always work. For
instance, if the utility increases the level of metering, this should, in theory, result in more
revenues for the utility and hence improve the ability of the utility to cover its costs. Yet, if
the cost of the metering program (in terms of the O&M costs to manage such a metering
program) exceeds the benefits of the metering program, the effect on financial performance
of the utility can be negative, even with an increase in revenues. At the same time, the
metering program will reduce consumption, which may result in consumers being less
willing to pay for the service—resulting in lower consumption levels. In the case of Africa,
where many connections are shared, it might also affect the willingness to share connec-
tions and could even affect water coverage. Hence, the specific outcomes of different
measures to improve utility performance are not given but are highly dependent on the
context in which they take place.
  In the next sections, the drivers of different aspects of performance will be examined—
specifically the drivers of financial performance, water coverage, and customer performance
(as measured by the quality of service levels).


Financial Performance
Several models have been used to explain what drives financial performance. As discussed
in chapter 3, the typical utility has an operating cost coverage ratio (OCCR) of about 1 in the
sample. As such, there are many utilities that have a minimum financial performance. The
best-fitting model was the one where a dependent variable that takes only two values was
used: 1 if the utility has an OCCR of more than 1.19 (found in the best performing 25 percent
of utilities) and 0 if it does not.
  The appropriate econometric method to use when the dependent variable is binary is a
Probit or Logit model, which describes the probability that the dependent variable takes the
value 1. Here a Probit approach was used to be able to control for utility-specific unobserved
heterogeneity. The latter may include unobserved variables such as the skills of the utility’s
manager; the physical location of the area serviced by the utility (topography, distance to
and quality of the raw water sources); the technology of the infrastructure; and any other
unobserved specific conditions that the utility may face and that could affect its financial
performance. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity is crucial in the presence of panel
data, to avoid biased estimated coefficients.
  The model has been estimated using 427 observations corresponding to 116 distinct utili-
ties (see table 6.3). The sample size is slightly reduced compared with the original sample
because of missing observations for some of the utilities. The Wald test indicates that the
model is globally significant. The value for the parameter rho, at the bottom of the table,
indicates that 64 percent of the total variance is contributed by the panel-level variance
component that is the unobserved utility-specific heterogeneity.
  The results show that both utility-specific and country-specific characteristics influence
the probability that utilities are performing well financially. When utilities achieve a better

     operational performance, this reflects positively on the utility’s financial performance.
     Higher service quality is negatively correlated with the probability of achieving better
     financial performance. This suggests that achieving higher service quality results in costs,
     whereas lower service quality results in lower revenues, either one affecting the OCCR;
     albeit that the effect of better operational performance is stronger than the effect of better
     customer performance.
       Utilities of larger size (as measured by the size of the population served with water) are
     more likely to be good financial performers, but once the utility reaches a certain critical
     size, the likelihood of being a financially well-performing utility decreases (the coefficient of
     the square of the variable measuring population served is negative), signifying the existence
     of economies of scale. Utilities for which staff efficiency (the revenues generated by each
     employee as a percentage of their costs) is higher tend to have better financial performance
     than those that have lower efficiency. Utilities with higher O&M cost per cubic meter of water
     produced tend to perform worse than those with lower O&M cost. Utilities that operate in
     poorer countries (as measured by the gross national income [GNI] per capita) are less likely
     to be financially good performers. Finally, the coefficient of the trend variable is negative,
     which indicates an overall decrease in financial performance over time.

Customer Performance
Water Coverage
The water coverage index can be used as a continuous variable. The model uses 468 obser-
vations covering 119 distinct utilities. It is controlled for utility-specific heterogeneity and
utility-specific unobserved effects are specified as fixed effects in the model. Estimation
results are shown in table 6.4. The Fisher test indicates global significance of the model and
overall significance of the utility-specific effects. The R-square is 0.47, which indicates that
47 percent of the total variance in customer performance is explained by the covariates. As
such, even though this model is the best performing of all the models tested, the result
shows that explaining the drivers of customer performance requires more information. It
also shows that it is not always possible to capture all the variance in Africa in panel data
regression models as it is likely that variables are omitted, most notably local information on
the physical and organizational environment in which utilities are working.
  It was found that the quality of service levels matters. Higher service-level quality results
in higher water coverage. The price of the service was not found to be statistically significant.
More interesting is the effect of good financial performance (as measured by an OCCR of at
least 1.19) on water coverage. The relationship shows that good financial performance is

Performance of Water Utilities in Africa                                                      65
     linked to higher water coverage. Yet, this effect does not hold for utilities in low-income
     countries. In view of the high capital intensity of the water infrastructure, investments in
     this type of infrastructure tend to be large and usually utilities are unable to pay for the
     initial investments. The effect holds in middle-income countries, but it should be noted
     that the effect of good financial performance—even in these countries—is rather limited in
     increasing access to water supply services. Hence, utilities may be able to fund some of the
     investments but are unlikely to pay for most of the up-front investments, as shown in the
     case studies described in chapter 7.
       The model shows a concave relationship between utility size (as measured by population
     size) and water coverage: water coverage increases more rapidly when utilities are larger and
     then decreases afterwards—suggesting economies of scale in providing water access. Yet, it
     is also likely that countries provide funds to expand coverage to larger utilities first before
     providing funds to utilities in smaller towns and localities.
       Utilities that operate in richer countries (as measured by GNI per capita) demonstrate
     higher water coverage in general, but only at the 10 percent level. Utilities that operate in
     countries that are associated with better economic management (as measured by the
     Country Policy and Institutional Assessment [CPIA] economic management cluster) tend to
     be associated with higher water coverage. The effect of better economic management is
     rather significant and could point to the fact that better economic management ensures that
     more resources are available to increase water coverage. Finally, the trend is found to be
     statistically insignificant.
       The model was run on water coverage again and distinguished by large utilities and
     those that are smaller—with large utilities classified as those serving more than 1 million
     customers. Although similar factors play a role, the importance of the variables differs
     significantly for the two models, showing that the behavior of utilities is far from similar.
     In general, utilities started to be established in capital cities; hence large utilities tend to
     have been in place much longer and by definition tend to have higher coverage than
     smaller utilities.
       When comparing what drives coverage in large and smaller utilities, some similarities and
     some important differences (see table 6.5) were seen. For both types of utilities, service qual-
     ity matters. Both models show a concave relationship between utility size (as measured by
     population size) and water coverage: water coverage increases more rapidly when utilities
     are larger and then decreases afterwards. However, the role of tariffs is much less significant
     as a driver for performance for large utilities than for smaller utilities. This may be linked to
     the fact that large utilities have a much larger customer base and, because of the relative
     anonymity of the individual client, it is much easier to not pay the bill. This is reflected by
     the generally lower collection efficiencies in larger utilities. The effect of good financial per-
     formance (as measured by an OCCR of at least 1.19) on water coverage shows that good finan-
     cial performance is not linked to higher water coverage in smaller utilities—independent
     of  the level of economic development of the country. For large utilities in low-income

countries, good financial performance has a small, but positive effect on water coverage. Yet,
this effect disappears for utilities in middle-income countries.
  Whether utilities operate in richer countries (as measured by GNI per capita) is statistically
insignificant in both low-income and middle-income countries. Utilities that operate in
countries that are associated with better economic management (as measured by the CPIA
economic management cluster) tend to be associated with higher water coverage in the case
of smaller utilities. Yet, the effect of the quality of economic management on large utilities is
insignificant. As larger utilities are mostly located in the capital or larger cities, the quality of
economic management may be less important as governments may have most likely already

     cant in smaller utilities, but negative and significant in larger utilities.

     Service Quality
     The customer performance index can be used as a continuous variable with data observa-
     tions ranging between 0 and 1. The model uses 468 observations covering 119 distinct utili-
     ties. It is controlled for utility-specific heterogeneity and utility-specific unobserved effects
     are specified as fixed effects in the model. Estimation results are shown in table 6.6. The
     Fisher test indicates global significance of the model and overall significance of the
     utility-specific effects. The R-square is 0.14, which indicates that only 14 percent of the total
     ­
     variance in customer performance is explained by the covariates. As such, even though this
     model is the best performing of all the models tested, the result shows that explaining the
     drivers of customer performance requires much more information. It also shows that it is not
     always possible to capture all the variance in Africa in panel data regression models as it is
     more than likely that variables are omitted, most notably local information on the physical
     and organizational environment in which utilities are working.
       The higher service quality for consumers (as measured with the indicator defined in
     chapter 4) is linked to the cost of the service. The more people spend on water services, the
     lower the service quality tends to be. One of the drivers of service quality is the depth of
     rationing. The more the water consumed per person per day and hence the less rationing

customers experience, the higher the service quality. Yet, this effect only shows up in
low-income countries, where it is statistically significant. Then, rationing is much more
widespread and pertinent in low-income countries than in middle-income countries.
Sewerage coverage tends also to be linked to better service quality, which may hint toward
economies of scope.
  Country-based factors matter but the effect is not very clear. When utilities also provide
sewerage coverage, utilities that operate in low-income countries (as measured by GNI per
capita) demonstrate higher service quality in general, but it depends on whether sewerage
coverage is also provided. Where sewerage coverage is provided, the effect of income is not
significant. Transparency (as measured by the CPIA index) is not significant. Finally, the
trend is found to be negative, but statistically insignificant.


Operational Performance
This index is also measured on a 0–1 scale, so the same methodology as the one used for
assessing the drivers of customer performance is adopted. The model is estimated using 415
observations for 116 distinct utilities (table 6.7). The model is significant overall and the
R-square is 0.35, so the overall fit of the model is moderate.
  Operational performance is found to have a concave relationship with the size of the pop-
ulation served with water when utilities are smaller: operational performance increases up

     to a threshold and then decreases: economies of scale matter.1 The better the financial
     performance of the utility, the higher the operational performance. The higher the customer
     performance, the higher the operational performance. Finally, the higher the share of labor
     costs, the lower the operational performance. This shows that utilities with a high share of
     labor in total costs tend to have lower staff efficiencies (that is, the revenues generated by
     each employee as a percentage of the cost of that employee are significantly lower) suggest-
     ing that these utilities tend to be less efficient in employing staff. This lack of efficiency will
     affect operational performance.
       Utilities operating in richer countries, as measured by the GNI per capita, do not show
     better operational performance. There is evidence of a positive, statistically significant
     trend. And, interestingly, the better the economic management in the country in which the
     utility is located, the higher the operational performance.


     Overall Performance Index
     We ran the models again using the overall composite index (combining customer, opera-
     tional, and financial performance). This index is also measured on a 0–1 scale, so the same
     methodology as the one used for assessing the drivers of customer performance is adopted.
     The model is estimated using 426 observations for 116 distinct utilities (table 6.8). The model
     is significant overall and the R-square is 0.52, so the overall fit of the model is good.
       The economies of scale as measured by the population served show that the larger the
     population served, the better the overall performance, but up to a threshold; too large a
     utility will generate diseconomies of scale. The threshold is, however, quite high since the
     proportion of utilities that are above the threshold is usually small. Utilities which also pro-
     vide sewerage coverage tend to be correlated with better performance. Economies of scope

also play a role, but the effect is only statistically significant in middle-income countries
because the number of utilities that provide sewerage services in low-income countries in
Africa is relatively limited. Another finding is that costs (measured by the O&M costs per
cubic meter of water produced) also play a critical role: the higher the O&M costs per cubic
meter produced, the lower the overall performance. The level of O&M costs are the result of
investment decisions; these investment decisions lock in costs for decades to come; hence
assessing investment decisions properly is key.
  Staff efficiency also matters. The higher the staff efficiency, the better the overall
performance. Finally, the quality of economic management matters. The better the eco-
nomic management, the better the utility performance. Interestingly, the quality of the
business environment also matters. If the quality of the business environment is high, util-
ity performance benefits.


Conclusions
The performance models are globally significant but for many the predictive power is highly
variable with the exception of the water coverage and the overall performance model. It was
observed that the major drivers of utility performance are linked to their costs as reflected in
the presence of economies of scale, economies of scope, the O&M costs per cubic meter of
water produced, and staff-related efficiency.
  The economies of scale as measured by the population served shows that the larger the
population served, the better the overall performance, but up to a threshold; too large a utility
will generate diseconomies of scale. The threshold is, however, quite high since the propor-
tion of utilities that are above the threshold is usually small.
  Utilities which also provide sewerage coverage tend to be correlated with better
performance. Economies of scope also play a role. Another finding is the impact of costs

     (measured by the O&M costs per cubic meter of water produced): the higher the O&M costs
     per cubic meter produced, the lower the overall performance. The level of O&M costs are the
     result of investment decisions; these investment decisions lock in costs for decades to come;
     hence assessing investment decisions properly is key. Staff efficiency and share of labor in
     total costs also matter. The higher the staff efficiency, the better the overall performance.
     Yet, staff efficiency is the result of a complex of factors, including labor regulations, but also
     O&M costs and tariff policies.
       Interestingly, some of the other drivers of utility performance are beyond the control of the
     utilities. The quality of economic management in the countries in which utilities operate
     affects utility performance: the higher the quality of the economic management, the higher
     the utility performance.
       The different aspects of performance affect one another. Higher customer service quality
     has a positive impact on water coverage whereas financial performance may affect opera-
     tional performance and water coverage, suggesting that funding is necessary to improve
     access and measures to improve operations in the utility. In the case of improving water
     access, the level of economic development matters, but also the quality of economic manage-
     ment, especially for smaller utilities that may depend more than the large ones on external
     funding to increase access.
       The additional findings are that water coverage is directly affected by customer perfor-
     mance (that is, service quality). Better economic management and higher GNI growth have
     a positive impact as they may be linked to the availability of investment funding. In most
     cases, there is no link between utilities’ financial performance and water coverage—with
     the exception of large utilities in low-income countries (although the effect is small). This
     suggests that most utilities are not able to improve access through improved financial
     performance but depend on external funds to do so.
     ­
       The hypothesis posed in chapter 4, that better operational performance results in better
     financial performance and subsequently in better customer performance, is not borne out
     by the econometric results. Better operational performance tends to have a positive
     impact on financial performance; but the opposite is true for customer performance. The
     better the customer performance, the lower the financial performance. Hence, utilities
     can optimize financial performance by increasing operational performance and/or reduc-
     ing customer performance. In general, financial, operational, and customer performance
     affect each other.
       There is evidence that unobserved utility-specific heterogeneity explains a large portion of
     the total variance, which would call for the large-scale collection of additional utility-specific
     variables, for example, information on local conditions (topography, distance to the raw
     water source, whether the utility gets water primarily from groundwater or surface water,
     quality of the raw source, age of the infrastructure, access to alternative water source, and so
     on) and organizational and institutional data.2 Hence, much more and detailed information
     on utility operations and the context in which the utilities operate is required to explain with

more clarity what drives utility performance. However, such data collection comes at a price
with regard to the cost of collection and the willingness of utilities, regulators, and other
stakeholders to provide such information.


Notes
1.	 A concave relationship (and hence the presence of a threshold) for large utilities is also expected. The fact that it does not
   show in the estimation results is probably explained by the characteristics of our sample as there is only a small number of
   large utilities in the sample.

2.	 The IBNET Toolkit includes organizational data, but in this round of data collection in Africa, this information was not
   consistently collected by the task teams, and such information was not available in many of the regulatory reports. Hence,
   this does not allow for including such information in the analysis.

Chapter 7   Drivers of Utility Performance: Case Study
            Perspective
            Introduction
            The purpose of the case studies is to complement the econometric analysis of the larger
            dataset. Unlike the econometric analysis, the case studies cannot show quantitative rela-
            tionships between indicators. However, the case studies can:

            •	 Track performance for a single utility over time

            •	 Assess why certain results were achieved

            •	 Analyze management techniques, organizational culture, and capital investment
              financing

              Five utilities were chosen for the case studies: Nairobi City Water and Sewerage
            Company (NCWSC) in Kenya; National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) in
            Uganda; Office National de l’Eau et de l’Assainissement (ONEA) in Burkina Faso;
            Sénégalaise des Eaux (SDE) in Senegal; and Société de Distribution d’Eau de la Côte d’Ivo-
            ire (SODECI) in Côte d’Ivoire. These utilities were selected to ensure consistency with the
            case studies written by the Electricity Study Team. The Electricity Study Team wrote case
            studies for electricity utilities for the same set of countries. Each of these countries has a
            national water utility except Kenya, so in four of five cases the national utility was
            selected. In Kenya, NCWSC was selected because it is the largest Kenyan utility, serving
            nearly 3 million people in the capital city, Nairobi.

       The selection of the case studies was not at random, so it should be noted that the case
     study sample is not representative. For instance, all five utilities are large, serving close to or
     more than 3 million people. By contrast, the typical utility in the econometric database
     serves about 115,000 people. All five utilities were established decades ago, and hence have
     a longer track record and relatively more developed infrastructure. All of them are serving
     capital cities. Apart from Nairobi, none of the utilities provides wastewater services. In addi-
     tion, the five utilities are mostly well-performing. This allows the case studies to focus on
     the dynamics of well-performing utilities.


     Performance of the Case Study Utilities
     Data from the JMP regarding the performance of the five case study countries over the
     past 15 years are provided in table 7.1 as context. How each case study utility performs on
     key indicators is shown in table 7.2. These data do not always correspond with utility data
     partially because the services that utilities provide may be for areas that are smaller than
     the area that is classified as urban. In addition, utilities use different yardsticks to trans-
     late the number of (active) connections into coverage or access.
       The indicators included in the table are those used in the econometric analysis, plus three
     others—nonrevenue water (NRW) as a percentage of production, staff per 1,000 connections,
     and the collection ratio (table 7.3). These three indicators have been added because they are
     analyzed substantially in the case studies. Where available, the global benchmark (best
     quartile of all utilities in the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation
     Utilities [IBNET] database) and the African benchmark (best quartile of all utilities in the
     Africa-specific IBNET analysis) are provided for comparison. Each utility’s aggregate perfor-
     mance ranking out of 118 utilities is included.
       It should be noted that the focus of the case studies is how these five utilities have been
     performing in their service areas. This is an important point to make because, as can be seen
     in tables 7.1 and 7.2, even in national utilities the service areas are not necessarily overlap-
     ping with the population to be served, and even though some of the utilities have done
     excellent work, the increase in service areas has been very different between the various
     utilities. For the four national utilities for which we have data from 2000 to 2013, we find that
     the population without improved services has still not decreased in three out of the five
     countries.
       In table 7.1, we see the efforts that have been put in, with sharp increases in the service
     area and in the population served—significantly beyond the overall population growth rates
     over a similar period. This also shows the scale of the challenge in providing water supply
     services in Africa.
       Table 7.2 shows some interesting features of the demand for water supply. Based on
     household surveys in the five case study countries, the population has increased rapidly in

                                       vide piped water services have been able to improve access to piped water on the premises,
                                       but the largest number of people are serviced by other means: standposts, kiosks, but also
                                       point-sources such as dependence on groundwater. Despite massive efforts, only in Burkina
                                       Faso and Uganda did the population with access to unimproved services decline, including
                                       in urban areas. Between 2000 and 2015, 16.8 million people in the five case study countries
                                       got access to piped water on the premises (of which 10.8 million were in urban areas). But
                                       most of the growth took place for other improved services which increased by 31.9 million
                                       people (of which only 7.3 million were in urban areas). So a significant part of the growth in

                                               can be very significant in different parts of the continent (for example in Uganda). This
                                               paper will not look into these small-scale providers but it is important to realize that utilities
                                               in Africa in many cases operate in an environment where there are multiple providers
                                               active—including in the service area of the utilities.
                                                 Table 7.3 shows that the utilities perform reasonably well against African benchmarks.
                                               At least 91 percent of connections are metered at all five utilities. There are fewer than
                                               six staff per 1,000 connections. Water supply is available, on average, for 18 hours per day
                                               or more in all five utilities. There is considerable dispersion among the cases on some
                                               indicators. Coverage in the utilities’ service area ranges from 69 percent (SODECI) to

                                  costs and improve water supply service. With new customers and increased consumption,
                                  revenues can increase and financial performance will continue to improve. Thus, there is
                                  a feedback loop between the three measures of performance. Finance is another import-
                                  ant element, which leads to better operational performance and customer performance.
                                    How the relationship shown in figure 7.1 works in practice was analyzed through the five
                                  case studies. Six key findings are summarized in this section:

                                  •	 Good financial performance enables financing, which enables utilities to expand access to
                                    piped water and provide higher quality water supply service.

                                  •	 Operating efficiency and financial performance are linked.

                                  •	 Successful utilities combine cost recovery with affordable access to water supply
                                    services.

                                  •	 A variety of strategies have been successful in expanding water supply access.

                                  •	 Incentivized contracts are successful in generating performance.

                                  •	 National utilities can be a management model to expand water supply services to small
                                    towns.


                                  Financing through Good Financial Performance
                                  When discussing good financial performance, it should be noted that the use of the OCCR is
                                  the bare minimum of financial performance. When a utility is able to cover its operating
                                  costs through its revenues, a utility will be able to provide services to its existing customers
                                  in the short run. In case a utility wants to ensure service provision in the medium term
                                  (it should be able to cover its depreciation) and if it wants to expand services it will have to
                                  be able to generate even more cash flow. As mentioned in Whittington et al. (2009) the vari-
                                  able costs of water service provision are relatively small in comparison with the capital costs.

                                                        Over the last 20 years, three of the utilities—NWSC, ONEA, and SDE/SONES—have turned
                                                      around their performance. Figures 7.2 to 7.7 show how water coverage and reliability
                                                      improved substantially in each case.1 NWSC in Uganda has increased coverage in its service
                                                      area from 47 percent in 1998 to 78 percent in 2013. Water is available 20 hours per day on
                                                      average, compared with 8 hours on average in 1996. ONEA in Burkina Faso has achieved
                                                      similar success, with coverage increasing from 50 percent (1998) to 86 percent (2014). Water
                                                      supply, once intermittent, is now available almost 24–7. In Senegal, 98 percent of the service
                                                      area’s population is now served, with water available 23 hours per day on average. In all
                                                      three cases, improvements in access and service were achieved even as the service area pop-

                                                        How did these utilities achieve these improvements in access to piped water and
                                                      water supply service? Historical data on the sources of investment financing help

                                                    Dakar both faced water shortages. Supply was rationed and water coverage was low. ONEA

                                                    to finance bulk supply. The Bank was a major financier in both cases.

performance-based service contract in 2001 to help manage the commercial function. As a
result, collection efficiency rose from 78 percent in 2002 to 95 percent in 2006. This has been
sustained and even improved, measuring 97 percent in 2013. Low levels of NRW were main-
tained. In Senegal, the private operator (SDE) was brought in through the  Senegal Water
Project. Signing a public–private partnership (PPP) contract satisfactory to the Bank was a
condition of the Bank loan. SDE steadily reduced NRW from 1996 to 2003 (29 percent to 20
percent) because the affermage contract included strong incentives to do so. Collection rates
were maintained at 95 percent or above.

Correlation of Operational and Financial Performance
The case studies show an association between good operating efficiency and financial per-
formance. Higher levels of operating efficiency are correlated with higher levels of financial
performance. Good financial performance can provide financial resources that allow the
utility to invest in further operating efficiencies, for example by replacing leaky mains,
worn-out meters, and inefficient, unreliable pumps.
  The relationship between operational and financial performance at NWSC, ONEA, and
SDE/SONES is described in the previous section on financing investment. A similar rela-
tionship is present at SODECI, whose peak performance on operational and financial
indicators was in 2000. The OCCR was 1.09 and the collection ratio 92 percent. NRW was
131 liters per connection per day, or just 17 percent in percentage terms. There was an
average of just three staff per 1,000 water connections. During the Ivorian Civil Wars
(2002–11), however, financial and operational performance declined. Since 2011, perfor-
mance has improved. As of 2014, SODECI is again a good performer. It ranks 12th of all
utilities in the econometric analysis (though its performance is still below the level it
reached before the war).
  Nairobi’s utility, NCWSC, provides a contrast to the other four utilities. Its OCCR is 1.01,
which indicates that revenue barely covers operating costs. NRW is also relatively high, at
697 liters per connection per day—partially the result of inefficiencies and partially the

                                                     four utilities. Although collection efficiency has improved, the lack of cash generated from
                                                     operations limits resources available for fixing pipes and replacing meters.

                                                     Combining Cost Recovery with Affordable Water Supply Service
                                                     It is often assumed that there is a trade-off between cost recovery and affordable service.
                                                     And indeed, all of the case study utilities—with the exception of Nairobi and to some
                                                     extent SDE in Senegal—are providing low levels of water consumption (especially low
                                                     levels of residential water consumption) and show lower than average levels of afford-
                                                     ability compared with African benchmarks (table 7.3). Yet, the use of cross-subsidies in
                                                     several of the case study utilities shows that this tool can to a large extent transcend this
                                                     trade-off.
                                                       There are two basic cross-subsidization strategies:

                                                     •	 Charging nonresidential customers more than residential customers

                                                     •	 Selling a basic needs quantity of water at a below average tariff and selling water above the
                                                        basic needs quantity at an above average tariff

                                                       NWSC’s tariff structure is an example of the first strategy (figure 7.8). Residents are
                                                     charged less than nonresidents, at a rate below the average tariff, no matter how much
                                                     they consume. Senegal’s tariff structure is an example of applying both strategies in
                                                     parallel (figure 7.9).

     Since then, the share of commercial consumption has risen from 21 percent to 33 percent
     (by volume), as commercial consumption by volume has risen by an average of 11.1 per-
     cent per year. These trends indicate that charging commercial customers at rates above
     the average tariff has not resulted in reduced consumption. The decreasing block tariff for
     commercial customers could also be a reason the cross-subsidization mechanism contin-
     ues to work well.
       Senegal’s tariff structure also relies heavily on nonresidential consumption for cross-­
     subsidies. However, unlike NWSC, nonresidential revenues have decreased over time, from
     39 percent of all revenue billed (2004) to 29 percent (2013); over the same period, the volume
     of water sold to nonresidential water users dropped to only 8 percent in 2013. High nonresi-
     dential tariffs could be a contributing factor to this trend. These cross-subsidies are summa-
     rized in the table 7.7
       The takeaway from these cases is that cross-subsidization can be helpful in keeping the
     service more affordable as long as certain principles are followed. The average tariff should
     be sufficient for cost recovery. To ensure affordability for households, residential tariffs can
     be set lower than the average tariff. Commercial tariffs or tariffs for high levels of consump-
     tion can be set higher than the average tariff, but not too high. To keep nonresidential users
     connected to the piped network, nonresidential tariffs must be set lower than the cost of
     alternate water sources.

     Strategies for Expanding Access
     Utilities have employed different strategies to expand access in their service area. SDE is an
     example for serving a large proportion of all customers with piped water to their premises
     (89 percent). Other utilities—such as ONEA (Ouagadougou) and NWSC (Kampala)—serve
     about half of the population with public taps. Household survey data for Dakar and
     Ouagadougou are shown in figure 7.10 and figure 7.11.4
       ONEA’s strategy is to focus first on achieving good access for the poor through public
     taps, then to increase individual connections. Household survey data for Ouagadougou,

                                                            to generate operating cash that financed investment and service improvement.

     Incentivized Management Contract. NWSC’s internally delegated management contracts
     (IDAMCs) have been another successful initiative. In 2004, each town was established as a
     business unit and managers were held accountable for meeting set performance targets.
     Kampala was further divided into branches, each responsible for operational activities in
     its service area and incentivized to meet targets set in the branch performance contract.
     Those who do meet the targets can earn bonuses up to 120 percent of their gross salary,
     whereas those who do not can attract a penalty of up to 25 percent of their salary. This con-
     cept was derived in part from two initial management contracts with private operators
     (Gauff and Ondeo) from 1998 to 2004. Gauff was contracted to undertake a massive over-
     haul of water services, including deploying geographic information systems (GIS), improv-
     ing metering and billing procedures, achieving yearly connections targets, and reducing
     NRW. Ondeo’s contract had similar objectives. These contracts rapidly improved NRW,
     which fell from 50 percent to 38 percent from 1998 to 2004. The collection ratio and staff
     productivity also rose. When the second management contract with Ondeo ended, NWSC
     maintained these performance standards without private sector involvement. The IDAMCs,
     as described above, ensured sustained performance.


     Performance-Based Contract for the Commercial Function. When ONEA needed donor finance
     for a large bulk water scheme, the Bank suggested an affermage contract, citing Senegal’s
     recent success. However, the Burkina Faso government was committed to public sector
     control of the utility. An alternative model was developed involving strong multi-­
     stakeholder accountability arrangements and a performance-based contract with a spe-
     cialist firm to boost ONEA’s commercial performance. Financing partners found this
     proposal credible, and the bulk water scheme and institutional reforms to ONEA pro-
     ceeded in parallel.
       ONEA had a performance-based service contract for commercial management with Veolia
     from 2001 to 2006 (Marin, Fall, and Ouibiga 2010). Veolia provided two deputy managers,
     plus other short-term advisers, for ONEA’s commercial and finance departments. They set
     up new accounting and customer management systems, and helped ONEA identify illegal
     customers, improve meter reading and meter repairs, and improve customer service. After
     an initial decline from 85 percent to 78 percent, collection efficiency rose to 95 percent by the
     end of the contract. ONEA has maintained high cash collection rates above 95 percent since
     the end of the contract. This includes collections from the government, which is obliged to
     settle its water bills according to the terms of the performance contract.


     Formal Supervision Involving Multiple Stakeholders. Another innovative model used by ONEA is
     the multi-stakeholder supervision committee at ONEA. ONEA’s management credits
     this committee with an important role in making sure that both the utility and the govern-
     ment play their agreed roles under the contract plan (performance contract with




88   Performance of Water Utilities in Africa
operational  targets). The multi-stakeholder committee comprises representatives of cus-
tomers, NGOs, and donors. The committee monitors performance of both the utility and the
government under the contract, on the basis of independently audited financial and techni-
cal reports. The committee’s monitoring role is centered on an annual meeting. Prior to the
meeting, committee members receive not just a report from ONEA on its performance
against the contract, but also the report of a financial auditor and a technical auditor, whose
job it is to assure the quality of the information. The auditors’ reports indicate the degree of
confidence they have in the information presented. The auditors appear in person before the
committee, and explain their reports.

National Utilities as a Model for Expansion of Water Supply Service
There is a continuous debate about what the optimal scale for utilities is, and whether util-
ities should be organized and controlled at the national, regional, or local level. All five
utilities in this sample are large, serving close to or more than 3 million people. Four of the
five are national utilities. Thus, based on the case study sample, it is not possible to address
the optimal scale issue. However, the case studies do show that national utilities can be
successful in expanding water supply service to small towns.
  In Uganda, the NWSC service area grew from 3 towns (1972) to 15 towns (2003) to 23 towns
(2013).5 The original three were relatively large urban centers—Kampala, Jinja, and Entebbe.
Since then, the utility has expanded to smaller towns with preexisting networks. This
arrangement works well because the smaller towns benefit from the managerial and techni-
cal know-how of NWSC. Also, the towns cross-subsidize each other. In 2013, 14 of 23 towns
served had average unit production costs that were higher than the weighted average tariff.
Kampala, which accounts for more than 60 percent of revenue, has the lowest average unit
production cost.
  In Côte d’Ivoire, the concession contract awarded to SAUR in 1959 was exclusively for
water services in Abidjan, the capital. Over the next 15 years, SODECI (the operator) gradu-
ally signed contracts with local governments in 10 other towns. In 1974, SODECI became
responsible for all water supply systems in the country. As of 2014, SODECI serves nearly
900 towns.
  Similar patterns are present in Senegal and Burkina Faso. The case studies cannot con-
clude that national utilities are performing better than regional or local utilities in providing
water supply service to smaller urban centers. However, they do show that national utilities
can provide water supply services to smaller towns.


Conclusions
The case studies show that well-performing utilities do exist in Africa. The utilities in the
case studies show that operating efficiency and financial performance are linked.
Successful utilities are able to ensure that they cover their operation and maintenance

     costs and generate additional funds to at least cover (part of the) depreciation of the
     existing infrastructure and possibly allow for some debt repayment. Nevertheless, even
     though the five case studies show that utilities in Africa can generate cash to pay for
     the  operation and maintenance, depreciation, and some debt repayments, many of
     these  utilities are not able to depend on only their own funds to pay for all of their
     investments.
       Affordability remains a challenge also in the case study utilities. Increasing water rates
     do not necessarily result in higher revenues if nonpayment increases. In some cases,
     top-performing utilities have used cross-subsidies to much effect to reduce the burden on
     the residential consumer, but this has at times resulted in a very small customer base,
     with nonresidential water users opting out. Of the five case study utilities, most were
     able—with varying degrees of cross-subsidization—to make the water supply services
     more affordable. Only two of the five case study utilities—Nairobi’s NCWSC and Senegal’s
     SDE—were providing piped water services at levels above the thresholds set by WHO as
     necessary for good health and hygiene (that is, at least 50 lcd provided to residential water
     consumers). Cross-subsidies that ensure long-term financial viability will require that the
     higher tariffs charged to nonresidential users are not set higher than the costs of alterna-
     tive water supplies (such as groundwater) so that they opt out of the piped network sys-
     tem. If these tariff prices are set too high, in the long run, the nonresidential basis on
     which to provide cross-subsidies to residential consumers will erode.
       Incentivized contracts can be successful in improving performance. Credible commit-
     ments through legally binding contracts between public and private parties, incentivized
     contracts with senior management teams, performance-based contracts, and multi-stake-
     holder frameworks have worked to sustain successful governance and utility management
     models. The four well-performing utilities—NWSC, SDE/SONES, ONEA, and SODECI—all
     have or had some form of incentivized contract in place.


     Notes
     1.	 The focus of this section is how utilities have financed improvements in their water supply service. The case studies
        show that expanding a piped network has been successful in these utilities. For technical and financial reasons, the
        same does not apply for the sewerage network. Due to the complexity of increasing access to sanitation services, and

Chapter 8   Lessons Learned

            There is a lack of agreement on what constitutes good performance in utilities. In this report,
            good performance has been defined as utilities that provide water and wastewater services that
                                                                                               performance
            are efficient, affordable, sustainable, and with a minimum service quality. Hence, ­
            has many different dimensions. A definition that focuses on these different aspects of
                        financial, operational, and customer performance—has been used. When disag-
            performance—­
            gregating the different elements measuring financial performance, customer performance, and
            operational performance, while separately addressing water coverage, it was found that these
            four indicators are in general not very strongly correlated (with the exception of water coverage
            and customer performance), meaning that good performance in one aspect of performance
            does not automatically predict good performance in other aspects. Even in the case study util-
            ities, which were in general well-performing, some aspects of good performance—especially
            with regard to customer performance—were less well articulated. It was found that incentive
            structures within and outside the sector can distort aspects of performance. The findings of
            literature about economies of scale and scope were confirmed, while the overall economic
            management in the economy and governance also matter in how well utilities are performing.


            Lesson 1: Although Utilities in Africa in General Underperform, There Are
            Relatively Well-Performing Utilities Operating in the Continent
            Well-performing utilities are in general doing well in terms of operational and financial
            performance. It was found that good performance varies widely between countries and also
            ­
            within countries. This suggests that water is indeed a local service and that local

     circumstances have a big impact on how well utilities are performing. Unfortunately, it was
     not possible to capture all these local particularities in the data collection. Variation in local
     ­circumstances can include, among others, the distance to water sources, the quality of water
     resources available to the utilities and water users, the availability of other water resources,
     spatial patterns and levels of economic development that affect the cost of infrastructure
     and service delivery, the types of consumers, the willingness of water users to connect and
     pay for utility services, but also the quality of management.



     Lesson 2: Customer Performance Is Relatively Weak Even among the
     Best-Performing Utilities
     Customer performance is not necessarily very well developed in African utilities, especially
     not when compared with global benchmarks. Water tends to be supplied for fewer than
     24 hours a day. In addition, many utilities provide relatively low levels of service compared
     with utilities elsewhere in the world in terms of a much heavier reliance on shared connec-
     tions and public standposts. This results in significantly lower levels of consumption per
     capita. Residential water consumption tends to be very low; in many utilities, less than
     50 lcd (the minimum volume of water set by World Health Organization [WHO] to guarantee
     good health and hygiene). Hence, even though tariffs are not necessarily low, the very low
     consumption levels provide utilities with a relatively weak revenue basis (especially when
     the utility is small in size). This low consumption also makes it less compelling for water
     consumers to use or connect to the service compared with other water sources at least in
     terms of service delivered (that is, consumption levels, convenience of service which is
     limited if households share connections and/or are dependent on public taps, and the often
     ­
     high number of supply interruptions). It was found that higher levels of service as measured
     by customer performance are positively connected to water coverage. Hence, when alterna-
     tive water sources are available, the low levels of service provided can deter households
     from connecting to the piped water network.


     Lesson 3: The Major Drivers of Water Utility Performance Are Linked to
     the Cost of Service, While an Enabling Environment as Reflected in
     Good Economic Management also Matters
     It was observed that one of the major drivers of utility performance is economies of scale:
     size (as measured by the size of the population served with water) matters, but when a utility
     becomes too large the benefits become disadvantages. Economies of scope also matter.
     Utilities with sewerage coverage tend to show better performance, although this result has
     to be interpreted against a context in which sewerage coverage is very low especially in
     low-income countries in Africa; and this may be linked with higher gross domestic product
     (GDP) in environments where utilities that provide wastewater services are located. Another
     finding, linked to the economies of scale and scope, is the impact of costs (either measured



94   Performance of Water Utilities in Africa
by the operation and maintenance [O&M] costs per cubic meter of water produced or the
share of labor in the total costs): higher O&M costs per cubic meter of water produced
are linked with lower utility performance. A large part of the O&M costs are the result of
investment decisions, and these decisions lock in costs for decades to come. It is, therefore,
important to assess investment decisions properly. Some of the other drivers of utility
­
performance are beyond the control of the utilities. The quality of economic management in
the countries in which utilities operate is affecting utility performance: the higher the qual-
ity of economic management, the higher the utility performance.


Lesson 4: Improving Water Coverage in Africa Will Require Large
Investments that Will Have to Be Mostly Paid for by Government Funds
Customer performance (that is, service quality) has a direct impact on improvements in
water coverage. Better economic management and higher gross national income (GNI)
growth have a positive impact on coverage as it is likely linked to the availability of invest-
ment funding for the sector. As per capita income rises, a larger amount of money can be
spent on water, ensuring a more sustainable footing for utilities. Experience shows that most
utilities are able to provide more or less universal access to water supply only when they
reach a certain level of economic development; and even higher levels of economic develop-
ment are needed to ensure proper management of wastewater services.
  In the sample of utilities, it was found that the link between utilities’ financial performance
and water coverage was only in place for certain groups of utilities. For other utilities, the
contribution of good financial performance to water coverage is very weak. This suggests
that most utilities, especially smaller ones in low-income countries are not able to improve
access through improved financial performance but depend on external funds to do so. The
case studies confirmed these findings: many of the best performing utilities still depend on
some form of government funding to finance their investments.
  Hence, increases in water coverage will have to be matched by government priorities to
fund the sector, especially as the current investment in the sector is mostly limited to water
supply (that is, most utilities in Africa, especially in low-income countries, do not provide
wastewater services). Utilities with few exceptions are also not able to provide services effi-
ciently, as was reflected in the results of the data envelopment analysis (DEA)—most utili-
                                                                           ­ vailable—showed
ties were very far from the DEA frontier. The case studies—where data were a
that more efficient levels of investment spending allow more financial space for utilities.
  As many utilities are underperforming, government funding for the sector should be
subject to much more stringent criteria for investment selection and priority setting as these
­
decisions will determine the O&M costs for decades after. The investment selection criteria
must be linked to, among others:

(a)	 More comprehensive processes and methods for investment project selection (with
    proper technical, economic, financial, and social due diligence);

     (b)	 Sufficient attention to the performance of the utility to operate and maintain its existing
         and new infrastructure so as to ensure the long-term sustainability of water (and waste-
         water services) by ensuring that these investments will generate the most value for
         money and through the inclusion of all life-cycle costs in investment decision making;

     (c)	 Ensuring that investment expansion and institutional capacity to manage the new infra-
         structure assets are in synch; and

     (d)	 Putting in place adequate and transparent sector financing policies (that is, tariff and
         subsidy policies that ensure that the assets can be properly operated and maintained).


     Lesson 5: Specific Measures Are Needed to Ensure that Progress in
     Financial Cost Recovery Does Not Translate into Less Affordable Services
     The better performing utilities tend to charge higher water rates to their customers. Yet,
     affordability remains a significant challenge for many utilities, even though most utilities
     in  Africa provide only water services.1 In some cases, top-performing utilities have used
     cross-subsidies to much effect to reduce the burden on the residential consumer, but
     this  has  at times resulted in a very skewed customer base, with nonresidential water
     users opting out. In the five case study utilities, most of these utilities were able—with cross-­
     subsidization—to make the water supply services more affordable. Yet, only two of the
                      utilities (Nairobi’s NCWSC and Senegal’s SDE) were able to provide piped
     five  case study ­
     water services at levels that are above the thresholds set by WHO as necessary for good health
     and  hygiene (i.e., 50–100 lcd for residential water consumers). Cross-subsidies can help
     make the service more affordable, but care should be taken to ensure that the high tariffs
     charged to nonresidential users are not set higher than the costs of alternative water supplies
     (such as groundwater) so that the nonresidential users opt out of the piped network system.

     Lesson 6: Availability of Data is Critical to Assess Performance and
     Guide Sector Planning
     To enable anyone to investigate the performance of utilities in Africa and elsewhere, avail-
     ability of reliable and complete data is critical. For this analysis, the team could benefit from
     a tested instrument like the IBNET Toolkit. Even so, the quality and, especially, the
     completeness of the collected data remained a major challenge. Organizational data were
     ­
     ­
     collected but overall response rate for this type of information was low; utilities do not
     always collect even basic data on their performance. There is a huge demand from many
     professionals for more data beyond the basic financial and operational data collected for this
     study. Basic performance monitoring is most common in countries where a regulator is
     active. In countries where utilities have no specific regulator in place, performance monitor-
     ing is generally underdeveloped. Yet, it is hard to improve performance without reliable data
     and basic reporting mechanisms in place that are available to the public (externally audited
     financial statements are often missing).



96   Performance of Water Utilities in Africa
  It should be noted that focusing on a very small set of indicators may result in a distorted
picture. For instance, cost recovery—at least O&M cost recovery—has become a major area of
focus to measure utility performance. Although, in theory, many utilities in Africa cover
their O&M costs, the actual cash flow performance of utilities is a major challenge because
collection efficiencies are typically significantly below 100 percent. This means that the cash
flowing into the utilities is insufficient to cover the basic expenditures, resulting in a decline
in service levels and slow progress in increasing access to piped water supply. Data on
collection efficiency (let alone working capital) are often either left unreported or are only
­
partially reported (with certain groups of consumers missing) and so, on paper, a utility may
be able to generate sufficient billed revenue to pay for its O&M.
  Finally, most utilities have little insight into their customers’ behavior. There are large dis-
crepancies between the data provided by utilities on the access to water supply services and
those registered in household surveys. Utilities should at frequent intervals calibrate their
insights into their customers’ behavior to better predict the demand for their services and
the investment plans that are based on this demand.

Appendix B   Case Studies

             Burkina Faso, ONEA (L’Office National de l’Eau et de l’Assainissement)
             Background
             ONEA is a national utility that provides water supply, wastewater, and excreta treatment
             services to 54 towns in Burkina Faso (Sawadogo 2015). Ouagadougou, the capital, accounts
             for more than 60 percent of customers.
               ONEA was established as a public water utility in 1985. Access was low and reliability was
             poor throughout the early 1990s. In 1994, ONEA was corporatized. In the same year, the first
             contract plan (performance contract with operational targets) was established between the
             utility and the government of Burkina Faso. A performance-based service contract with
             Veolia was in place from 2001 to 2006.
               Today, ONEA is publicly owned and operated. Its contract plan with the government is
             supervised by a multi-stakeholder committee comprising representatives of customers,
             nongovernmental organizations, and donors. The committee monitors performance of both
             the utility and the government under the contract, on the basis of independently audited
             financial and technical reports.
               The committee’s monitoring role is centered on an annual meeting. Before the meeting,
             committee members receive not just a report from ONEA on its performance against the
             contract, but also the report of a financial auditor and a technical auditor whose job it is to
             assure the quality of the information. The auditors’ reports indicate the degree of confidence
             they have in the information presented. The auditors appear in person before the committee
             and explain their reports.

             Performance
             Customer Performance

             Access to Water Services. In 2000, ONEA served about half of its service area population—2.3
             million people. By 2014, nearly 4 million people were served out of 4.6 million people (86
             percent coverage). This progress is extraordinary considering that from 2000 to 2015
             Ouagadougou was the fastest growing Sub-Saharan African city (out of the set of cities with
             a 2015 population above 1 million). Ouagadougou grew at an average annual rate of 7.5 per-
             cent during this period (United Nations 2014).
               Growth in the service area population and population served are shown in figure B.1.
             Figure B.2 shows the growth in water coverage, defined as the proportion of the service area
             population served by ONEA. A breakdown of those served by direct or shared taps and those
             served by public water points is included for years 2006–14.

for Burkina Faso. However, the government was committed to public sector control of the
utility. An alternative model was developed involving strong multi-stakeholder account-
ability arrangements and a performance-based contract with a specialist firm to boost
ONEA’s commercial performance. Financing partners found this proposal credible, and the
bulk water scheme and institutional reforms to ONEA proceeded in parallel.
  Veolia’s contract from 2001 to 2006 increased collection efficiency from 85 percent to

   percent, success ONEA has maintained in the decade after the contract’s end. At the
same time, the Ouagadougou Water Supply Project ensured greater supply reliability for
ONEA’s customers, and included network expansion and the installation of  new con-
nections and standposts. Low levels of NRW were maintained. Staff productivity rose
while new staff were hired.
  Today, ONEA’s innovative Supervisory Committee, strong performance culture, and
operational efficiency are sustaining the benefits achieved by these reforms.

Côte d’Ivoire, SODECI (la Société de Distribution d’Eau de
la Côte d’Ivoire)
Background
SODECI, founded in 1960, is the oldest PPP water utility in the developing world, serving
over 11 million customers. The partnership between the national government and the
private operator has allowed effective expansion of access to water services, while
increasing the efficiency and profitability of the national utility over time. This PPP has
endured even as utilities in neighboring countries were nationalized. It has remained
private since its founding more than 50 years ago. More notably, SODECI has shown
remarkable resilience and continuity of service during and after the First Ivorian Civil
War from 2002 until 2007 and the Second Ivorian Civil War from late 2010 until early 2011.
The history of SODECI is summarized in five time periods below (Marin et al. 2009).


1960–74. Côte d’Ivoire gained independence in 1960. The year before that, the French water
operator SAUR had been awarded a concession contract to provide water supply services in
Abidjan. SODECI, the new Ivorian company established in 1960, gradually signed operating
contracts with municipalities in 10 other cities.


1974–88. In 1974, Côte d’Ivoire’s water sector was reformed. Municipal water utilities were
consolidated into one national utility, which signed an operations contract with SODECI.
From 1974 to 1988, US$400 million of public investment were used to install piped water
in 200 additional towns. Before these reforms, only 34 percent of households had access
to piped water. By 1983, household coverage almost doubled to 63 percent. The ­company’s
management was gradually transferred to Ivorian nationals. In 1978, the French group
SAUR sold 48 percent of the shares in an initial public offering on the Abidjan stock
exchange.

      1988–2001. From 1988 to 2001, SODECI financed rapid expansion of the water network
      through a tariff surcharge. SODECI more than doubled the number of households served
      by piped water. During this period, major gains in efficiency were achieved (losses
      decreased from 180 liters per connection per day to 130 liters per connection per day).
      At  the end of this period, SODECI’s operational performance was at the level of
      ­
      present-day global benchmarks. The expansion of the network added many more cus-
      tomers. Increased revenues as a result of expansion, as well as efficiency gains, gradually
      improved the overall financial performance of the utility. Average tariffs decreased in
      real terms over the same time period.


      2002–11. During the First Ivorian Civil War (2002–07) and Second Ivorian Civil War
      (2010–11), SODECI continued to provide water services to existing and new customers.
      ­
      Nearly  4  million additional people were served during this period.8 As would be
      expected, however, service and operational performance declined during this time.
                     service was nearly halved. NRW rose. Revenue fell slightly.

      2012–14. After 2011, when the conflict stabilized, performance began improving. While
      pre-conflict performance has not been attained since then, SODECI is still a successful utility
      in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Most indicator values for 2014 are on par with or better
      than the regional benchmark, a significant accomplishment given nearly a decade of politi-
      cal instability and factual division of the country. The Eranove Group, formerly known as
      Finagestion, is a main shareholder of SODECI.

      Access to Water Services. Between 2000 and 2014, SODECI extended water service to
          million additional people. This was achieved despite the civil wars from 2002 to 2007
      5.5 ­
      and 2010 to 2011. Owing to rapid migration to major cities and towns during the crises, water
      coverage declined in the early 2000s. Since 2011, coverage has been steadily rising as SODECI
      regains its footing.
        Growth in SODECI’s service area population and population served over this period is
      shown in figure B.16. Figure B.17 shows the growth in water coverage, defined as the propor-
      tion of the service area population served by SODECI.
        As of 2006, about 25 percent of people in the served area population were served by commu-
      nity tap stands (Fall et al. 2009). In 2014, the average number of people served per connection
                                    connection during the 2000–04 period (see figure B.18).
      was 15, up from 12 people per ­


      Sufficiency. Average residential water consumption per capita has  declined over time, from
      about 40 lcd in the early 2000s to 32 lcd in 2014 (see figure B.19). Historically, per capita con-

        Nairobi is a rapidly growing city, expected to reach 4.5 million people by 2019. The NCWSC
      will need to finance significant capital investment to keep pace with population growth and
      reach the 20 percent still unserved today, while improving supply reliability. The required
      investment (2014–19) is estimated to be US$478 million.


      Senegal, SDE and SONES
      Background
      In 1995, the GoS split SONEES, the existing national utility, into three entities: an
      asset-holding company for water service assets (SONES), a private operator for water ser-
      vices engaged through an affermage contract (SDE), and a public, combined asset-owner
      and operator for wastewater services (ONAS). SONES and ONAS have entered into perfor-
      mance contracts with the GoS, represented by the Ministry of Water and Sanitation
      (Ministère de l’Hydraulique et de l’Assainissement) and the Ministry of Finance (Ministère
      de l’Économie, des Finances et du Plan). The SDE has an affermage contract with SONES
      and the government.
        The SDE, the private operator, is responsible for water supply services in 66 towns. Dakar,
      the capital, accounts for more than 50 percent of connections. The provision of water supply
      and sanitation services in Senegal is governed by the Water and Sanitation Law (Loi portant
      organisation du service public d’eau potable et d’assainissement des eaux usées domestiques) of
      September 24, 2008, which defines the responsibilities for managing urban and rural water
      and sanitation services and their delegation (including to private entities), the principles for
      delivering services, the monitoring and controlling of the delivery of services, and the cost
      recovery of these services.

      Access to Water Services. In 1995, the SDE served about 69 percent of its service area
      ­
      population—3.6 million people. By 2013, nearly 5.8 million people were served, out of
      5.9 million people (98 percent coverage).17 Growth in the service area population and the
      population served are shown in figure B.38. Figure B.39 shows the growth in water coverage,
      defined as the proportion of the service area population served by the SDE. A breakdown of
      those served by connections and those served by standpipes is also included.
        Today, the SDE serves most people (89 percent) with a direct connection. Just 9 percent
      are served by public taps. These utility-reported estimates closely match household survey
      data for Dakar. In 2014, 86 percent of people reported access to piped water to their prem-
      ises and 9 percent of people reported access to standpipes (see figure B.40).18 In 2005, how-
      ever, the DHS data differed from the utility-reported data. Eighty-eight percent of those
      living in Dakar reported accessing water through a connection piped to their premises. For
      the same year, the SDE reported direct access for just 64 percent of its service area. This
      seems to indicate that direct connections were first promoted in Dakar and then in other

  Two major programs implemented during this period were the Senegal Water Project (US$223
million, 1996–2004) and the Long Term Water Project (US$255 million, 2002–09).22 The Bank
was a major financier for both projects, providing US$85 million and US$146 million, respectively.
                             similar to International Bank for Reconstruction and
Overall borrowing terms were ­
Development terms, with interest rates around 6 percent and tenors of 20 years (including
five-year grace periods).23 The cost of finance was kept down through the financing structure
used. Because the investments were the responsibility of the publicly owned SONES, the funds
were lent to the government on concessional International Development Association terms.
  The first project focused on urgent investments needed to increase water supply in Dakar.
This included additional boreholes, expansion of a treatment plant, and leakage reduction
works. A private operator was brought in through this project as well. Signing a PPP contract
satisfactory to the Bank was a condition of the Bank loan. The second phase of reforms
involved the construction of the much larger Keur Momar Sarr water treatment plant
(in 2005, 65,000 m3 per day; upgraded in 2008 to 130,000 m3 per day) along with a continued
expansion in the distribution network.

Organization
Human Resources. Management capability came from both the private and public sectors. The
new state-run asset holder, SONES, maintained continuity by retaining the managing director
of the forerunner institution, SONEES. All permanent employees of SONEES had guaranteed
employment in the new structure. Meanwhile, the affermage contract also brought in private
                                                                   ­ ompany, SAUR. Senegal’s
sector expertise from an experienced and specialized international c
long experience with private sector management—it had an affermage contract before the
1972 nationalization and a consulting contract with SAUR between 1972 and 1995—facilitated
trust, familiarity, and cooperation. That operator in turn brought in modern management sys-
tems and techniques and skilled managers. The operator trained local staff, so the company is
now run almost entirely with national staff at the same high levels of efficiency. Profit incen-
tives for owners in turn led to performance-oriented management for the staff.


Strategic Planning. The various contracts establish a process for investment planning.
SONES  (the public asset-holding company) has to prepare a 10-year investment plan and
a 3-year rolling investment plan, based on the SDE’s inputs on demand and service needs.
The parties then have to agree on a three-year investment convention containing the detailed
planning of the works in the coming three years. No investment work can be carried out if it
has not been previously included in that investment convention.


Summary
In Senegal, the SDE estimates that about 98 percent of people in its service area now have
access to piped water services. Eighty-nine percent have access to a connection on premises
while 9 percent have access to a standpipe. On average, water is available for 23 hours per
day. Residential customers consume 92 percent of all water sold, at an average of 55 lcd.


Performance of Water Utilities in Africa                                                      137
        This situation is a significant improvement over that of the mid-1990s, when Dakar faced
      a water shortage. With groundwater resources depleting rapidly, supply was rationed to
      16  hours per day. The utility needed to finance a new production source and turned to
      development partners for support. The Water Sector Project, supported by the Bank,
      developed a plan to finance short-term production sources. A condition of this loan was
      the introduction of a private operator to improve efficiency and management. In 1995, the
      GoS split SONEES, the existing national utility, into three entities: an asset-holding com-
      pany for water service assets (SONES), a private operator for water services engaged
      through an affermage contract (SDE), and a public, combined asset-owner and operator for
      wastewater services (ONAS).
        Private operation did improve efficiency, with NRW falling from 29 percent to 20 percent
      in eight years (1995–2003) and the collection ratio rising to 98 percent by 1997. Staff produc-
      tivity improved from seven staff per 1,000 connections (1996) to two staff per 1,000 connec-
      tions (2013).
        Total capital investment in the sector from 1996 to 2013 totaled about US$770
      ­
      m illion. About a quarter of this was financed by own funds and half was financed by
      loans from donors. The SDE is limited by its contract to charge a fixed operator tariff,
      so the average retail tariff paid by customers has to cover the operator tariff, in addi-
      tion to an amount to service the debt taken on by SONES to finance the infrastructure.
      Tariffs are kept at affordable levels by cross-subsidizing households that consume
      less than 20 m 3 every two months. The nonresidential tariff is four times this social
      tariff (US$1.75 per m 3), while the tariff for government customers is nine times the
      social tariff (US$3.72 per m 3). A consistent increase in the residential share of con-
      sumption in recent years (92 percent as of 2013 with only 8 percent being consumed
      by nonresidential water customers) could threaten the sustainability of this cross-sub-
      sidy mechanism.


      Uganda, NWSC (National Water and Sewerage Corporation)
      Background
      In 2013 the NWSC was providing water supply and (sometimes) sewerage services to
      23 urban centers and towns in Uganda. 24 The NWSC is internationally recognized for its
      successful performance turnaround, which began in 1998. Two important things hap-
      pened in 1998: a management contract with a German engineering firm (Gauff) was
      signed and a new managing director (Dr. William Muhairwe) was appointed. Dr.
      Muhairwe launched several internal programs to improve operational efficiency, such as
      the 100 days’ program. In 2002, a second management contract was signed, this time
      with Ondeo.
        The IDAMCs, first piloted in 2004, were another successful initiative. Each town was estab-
      lished as a business unit and managers were held accountable for meeting set performance
      targets. Kampala, which accounts for more than 60 percent of total revenue, was further

                                                                                                                standpipe tariff is about 39 per-
                                                  cent less than the domestic tariff, the NWSC found that some of the kiosks charge an excessive
                                                  markup for the water. Once the water is dispensed in 20 liter jerry cans at the kiosk, the effec-
                                                  tive tariff could be US$1 per m3 or more (Kariuki et al. 2014). In response, the NWSC has installed
                                                  standpipes that automatically dispense water when a customer inserts an electronic token. By
                                                  cutting out the middlemen (the kiosk operator) these prepaid water points ensure that cus-
                                                  tomers can access water at the low standpipe tariff set by the NWSC, without markups.
                                                     A similar effort that helps ensure affordability is the NWSC’s recognition that some indi-
                                                  vidual yard taps are in fact shared water points. If consumption of water by one direct con-
                                                  nection seems high, the NWSC staff will visit to check if the yard tap serves more than two or
                                                  three households. If so, the tariff for public water points is applied.

                                                  Summary
                                                  As a result of the NWSC’s turnaround, about 76 percent of people in the utility service area
                                                  now have access to piped water services, up from just 47 percent in 1998. On average,
                                                  water is available for 18 hours per day. Cross-subsidies—and standpipes that dispense
                                                  water automatically—help ensure water is affordable to residential customers. Revenue
                                                  covers all operating costs and some capital costs, a result of operational efficiency and a
                                                  cost recovery tariff. The NWSC can borrow on commercial terms and service the debt with
                                                  operating cash.
                                                     The reforms were phased. Early on, local and international management models were
                                                  tried in parallel, with the primary goal of continuing to serve existing customers while
                                                  reducing financing losses through greater efficiency. This was successful, as evidenced by
                                                  NRW falling from 50 percent to 30 percent (1998–2006) and staff productivity rising from
                                                  36  staff per 1,000 connections to six staff per 1,000 connections (1998–2006). Over time,
                                                  pragmatic solutions, including tariff indexation and a performance contract rather than a
                                                  regulator, were developed. The IDAMCs (since 2004) incentivize staff to meet operational
                                                  and financial targets such as NRW, arrears, the working ratio, and connection efficiency.

      Update: 2014–15

      In 2013, the NWSC launched an impressive new “water for all” campaign. Now that the
      NWSC is financially sustainable, the goal is to increase water supply access across the coun-
      try. The number of towns served rose from 23 to 149 in less than three years (June 2013 to
      March 2016). In these new towns, the NWSC has mostly taken over the operations and main-
      tenance of existing infrastructure from the Directorate of Water Development. Data on this
      expansion have been incomplete and hence could not be verified during this study. Prior
      data collection in the newly added towns was poor, so the NWSC plans to conduct a cus-
      tomer survey to establish better data.

      2.	 This is a very basic indicator for affordability as many utilities only provide services to urban residents (whose incomes tend
         to be higher than the national average). In addition, the revenues spent on water also include the sales to nondomestic
         users (as many utilities do not separately report for residential users and hence the effect of cross-subsidies cannot always
         be detected).

      3.	 This means that more than 25 percent of African utilities in the sample collected have a staff efficiency indicator value
         higher than ONEA’s.

Appendix C   Data Quality Procedures

             The quality of data in International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities
             (IBNET) depends on the quality of the submissions by utilities and their associations. IBNET,
             however, invests substantial efforts to ensure that the data collected are of top quality and
             adequately reflect the status of the utility performance.
               IBNET data in Africa are gained from the following sources: (a) Bank operations in
             Francophone Africa and Malawi; (b) regulators from Tanzania, Kenya, and Zambia; and (c)
             individual consultants working under the supervision of the IBNET and Bank teams from
             Nigeria, South Africa, and Ethiopia. The quality of data sources varied from excellent quality
             assurance procedures (such as regulatory data) to some with less sound procedures; how-
             ever, all of the data have gone through a rigorous review by the IBNET team.


             Data Quality When Collecting Data. The IBNET data collection tool contains ranges and built-in
             filters that prevent the input of obviously wrong information. More than 70 filters are set in
             the IBNET Toolkit that prevent input of wrong as well as non-numeric data.


             Data Quality When Uploading the Data. The IBNET site controls data when uploading the data:

             •	 Data are within the expected ranges.

             •	 Time trends appear to be reasonable (red flag if data or indicators changed more than 30
               percent within one year, yellow flag when data changed by 10 percent to 30 percent, and
               green flag when changes are below 10 percent). All yellow- and red-flagged data were sent
               to data collectors for review and explanation.

             •	 Confidence ratings assigned are as may be expected from experience (urbanization, length
               of pipes, consumption, and collection rates).

               After the dataset is uploaded, it undergoes a review for each of the data items on outliers,
             data sources, and consistency through the “performers” function in the IBNET database.
             The IBNET website allows examination of the calculated performance levels provided by all
             the utilities for consistency, to ensure that data are within the ranges to be expected and
             time trends appear to be reasonable. The calculated averages for the given set of data help
             understand the utilities’ outliers, and these performance outliers are reviewed jointly with
             the data collector to understand the reason for these outliers.
               We have a full data sample of more than 1,400 observations in the database, covering 306
             utilities from 40 African countries. Observations span a 20-year period (from 1995 to 2014)
             but not all utilities have reported information each year. There were few utilities which pro-
             vided information at the beginning of the period (less than 15 utilities each year from 1995 to
             1999). The number of utilities in the IBNET database has increased regularly over time. In
             2011 and 2012, more than 250 utilities provided information each year, because of large data
             collection efforts in Ethiopia and Nigeria. Because participation in the IBNET data collection

      African utilities operating in the water sector.
        A subsample of almost 120 utilities from 14 countries covering the period 2010–13 was used
      for the analyses in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6. In chapter 7, the case studies use datasets from
      longer time periods for the five selected utilities.

Appendix D   Data Envelopment Analysis Methodology

             The data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a nonparametric approach to measuring the relative
             efficiency of firms in an industry where the firms are often referred to in the DEA literature
             as decision-making units. The DEA creates a performance index from indicators, referred to
             as inputs and outputs in the DEA literature, which can be related to other factors that drive
             performance. Under basic DEA, a water utility is regarded as a relatively efficient utility if its
             observed inputs can be scaled to yield outputs that equal or exceed any combination or
             scaling of what the other utilities’ observed inputs yield. The origination of the approach is
             frequently attributed to Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) and has been applied in many
             studies, including studies of water utilities. Extensions of the basic DEA approach to accom-
             modate alternatives to its assumptions have been presented in the decades since the appear-
             ance of the seminal paper.
               The DEA approach uses mathematical programming methods to determine the perfor-
             mance ranking of firms in an industry. The DEA approach measures the efficiency of firm
             k in an industry of K firms as the optimal value of the objective function found by solving
             the following problem where yik is the amount of the ith of m outputs produced by firm k,
             xjk  is the amount of the jth of n inputs used by firm k, and the maximization is over the
             m + n nonnegative, choice variables, ui, and vj:

                                       m
             Maximize	
                                  ∑ i =1 ui yik , 
                                   n
                                  ∑ j =1 vi x jk
                                       m
             subject to	
                                  ∑ i =1 ui yik ≤ 1;k = 1,2,...,K, (D.1)
                                   n
                                  ∑ j =1 vi x jk
             where ui, vj ≥ 0; i = 1, 2, … , m; j = 1, 2, … , n.
               Note that the output values, ui, and input prices, vj, are evaluated to place firm k in the
             best light to determine its relative performance. A transformation of variables yields an
             equivalent model which may be more conveniently solved through the techniques of linear
             programming (see for example, Alhabeeb and Moffitt 2012); that is,

                                      m
             Maximize	            ∑ i =1 ui yik , 
                                      m                 n
             subject to	          ∑ i =1 ui yik − ∑ j =1 vi x jk ≤ 0, (D.2)
                                      n
                                  ∑ j =1 vi x jk = 1,
                                  ui , v j ≥ 0.

        The efficiency of each of the K firms is estimated by varying k in the objective function
      over k = 1, 2, … , K.
        Collecting the optimal value of the objective function for each value of k yields a perfor-
      mance index known in the DEA literature as an efficiency ranking of the firms over the [0, 1]
      interval with a “1” signifying an efficient firm. A relative efficiency frontier can be formed by
      piecewise linear segments associated with observations from the efficient firms.
        An important advantage of the DEA relative to statistical regression techniques is that it
      does not require specification of a functional form relating outputs and inputs as parametric
      statistical techniques do. Similarly, specification of distributions for stochastic model com-
      ponents is avoided. An important limitation of the DEA is its sensitivity to errors in sample
      observations, the potential of which is ignored by the basic DEA approach. The subjectivity
      involved in selection of inputs and outputs is also a limitation.
