KEY MESSAGES
Kazakhstan can further increase the impact of its already substantial HIV investment through a
combination of multiple key measures:

   Optimized allocation of currently available resources to high-impact programs (US$38
    million) would avert 6 percent of new infections and 22 percent of deaths over 2015–20
    compared to business as usual.
   At current unit costs of programs, achieving national HIV prevention and treatment targets
    would require substantial additional investment. To achieve national targets (no increase
    in HIV incidence and deaths) would cost US$52 million per year and achieving more
    ambitious 2020 targets (reducing new infections and deaths by 50 percent) would cost
    US$80 million.
   The cost for achieving national targets could be reduced by 50 percent by reducing the
    currently high unit cost of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by 67 percent and management
    costs by 20 percent and reinvest funds into priority programs:
    ∙ Scaling up antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV testing and counselling (HTC) as
      required to initiate PLHIV on ART
    ∙ Sustaining and scaling up programs for people who inject drugs (PWID) including
      needle- syringe programs (NSP) and opioid substitution therapy (OST)
    ∙ Substantially increasing coverage of programs for men who have sex with men (MSM)
    ∙ Sustaining coverage of FSW and PMTCT programs.
   With optimized allocation of resources, reduced ART costs, and a 20 percent reduction of
    management cost, it will be possible to achieve a 50 percent reduction in both HIV
    incidence and deaths over 2015–20 with the level of funding currently available. Through
    such an annual investment of US$38 million, Kazakhstan could avert 5,300 new infections
    and 4,200 deaths by 2020.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As part of a Regional initiative, Kazakhstan conducted an HIV allocative efficiency analysis in
2014–15 to inform more strategic investment in HIV programs.

Kazakhstan continues to experience a concentrated HIV epidemic in which the majority of new
infections occurred among key populations, particularly PWID, MSM, prison inmates, FSW, and
their clients. Under current conditions (constant behaviors and program coverage), new HIV
infections are projected to rise by 13 percent and deaths by 32 percent. The epidemics among
PWID and MSM are projected to account for 67 percent of new HIV infections from 2015 to
2020 so need to be a core focus of programs.

With optimized allocations of 2013 spending levels, new HIV infections could be reduced by 6
percent and deaths by 22 percent. These efficiency gains could be increased substantially if
Kazakhstan could reduce management cost by 20 percent. With optimized allocations of
current funding plus a 20 percent reduction in management cost, Kazakhstan could reduce its
new HIV infections by 18 percent and deaths by 32 percent. These reductions assume that
savings on management and other costs would be reinvested in high-impact programs
including ART and programs for PWID.

With optimized allocations, the cost to achieve national targets (no increase in incidence and
deaths from 2015 to 2020) would be US$52 million per year. The cost to achieve more
ambitious future HIV response targets (reduce HIV incidence and deaths by 50 percent
cumulatively over 2015–20) was estimated at US$80 million.

The cost to achieve national targets could be reduced if the ART unit cost and management
costs could be reduced. If Kazakhstan could reduce its ART cost to 33 percent of the 2013 cost,
Kazakhstan could reach even the ambitious targets of reducing incidence and deaths by 50
percent by 2020 with current funding. With these cost reductions, the HIV response would
remain within the range of unit costs of other countries of the region.

    Note: Figure 1 is a condensed version of Figure 4.11 in the body of the report. The levels of investment and
    coverage described here also are detailed in Table 4.5.

    Figure 1 summarizes the proposed reallocations arising out of this analysis for optimized
    allocation with reduced ART and management cost. The following programs would see
    particularly large changes in allocations (amounts should be seen as indicative of only the
    direction and dimension of change) over 2015–20:

        Increase coverage of ART from 47 percent among PLHIV with CD4 <500 to over 90 percent,
         but no increase in spending due to reduced unit cost
        Increase allocations for needle-syringe programs from US$3.3 million to US$3.9 million (to
         reach 55 percent coverage)
        Increase allocations for prevention among FSW from US$0.6 million to US$1.2 million (to
         achieve over 90 percent coverage)
        Increase allocations for prevention among MSM from US$0.1 million to US$0.7 million (to
         reach 20 percent coverage, thereby doubling the current national target)1
        Increase allocations for other prevention programs for PWID including condoms and HTC
         from US$0.5 million to US$1.5 million (47 percent coverage)
        Increase allocations for OST from US$0.1 to US$0.4 million, and consider mobilizing other
         health resources for OST to further increase coverage).
    With optimized allocations and without technical efficiency gains, the cost for achieving
    ambitious national targets from 2015 to 2020 would be US$480 million; and with reduced ART
    and management cost, US$230 million. These 2 amounts are considerably below the amount
    derived through the preliminary costing of the national strategy (US$734 million), suggesting
    the potential for allocative and technical efficiency gains.

    In conclusion, a combination of various efficiency gains in Kazakhstan’s HIV response can
    halve new HIV infections and deaths, achieving ambitious national targets at no additional
    cost. As a first priority, ART will be essential for reducing deaths and new infections, but unit

    1   The coverage corresponding to the increased investment is derived from the cost-coverage curves in the model.
        The estimated coverage to be achieved is lower than for other groups because the difficulty in accessing MSM
        was considered in the cost-coverage curve for MSM programs.
Executive Summary                                                                             xi



costs need to be reviewed and reduced. A second consistent finding is the continued need to
provide HIV services for PWID at scale. A third consistent finding is the need to scale up
programs for MSM and at least double the current low coverage levels. Additional technical
efficiency analysis is worth considering to explore the concrete pathways to achieve the
proposed cost reductions for ART, OST, and management costs.

1.       INTRODUCTION
1.1      Necessity for allocative efficiency
Current HIV programs are faced with the necessity to scale up prevention and provide
treatment to a larger number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) than ever before. In the
current environment of increasingly limited resources for HIV responses, focused design and
efficiency in program delivery are essential to ensure that programs can do more with less.

In the 2011 United Nations Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS, countries agreed to reduce
sexual and injection-related transmission by 50 percent, virtually eliminate mother-to-child-
transmission (MTCT), initiate 80 percent of eligible PLHIV on treatment, and end HIV-related
discrimination by 2015 (UNGASS 2011). The 2014 UNAIDS Gap Report illustrated that
substantial additional efforts will be required in most countries to achieve these targets.
Despite the progress made, HIV remains among the unfinished agenda items within the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which need to be transitioned and integrated into the
post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Against this background, in 2014 UNAIDS defined a global Fast-Track strategy to achieve the
goal of Ending AIDS by 2030. A core element of the Fast-Track approach is the 90-90-90 targets
(UNAIDS 2014d). These targets set out to achieve that 90 percent of all PLHIV are diagnosed;
90 percent of diagnosed PLHIV are on ART; and 90 percent of PLHIV on ART are virally
suppressed. The Fast-Track approach also emphasizes the need to focus on the geographic
areas and communities most affected by HIV and recommends that resources be concentrated
on the programs with the greatest impact.

In this context, a shift toward investment thinking in the design of HIV responses is being
promoted by UNAIDS and cosponsors globally to maximize the impact of program investment
and best realize the long-term health and economic benefits of HIV programs. Investment
cases are being developed by a number of countries to understand HIV epidemics as well as to
design, deliver, and sustain effective HIV responses. The investment cases are complemented
with a human-rights-based approach to health care. In support of HIV investment cases, a
group of countries in the ECA Region conducted allocative efficiency (AE) analyses. In 2014–
15, AE analyses were carried out in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Republic of Kyrgyz,
Moldova, Ukraine and a number of countries outside the ECA Region (Fraser and others 2014).
This report summarizes the results of the analysis for policy makers, program leaders, and

The concept of allocative efficiency refers to the maximization of health outcomes using the
least costly mix of health interventions.2 HIV allocative efficiency studies generally try
toanswer the question “How can HIV funding be optimally allocated to the combination of HIV


2   Technically, AE can be accomplished either within a fixed budget envelope (maximal impact with given amount
    of money) or within defined impact targets (minimal cost to achieve a given impact).

    response interventions that will yield the highest impact?” This concept not only is critical for
    maximizing current and future impact but also is an integral element to transition to full
    domestic financing and a sustainable response. A response that is allocatively and technically
    efficient will be easier to sustain.

    There is wide consensus that better outcomes could be achieved in many settings with a given
    amount of HIV funding; or that given outcomes could be achieved with less HIV funding if
    resources were distributed optimally or if resources were used in the most efficient ways.

    1.2      Objectives of the analysis
    Kazakhstan has set out the priorities of its HIV response in its Concept of Development Services
    for HIV Prevention for the Period 2016–2020 (Kazakhstan MOH 2015). This document sets out
    five key objectives:

        To increase public awareness on how to prevent HIV infection
        To implement HIV prevention programs among the general population and key
         populations group at higher risk, such as PWID, SW, MSM, and prison inmates
        To prevent HIV transmission from mother to child
        To provide access to treatment, care, and support in accordance with international
         standards
        To monitor and evaluate, project, and plan sustainable responses.
    In its national HIV program, Kazakhstan proposes the following targets to be achieved by
    2020:
    a. Prevalence of HIV infection will be restricted to current levels so that the epidemic remains
        concentrated and overall prevalence in the population aged 15–49 years does not exceed
        0.2 percent–0.6 percent.
    b. The mortality rate among people living with HIV will be at 10 per 1,000 people living with
       HIV.
    c.   Transmission of HIV from mother to child will not exceed than 2 percent.
    d. Awareness of general population and young people about HIV transmission and
       prevention measures will reach 36 percent by 2016; and 40 percent by 2020.
    e.   Annual coverage of HIV testing at the country level will be 10 percent.
    f.   Coverage of PWID reached with preventive measures will be not less than 60 percent;
         coverage of SW reached with preventive measures will be not less than 80 percent; and
         coverage of MSM reached with preventive measures will be not less than 10 percent.
    g.   Safe sexual behavior will be accepted by key populations at higher risk: at least 90 percent
         of SW, at least 70 percent of MSM, and at least 50 percent of PWID.
    h. Safe injecting behavior will be accepted by a minimum of 50 percent of PWID.
    i.   ARV therapy (ART) will be provided to all individuals with HIV with CD4 count less than
         500.
    j.   HIV-infected adults and children, who, according to available information, continue
         receiving ART 12 months after its initiation will reach 70 percent.
    According to national estimates, the total tentative budget to reach these targets by 2020 is
    US$734 million.

    The national HIV program sets a number of additional coverage targets. Given the limited
    resources, additional prioritization based on in-depth AE analysis is required to redefine
Introduction                                                                                     3



program coverage targets for maximum impact with different scenarios of resource
availability, and to support additional operational planning and budgeting.

In this context, the government is developing HIV investment analyses, including the current
allocative efficiency study, that attempt to increase the effectiveness of HIV investments and
define corresponding priorities, strategies and impacts of the response. These analyses also
attempt to determine the future sources of HIV financing and how to most effectively allocate
the resources to be provided by the Global Fund. The analyses were conducted by a group of
international partners in close collaboration with Government of Kazakhstan, particularly with
the Republican AIDS Center and other governmental bodies.

The findings of the current study will assist the Government of Kazakhstan to further
strengthen its HIV investment case, as explained in the paragraph above. The national HIV AE
study was designed to answer three questions:

1. How can the country optimize the allocation of HIV funding for maximum health impacts?
2. How much will it cost to achieve the targets of the National HIV Strategy and long-term
   international commitments toward HIV goals?
3. What is the cost-effectiveness of optimized allocations for HIV??

    Over the past two decades, Kazakhstan’s health investment has fluctuated. The share of
    government spending on health ranged from 14.7 percent in 1997 to 7.4 percent in 2005
    (Figure 2.1). In 2012 government health expenditure was at 10.9 percent, just below the global
    average of 11.7 percent.

    government expenditure, 1995n health

    In absolute numbers, Kazakhstan’s health expenditure increased sharply from US$0.77 billion
    in 1997 to US$8.48 billion in 2012 (WHO 2014b). However, this increase corresponds to a
    large increase in GDP. In contrast, health spending remained relatively stable at approximately
    4 percent of GDP (Figure 2.2). In 2012, 58 percent of health spending was government
    expenditure. Forty-two percent was funded out of pocket, and nonprofit and private insurance
    funding remained below 1 percent of total health spending.

International assistance to Kazakhstan fluctuated over the past decade. It peaked in 2008 and
declined since then. In 2012, support for health and population (US$17.1 million) and HIV
(US$8.7 million) combined accounted for 16.7 percent of external support.

Kazakhstan’s HIV response is funded predominantly domestically, with over 80 percent of HIV
funding being provided by government. Another 20 percent of the HIV response is funded by
international partners (Figure 2.4). Within the international funding support provided to
Kazakhstan HIV response, the largest share (85.3 percent in 2012) was provided by the Global
Fund for HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The United States Government and other partners
provided additional complementary support.

    HIV accounts for 0.7 percent of years of life lost (YLLs) in Kazakhstan; and 0.5 percent of
    disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and HIV spending for 0.4 percent of total health
    expenditure (THE) in Kazakhstan (Figure 2.6). The latter suggests that, in the population
    overall, HIV accounts for only a small proportion of disease burden, but, as this study
    demonstrates (chapter 4), the burden is concentrated in key populations. Levels of HIV
    investment are in a similar range, but slightly below the proportion of disease burden
    attributable to HIV. Therefore, Kazakhstan’s overall level of HIV spending is in a range similar
    to that of other countries in the Region.

3.     METHODOLOGY: HOW WILL THIS REPORT
       ANSWER KEY QUESTIONS?
Chapter 3 outlines the main steps taken and tools applied to carry out the analyses presented
in this report. Additional detail is available in appendixes A, B, and C.

3.1    Optima Model
To carry out the analyses, the team used Optima, a mathematical model of HIV transmission
and disease progression integrated with an economic and program analysis framework.
Optima uses HIV epidemic modeling techniques and incorporates evidence on biological
transmission probabilities, detailed infection progression, sexual mixing patterns, and drug
injection behaviors. In consultation with in-country experts, Optima was calibrated to HIV
prevalence data points available from the different subpopulations (such as FSW, PWID, and
MSM), and to data points on the number of people on ART.

To assess how incremental changes in spending affect HIV epidemics and determine an
optimized funding allocation, the model parameterizes the relationships among the cost of
HIV intervention programs, the coverage level attained by these programs, and the resulting
outcomes. These relationships are specific to the country, population, and prevention
program being considered.

Using the relationships among cost, coverage, and outcome in combination with Optima’s
epidemic module, it is possible to calculate how incremental changes in the level of funding
allocated to each program will impact on overall epidemic outcomes. Furthermore, by using
a mathematical optimization algorithm, Optima is able to determine an optimized allocation
of funding across different HIV programs. Additional details about Optima are contained in
appendix A.

3.2    Analytical framework
The study was conceptualized by a Regional steering group comprising the Global Fund,
UNAIDS, UNDP, and convened by the World Bank. A national technical group convened by
UNAIDS in collaboration with the government was formed. Country-specific objectives of the
analysis and parameters were outlined in a Scope of Work document. Epidemiological,
program, and cost data were collected by in-country experts with technical support from
international partners using an adapted MS-Excel-based Optima data entry spreadsheet. In
November 2014, a Regional mathematical modeling workshop was conducted in Yerevan,
Armenia. National experts and specialists from international partners worked together with
mathematical modelers from UNSW to perform modeling analyses using the Matlab software
package. This Regional process also aimed at data comparison, exchange, quality assurance,
and development of capacities in HIV epidemic and response analysis using mathematical

     modeling techniques. Preliminary results were consulted with government experts and other
     in-country partners and summarized in this report.

     Optima is a flexible model that enables the user to decide which populations, programs, time
     frames, and funding levels to consider in a country analysis. Table 3.1 summarizes the main
     parameters, which were identified based on contextual, epidemiological, national strategic,
     program, and funding information and agreed with in-country stakeholders.

     Note: A comprehensive four-pronged approach to PMTCT includes additional elements such as provision of
     contraception. For the vast majority of women, the primary purpose of contraception in this concentrated
     epidemic setting is not PMTCT but pregnancy prevention. Therefore, it was decided not to include
     contraception costs in this analysis (apart from the cost for condom promotion for key populations covered
     in FSW, MSM, and PWID programs). The same logic applies to other related services.

Populations comprise key populations, which are defined around the dominant factor
influencing HIV acquisition, and general populations, which are disaggregated by age and
sex. Programs were divided into direct programs and indirect programs. Direct programs
have a direct effect on HIV incidence or deaths so could be included in the mathematical
optimization analysis. Within direct programs, some service packages target specific key
populations (FSW, MSM, PWID); others (HTC, ART, PMTCT) cut across all populations,
including key populations. Indirect programs are cross-cutting expenses or have indirect or
unclear effects on health outcomes so were not included in the mathematical optimization.

Costs per person reached––derived from coverage information and total spending on
programs––are presented in Table 3.2. These are not unit costs, and definitions of program
coverage vary among countries. In addition, Kazakhstan used a different approach than did
other ECA countries to account for the human resource expenses and management cost of
specific programs. In Kazakhstan, these costs were included in the general management cost.
Therefore, management costs were higher than in other countries, while program costs were
lower. For these reasons of different accounting (among others), in Kazakhstan, indirect
programs (management, enablers, synergies, other costs) accounted for 56 percent of HIV
expenditure reported. Kazakhstan’s cost for antiretroviral therapy (ART) was particularly
high in Regional comparison. As a result, specific analyses were conducted to assess the
effect of reducing ART cost.

Note: Table 3.2 reflects how costs were categorized by countries for this analysis. It is not based on detailed
matching of classification of inputs, but on how countries classified expenses using the detailed available
guidance for NASA and GARPR reports. Although this guidance is detailed and specific, differences cannot be
ruled out, particularly when it comes to cross-cutting costs such as HR costs. Moreover, even if costs are
classified consistently, the comprehensiveness of service packages may differ; a=Program management cost
and human resources not included in the program cost; b=Cost differs from the unit cost established in a
separate study, which included comprehensive service cost and which was US$2,492 per person per year,
that is, substantially higher (INSERM and UNAIDS 2015). However, this higher cost could not be used here
because, for optimization, the same approach should be used for different programs within the same
country. The differences among countries suggest the need for additional technical efficiency analysis;
c=Average cost per person reached (including first and subsequent lines of treatment).


3.3      Limitations of analysis
For this modeling analysis, as for any, understanding key assumptions and the related
limitations is important.

   Some gaps in data existed for both key populations and the general population. As in
    other models, estimates of HIV prevalence in the general population were derived from
    data of HIV in pregnant women as a proxy. Some of the available data (from IBBS and
    service delivery data from HTC sites) were limited by nonrandom sampling.
12                                                            Optimizing investments in Kazakhstan’s HIV response



         For this analysis, standard classification of cost data in line with National AIDS Spending
          Assessments (NASA) was used. However, differences in program packages among
          countries limited the comparability of findings.
         The analysis used past ratios of expenditure to coverage as a basis for determining
          program cost rather than unit costs from a costing of future programs. Using past cost
          and results has a number of advantages over using projected costs from plans and
          budgets, which ultimately are predictions of future cost. However, using past cost and
          results also has the disadvantage that there may be future increases or decreases in cost
          in relation to new approaches, implementation arrangements, or technologies.
         The modeling approach used to calculate relative cost effectiveness among programs
          includes assumptions concerning the impact of increases or decreases in funding for
          programs. These assumptions are based on unit costs and observed ecological
          relationships among outcomes of program coverage or risk behavior and the amount of
          money spent on programs in the past. These assumptions also anticipate some
          saturation in the possible effects of programs caused by increases in spending.3
         The analysis did not determine the technical efficiency of programs. Gains in technical
          efficiency would lead to different unit costs so would affect resource allocation.
         Modeling the optimization of allocative efficiencies critically depends on the availability
          of evidence-based estimated parameters of the effectiveness of individual interventions.
          Although these estimates were derived from a systematic global literature review,4 they
          may vary in specific countries and populations depending on various factors, particularly
          the levels of adherence to interventions. All programs and spending categories for which
          such parameters cannot be obtained, such as enablers and synergies, could not be
          included in the mathematical optimization. However, because they have important
          functions in the HIV response, they have been treated as fixed costs and, in certain
          scenarios, adjusted with specific justifications.
         Effects outside the HIV endpoints (such as non-health benefits of OST, effects of needle
          exchange on hepatitis, effects of condoms on contraception and STIs) are complex to
          consider. Given that the majority of OST benefits go beyond HIV outcomes, specific
          consideration was given to consider the non-HIV benefits of OST (appendix A). However,
          given the complexity of interactions among interventions and their non-HIV benefits,
          this approach was applied only for OST. Along the same lines, the model does not seek to
          quantify human rights; stigma and discrimination; or ethical, legal, or psychosocial
          implications. Nevertheless, the model acknowledges that these aspects are important to
          be considered.
         Different models may not always produce exactly the same projections as those
          produced by Optima. The analysts used the best possible data, the combined experience
          from model application in over 20 countries, and Regional comparison and validation of
          inputs through comparison among different sources including data from clinical records,
          surveillance, and research.




     3   Saturation of a program occurs when most persons who were easy to reach––for example, all PWID who were
         prepared to participate in needle syringe programs––have been reached. To reach the remaining persons not
         yet covered with a program was assumed to become increasingly more expensive because additional
         mobilization and support are required to reach and maintain hard-to-reach subpopulations.

4.       RESULTS AND THEIR INTERPRETATIONS
This chapter presents the findings of the analyses carried out, beginning with epidemic
analysis, then moves into optimization analysis and related cost-effectiveness analysis.

4.1      What is the status of the HIV epidemic in Kazakhstan?
Table 4.1 summarizes the key national data on the HIV epidemic. Table 4.1 illustrates the
rapid growth of the epidemic from 2000 to 2010, then the stabilizing of deaths and slowing
of the number of new diagnoses around 2010. HIV prevalence remains highest among PWID
and prison inmates.

Table 4.2 shows key estimates in Kazakhstan for 2014 from Optima. According to Optima
projections, the country had an estimated 18,000 PLHIV, 1,500 new infections, and 900
deaths. In relation to national data, the number of new infections was lower than the number
of new diagnoses. This finding can be explained by the projected epidemic trend, which,
based on the available prevalence data, was estimated to have declined between 2007 and
2014. The higher number of new diagnoses between 2010 and 2013 in the registered data
plausibly reflects the new infections during the mid-2000s, when the estimated annual new
infections exceeded 2,000 per year. The model-estimated number of AIDS-related deaths
exceeds the number of registered deaths. This pattern is similar to those found in other
countries in the ECA Region (and in Spectrum estimates in the Region) and likely is due to
the fact that a proportion of AIDS deaths are not recorded as such.5

4.2 What are the expected trends if current conditions are
maintained?
The following Optima projections assumed that current trends in transmission-related
behaviors will continue. As mentioned above, appendixes A and B describe the process and
some of the data used to generate these estimations and projections. Table 4.3 summarizes
HIV epidemic estimates for 2014 and 2020, and assumes that current conditions (behaviors
and service coverage as per latest available data) will be sustained over 2015–20.




5   The issue of differences in registered versus model-estimated mortality would warrant a separate
    epidemiological review in countries of the Region.

Note: These are modelled HIV estimates from Optima, and the numbers are not exactly the same as those
produced in Spectrum. All model estimates differ from service statistics, which include only new diagnoses
(reflecting past new infections) and registered AIDS-related deaths (which are a subset of all AIDS-related
deaths).

The projections suggest that, while overall HIV prevalence will stabilize as a percentage,
PLHIV numbers will grow proportionately with population growth. New infections and
deaths are projected to increase by 13 percent and 32 percent, respectively.

The model-predicted evolution of annual HIV incidence (2000–20) in each subpopulations is
shown in Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1 suggests that HIV transmission among PWID, who are
predominantly males, remains the single largest segment of transmission. Notably, the
annual number of new infections in this group peaked in the early 2000; declined thereafter;
and, according to Optima projections, will account for fewer than 50 percent of new
infections from 2015 to 2020. The model also projected that, by 2020, transmission among
MSM will account for 20 percent of new infections. Another approximately 20 percent of
new infections will occur through sexual transmission to females of reproductive age (15–
49)―commonly female partners of men from key populations. Transmission among female
sex workers and their clients accounts for less than 5 percent of new infections and is
projected to stay near the same level up to 2020.

     4.3 Optimizing resources toward moderate targets and
     national strategy targets using current unit costs by 2020
     This chapter summarizes results of optimization analysis using current unit costs. To
     provide nuanced results, this analysis was conducted for moderate and ambitious targets to
     understand differences in resource needs.

     4.3.1. What is the effect of maintaining current spending up to 2020?
     In Figure 4.2, Allocation A shows the actual 2013 spending on the range of HIV programs.
     Figure 4.2 Kazakhstan: Optimizing spending toward national ambitious targets to reduce HIV
     incidence and AIDS-related deaths to 50 percent of their 2014 levels by 2020 (Allocations A–E)

Results and their interpretations                                                                17



Compared to zero spending, current HIV spending in Kazakhstan is very substantially
impacting the HIV epidemic (Figure 4.3 to Figure 4.9, and Table 4.4). With no programs in
place, the HIV epidemic is projected to grow dramatically, and a projected 54,000 new
infections and 11,100 deaths would occur in 2015–20. If current spending and allocations
were sustained, the epidemic would grow only slowly so that, over the same period, 9,500
new infections and 6,500 deaths would occur. Nevertheless, current allocations and
spending would be insufficient to fully stabilize or reduce new infections and deaths in
Kazakhstan.

4.3.2. What is the effect of optimized spending at the current level of funding?
If only the current level of funding is available, Allocation B represents the optimized
spending allocation from 2015 to 2020 that would get as close as possible to the same
national targets. Figure 4.3 illustrates the health outcomes of implementing such an
allocation, and therefore shows how close this scenario comes to achieving the national
targets.

Optimized allocation of 2013 spending would imply increasing coverage of ART from 47
percent to 61 percent (CD4<500) and MSM programs from 8 percent to 15 percent.
Simultaneously, the current high levels of coverage of NSP for PWID and current (low)
coverage of OST would be sustained, and savings would be made on the other programs. The
model prioritized ART over HTC for two reasons: a large number of already diagnosed
PLHIV are not yet on ART, and HTC for key populations would continue to be provided
within the programs for these groups. MSM programs are prioritized because of the growing
number of new infections in this group. This choice does not mean that programs with
reduced allocations are not important. Prioritizing MSM programs simply suggests that, at
current levels of spending and current unit cost, more emphasis on ART and MSM would
increase the impact of the overall response. Compared to business as usual (current
allocations maintained over the same period), over 2015–20, the optimized allocation would
avert 6 percent of new infections and 22 percent of deaths.

Allocation C is very similar to Allocation B. However, Allocation C reduces resources to
“management and coordination” by 20 percent and redirects them to the direct HIV
programs considered in the optimization analysis. Saving 20 percent of management costs at
current levels of funding would enable both increasing ART and MSM program coverage; and
sustaining coverage of critical programs including NSP, HTC, FSW, and PMTCT (Table 4.4).
Saving 20 percent of management costs at current levels of funding and optimally allocating
the resources would avert 18 percent of new infections and 32 percent of deaths compared
to current allocations.

4.3.3. What is the amount needed and the optimized allocation to achieve
         moderate and ambitious national targets at current unit costs?
Allocation D represents the minimal annual spending required to achieve national strategy
targets. These targets were defined as no increase in new HIV infections; no increase in AIDS-
related deaths from 2014 levels by 2020; and the virtual elimination of MTCT. The estimated
minimal total annual spending to satisfy these targets is a 37 percent increase ($52.5 million
per year) above what was spent on HIV programs in Kazakhstan in 2014 ($37.8 million). The
team’s analyses suggest that, to fully achieve the national targets, increases in funding to
PWID condom programs and NSP, PMTCT, and ART programs are required.

Allocation E represents the minimal amount of annual spending required to completely
achieve a set of ambitious targets. For this analysis, these ambitious targets were defined to
18                                                       Optimizing investments in Kazakhstan’s HIV response



      reduce both new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths by 50 percent from 2014 levels by
      2020, and to eliminate MTCT. The estimated minimal total annual spending to satisfy these
      ambitious targets would be a 112 percent increase ($81.2 million per year) above what was
      spent on HIV programs in 2014 in Kazakhstan ($37.8 million). To achieve the ambitious
      targets, the team’s analysis suggests that additional spending increases to FSW and clients,
      MSM and PWID condom programs, NSP, OST, PMTCT, and ART programs are required.

      Figure 4.3 should be viewed in tandem with Figure 4.2. The bars presented in Figure 4.3
      show the projected national health outcomes in 2020 under each scenario in Figure 4.2. The
      first bar in each subfigure (2014) shows the estimated 2014 values of the respective health
      outcome indicator. The second bar (current spending) shows the effect of maintaining 2013
      levels of spending and the same allocations over 2015–20. This outcome differs from 2014
      values because of the upward trajectory of the epidemic. The bars that represent Allocation
      D––the minimal amount of money required to completely achieve national targets––
      illustrate that the allocation described in Figure 4.2 is estimated to lead to no increase in
      either new infections (sexual or injecting) or deaths from 2014 levels by 2020. Allocation B
      and Allocation C show that optimally redistributing current resources would reduce
      infections and deaths by 2020 compared to the projection of the scenario of Allocation A by
      2020, but not compared to 2014 levels. The bars that represent Allocation E show that the
      ambitious targets of reducing incidence and deaths by 50 percent from 2014 levels and
      eliminating MTCT are expected to be achieved by 2020. In line with global targets to
      eliminate MTCT, “Breastfed MTCT cases” and “Non-breastfed MTCT cases” are defined here
      as the proportion of HIV positive women who transmit HIV to their babies, disaggregated by
      their breastfeeding status.

Note: Table 4.4 details the allocations described in the previous chapters, and describes the associated coverages expected with such funding. Program coverages associated with
the described allocations are derived from the appropriate cost-coverage outcome curves. The analysis period for calculating cumulative program spending and cumulative new
HIV infections, AIDS-related deaths, and DALYs is from the beginning of 2015 to the end of 2020. The overall HIV prevalence and number of people living with HIV estimates are
taken from the end point of the analysis period (end-2020). The number of averted new infections, AIDS-related deaths, and DALYs for each scenario are calculated by
comparing against a baseline of zero spending. The cost per infection, death, or DALY averted then is simply the total program costs over the 2015–20 analysis period divided by
the number of infections, deaths, or DALYs averted, respectively; a=The fact that, for this level of spending, the model suggests 0 coverage of condom programs for PWID should
not be interpreted to mean that condom distribution to PWID should be stopped. The 0 coverage simply suggests that, given current unit costs and limited resources, this
program is not as cost effective as other programs. In practice, continued condom distribution to PWID using a cost-efficient approach would reflect the requirements of this HIV
epidemic characterized by substantial levels of sexual transmission of HIV from PWID to their partners; b=Pregnant women should continue to be covered with ART as part of
the increased ART budget. In practice, ART coverage also would require continued HIV testing and counselling for pregnant women.

     Achieving moderate targets at current program unit cost would cost US$51.8 million.
     Achieving ambitious targets would cost US$80.1 million, and therefore would require
     substantial increases in investment (Table 4.4).

     In each of these scenarios―except Allocation C―the proportion of annual spending to
     “management and other costs” is kept fixed. The breakdown in management cost is shown in
     Figure 4.10. Because 56 percent of 2013 HIV spending was allocated to indirect programs,
     including management and other costs, it also is important to explore in more depth the actual
     breakdown of these costs. The two single largest subcategories of management and other costs
     were actual administration, management, and coordination (including human resources); and
     infrastructure. Infrastructure costs relate primarily to AIDS centers, Trust Points, and Friendly
     Clinics, through which HIV services and counselling are provided. As mentioned, costs for
     indirect programs are not included in the mathematical optimization because their effects on
     HIV incidence, deaths, or DALYs is either indirect, cross-cutting, or not quantifiable. The fact
     that these costs were not part of mathematical optimization does not mean that they are less
     important, but it also does not mean that there is no potential for improving efficiency.
     Because 56 percent of HIV funding is not spent

     efficiency gains could be found in that 56 percent.

4.4 How much would it cost to achieve moderate and
ambitious national targets with reduced ART cost?
Achieving national targets would require large increases in resources (section 4.3). Regional
cost comparison in seven countries suggests that Kazakhstan had the highest cost per person
reached with ART in the Region. Therefore, it was considered relevant to explore how the
analysis would change if ART cost could be reduced. Regional comparison of procurement
costs suggests that more competitive or international procurement of antiretrovirals (ARVs)
and diagnostics such as viral load tests could lower costs by two-thirds. A 67 percent reduction
in ART unit cost would imply a reduction from US$2,279 to US$760 per person reached by
ART per year. Even with such a substantial reduction, ART cost would remain within the range
of costs reported by other countries. The reduced cost would range from the lowest cost
reported in 7 countries (US$576 per person year of ART) to the median cost (US$1,127).

An analysis was conducted to determine the minimal annual spending required to achieve the
national and ambitious targets previously described in these scenarios should the future unit
cost of ART be reduced by a factor of 3. Twenty percent efficiencies in “management and
coordination” activities were also simulated.

Should the unit cost of ART be reduced by a factor of
3, the minimal annual spending required to achieve                  KEY MESSAGE
the moderate national targets was estimated at just        By reducing ART cost to 30 percent
below US$30 million, that is, lower than the 2013          of current cost and reducing
spending (US$37.8 million). In line with targets set,      management cost by 20 percent,
this allocation would only stabilize HIV incidence         Kazakhstan could achieve ambitious
and moderately reduce deaths. Interestingly, as            targets or reduce HIV incidence and
shown in Figure 4.11, if the cost of ART were reduced      deaths by 50 percent by 2020.
by a factor of 3 and funding were distributed
optimally, nearly the same amount that was available in 2013 (US$37.7 million) would be
sufficient to achieve the ambitious targets of a 50 percent reduction in incidence and deaths by
2020 compared to 2014 levels. In this allocation (Allocation C), ART coverage (CD4<500)
increases from 47 percent to over 90 percent. Savings on ART and management costs enable
prioritizing FSW, MSM, and PWID condom programs as well as OST and PMTCT programs.
Under this scenario, funding to ART, NSP, and HTC programs is similar to current levels. The
estimated impact of such a scenario (Figure 4.12) provides a strong argument to advocate for
cheaper ART procurement, efficiency gains in “management and coordination” activities, and
the optimized distribution of funding. Optimally allocating resources accompanied by an ART
cost reduced by two-thirds would achieve the targets of reducing new infections and deaths by 50
percent compared to 2014. Compared to maintaining current allocations up to 2020, this
optimized allocation with reduced ART cost would avert 5,300 new infections and 4,200 deaths,
or 56 percent of new infections and 65 percent of deaths.6




6   Reductions compared to 2014 levels differ slightly from reductions compared to current allocations maintained
    from 2015 to 2020. The latter include the moderate increases in new infections and deaths that are estimated to
    occur over 2015–20. This is the reason that these reductions are slightly higher than reductions compared to
    2014 levels.

     4.5     Impact of funding to opioid substitution therapy programs
     The potential impacts of scaling down and scaling up OST programs also were simulated
     (Figure 4.13). In one scenario, OST programs were defunded. In another scenario, funding to
     OST programs was increased to US$2 million a year.

     The health and economic outcomes of such allocations are summarized in Table 4.6, which
     details the allocations described in this section and describes the associated effects.

     An additional investment of US$2 million would take OST coverage from 0.2 percent to 4
     percent. Although a 20-fold increase, this coverage is low compared to high coverage levels
     achieved in other regions of the world. This level of investment in OST would avert 700 new
     infections, 100 deaths, and 32,400 DALYs cumulatively by 2030. The costs per death, new
     infection, and DALY averted are calculated as compared to current level of spending, not to
     zero spending. Therefore, these costs are higher and not comparable to the costs calculated in
     other parts of the report, which all compare to zero spending.

4.6      Efficiency gains from optimized allocations
The cost effectiveness calculations discussed in this section compare to a baseline of zero
spending from 2015 and build on data presented in sections 4.3 and 4.4.

In the zero spending scenario, an estimated 53,500 cumulative new HIV infections and 11,100
cumulative AIDS-related deaths would occur over 2015–20 in Kazakhstan (Table 4.7). Under
this scenario, the epidemic is projected to explode so that an estimated 305,000 cumulative
new HIV infections and 89,600 cumulative AIDS-related deaths would occur from 2015 to
2030.

Under a scenario of maintaining current spending and distribution to programs, an estimated
44,100 of the 53,500 new infections could be averted by 2020; and 4,600 of the 11,100 AIDS-
related deaths could be averted. By 2030, maintaining current spending could avert 277,600 of
the 305,200 new infections and 70,900 of the 89,600 AIDS-related deaths.
If current funding is maintained, program costs over 2015–20 would total US$277 million. This
total implies that the cost per infection averted in the maintaining current spending scenario
would be US$2,300, and the cost per death averted would be US$22,100. When the longer
30                                                         Optimizing investments in Kazakhstan’s HIV response



     2015–30 time frame is considered, compared to the baseline scenario of zero spending (a
     counterfactual that assumes that there is no public spending on HIV programs), the cost per
     infection averted would be $1,000 and the cost per AIDS-related death averted would be
     $3,900.

     By increasing the national budget by 37 percent to $52.5 million per year and spending
     optimally to achieve national strategic targets (Allocation D, Figure 4.2), 46,900 new infections
     and 7,200 AIDS-related deaths could be averted by 2020 compared to the zero-spend baseline.
     These epidemiological outcomes of Allocation D equate to an additional 2,800 new infections
     and, significantly, 2,600 AIDS-related deaths averted by 2020 compared to the maintaining
     current spending projection. By 2030, optimally redistributing current funding levels toward
     the national strategic targets can avert an estimated 288,500 new infections and 79,200
     deaths, which equal 11,000 infections and 8,300 deaths fewer than the maintaining current
     spending scenario.

     The cost per infection averted by 2020 by optimally allocating toward national targets is
     $2,900, and the cost per death averted is $19,000. The cost per AIDS-related death averted in
     this scenario is $3,100 less than in the scenario of maintaining current spending.

     Under the scenario in which the cost of ART procurement is reduced by a factor of 3, the
     minimal spending required to achieve the same national strategic targets would be less than
     the current budget (section 4.4). Furthermore, should 20 percent efficiencies in “management
     and costs” activities be achieved and funds be distributed in an optimized way, the total
     spending required to achieve a set of ambitious targets also would be possible within the
     current budget. By optimally allocating funds to achieve these ambitious targets under the
     described assumptions of ART procurement (Allocation C, Figure 4.11), the cost per infection
     averted by 2020 would be $4,000 and the cost per AIDS-related death averted would be
     $22,400. When coupled with the estimate that this allocation would achieve 50 percent
     reductions in infections and deaths by 2020 relative to 2014 levels (Figure 4.12), the
     implication is that HIV investments remain highly cost effective compared to zero spending.
     Table 4.7 also illustrates that, compared to zero spending, current spending is already cost
     effective.

5.     CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The following are key recommendations from this study to policy makers and planners in
Kazakhstan.



1
       In Kazakhstan’s concentrated HIV epidemic, there is continued need to focus
       analysis, planning, and implementation on key populations, particularly people
       who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, prison inmates, female sex
workers, and their clients. Under current conditions (constant behaviors and program
coverage), new HIV infections are projected to rise by 13 percent and deaths by 32 percent
between 2014 and 2020. The epidemics among PWID and MSM are projected to account for
two-thirds of new HIV infections and must be core foci of programs. Prevention, HTC, and
treatment need to be targeted primarily toward these two groups while continuing to provide
services to other key populations.



2
      Kazakhstan’s current investments already are making a great difference in
      slowing the spread of the HIV epidemic, and the level of investment needs to be
      sustained. With no programs in place, the HIV epidemic would grow dramatically and a
projected 54,000 new infections and 11,100 deaths would occur from 2015 to 2020. Given
current spending and allocations, the epidemic would grow slowly, and 9,500 new infections
and 6,500 deaths would occur over 2015–20. Nevertheless, at current unit cost and with
current allocations, the current level of HIV spending would not be sufficient to stabilize and
reduce new infections and deaths in Kazakhstan.



3
       By optimizing current allocations to HIV programs, Kazakhstan could reduce new
       infections and deaths. Optimized allocation of US$37.8 million (2013 spending) would
       avert 6 percent of new infections and 22 percent of deaths over 2015–20 compared
to business as usual (current allocations maintained during same period). Optimized allocation
of 2013 spending would imply increasing coverage of ART from 47 percent to 61 percent
(CD4<500) and of MSM programs from 8 percent to 15 percent. Simultaneously, the current
high levels of coverage of NSP for PWID and current coverage of OST would be sustained, and
savings in the other programs would be made.



4
      With additional savings on management costs, Kazakhstan could substantially
      further increase the impact of the national HIV response. With the same amount of
      money available as in 2013, saving 20 percent of management costs at current levels of
funding and allocating the resources optimally would avert 18 percent of new infections and
32 percent of deaths, compared to current allocations.



5
      At current unit costs of programs, achieving the national HIV prevention and
      treatment targets would require substantial additional investment. To achieve the
      national targets (no increase in HIV incidence and deaths) would cost US$51.8 million




                                              31
32                                                             Optimizing investments in Kazakhstan’s HIV response



     per year―33 percent more than current spending. Achieving the more ambitious targets
     (reducing new infections and deaths by 50 percent) would cost US$80.1 million, thus requiring
     substantially increased investment.



     6
           Reducing the unit cost of ART while scaling up ART to high coverage levels are the
           key elements required to achieve the national targets at current spending levels.
           Unit cost for ART in Kazakhstan has been high compared to other countries in the region
     and the effect of a reduction of unit costs by 67 percent (from US$2,280 to US$760 per person
     reached per year) was explored. Even with such a substantial reduction, ART cost still would
     be within the range of costs reported by other countries in the Region. When combined with a
     20 percent reduction of management cost and optimized allocation of funds, it would be
     possible to achieve a 50 percent in both HIV incidence and deaths with an annual investment
     of US$37.7 million––approximately the 2013 funding levels. This optimized allocation with
     reduced ART cost would avert 5,300 new infections and 4,200 deaths. Optimization also would
     enable almost doubling ART coverage from 47 percent of PLHIV (CD4<500) to over 90 percent
     of PLHIV (CD4<500).



     7
           Addressing the HIV epidemic and wider health needs of people who inject drugs
           remains a critical priority for Kazakhstan. Needle and syringe exchange programs
           should be sustained with at least 50 percent coverage and further scaled up in the
     context of comprehensive harm-reduction programs. Opioid substitution therapy has
     important effects on HIV prevention and ART adherence and should be provided at
     substantially larger scale. Increasing the proportion of PWID on OST from 0.2 percent to 4
     percent would avert 700 new infections, 100 deaths, and over 32,000 DALYs from 2015 to
     2030. These findings are in line with a recent analysis of cost-effectiveness of HIV and HCV
     programs in Kazakhstan. The analysis showed that reductions in HIV and HCV epidemics over
     the next 15 years would not be feasible without raising the coverage of NSP, OST, access to
     ART, and HIV diagnosis (INSERM and UNAIDS 2015). Because the health and social benefits of
     OST extend far beyond HIV, substantial additional funding from outside the HIV response
     should be provided for OST. In addition, a technical efficiency analysis could be conducted how
     to make OST programs more cost effective.



     8
            To address the growing MSM epidemic, MSM programs need to increase coverage.
            By 2020, MSM are projected to account for approximately 20 percent of new HIV
            infections. Under current allocations, program coverage would remain low at 8 percent,
     but it should increase substantially to at least 20 percent. This increase will require making
     pragmatic outreach approaches through informal networks while continuing current efforts to
     reduce stigma and discrimination, so that more ambitious targets can be set in future.



     9
            A reduction in management cost of approximately 20 percent could be explored
            further in a rapid technical efficiency analysis. Kazakhstan reported management and
            other cost as 56 percent of total HIV spending. This percentage includes infrastructure
     cost and can be partially explained by the inclusion of management cost of specific programs.
     However, the large share of this expenditure category, which could not be included in
     optimization analysis, justifies further technical efficiency review.



     10
                  Domestic investment in Kazakhstan’s HIV programs will be critical to
                  sustain the response, including programs previously covered by the Global
                  Fund, after the country graduates from Global Fund support in 2016.7 If
     Kazakhstan can sustain the current total level of HIV funding and if the proposed technical
     efficiency gains can be realized, the country’s 2013 level of HIV investment will remain

     7   The Global Fund is phasing out support for upper-middle income countries such as Kazakhstan.
Conclusions and recommendations                                                                   33



sufficient to achieve the ambitious targets of reducing HIV incidence by 50 percent. If ARV
costs cannot be reduced, it is necessary to increase HIV investment accordingly. This reduction
is justified also by the fact that current levels of HIV spending as a share of total health
spending is below the contribution of HIV disease burden to the overall disease burden.
Furthermore, domestic investment, which can avert 5,300 new infections within 6 years
(2015–20) will reduce future health care costs and thereby make achievement of the 2020
national HIV targets an investment with long-term benefits.

APPENDIXES
APPENDIX A.                TECHNICAL SUMMARY OF OPTIMA
Appendix A provides a brief technical overview of Optima. A more detailed summary of the
model and methods is provided elsewhere (Kerr and others 2015). Optima is based on a
dynamic, population-based HIV model. Figure A.1a summarizes the populations and mixing
patterns used in Optima. Figure A.1b shows the disease progression implemented in the
model. Optima tracks the entire population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) across 5 stages
of CD4 count. These CD4 count stages are aligned with the progression of the World Health
Organization (WHO) treatment guidelines, namely, acute HIV infection, >500, 350–500, 200–
350, 50–200, and 50 cells per microliter. Key aspects of the antiretroviral therapy (ART)
service delivery cascade are included: from infection to diagnosis, ART initiation on first-line
therapy, treatment failure, subsequent lines of therapy, and HIV/AIDS-related or other death.

The model uses a linked system of ordinary differential equations to track the movement of
PLHIV among HIV health states. The full set of equations is provided in the supplementary
material to a summary paper on the Optima model. The overall population is partitioned in
two ways: by population group and by HIV health state. Individuals are assigned to a given
population group based on their dominant risk.8 HIV infections occur through the interactions
among different populations by regular, casual, or commercial (including transactional) sexual
partnerships; through sharing of injecting equipment; or through mother-to-child
transmission. The force-of-infection is the rate at which uninfected individuals become
infected. The rate depends on the number and type of risk events to which individuals are
exposed in a given period (either within their population groups or through interaction with
other population groups) and the infection probability of each event. Mathematically, the force
of- infection has the general form:



where λ is the force-of-infection, β is the transmission probability of each event, and n is the
effective number of at-risk events (that is, n gives the average number of interaction events
with HIV-infected people through which HIV transmission may occur). The value of the

8   However, to capture important cross-modal types of transmission, relevant behavioral parameters can be set to
    non-zero values (for example, males who inject drugs may engage in commercial sex; some MSM may have
    female sexual partners).


                                                       35
36                                                                  Optimizing investments in Kazakhstan’s HIV response



     transmission probability β varies across CD4 count compartments (indirectly reflecting the
     high viral load at early and late stages of infection); differs for different modes of transmission
     (intravenous drug injection with a contaminated needle-syringe, penile-vaginal or penile-anal
     intercourse, and mother-to-child); and may be reduced by behavioral interventions (for
     example, condom use), biological interventions (for example, male circumcision), or ART.
     There is one force-of-infection term for each type of interaction, for example, casual sexual
     relationships between male sex workers and female sex workers (FSW). The force-of-infection
     for a given population will be the sum of all interaction types.9 In addition to the force-of-
     infection rate, which is the number of individuals who become infected with HIV per year,
     there are seven other ways by which individuals can change health states.10 The change in the
     number of people in each compartment is determined by the sum over the relevant rates
     described above multiplied by the population size of the compartments on which they act.11




     9    For sexual transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
             HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in partner populations
             Average number of casual, regular, and commercial homosexual and heterosexual acts per person per year
             Proportion of these acts in which condoms are used
             Proportion of men who are circumcised
             Prevalence of sexually transmissible infections (which can increase HIV transmission probability)
             Proportion of acts that are covered by pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis
             Proportion of partners on antiretroviral treatment (art)
             Efficacies of condoms, male circumcision, post-exposure prophylaxis, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and art at
              preventing HIV transmission.
          For injecting-related transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
             HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in populations of people who use a syringe and then share it
             Number of injections per person per year
             Proportion of injections made with shared equipment
             Fraction of people who inject drugs on opioid substitution therapy and its efficacy in reducing injecting
              behavior.
          For mother-to-child transmission, the number of-infections is determined by:
             Birth rate among women living with HIV
             Proportion of women with HIV who breastfeed
             Probability of perinatal HIV transmission in the absence of intervention
             Proportion of women receiving prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), including ART.
     10   First, individuals may die, either because of an average background death rate for that population (which is
          greater for older populations or for people who inject drugs) or because of HIV/AIDS (which depends on CD4
          count). Second, in the absence of treatment, individuals progress from higher to lower CD4 counts. Third,
          individuals can move from undiagnosed to diagnosed states based on their HIV testing rate, which depends on
          CD4 count (for example, people with AIDS symptoms or primary HIV infection may have a higher testing rate)
          and population type (for example, FSW may test more frequently than males in the general population). Fourth,
          diagnosed individuals may commence ART at a rate depending on CD4 count. Fifth, individuals may experience
          treatment failure due to lack of adherence to therapy or development of drug resistance. Sixth, people may
          initiate second and subsequent lines of treatment after treatment failure. Finally, while on successful first- or
          second-line treatment (that is, effective viral suppressive therapy), individuals may progress from lower to
          higher CD4 counts.
     11   For example, the change in the number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–350
          cells per microliter is:




          where UFSW2002350 is the current number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–
          350 cells per microliter; UFSW3502500 is the same population but with higher CD4 count (350–500 cells/mL); t
          is the disease progression rate for the given CD4 count (where 1/t is the average time to lose 150 CD4 cells/mL);
          m is the death rate; and h is the HIV testing rate. (Note: This example does not consider movement among
          populations, such as FSW returning to the general female population and vice versa—something which is
          included in Optima.)

     Each compartment (Figure A.1b, boxes) corresponds to a single differential equation in the
     model, and each rate (Figure A.1b, arrows) corresponds to a single term in that equation. Table
     A.1 lists the parameters used in Optima; most of these are used to calculate the force of
     infection. The analysts interpret empirical estimates for model parameter values in Bayesian
     terms as previous distributions. The model then must be calibrated: finding posterior
     distributions of the model parameter values so+ that the model generates accurate estimates
     of HIV prevalence, the number of people on treatment, and any other epidemiological data that
     are available (such as HIV-related deaths). The calibration can be performed automatically,
     manually, or a combination. Model calibration and validation normally should be performed in
     consultation with governments in the countries in which the model is being applied.

     HIV Resource Optimization and Program Coverage Targets
     A novel component of Optima is its ability to calculate allocations of resources that optimally
     address one or more HIV-related objectives (for example, impact-level targets in a country’s
     HIV national strategic plan). Because this model also calculates the coverage levels required to
     achieve these targets, Optima can be used to inform HIV strategic planning and the
     determination of program coverage levels. The key assumptions of resource optimization are
     the relationships among (1) the cost of HIV programs for specific target populations, (2) the
     resulting coverage levels of targeted populations with these HIV programs, and (3) how these
     coverage levels of HIV programs for targeted populations influence behavioral and clinical
     outcomes. Such relationships are required to understand how incremental changes in
     spending (marginal costs) affect HIV epidemics.12 Logistic functions can incorporate initial
     start-up costs and enable changes in behavior to saturate at high spending levels, thus better
     reflecting program reality. The logistic function has the form:




     where L(x) relates spending to coverage; x is the amount of funding for the program; A is the
     lower asymptote value (adjusted to match the value of L when there is no spending on a
     program); B is the upper asymptote value (for very high spending); C is the midpoint; and D is
     the steepness of the transition from A to B. For its fits, the team typically chose saturation
     values of the coverage to match behavioral data in countries with heavily funded HIV
     responses.13 To perform the optimization, Optima uses a global parameter search algorithm
     called Bayesian adaptive locally linear stochastic descent (BALLSD). BALLSD is similar to
     simulated annealing in that it makes stochastic downhill steps in parameter space from an
     initial starting point. However, unlike simulated annealing, BALLSD chooses future step sizes
     and directions based on the outcome of previous steps. For certain classes of optimization
     problems, the team has shown that BALLSD can determine optimized solutions with fewer


     12   A traditional approach is to apply unit cost values to inform a linear relationship between money spent and
          coverage attained. This assumption is reasonable for programs such as an established ART program that no
          longer incurs start-up or initiation costs. However, the assumption is less appropriate for condom promotion and
          behavior change communication programs. Most HIV programs typically have initial setup costs, followed by a
          more effective scale-up with increased funding. However, very high coverage levels have saturation effects
          because these high levels require increased incremental costs due to generating demand and related activities for
          the most difficult-to-reach groups. Optima uses a logistic function fitted to available input data to model cost–
          coverage curves (Appendix 2).
     13   Program coverage for zero spending, or behavioral outcomes for zero coverage of formal programs, is inferred
          using data from early on in the epidemic or just before significant investment in HIV programs. Practically, the
          team also discussed the zero and high spending cases with local experts, who could advise on private sector HIV
          service delivery outside the governments’ expenditure tracking systems. For each HIV program, the team derived
          one set of logistic curves that related funding to program coverage levels and another set of curves (generally,
          linear relationships) that related coverage levels to clinical or behavioral outcomes (the impacts that HIV
          strategies aim to achieve).

function evaluations than traditional optimization methods, including gradient descent and
simulated annealing.

While all HIV interventions have some direct or indirect non-HIV benefits, some programs
including opiate substitution therapy (OST) or conditional cash transfers, have multiple
substantial proven benefits across different sectors. Such additional benefits were reflected by
using the approach of a cross-sectoral financing model to effectively distribute the costs in
accordance with the benefits. By adapting standard techniques from welfare economics to
attribute the benefits of OST programs across the benefiting sectors, it was estimated that
average HIV-related benefits are approximately only 10 percent of the overall health and social
benefits of OST. Therefore, only 10 percent of the OST cost was included in the optimization
analysis.

Uncertainty Analyses
Optima uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for performing automatic
calibration and for computing uncertainties in the model fit to epidemiological data. With this
algorithm, the model is run many times (typically, 1,000–10,000) to generate a range of
epidemic projections. Their differences represent uncertainty in the expected epidemiological
trajectories. The most important assumptions in the optimization analysis are associated with
the cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves. To incorporate uncertainty in these curves,
users define upper and lower limits for both coverage and behavior for no spending and for
very high spending.14




14   All available historical spending data and achieved outcomes of spending, data from comparable settings,
     experience, and extensive discussion with stakeholders in the country of application can be used to inform these
     ranges. All logistic curves within these ranges then are allowable and are incorporated in Optima uncertainty
     analyses. These cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves thus are reconciled with the epidemiological,
     behavioral, and biological data in a Bayesian optimal way, thereby enabling the calculation of unified uncertainty
     estimates.

The calibration to HIV prevalence data points is shown in Figure B.1 and the calibration to data
points on the number of people on ART is shown in Figure B.2. These calibrations were
produced in collaboration with Kazakhstan experts.

APPENDIX C.               COST-COVERAGE-OUTCOME CURVES
The relationship between program spending and coverage is shown in subfigure C.1.a. This
relationship describes the level of output (availability of a service to a specific proportion of
the target population) achieved with a specific level of financial input (cost in US$). For
example, this relationship would describe how many female sex workers could be provided
with a standard package of services with an investment of US$0–US$1,000,000. The
relationship between coverage levels and outcomes is shown in subfigure C.1.b. This
relationship describes the proportion of people who will adopt a specific behavior (such as
condom use or consistent use of ARVs leading to viral suppression). These relationships were
produced in collaboration with Kazakhstan experts.

Appendix D includes additional charts that were not included in the main report but that may
be relevant for some readers.

To investigate whether allocations would be different with a longer time frame, some key
analyses were repeated using 2030 as the time frame for investment and tracking impact.
These results appear in Figure D.2 and Figure D.3.

These figures show the optimized allocations for the same targets as analyzed in section 4.3.1,
but for 2015–30. The allocations presented in Figure D.2 and Figure D.3 are the same as those
in Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3, although they are analyzed for the longer time frame (2015–30,
rather than 2015–20). The results are similar to those obtained for 2015–20. However, the
results for the longer time frame show a slight emphasis toward prevention programs and
away from treatment programs, particularly when limited funding is available. This emphasis
is not surprising because preventing an infection in the short term means that resources will
not have to be used to treat such an individual in the longer term.

                        improving implementation efficiency means identifying better delivery
                        solutions. Doing so requires improving planning, designing service delivery
                        models, and assessing and addressing service delivery “roadblocks.”
