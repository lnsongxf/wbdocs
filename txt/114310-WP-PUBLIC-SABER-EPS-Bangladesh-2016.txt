 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
    Teacher standards are set by the central government, which also has authority over class sizes and delivery
    of the curriculum. Schools have autonomy over appointment, deployment, and dismissal of teachers, as well
    as teacher salaries.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
    The government sets standards for what students need to learn each year and for each class. Each year’s
    program is set and needs to be followed by each school. Standardized exams are administered to selected
    grades annually; however, results are not disaggregated. Policy dictates that schools be inspected and the
    term of inspection depends on the results of previous inspections.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
    Parents are provided with regular information on standardized exams and the results of inspections.
    However, neither students nor parents are surveyed as part of the inspection process.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    Private independent schools set fees subject to government review. The government allows all of the
    following provider types to operate a school: community, not for profit, faith based, and for profit.
    Certification standards on land, facilities, and assets prevent new providers from entering the market.

    of previous inspections. The government also requires schools to report on the use of public funds.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
    Only ad-hoc information is provided to parents on standardized exams and inspections, and neither
    students nor parents are surveyed as part of the inspection process. Schools are not allowed to select
    students and are required to conduct a lottery if a school is over-subscribed.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    The government allows all of the following provider types to operate a school: community, not for profit, faith

    schools.

The four policy goals enable a government to increase

critical actors in an education system (figure 2).
Empowering parents, students, and communities
enhances the ability of parents to express their voice and
hold policymakers accountable for results. Additionally,
when parents are empowered, in most contexts, they
can have greater influence over provider behaviors.
Increasing school accountability strengthens the quality-
and equity-assurance mechanisms between the state
and education providers. Encouraging innovation and
promoting diversity of supply can allow providers to
respond to local needs. Increasing school-level
autonomy in critical decisions improves the services
provided to students. Allowing a diverse set of providers
to enter the market can increase client power and enable
citizens to choose from a wider range of models. By

SABER-EPS recognizes that the four policy goals outlined
in box 1 can assist governments in raising accountability
for the education services provided in their countries.
The tool allows governments to systematically evaluate
their policies and implement practices that are effective
across multiple country contexts.

Four types of private provision of education
Across the world, governments can implement
numerous strategies to improve educational outcomes
by supporting non-state education provision. SABER-EPS
benchmarks key policy goals across the four most
common models of private service delivery:
    1. Independent private schools: schools that are
       owned and operated by non-government
       providers and are financed privately, typically
       through fees.
    2. Government-funded private schools: schools
       that are owned and operated by non-
       government providers, but receive government
       funding.
    3. Privately managed schools: schools that are
       owned and financed by the government, but
       are operated by non-government providers.
    4. Voucher schools: schools that students choose
       to attend with government-provided funding;
       these schools can be operated by the

Mirroring the stable public expenditure at the primary
level, Bangladesh has had stable net enrolment at the
primary level in recent years. Between 2005 and 2010,
approximately 91 percent of primary-age children were
enrolled in primary school. However, enrolment at the
secondary level remains low, notwithstanding an
increase from 42 percent to 46 percent between 2005
and 2010 (figure 5).

In a regional comparison, Bangladesh rates poorly in
terms of average years of schooling for each quintile
(figure 9). However, in terms of the equity of schooling,
Bangladesh comes only after Nepal: the difference in the
average years of schooling between the poorest and
wealthiest quintile is 3.2 years in Nepal, 3.4 years in
Bangladesh, 3.8 years in India, and 4.2 years in Pakistan
(figure 9).

In some areas, the government has delegated its control
over education provision. According to Article 3-1 of the
Bangladesh Gazette, Part VI, dated the 6th December
1979, both private independent and government-funded
private schools retain the principal authority to appoint
and deploy teachers, as well as to affect their eventual
dismissal. In terms of teacher salary levels, the
Registration of Private Schools Ordinance, 1962; Section
4 (2b) states that the school has authority in this matter
in both independent private and government-funded
private schools.
According to Articles 15 and 16 of the School-1, Section
S.R.O. No-263 from the Law of 2011, the government
determines maximum class size and every non-

Similarly, at the secondary level, where a vast majority of
schools are government-funded private institutions, the
government could consider providing increased funding
to schools that maintain higher retention rates as well as
pass rates on both the secondary school certificate and
higher secondary certificate. The government could also
consider expanding SEQAEP to additional upazilas, as
recommended under policy option 2.1.


Country examples
In Jordan, the education system has undergone a
number of reforms, one of which has been the
establishment of clear student learning standards. The
Ministry of Education in Jordan states that education
must promote high levels of student success, measured
by performance indicators meant to bolster learning
outcomes (Jordan-Ministry of Education 2006). Between
1999 and 2007, Jordan experienced a sustained period of
improvement in student scores on the international
TIMSS exam.

In Namibia, following an evaluation of the adequacy of
the education and training system in supporting national
development goals, new learning standards were put in
place to define the core knowledge and skills to be
acquired at the end of each school phase. The knowledge
and skills were explicitly chosen to support Namibia’s
goal of being a knowledge based economy by 2030
(Namibia-Ministry of Education 2007).

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative collects data on the policies and institutions of education
       systems around the world and benchmarks them against practices
       associated with student learning. SABER aims to give all parties
       with a stake in educational results—from students, administrators,
       teachers, and parents to policymakers and business people—an
       accessible, detailed, objective snapshot of how well the policies of
       their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
       all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of engaging
       the private sector in education.
