Modeling the Long-Term Health and Cost
Impacts of Reducing Smoking Prevalence
through Tobacco Taxation in Ukraine


Introduction

Smoking is a leading cause of preventable premature deaths. Smoking’s
effects will continue to devastate lives in many countries, including Ukraine, if
measures are not implemented to reduce its prevalence. Smoking is a major
cause of many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory
disease, and smoking-related cancers.

Over recent years, successful tobacco control policies in Ukraine have resulted
in one of the fastest declines in smoking prevalence in the world (1). This is
largely due to multifaceted tobacco control legislation, adopted from 2005
and subsequently upgraded.

Ukraine ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in
2006. Currently, Ukrainian legislation basically corresponds to FCTC requirements.
In 2005, Ukraine adopted a first tobacco-control law. Since then, several
additional tobacco-control policies have been implemented in the country.

Smoke-free policies supported by media campaigns have covered many
workplaces and public places since the middle of 2006. Under these policies,
at least 50 percent of the area of restaurants and bars had to be isolated from
the smoking area, so that tobacco smoke did not penetrate into smoke-free
areas. This measure was supported by an intensive media campaign and
public movement in favor of smoke-free policies. Many restaurants went
completely smoke-free both before and after implementing this measure. As
of December 2012, restaurants, workplaces, and other public places became
100 percent smoke-free. Designated smoking places, which figured in the
legislation between 2006 and 2012, were abolished in the amended laws.
As of late 2006, cigarette packs carried textual warning labels covering 30
percent of their surface, in place of a previous warning which covered 10
percent of the front surface and stated: “Ministry of Health warns: Smoking
is bad for your health.” Since October 4, 2012, large (50 percent of the pack
surface area), graphic health-warning labels on tobacco packaging have
been introduced.

A ban on outdoor tobacco advertising since January 2009 was followed by a
more comprehensive tobacco advertising ban, which entered into force on
September 16, 2012.
                                                                                    3
    In addition to the reduced tobacco affordability observed during the global
    economic recession, the average tax incidence was increased between August
    2008 and July 2010 from 0.5 UAH (Ukrainian hryvnia, the national currency
    of Ukraine) to 3 UAH per cigarette pack. Further changes in tobacco tax rates
    were less substantial and were above inflation only in some years.
    However, while the policies described were definitely beneficial, much
    progress remains to be made. As of late 2015, the prevalence of current
    smoking among men in Ukraine was 45 percent (2, 3), although prevalence is
    much lower in women, at 11 percent (2, 3).

    It is not a given that smoking trends will continue to decrease in Ukraine,
    unless effective tobacco control measures are sustained and strengthened.
    Especially when the economy grows, commodities/luxuries such as smoking
    will become more affordable.

    Tobacco industry tactics can also become an important factor in determining
    the level of cigarette consumption. One of the mechanisms of this influence
    derives from the industry’s right to determine the maximum retail price of
    cigarettes and thus to manipulate the net-of-tax portion of the price. In 2016, a
    new tax policy stipulated that the minimal specific tobacco tax increase by 40
    percent. Thus, the retail price was expected to increase and the consumption
    of cigarettes to decrease. However, the actual level of cigarette consumption
    increased. This happened because tobacco companies, aiming to keep their
    customers, initiated “price wars.” This example illustrates that more factors are
    at play than are usually taken into account in weighing policy choices. Price
    and tax factors are extremely important and need to be considered when
    forecasting trends.

    The present report provides evidence from a modeling exercise undertaken
    to predict the health and related cost impacts that may stem from the
    implementation of a tobacco excise tax increase in Ukraine. Impacts are
    calculated relative to the status quo before the tax hike, and are modeled,
    beginning in 2017, for 2025 and 2035.

    A microsimulation model was employed to simulate the long-term impact
    of tobacco taxation on the future burden of a range of non-communicable
    diseases (NCDs). Specifically, the disease outcomes quantified were coronary
    heart disease (CHD), stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
    and lung cancer. The microsimulation model has been deemed by the
    OECD the most relevant method for NCD modeling based on risk-factor data
    (4). This report complements modeling work done to estimate the fiscal-
    revenue impact and expected reduction in consumption that might stem
    from proposed additional tobacco excise tax increases in Ukraine. That work
    was carried out by the World Bank, using the Tobacco Tax Simulation Model
    (TaXSiM) developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) (5, 6).

                            Summary of results

                            Table 1 presents a summary of total disease cases (epidemiological) and costs
                            (economic) by parameter, year, and scenario as rates per Ukraine population.

                            The model estimated that by 2035 the specified tax increase would result
                            in the avoidance of 126,730 new cases of smoking-related disease; 29,172
                            premature deaths; and 267,098 potential years of life lost, relative to no
                            change in tax. These reductions in disease and death will avoid 1.5 billion
                            UAH in healthcare costs and 16.5 billion UAH in premature mortality costs,
                            respectively.

Data Collection

Smoking Prevalence Data
Baseline smoking prevalence data was extracted from the 2015 Annual
Household Survey, conducted by the National Statistic Service in Ukraine (7).
Additional data on percentages of occasional smokers and ex-smokers were
extrapolated from the omnibus surveys conducted by Kiev International
Institute of Sociology (2, 3).

Data manipulation and assumptions

1. Daily versus current smokers: The Annual Household Survey provides
prevalence data on daily smoking only, rather than current smoking. Current
smoking data are preferable, since the WHO target is focused on a total
reduction in smoking prevalence, rather than number of cigarettes smoked.
Modeling proceeded with a focus on prevalence of current smoking. Pooled
estimates from other smaller surveys with more detailed collection of smoking
status data were collated and the 2015 Household survey adjusted to include
estimated proportions of occasional smokers.

2. Ex-smokers: No data by age and sex were available for percentages of
ex-smokers within the Annual Household Survey. However, some data
were available from the recent omnibus surveys (2013-2015). Therefore, in
order to take account of ex-smokers (who have a greater disease risk than
never smokers), the distributions of ex-smokers and never smokers from the
omnibus surveys were used to proportion out the non-smoker data into ex-
smoker and never smoker from the Annual Household Survey. This enabled
us to initialize the model in the start year with a more accurate estimation of
ex-smokers than would be done using proxy ex-smoker data.

3. Sample sizes: Often, sample sizes by age group were not presented,
therefore the total sample size was proportioned across the five-year age
groups and the variance increased based on data from the UN population
prospects database (8).

4. Age groups: Data for some years were in wide age groups of more than
20 years (e.g., 30-59 years), therefore prevalence was assumed to be the same
across these groups. Once raw/more detailed data/data by five-year age
groups become available, then the data can be updated.

                                Disease Data
                                For this study, the following smoking-related NCDs were modeled: Coronary
                                heart disease (CHD), stroke, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
                                disease (COPD). Incidence and mortality data by age and sex were extracted
                                from the Global Burden of Disease study database (9). Lung cancer data were
                                grouped with trachea and bronchus data in the database, which slightly
                                overestimates cases relative to Globocan (10). No survival data were available
                                for these diseases in Ukraine, therefore survival data were calculated using
                                DISMOD equations from the World Health Organization (11).

                                Relative risks (RR) for smokers compared to non-smokers were extracted from
                                prospective cohort studies which observed the development of CHD (12-17),
                                COPD (17-21), lung cancer (17, 21-23), and stroke (24-26). As various cohort

                                were compared and combined to cover the modeled population: Thus,
                                relative risks for various age groups may derive from different studies. However,
                                if RRs for neighboring age groups from various studies differed much, some
                                smoothing was undertaken. Appendix 3 describes the method of creating RRs
                                in more detail.

                                For ex-smokers, RRs were assumed to decrease over time since cessation. The
                                ex-smoker RR was computed using a decay function method developed by
                                Hoogenveen and colleagues (27). This function uses the current smoker RR
                                for each disease as the starting point and then models the decline in relative
                                risk of disease for an ex-smoker over time, as detailed in Appendix 1 of the
                                supplementary appendix.

                                Health-Economic Data
                                Data on direct health care costs by disease were extracted from the literature
                                (28), but no data on indirect, non-healthcare costs by disease were available.
                                Data on direct health care costs were included in the model and the direct
                                healthcare cost impacts output from the model.

                                It was possible to calculate premature mortality costs by including average
                                annual income.1 This accumulates the lost earnings due to death before age
                                65 to provide a different measure of lost productivity in terms of losses of
                                GDP due to death. However, this does not take account of losses in
                                productivity due to morbidity. We carried out a sensitivity analysis on the costs,
                                running the model with a discount rate of 5 percent, as is used in Russia
                                (http://www.ispor.org/peguidelines/countrydet.asp?c=18&t=4).

                          Population Data
                          In order to simulate the population of Ukraine, the population by age and sex,
                          births by mother’s age, and total fertility rate statistics were taken from the UN
                          population prospects database (8).

                          Total mortality rates were taken from the WHO global health estimates
                          database (29).

                          These parameters enable the model to simulate the Ukrainian population as
                          close to reality as is possible.

                          The Microsimulation Model

                          The UK Health Forum (UKHF) microsimulation model was originally developed
                          for the English government’s Foresight enquiry (30, 31) and has been further
                          developed over the past decade to incorporate a number of additional
                          interacting risk factors, including smoking. (Methods are described in greater
                          detail in (32, 33) and in our supplementary appendix 1.) The model simulates a
                          virtual population that reproduces the characteristics and behavior of a large
                          sample of individuals (20-100 million). These characteristics (age, sex, smoking
                          status) can evolve over the life course based on known population statistics
                          and risk factor data. Individuals can be born and die in the model.

                          Figure 1 illustrates the modular nature of the model.

                          Module 1 uses cross-sectional data on the prevalence of the risk factor -
                          cigarette smoking in this case. For the current study, 2015 smoking prevalence
                          data for Ukraine was extrapolated forward to 2035. It was assumed that the
                          proportions of the population within each smoking category as calculated in
                          2015 remained constant until 2035.




                                                                                                                9
                                        Module 2 is a microsimulation model which uses the prevalence of the risk
                                        factor over time, along with the specified data on the risks of developing
                                        diseases, to make projections of future disease burden.

                                        The model produces a wide range of different outputs, including incidence,
                                        cumulative incidence, prevalence, premature mortality, direct healthcare costs
                                        avoided, and disability-adjusted life years.

                                        To our knowledge, no other studies have used a microsimulation model
                                        to quantify the future costs and health impacts of tobacco taxation policy
                                        scenarios in Ukraine.

                                        Development of Scenarios

                                        An initial modeling study was carried out using the World Health Organization
                                        (WHO) TaXSiM model.2 Within this model, a scenario that reflects tobacco
                                        excise tax changes in 2017 was simulated to calculate the revenue impact as a
                                        result of this tax increase (Table 3).

                                        TaXSiM also calculated the percentage reduction in total cigarette
                                        consumption (%) due to the suggested tax changes. These taxation changes
                                        result in non-smokers’ (predominantly young people) not initiating smoking;
                                        smokers’ quitting, and smokers’ reducing the number of cigarettes smoked.
                                        Details of the TaXSiM model scenarios can be found in Table 3.

     Scenario Assumptions
     1. Several studies suggest that around 50 percent of the effect of price increases
     on overall cigarette consumption results from participation changes (34, 35).
     Therefore, 50 percent of the estimated reduction in cigarette consumption
     was used as an estimate of the reduction in the total prevalence of smoking.
     While taxation which results in increased real prices of tobacco might reduce
     the intensity of smoking, research suggests that people who cut down actually
     inhale more, as measured by serum cotinine levels (36). Further, the WHO target
     is focused on a total reduction in smoking prevalence. Therefore, modeling
     proceeded with a focus on current smoking prevalence, as opposed to the
     number of cigarettes smoked.

     2. Our analysis of the omnibus surveys 2013-2015 showed that, in males,
     55 percent of the change in smoking prevalence was due to a reduction in
     uptake. Specifically, the percentage of smokers decreased, the percentage of
     ex-smokers did not change, while the percentage of never smokers increased.
     Therefore, these changes were probably due to males’“not starting smoking.”
     Among females, 100 percent of the change in consumption was due to “not
     starting smoking” (2).

     3. While these average changes were not the same for each group, and people
     usually initiate smoking while they are under 30 years old (2), the model did not
     take these age differences into account, and the relative decline in percentages
     of current smokers was applied to all age groups.
     Therefore, it was assumed that taxation would result in changes in uptake.

     4. A baseline “static” trend was included. This assumed that smoking prevalence
     remains constant at 2015 rates. The tax increase scenario was compared to
     this baseline.

     5. The tax increase scenario represents the tax change adopted in January 2017.

     6. The change in smoking prevalence occurs in the second year of the
     simulation only (2017). This is in line with TaXSiM. As noted above, tobacco
     companies’“price wars” were observed to cause an increase in cigarette
     consumption, rather than the decrease expected according to taxation policies.
     Taking this into account, it was assumed that, in 2016, there would be no
     change in smoking prevalence from the 2015 level (37). The baseline used in
     the model was 2015 smoking prevalence held constant.

     7. The scenarios are based on Monte Carlo simulations (Individuals were
     sampled from the population and simulated through).

     8. The specified percentage of smokers who are affected by the tax increase
     move to the never-smoker category in 2017.

                                                      Smoking Prevalence through Tobacco Taxation in Ukraine




                         9. If an individual’s smoking status is changed by the scenario, their smoking
                         status will remain fixed for the entire simulation.

                         10. We assumed an immediate reduction in smoking prevalence due to the
                         tax increases in 2017. We learned via personal communication with Prof. Joy
                         Townsend that there are different views on the temporal impact of a tax:
                         Econometricians follow Becker’s model, assuming that, as tobacco is very
                         addictive, the reaction to price increases is slow and greater in the long run.
                         Becker, therefore, uses a lagged variable of y (t-1) (38). Townsend and Atkinson
                         take the opposite view (39): That smokers tend to react quickly to a price
                         change. We used a model similar to theirs, with an immediate effect and then
                         a linear trend, and in line with the TaXSiM model outputs.

                         There were two scenarios:

                         1. A baseline ‘static’ trend. This assumed that smoking prevalence stays
                         constant at 2015 rates.

                         2. A tax increase scenario. An earlier iteration of TaXSiM calculated that
                         an increase in Ad valorem tax of 15 percent, a 30 percent increase in the
                         minimum specific excise, 11.08 UAH, and a simple specific of 8.28 UAH
                         would result in a reduction of 10.2 percent in cigarettes smoked. Using the
                         assumptions above, this translated into a reduction in uptake of 5.61 percent
                         in males, and 10.2 percent in females. Therefore, in 2017, this specified
                         percentage of smokers was moved to the never-smoker group in order to take
                         account of uptake and maintain 100 percent of smokers in the model (the
                         population cannot exceed 100 percent). This slightly underestimates the effect
                         of the scenario, as described in the discussion. This change occurred in 2017
                         only. Appendix 2 provides the full TaxSiM analysis from the earlier iteration.

                            Results from the microsimulation are presented as rates per 100,000, then
                            scaled to the Ukraine population for that year, as estimated by the UN
                            population prospects (8).

                            1. Cumulative incidence rate per year per Ukraine population
                            The total number of new cases of a disease divided by the total number of
                            susceptible people in a given year and accumulated over a specified period
                            of the simulation from the year 2016. Therefore, the cumulative number of
                            incident cases represents a sum of all of the incident cases from the start of the
                            simulation.

                            2. Cumulative incidence avoided per Ukraine population over the
                            simulation period
                            The total number of incident cases of disease avoided or gained as compared
                            to baseline (i.e., scenario 0). A positive value represents the number of cases
                            avoided, whereas a negative value represents the number of cases gained.

                            3. Incidence
                            The total number of new cases of a disease, divided by the total number of
                            susceptible people in a given year presented as a rate per population.

                            4. Attributable incidence rate per Ukraine population per year
                            The number of new cases of a disease attributable to being a smoker or ex-
                            smoker in the Ukraine population.




                                                                                                                  15
     5. Premature mortality rates per Ukraine population
     Premature mortality refers to the total number of deaths in a given year below
     the life expectancy of that individual in the Ukraine population. Results are
     presented per year in the total population and cumulative over a given period
     of the simulation.

     6. Potential years of life lost per Ukraine population
     For each individual, the difference between the reference age (life expectancy
     at birth) and the age of death is calculated. The average annual PYLL was
     calculated each year in the microsimulation. This metric considers individuals
     who have died in a given year and is output as a rate per 100,000, which is
     then scaled to a rate per Ukraine population.
     Economic outputs

     7. Direct cost avoided
     These are cumulative direct costs across the period of the simulation. The
     result for 2020 represents the cumulative costs avoided for the period 2016 to
     2020. These costs are scaled to the total population of Ukraine.

     8. Premature mortality costs
     This relates to lost earnings due to premature deaths. The premature mortality
     costs for each individual in the year of death are calculated by summing over
     the income costs from the age of death until the individual’s life expectancy
     (LE) at birth.

     Summary Table

     Table 6 presents a summary table of total disease cases (epidemiological)
     and costs (economic) by parameter, year, and scenario as rates per Ukraine
     population.

     Scenario 0 (Sc0) refers to the baseline scenario where smoking prevalence was
     assumed constant based on 2015 smoking prevalence.

     Scenario 1 (Sc1) refers to the one-off tax scenario as summarized in table 3.

                                                         year for each disease. Figure 7 presents the incident cases by scenario for 2025

                                                         scenario 1, the cases attributable to smoking contribute a smaller portion to

                                                         expected, since the scenario is impacting smokers, so we would expect the

                        direct costs avoided by 2025 and 2035. For example, scenario 1 is predicted

on the future burden of four smoking-related diseases through 2035. The
results showed that small changes in smoking prevalence in one year can have
large impacts in terms of disease incidence and premature mortality cases
avoided into the future. Our results show that implementation of a one-off tax
has an impact on smoking-related health burden, but highlights the need for
continuous tobacco control measures, if smoking prevalence is to continue to
decrease and have sizeable impacts on related disease occurrence.

As well as benefits in terms of morbidity, particularly CHD cases avoided,
we observe large savings in terms of premature mortality and potential
years of life lost. This is important, since Ukraine is experiencing a decreasing
population over time, and a lower life expectancy compared to the EU
average of 78 for males and around 83 for females (40). Tobacco taxation is one
important step to improving life expectancy in Ukraine, especially amongst
men, whose smoking prevalence is high.

The study included just four smoking-related diseases (CHD, COPD, stroke, lung
cancer). However, we know that smoking is responsible for many more diseases,
and harms almost every organ in the body (41). Therefore, we are likely to see
much wider epidemiological benefits than those observed here. Future work
could update this study by including additional smoking-related diseases.

While the microsimulation method is advantageous in NCD modeling, one key
disadvantage is that the model is data intensive. Fortuitously, during the period
of the study, the Global Burden of Disease team published an online database
that included many of the data inputs that were required (9). While country-
specific data are preferable, and the GBD is based on modeled estimates and
recommended as a cross-country comparative tool, few other data were
available for Ukraine. Inter alia, there were neither survival data nor relative risks
specific for Ukraine available. Once better data become available, the model
can easily be updated.

No data on indirect costs such as productivity losses by disease were
available. Large savings to the health system were observed with just a small
change in smoking prevalence. However, wider societal costs such as losses
in productivity are likely to be higher than those reflected here, making a
stronger case for the implementation of regular tax hikes for tobacco control
(42). If indirect cost data by disease become available, then the model can
once again easily be updated in the future.




                                                                                       25
     One notable limitation of our scenario methodology is that smokers were
     moved to the never-smokers category to account for changes in uptake
     due to the tax. While this is not realistic, it was the only solution by which to
     model change in uptake within the total population (and ensure we maintain
     100 percent of people in the population). This approach could result in an
     underestimation of the health impact of a tobacco tax increase. This effect
     could arise, because some of those smokers who become never smokers may
     already have a smoking-related disease.

     We know that social groups react differently to tax increases (43). Due to small
     sample sizes, it was not possible to model the long-term health impacts on
     different social groups within the microsimulation. However, we can infer from
     research conducted in Ukraine (43, 44) that the largest impact of taxation will
     be observed in the poorest social groups. This is important, since it means that
     tobacco taxation could contribute to reducing social inequalities in health.
     One specific limitation of any predictive model is that it does not take account
     of major future changes in circumstances, such as the behavior of the tobacco
     industry, or the introduction of new drugs or technologies. In theory, their
     effects can be estimated by altering parameters in the model, but these will
     significantly increase the degrees of uncertainty. However, they could be
     simulated as additional scenarios in the future relative to a “no change” scenario.

     At present, the model does not take account of multimorbidity and the joint
     effect of several risk factors on disease occurrence and related mortality.
     However, individuals can get more than one smoking-related disease in their
     lifetime. Future work could expand the scope of the model to take account of
     technological and economic changes and their potential effects, and also to
     model the clustering of risk factors and diseases in the same individuals.
     The model did not take account of passive smoking/secondhand smoke.
     Understanding the combined risk of smoking and passive smoking on later
     disease outcomes will enable us to model the combined impact of these risk
     factors on later disease outcomes.

     It was beyond the scope of this study, given the time constraints, to carry
     out an in-depth uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. We are aware that this
     is good practice; however, there is a lack of validated datasets by which to
     compare our outputs. Furthermore, the microsimulation is complex, relative to
     spreadsheet models, for example. It involves many thousands of calculations
     which are completed during the simulation of 50 million individuals. Given
     this complexity, local uncertainty analysis would demand many thousands of
     consecutive runs and would require a supercomputer to complete the exercise
     in a realistic time scale. However, we did carry out a small sensitivity analysis of
     the costs – running the model with and without a 5 percent discount rate.
     Further work should develop more sophisticated interventions, for example,

                             Smoking Prevalence through Tobacco Taxation in Ukraine




individuals of different ages could be affected differently by the intervention.
It was beyond the scope of this study to include this development within the
microsimulation. However, a prototype, user-friendly tool has been developed
for Ukraine that enables the user to select different age cohorts (as opposed to
a population distribution of individuals) and run simulations to quantify health
and cost impacts by population groups.

Further work should also explore the impact of other potential policies in
Ukraine, such as a tobacco duty escalator, as well as a combination of tobacco-
control measures including smoking cessation services.

This study complements that which was carried out using the TaXSiM model
and shows the health and related economic benefits of increasing tobacco tax
in Ukraine. Even small reductions in smoking prevalence in one year will have
long-term impacts on disease incidence and subsequent health costs.

1.2 Module Two: Microsimulation

1.2.1 Microsimulation initialization: Birth, disease and death models
Simulated people are generated with the correct demographic statistics in
the simulation’s start-year. In this year, women are stochastically allocated the
number and years of birth of their children – these are generated from known
fertility and mother’s age at birth statistics (valid in the start-year). If a woman
has children, then those children are generated as members of the simulation
in the appropriate birth year.

The microsimulation is provided with a list of relevant diseases. These
diseases used the best available incidence, mortality, survival, relative risk and
prevalence statistics (by age and sex). Individuals in the model are simulated
from their year of birth (which may be before the start year of the simulation).
In the course of their lives, simulated people can die from one of the diseases
caused by smoking that they might have acquired or from some other cause.
The probability that a person of a given age and sex dies from a cause other
than the disease are calculated in terms of known death and disease statistics
valid in the start year. It is constant over the course of the simulation. The
survival rates from tobacco-related diseases will change as a consequence of
the changing distribution of smoking level in the population.

The microsimulation incorporates a sophisticated economic module. The
module employs Markov-type simulation of long-term health benefits, health
care costs, and cost-effectiveness of specified interventions. It synthesizes and
estimates evidence on cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis.
The model can be used to project the differences in quality-adjusted life years
(QALYs), direct and indirect lifetime health-care costs, and, as a consequence
of interventions, incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over a specified
time scale. Outputs can be discounted for any specific discount rate.
The section provides an overview of the initialization of the microsimulation
model and will be expanded upon in the next sections.

1.2.2 Population models
Populations are implemented as instances of the TPopulation C++ class. The
TPopulation class is created from a population (*.ppl) file. Usually a simulation
will use only one population, but it can simultaneously process multiple
populations (for example, different ethnicities within a national population).

                           1.2.3.2 Smoking
                           The microsimulation framework applied to smoking enables us to measure
                           the future health impact of changes in rates of tobacco consumption. This
                           includes the impact of giving up smoking on the following diseases: i)
                           Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ii) Coronary heart disease
                           (or Myocardial Infarction if CHD data are not available), iii) stroke, and iv) lung
                           cancer. In the simulation, each person is categorized into one of the three
                           smoking groups: Smokers, ex-smokers, and people who have never smoked.
                           Their initial distribution is based on the distribution of smokers, ex-smokers
           Myocardial	Infarction	if	CHD	data	are	not	available),	iii)	stroke,	and	iv)	lung	cancer.	In	the	simulation,

                                                                Once a person has a fatal disease (or diseases), their probability of survival

                                                                A large amount data are required for modeling these diseases. Where possible,

     2 Software Architecture

     2.1 Aim of the Model
     This model utilizes a common bespoke method to predict the impact of
     changing risk factors to measure chronic disease. UKHF currently have risk-factor
     models for obesity, tobacco, albuminuria, and eGFR and related diseases that
     include myocardial infarction/coronary heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes,
     chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and lung cancer.

     The model is an epidemiological/medical competing-risk application that uses
     both stochastic and deterministic processing capable of projecting cohort
     mortality rates of an individual or a population, taking account of the individuals’
     risk factors and medical profiles. Through its interactive scenario specification,
     the model allows for the effects of ageing and the projection of future mortality
     rates, either with or without taking into account possible future trends in risk
     factors or medical conditions.

     2.2 Summary of the Architecture of the Existing Model
     The existing solution is written in C++ (compiler Embarcadero C++ Builder). It is
     a modular, object-oriented design and is compiled to run under the Windows
     operating system.

     The application has a limited interactive graphics capability designed for
     the rapid assessment of outputs and comparative assessments of batched
     runs. Diagrams and graphs produced in this way can be exported from the
     application in suitable file formats. The model is equipped with a suite of editors
     allowing flexible and traceable input of individual, cohort, or population data.

     The model’s inputs are in the form of tab-delimited text files. The application
     has a number of editors that can create, edit, and store these files. The
     simulation, disease, and scenario editors allow the user to specify all input data
     files, parameters and processing rules necessary for a run of the program. The
     application’s many data inputs are processed in a similar fashion – for a specified
     run-configuration, the application dynamically creates and maintains lists of
     software objects, each object being constructed from a designated data file (the
     disease and scenario objects sketched below are examples of this process). Files
     input in this way into their corresponding dynamical objects are automatically
     checked for their data integrity by the newly created software object’s own
     methods. Each run creates and stores a time-tagged configuration file specifying
     the complete set of input files, output files, parameter settings and rule set.
     Provided that the necessary input data are available, it is possible to rerun a
     simulation by reusing the configuration file.

Outputs are handled in a similar way but in reverse: Run-time generated
outputs are stored in dynamically created output objects; at the end of a run,
the objects write their data to tab-delimited text files. Outputs can be summary
files, medium or low-level data files which can be further processed by standard
software packages.

2.3 Main C++ Classes Used by the Model
Individual members of the population and diseases are modeled by the C++
classes Tperson and Tdisease respectively. The risk-factor trends and scenarios
are modeled by the C++ class Tscenario. The principal operations of the
program can be regarded as the interactions of Tperson, Tdisease, and Tscenario
objects. These classes have some of their fields and methods highlighted in
the following section and subsections; the idea is to give an indication of the
processing chain implemented in the model. The software closely follows the
real-world life of individuals – they age in a personal risk factor environment and
possibly catch diseases from which they may recover or die.

Figure 3 shows a schematic of the model illustrating the overall structure of the
model and each class.

                               2.3.1 Tperson C++ class
                               People are implemented as instances of the C++ class, Tperson; an indication
                               of its data fields and methods provided in Table 4 are grouped into the state
                               record. The medHistory record maintains their current disease and risk factor
                               status together with data necessary for the computation of disease-related
                               transitions. The Tperson object’s data fields are updated annually with the
                               yearByYear(diseaseList, scenarioList, …) method. The method needs to be
                               supplied with pointers to the list of disease object pointers being modeled
                               and the list of risk-factor scenario object pointers, which determines how the
                               person’s set of risk factors change over the year.

                           2.3.2 Tdisease C++ class
                           Both single and multistage diseases are implemented as instances of the C++
                           class Tdisease. An example of their structure is shown in Figure 4. Each stage of
                           a disease has its own set of disease statistics such as incidence risks, remission
                           risks, and survival risks. Moreover, each disease stage will also contain economic
                           data such as direct and indirect costs. In addition to the data fields, there are also
                           methods that are included in the Tdisease class, some examples of which are
                           provided in Table 5. Disease data are stored in structured text files – one file for
                           each disease or version of that disease. The key method of the Tdisease class is
                           function GetRisk() . For a specified person state, medical history, and risk factor
                           type, the method returns the relevant transition probability. If the application
                           is running in a stochastic transition mode, this probability is compared to an
                           application-generated random number to determine if the transition takes
                           place; in deterministic mode, the same transition probability is included in the
                           relevant life-disease table that computes and lists the probabilities of being alive
                           and in possible exclusive disease states or dead.

                         Processing is user-specified to be either random (Monte Carlo) or deterministic.
                         The random option can process any specified population or cohort; the
                         deterministic option processes only cohorts. In this context: A population is
                         a specified number of males and females whose age distributions and risk
                         factor distributions are input as appropriate tab delimited text files; a cohort
                         is a text file of individuals specifying, for each individual, their initial state and
                         medical history. The user options and necessary data files are specified in the
                         application’s simulation editor.

                         The user must also specify the set of diseases and the set of risk factors that
                         are being simulated. Again, this is done via the appropriate application editor:
                         The disease editor allows the construction and identification of a batch file
                         of disease files; the simulation editor allows for the specification of the mix
                         of risk factors and, where necessary, their distributions by age and gender.
                         The simulation editor also provides the mechanism by which essential run
                         parameters are specified – the start year, stop year, number of trials, and so on.

                               Smoking Prevalence through Tobacco Taxation in Ukraine




Individuals are processed one at a time from the simulation’s start year until they
either die or reach the simulation’s stop year. In each simulated year they can
either contract any mix of the modeled diseases which they do not yet have,
achieve remission from any disease or disease stage they might have, die from
any terminal disease they might have, or die from other causes. (Other causes
are modeled as a single, instantly fatal, terminal disease; its incidence probability
is constructed via the disease editor from the modeled diseases’ mortality
statistics and the appropriate national mortality statistics).

Each run of the model requires the specification of a risk-factor scenario for each
risk factor modeled. These scenarios can simply maintain risk-factor distributions
at their start year values, or they can allow for the modeling of risk factor
trends or medical advances resulting in the reduction of disease incidence or
improvements in the survivability of specified diseases.

2.3.3 Tscenario C++ class
Scenarios are modeled as instances of the C++ Tscenario class and are
constructed by the scenario editor, which is accessed via the simulation editor.

Runs can be organized into batches, with different runs having different risk-
factor scenarios. This allows for direct comparisons to be made – for example,
what happens to life expectancy with or without improvements to the
treatment of stroke.

Scenarios are implemented as instances of the C++ class, Tscenario; an
indication of its data fields and methods is provided in Table 6.

The scenario objects are constructed from files that are created by the
scenario editor.

Much of the input data (disease data, mortality data, demographic data, etc.) is
typically changed on an annual basis. Such changes are easily accommodated
and logged via the input editors – the disease, distribution, and simulation
editors.

New diseases that are described by the current set of risk factors can be added
to (or subtracted from) the simulation via the disease editor.
The model has essentially only two external software dependencies: Its own
C++ development environment and its host processor’s operating system. The
configuration was chosen for ease of its maintainability.

                         Appendix 3. Adjustment of Epidemiological Input Data
                         for the Microsimulation Model of the Health Impacts of
                         Tobacco Taxation in Ukraine

                         The goal of this annex is to summarize research findings relevant to the
                         microsimulation model, including data on the incidence of tobacco-use-
                         related diseases, relative risks of their development in smokers and former
                         smokers compared with never smokers, and related risk of premature death.

                         Below, diseases included in the model are considered and, for each of them,
                         extracts are shown from studies related to incidence, relative risks, and
                         mortality. Based on the published evidence and statistics available for Ukraine,
                         estimates of incidence and relative risks were elaborated and suggested as
                         inputs for the microsimulation model.

                         As estimates from the Global Burden of Disease database became available
                         during our research (Global Burden of Disease, 2016), we utilized incidence
                         inputs from this database. Estimates for relative risks were used, as explained
                         below.

                         3.1 Cardiovascular Diseases, Particularly Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

                         3.1.1 Incidence
                         Because there are no proper estimates of CHD incidence in Ukraine, and most
                         studies report only relative risks and no absolute risks, data were adapted from
                         the seminal study on ischemic heart disease – the Framingham study (Castelli,
                         1984; Lerner & Kannel, 1986).

                         The Framingham study reports average morbidity and mortality for men and
                         women. It was calculated that the number of CHD cases is about five times
                         greater than the number of CHD deaths. SDR for CHD in Ukraine was taken
                         for the years 2012-2014 and multiplied by the coefficient to estimate the
                         approximate level of average incidence.

                            Subsequently, from the graphs included in papers on the Framingham study,
                            the biennial levels of new cases of CHD per 1000 were extracted, smoothed to
                            five-year intervals, and multiplied by 50 to switch to rates per year per 100000.
                            Then, average unweighted incidence for people aged 35-84 was calculated,
                            the coefficients were determined to adjust the incidence to the expected
                            value based on mortality levels (1.6 for men and 1.9 for women), and the
                            expected incidence was calculated. It was assumed that people older than 84
                            years have the same incidence as people aged 80-84. In Table 3.2, columns
                            which correspond to age groups 0-34 are not shown, as their incidence of
                            CHD is assumed to be 0.

                          3.1.2 Relative risk
                          Peer-reviewed literature shows that younger smokers have a much greater
                          relative risk of contracting CHD than older ones. Relative to never smokers,
                          CHD risk among current smokers was highest in the youngest and lowest
                          in the oldest participants. For example, among women aged 40 to 49 years,
                          the hazard ratio was 8.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.0, 14), while it was
                          3.1 (95% CI = 2.0, 4.9) among those aged 70 or older. The largest absolute
                          risk differences between current smokers and never smokers were observed
                          among the oldest participants. Finally, the majority of CHD cases among
                          smokers were attributable to smoking. For example, attributable proportions
                          of CHD by age group were 88% (40-49 years), 81% (50-59 years), 71% for (60-69
                          years), and 68% (70 years) among women who smoked (Tolstrup et al., 2014).

                 (Tolstrup et al., 2014).


                 A population-based prospective cohort study of 19 782 men and 21 500
                 women aged 40-59 years between 1990-1992 and 2001 was conducted
                 to examine the relationship between smoking status and the risk of CHD.
                 A total of 260 incidences of CHD were confirmed among men, including
                 174 myocardial infarctions (MI). The numbers among women were 66 and
                 43, respectively. The multivariate relative risk [95% confidence interval (CI)]
                 for current smokers versus never-smokers in men, after adjustment for
                 cardiovascular risk factors and several lifestyle factors, was 2.85 (1.98, 4.12)
                 for total CHD and 3.64 (2.27, 5.83) for MI. These respective risks in women
                 were 3.07 (1.48, 6.40) and 2.90 (1.18, 7.18). Among men, a dose-dependent
                 relationship was observed between the number of cigarettes and the risk of
                 MI. The population-attributable risk percent (95% CI) of CHD was 46% (34, 55)
                 in men and 9% (0, 18) in women. Smoking cessation, however, led to a rapid
                 decline in the CHD risk within 2 years (Baba et al., 2006).

                 Smoking fewer cigarettes/day for a longer duration was more deleterious
                 than smoking more cigarettes/day for a shorter duration (P < 0.01). For 50
                 pack-years (365,000 cigarettes), estimated RRs of CVD were 2.1 for accrual at 20
                 cigarettes/day and 1.6 for accrual at 50 cigarettes/day (Lubin et al., 2016).

                 3.1.2.1 Women versus men
                 A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies with data
                 for 3 912 809 individuals and 67 075 coronary heart disease events from 86
                 prospective trials concluded as follows: In 75 cohorts (2.4 million participants)
                 that adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors other than coronary heart disease,


                                                                                                       67
                        the pooled adjusted female-to-male RRR of smoking compared with not
                        smoking for coronary heart disease was 1.25 (95% CI 1.12-1.39, p<0.0001). This
                        outcome was unchanged after adjustment for potential publication bias, and
                        there was no evidence of important between-study heterogeneity (p=0.21).
                        The RRR increased by 2% for every additional year of study follow-up (p=0.03).
                        In pooled data from 53 studies, there was no evidence of a sex difference in the

                        who never had (RRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86-1.08, p=0.53) (Huxley & Woodward, 2011).

                        3.1.2.2	 Effects of quitting smoking
                        In a cohort of 475 734 Korean men aged 30 to 58 years, compared with non-
                        reducing heavy smokers (>= 20 cigarettes/d), those who quit smoking showed
                        significantly lower risks of MI with hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals [CI])
                        of 0.43 (0.34 to 0.53) (Song & Cho, 2008).

                        3.1.2.3 Suggested RR for smokers compared with non-smokers
                        Based on the above results from (Tolstrup et al., 2014) and (Song & Cho, 2008),
                        the updated risk ratios might be as follows.

                        3.1.3 Mortality
                        In the Greek cohort study (Notara et al., 2015), which observed 10-year Acute
                        Coronary Syndrome (ACS) prognosis among 2172 cardiovascular patients,
                        patients with >60 pack-years of smoking had 57.8 % higher ACS mortality and
                        24.6 % higher risk for any ACS event. A nested model, adjusted only for age and
                        sex, revealed that, for every 30 pack-years of smoking increase, the associated
                        ACS risk increased by 13 % (95 % CI 1.03, 1.30, p = 0.001).

                        Smoking is a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and
                        mortality even at older age, advancing cardiovascular mortality by more than
                        five years, and demonstrating that smoking cessation in these age groups is
                        still beneficial in reducing the excess risk. Random effects meta-analysis of
                        the association of smoking status with cardiovascular mortality (based on the
                        data of 503 905 participants aged 60 and older, of whom 37 952 died from

cardiovascular disease) yielded a summary hazard ratio of 2.07 (95% CI 1.82 to
2.36) for current smokers and 1.37 (1.25 to 1.49) for former smokers compared
with never smokers. Corresponding summary estimates for risk advancement
periods were 5.50 years (4.25 to 6.75) for current smokers and 2.16 years (1.38
to 2.39) for former smokers. The excess risk in smokers increased with cigarette
consumption in a dose-response manner and decreased continuously with
time since smoking cessation in former smokers (Mons et al., 2015).
In Sweden and Estonia, a 13-year follow-up regarding all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality revealed that smoking and, to a lesser extent, plasma
levels of interleukin-6 were significant predictors of CVD and non-CVD mortality
in men, but none of the other conventional risk factors reached statistical
significance (Jensen-Urstad, Viigimaa, Sammul, Lenhoff, & Johansson, 2014).

In a large prospective cohort of women (Sandhu et al., 2012) without coronary
heart disease at baseline (among 101 018 women participating in the Nurses’
Health Study), a strong dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking
and SCD risk was observed, and smoking cessation significantly reduced
and eventually eliminated excess SCD risk. Compared with never smokers,
current smokers had a 2.44-fold (95% CI, 1.80-3.31) increased risk of SCD after
controlling for coronary risk factors. In multivariable analyses, the quantity of
cigarettes smoked daily (P value for trend, <0.0001) and smoking duration (P
value for trend, <0.0001) were linearly associated with SCD risk among current
smokers. Small-to-moderate amounts of cigarette consumption (1-14 per
day) were associated with a significant 1.84-fold (95% CI, 1.16-2.92) increase in
SCD risk and every 5 years of continued smoking was associated with an 8%
increase in SCD risk (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.12; P<0.0001). The SCD
risk linearly decreased over time after quitting and was equivalent to that of a
never-smoker after 20 years of cessation (P value for trend, <0.0001).

3.1.3.1 Effects of quitting smoking
A systematic review was conducted to determine the magnitude of
risk reduction achieved by smoking cessation in patients with CHD. The
researchers estimated a 36% reduction in crude relative risk (RR) of mortality
for patients with CHD who quit, compared with those who continued
smoking (RR, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.71) (Critchley &
Capewell, 2003).

                                       3.2.1 Incidence among the population
                                       Incident cases of COPD in a population-based prospective 9-year study in Sao
                                       Paulo, Brazil, ranged from 1.4% to 4.0%, depending on the diagnostic criterion
                                       used (Moreira et al., 2015).

                                       In the Rotterdam Study (Terzikhan et al., 2016), the overall IR was higher in
                                       men (13.3/1000 PY, 95 % CI 12.4–14.3) than in women (6.1/1000 PY, 95 % CI
                                       5.6–6.6); age-specific IR ranged between 8.7 and 17.6/1000 PY in males and
                                       3.0–7.9/1000 PY in females. The incidence of COPD increased from the age of
                                       45 in both sexes to the age of 80 in men and 75 in women (Figure 3.3).

                                       Although some studies report either relative risks of COPD among people in
                                       older age groups or mention that incidence increases after age 45 (Terzikhan
                                       et al., 2016), this does not mean that COPD is only occurring among people
                                       over 45. A systematic review on global burden of COPD (Halbert et al., 2006)
                                       reports pooled COPD prevalence at the level of 3.1% (1.8–5.0) among people
                                       younger than 40. Additionally, the WHO global report on mortality attributable
                                       to tobacco (World Health Organization, 2012) reports tobacco-related
                                       mortality starting from 30 years of age and estimates that 39% of COPD deaths
                                       among people aged 30-44 are attributable to tobacco.

                                       The only study which reported the incidence of COPD by age and sex was
                                       conducted in Japan (Kojima et al., 2007). Its findings were used to estimate
                                       incidence by age groups in Ukraine.

                         Another study conducted in Japan (Fukuchi et al., 2004) reported the
                         prevalence of COPD among adults: 10.9% altogether, 16.4% among men and
                         5.0% among women.

                         These data on incidence and prevalence were considered in order to obtain
                         extrapolated estimates for Ukraine. However, the only disease occurrence
                         indicator available for Ukraine is the prevalence of COPD from the WHO
                         Euro Health for all database, which reports a level of 3.7-3.9% in 2005-2015.
                         However, studies aimed at COPD measurement conducted, for instance, in
                         Norway (Johannessen, Omenaas, Bakke, & Gulsvik, 2005) found that about half
                         of COPD cases remain undiagnosed. Another study (Nielsen, 2009) projected
                         COPD prevalence to be 15-25% of the adult population. Yet the prevalence of
                         COPD in Norway reported in HFADB is 0.2%.

                         Additionally, there is a recognized discrepancy in COPD prevalence across
                         different countries and various studies. This is believed to be determined
                         by the methods and definitions used to measure disease (Halbert, Isonaka,
                         George, & Iqbal, 2003). Prevalence in most countries where proper measures
                         were conducted was found to be between 4% and 10%.




                                                                                                              71
                                                        Thus, there are no serious grounds to expect that the incidence of COPD in
                                                        Ukraine should be lower than in Japan. Data on COPD incidence from the
                                                        Japan study (Kojima et al., 2007) are suggested for use.

                                                        women. The age-specific IR of COPD in ever smokers ranged between 7.3 and
                                                        15.3/1000 PY. The IR was 6.0/1000 PY (95 % CI 4.6–7.8) in never-smoking men
                                                        and 3.7/1,000 PY (95 % CI 3.1–4.3) in never-smoking women. The age-specific
                                                        incidence of COPD in never smokers increased by age, but to a lesser extent
                                                        than the incidence of COPD in ever smokers (Figure 3. 5).

                       The abovementioned study from Norway found that adjusted odds ratios (OR)
                       for current smokers and ex-smokers were 9.6 (95% CI 3.6-25.2) and 5.0 (95% CI
                       1.8-13.8), compared to never smokers (Johannessen et al., 2005).

                       The comparisons of risks from these two studies were extracted for the model.

                       The suggested RRs are equal for men and women. With regard to various
                       tobacco-related diseases, some researchers have reported that the risk of
                       contracting these diseases is greater in women than in men, while others found
                       that the risk is identical. In Danish cohorts (Prescott, Bjerg, Andersen, Lange, &
                       Vestbo, 1997), it was seen that risk associated with pack-years was higher in
                       females than in males. As women smokers in Ukraine on average smoke fewer
                       cigarettes, equal RRs for men and women can be considered grounded.

                       3.3 Hypertension

                       3.3.1.1 Effects of smoking
                       While some authors find an association between tobacco smoking and high
                       blood pressure (Tesfaye, Byass, & Wall, 2009; Tesfaye, Byass, Wall, Berhane,
                       & Bonita, 2008), it is necessary to distinguish between short-term, acute
                       hypertensive effects and the long-term risk of developing chronic hypertension.

                       Cigarette smoking acutely exerts a hypertensive effect, mainly through the
                       stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. As regards the impact of
                       chronic smoking on blood pressure, available data do not provide evidence of a
                       direct causal relationship between these two cardiovascular risk factors (Poulter,
                       2002), a concept supported by the evidence that lower blood pressure values
                       have not been observed after chronic smoking cessation (Virdis, Giannarelli,
                       Neves, Taddei, & Ghiadoni, 2010). Though the prevalence of hypertension was
                       higher in former smokers than in never smokers (13.5 versus 8.8%, P < 0.001)
                       and the risk of hypertension was higher [odds ratio (OR) 1.31 (1.13-1.52), P<
                       0.001] in former smokers than in never smokers (Halimi et al., 2002), these
                       findings were from a cross-sectional study, and no grounds for cause-and-effect
                       association are found in this regard (Poulter, 2002).



                                                                                                               73
     3.3.1.1 Effects of quitting smoking
     The effect of smoking cessation on the risk of developing hypertension
     (HPT) and on BP values was studied in a longitudinal study, with a follow-up
     period of 8 years, which included the participants of the Olivetti Heart Study.
     These were 430 untreated normotensive non-diabetic men with normal renal
     function (D’Elia et al., 2014). After 8 years of follow-up, BP changes (delta) were
     significantly lower in ex-smokers than in smokers (delta SBP/DBP: 12.6 +/-
     13.4/7.9 +/- 8.1 vs. 16.0 +/- 14.9/10.3 +/- 10.1 mm Hg; P < 0.05; M +/- SD), also
     after adjustment for potential confounders. Moreover, at the last examination,
     the overall HPT prevalence was 33%, with lower values in ex-smokers than in
     smokers (25 vs. 38%, P = 0.01). After accounting for age, BP and BMI at baseline,
     and changes in smoking habits over the 8-year period, ex-smokers still had
     significantly lower risk of HPT than smokers (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence
     interval 0.15-0.58; P < 0.01).

     Taking into account contradictory data on the impact of tobacco smoking on
     developing hypertension, we decided to exclude hypertension from the list of
     diseases modeled in the microsimulation of tobacco-related health impacts.

     3.4 Lung Cancer

     3.4.1 Relative risk
     3.4.1.1 Effects of smoking
     In the Seoul Male Cancer Cohort Study (SMCC), which included 14 272 men,
     cigarette smoking was associated with 4.18-fold risk of lung cancer in Korean
     men (Bae et al., 2007).

     3.4.1.1 Women versus men
     Analysis was conducted on the data of 279 214 men and 184 623 women
     from eight states in the USA, aged 50-71 years at study baseline, participating
     in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health study. Findings revealed that incidence rates
     were 20.3 (95% Cl 16.3-24.3) per 100 000 person-years in men who had never
     smoked (99 cancers) and 25.3 (21.3-29.3) in women who had never smoked
     (152 cancers); for this group, the adjusted hazard ratio for lung cancer was 1.3
     (1.0-1.8) for women compared with men.

     Smoking was associated with increased risk of lung cancer in men and
     women. The incidence rate of current smokers who smoked more than two
     packs per day was 1259.2 (1035.0-1483.3) in men and 1308.9 (924.2-1693.6) in
     women. In current smokers, in a model adjusted for typical smoking dose, the
     HR was 0.9 (0.8-0.9) for women compared with men.

     For former smokers, in a model adjusted for years of cessation and typical
     smoking dose, the HR was 0.9 (0.9-1.0) for women compared with men.

                               Smoking Prevalence through Tobacco Taxation in Ukraine




Incidence rates of adenocarcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, and undifferentiated
tumors were similar in men and women; incidence rates of squamous tumors
in men were about twice those in women. These findings suggest that
women are not more susceptible than men to the carcinogenic effects of
cigarette smoking in the lung. In smokers, incidence rates tended to be higher
in men than women with comparable smoking histories, but differences were
modest; smoking was strongly associated with lung cancer risk in both men
and women (Freedman, Leitzmann, Hollenbeck, Schatzkin & Abnet, 2008).

3.4.2 Mortality

3.4.2.1 Effects of smoking
In the Japan Collaborative Cohort (JACC) Study, with 45 010 males and
55 724 females aged 40-79 years, 52.2% and 14.8% of lung cancer deaths
were attributable to current and former cigarette smoking, respectively. In
females, the corresponding figures were 11.8% and 2.8%. Among current
male smokers, the relative risk was strongly correlated with the intensity and
duration of cigarette smoking. In contrast, the PAR was associated with an
intermediate level of smoking except for the years of smoking: the largest
PARs were observed in those with 20-29 cigarettes per day, 40-59 pack-years
and 20-22 years old at smoking inception. Absolute risks were estimated to
increase with age and duration of smoking and not to decrease even after
cessation (Ando et al., 2003).

3.4.1.1 Effects of quitting smoking
Pooled data from three large-scale cohort studies in Japan were used to
evaluate the impact of smoking cessation on the decrease in risk of lung cancer
death in male ex-smokers by age at quitting. For simplicity, subjects were limited
to male never smokers and former or current smokers who started smoking
at ages 18-22 years. 110 002 men aged 40-79 years at baseline were included.
During the mean follow-up of 8.5 years, 968 men died from lung cancer. The
mortality rate ratio compared to current smokers decreased with increasing
attained age in men who stopped smoking before age 70 years. Among
men who quit in their fifties, the cohort-adjusted mortality rate ratios (95%
confidence interval) were 0.57 (0.40-0.82), 0.44 (0.29-0.66) and 0.36 (0.13-1.00)
at attained ages 60-69, 70-79 and 80-89 years, respectively. The corresponding
figures for those who quit in their sixties were 0.81 (0.44-1.48), 0.60 (0.43-0.82)
and 0.43 (0.21-0.86). Overall, the mortality rate ratio for current smokers, relative
to nonsmokers, was 4.71 (95% confidence interval 3.76-5.89) and those for
ex-smokers who had quit smoking 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24 and >= 25 years
before were 3.99 (2.97-5.35), 2.55 (1.80-3.62), 1.87 (1.23-2.85), 1.21 (0.66-2.22),
0.76 (0.33-1.75) and 0.67 (0.34-1.32), respectively. Although earlier cessation
of smoking generally resulted in a lower rate of lung cancer mortality in each
group of attained age, the absolute mortality rate decreased appreciably after
stopping smoking even in men who quit at ages 60-69 years (Wakai et al., 2007).

                                                                                       75
     3.5 Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
     In a meta-analysis of the association between cigarette smoking and PAD,
     the pooled OR for current smokers was 2.71 (95% CI 2.28 to 3.21); for ex-
     smokers, the pooled OR was 1.67 (95% CI 1.54 to 1.81). The magnitude of the
     association is greater than that reported for coronary heart disease. The risk is
     lower among ex-smokers but, nonetheless, significantly increased compared
     with never smokers (Lu, Mackay, & Pell, 2014).

     3.5.1 Any stroke

     3.5.1.1 Effects of smoking
     In a meta-analysis on the possible risks of stroke from cigarette smoking
     (Shinton & Beevers, 1989), the overall relative risk of stroke associated with
     cigarette smoking was 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 1.6). Considerable
     differences were seen in relative risks among the subtypes: Cerebral infarction
     1.9, cerebral hemorrhage 0.7, and subarachnoid hemorrhage 2.9. An effect
     of age on the relative risk was also noted; less than 55 years 2.9, 55-74 years
     1.8, and greater than or equal to 75 years 1.1. A dose response between the
     number of cigarettes smoked and relative risk was noted, and there was a small
     increased risk in women compared with men. Ex-smokers under the age of 75
     seemed to retain an appreciably increased risk of stroke (1.5); for all ages, the
     relative risk in ex-smokers was 1.2.

     In a prospective study (Wannamethee, Shaper, Whincup, & Walker, 1995) of
     cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, 7735 men aged 40 through 59 years
     were drawn at random from the age-sex registers of one general practice in
     each of 24 British towns from 1978 through 1980 (the British Regional Heart
     Study). During the 12.75 years of follow-up, there were 167 major stroke events
     (43 fatal and 124 non-fatal) in the 7264 men with no recall of previous ischemic
     heart disease or stroke. After full adjustment for other risk factors, current
     smokers had a nearly fourfold relative risk (RR) of stroke compared with never
     smokers (RR, 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 6.9).

     Ex-smokers showed lower risk than current smokers, but showed excess risk
     compared with never smokers (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9 to 3.3; P = .11); those who
     switched to pipe or cigar smoking showed a significantly increased risk (RR, 3.3;
     95% CI, 1.6 to 7.1), similar to that of current light smokers. Primary pipe or cigar
     smokers also showed increased risk (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.6 to 8.0), but the number
     of subjects involved was small. The benefit of giving up smoking completely
     was seen within five years of quitting, with no further consistent decline in
     risk thereafter, but this was dependent on the amount of tobacco smoked.
     Light smokers (< 20 cigarettes/d) reverted to the risk level of those who had
     never smoked. Heavy smokers retained a more than twofold risk compared
     with never smokers (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.3). The age-adjusted RR of stroke in
     those who quit smoking during the first five years of follow-up (recent quitters)

was reduced compared with continuing smokers (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.7 to 4.6
vs. RR, 4.3; 95% CI, 2.1 to 8.8). The benefit of quitting smoking was observed
in both normotensive and hypertensive men, but the absolute benefit was
greater in hypertensive subjects. Thus, smoking cessation is associated with a
considerable and rapid benefit in decreasing the risk of stroke, particularly in
light smokers (< 20 cigarettes/d); a complete loss of risk is not seen in heavy
smokers. Switching to pipe or cigar smoking confers little benefit, emphasizing
the need for complete cessation of smoking. The absolute benefit of quitting
smoking on risk of stroke is most marked in hypertensive subjects.

In the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study on Cancer and
Cardiovascular Disease (JPHC Study), relative risks (95% CIs) for current smokers
compared with never-smokers, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors
and public health center, were 1.27 (1.05 to 1.54) for total stroke, 0.72 (0.49 to
1.07) for intraparenchymal hemorrhage, 3.60 (1.62 to 8.01) for subarachnoid
hemorrhage, and 1.66 (1.25 to 2.20) for ischemic stroke. The respective
multivariate relative risks among women were 1.98 (1.42 to 2.77), 1.53 (0.86
to 4.25), 2.70 (1.45 to 5.02), and 1.57 (0.86 to 2.87). There was a dose-response
relation between the number of cigarettes smoked and risks of ischemic stroke
for men. A similar positive association was observed between smoking and
risks of lacunar infarction and large-artery occlusive infarction, but not embolic
infarction (Mannami et al., 2004).

3.5.1.1 Women versus men
In a systematic review and meta-analysis which aimed to estimate the effect of
smoking on stroke in women compared with men (Peters, Huxley, & Woodward,
2013), with data from 81 prospective cohort studies that included 3 980 359
individuals and 42 401 strokes, the pooled multiple-adjusted RRR indicated a
similar risk of stroke associated with smoking in women compared with men
(RRR, 1.06 [95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.13]). In a regional analysis, there
was evidence of a more harmful effect of smoking in women than in men
in Western populations (RRR, 1.10 [1.02-1.18]), but not in Asian populations
(RRR, 0.97 [0.87-1.09]). Compared with never-smokers, the beneficial effects of
quitting smoking on stroke risk among former smokers were similar between
the sexes (RRR, 1.10 [0.99-1.22]).

3.5.2 Ischemic stroke
Smoking is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke or CV death in
the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, which comprised mostly
middle-aged to young-old subjects (65-74 years), but not in the Cardiovascular
Health Study (CHS), which comprised mostly middle-old or oldest-old (>= 75
years) adults with atrial fibrillation. Compared with never smokers, current smokers
had a higher incidence of the composite endpoint in ARIC [HR: 1.65 (1.21-2.26)],
but not in CHS [HR: 1.05 (0.69-1.61)] (Kwon et al., 2016).

                           3.5.2.1 Effects of quitting or reducing smoking
                           In a cohort of 475 734 Korean men aged 30 to 58 years, compared with
                           non-reducing heavy smokers (>= 20 cigarettes/d), those who quit smoking
                           showed significantly lower risks of ischemic stroke with hazard ratios (95%
                           confidence intervals [CI]) of 0.66 (0.55 to 0.79). Compared with non-reducing
                           heavy smokers, the risks of all strokes combined and MI among reducers
                           tended to decrease, although the decrements were not statistically significant
                           (Song & Cho, 2008).

                           3.5.3.1.1 Effects of smoking
                           In a study of incident cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), which are asymptomatic
                           precursors of intracerebral hemorrhage, conducted among 2635 individuals
                           aged 66 to 93 years from the population-based Age, Gene/Environment
                           Susceptibility (AGES)-Reykjavik Study, relative risk for current smoking was 1.47
                           [95% CI, 1.11-1.94] (Ding et al., 2015).

                           3.5.1.1.1 Effects of quitting or reducing smoking
                           In a cohort of 475 734 Korean men aged 30 to 58 years, compared with
                           non-reducing heavy smokers (>= 20 cigarettes/d), those who quit smoking
                           showed significantly lower risks of subarachnoid hemorrhage with hazard
                           ratios (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of 0.58 (0.38 to 0.90). For hemorrhagic
                           stroke, quitters showed lower risk compared with heavy smokers, but the
                           difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI: 0.64
                           to 1.06). The risks of subarachnoid hemorrhage in those who reduced
                           from moderate to light smoking tended to be lower than in non-reducing
                           moderate (10 to 19 cigarettes/d) smokers (Song & Cho, 2008).

3.6 All-Cause Mortality

3.6.1.1 Effects of smoking
In a large community-based prospective cohort study comprising 6209 Beijing
adults (aged >= 40 years) studied for approximately eight years (1991-1999),
the multivariable-adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were 2.7 (95% confidence
interval (CI):1.56-4.69) in young adult smokers (40-50 years) and 1.31 (95%
CI: 1.13-1.52) in old smokers (>50 years) (Li et al., 2016). Mortality differences
(/10,000 person-years) were 15.99 (95% CI: 15.34-16.64) in the young and
74.61(68.57-80.65) in the old. Compared with current smokers, the HRs of all-
cause deaths for former smokers in younger and older adults were 0.57 (95% CI:
0.23-1.42) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.73-1.26), respectively.

Among 20 033 individuals participating in the Health Effects of Arsenic
Longitudinal Study (HEALS) in Bangladesh, cigarette/bidi smoking was positively
associated with all-cause (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.06 1.86) and cancer mortality (HR
2.91, 1.24 6.80), and there was a dose-response relationship between increasing
intensity of cigarette/bidi consumption and increasing mortality. An elevated
risk of death from ischemic heart disease (HR 1.87, 1.08 3.24) was associated
with current cigarette/bidi smoking. Among women, the corresponding HRs
were 1.65 (95% CI 1.16 2.36) for all-cause mortality and 2.69 (95% CI 1.20 6.01) for
ischemic heart disease mortality. Cigarette/bidi smoking accounted for about
25.0% of deaths in men and 7.6% in women (Wu et al., 2013).

3.6.1.1 Effects of quitting smoking
Effects of quitting smoking on all-cause mortality were measured in a cohort of
1 494 Chinese people (961 men, 533 women) followed for 18 years (1976-1994)
to assess changes in smoking behavior and then for an additional 17 years
(1994-2011) to examine the relationships of continuing to smoke and new
quitting with mortality risk. Ever smokers had increased risks of lung cancer,
coronary heart disease, thrombotic stroke, and COPD, with dose-response
relationships. For all tobacco-related mortality, the relative risk for new quitters
compared with continuing smokers was 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.46,
0.99) for those who had quit two to seven years previously and 0.56 (95%
confidence interval: 0.37, 0.85) for those who had quit eight years or more
previously. The corresponding relative risks were 0.69 and 0.45 for lung cancer,
0.78 and 0.51 for coronary heart disease, 0.76 and 0.84 for thrombotic stroke,
and 0.89 and 0.61 for COPD, respectively (He et al., 2014).

     In the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a cohort study of middle-aged and
     elderly Chinese in Singapore (n=48 251), compared with current smokers, the
     adjusted HR (95% CI) for total mortality was 0.84 (0.76 to 0.94) for new quitters,
     0.61 (0.56 to 0.67) for long-term quitters and 0.49 (0.46 to 0.53) for never-
     smokers. New quitters had a 24% reduction in lung cancer mortality (HR: 0.76,
     95% CI 0.57 to 1.00), and long-term quitters had a 56% reduction (HR: 0.44,
     95% CI 0.35 to 0.57). The risk for coronary heart disease mortality was reduced
     in new quitters (HR: 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.08) and long-term quitters (HR: 0.63,
     95% CI 0.52 to 0.77), although the result for new quitters was of borderline
     significance due to the relatively small number of cardiovascular deaths. The
     risk for chronic pulmonary disease mortality was reduced in long-term quitters
     but increased in new quitters. The authors concluded that significant reduction
     in the risk of total mortality, specifically for lung cancer mortality, can be
     achieved within five years of smoking cessation (Lim, Tai, Yuan, Yu, & Koh, 2013).
