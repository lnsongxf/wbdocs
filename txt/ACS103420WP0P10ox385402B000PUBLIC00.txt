Como em muitos outros países ricos em recursos, o desenvolvimento dos sectores de mineração e do
gás natural em Moçambique tem levantado questões importantes e desafiantes sobre a distribuição
das receitas geradas no sector, particularmente para as áreas afectadas pelas indústrias extractivas.
Estima-se que Moçambique possui vastas reservas de carvão, gás natural e outros recursos minerais. Estes
recursos, se geridos correctamente, têm o potencial de transformar a economia do país através da
aplicação de ganhos que daí resultem no investimento em infra-estruturas e apoio aos esforços de
diversificação da economia e redução da pobreza. Mas a alocação eficiente e equitativa das receitas
provenientes dos recursos naturais é uma tarefa árdua e um desafio para os formuladores de políticas
públicas, os quais frequentemente enfrentam pressões intensas na tomada de decisões visando canalizar
parte do que se colecta aos territórios locais onde a exploração é feita. Neste contexto, estabelecer regras
fiscais claras para a distribuição de receitas, incluindo a sua atribuição obrigatória às comunidades nas
áreas afectadas, pode evitar que as mesmas sejam alvo de influência indevida, garantindo que uma parte
significativa dos retornos da extracção de recursos seja destinada a compensar os custos sociais,
ambientais e de infra-estrutura.

Em 2013, o Governo de Moçambique (GdM) alocou a sete localidades, em três províncias ricas em
recursos naturais, 2,75% dos royalties gerados pelos sectores de mineração e de gás natural. Esta
medida tem fundamento legal nos artigos 19 e 11 das Leis 11/2007 e 12/2007, ambas de 27 de Junho, que
defendem a canalização de uma percentagem (embora não especificada) de royalties para o
desenvolvimento comunitário das zonas de exploração de recursos extractivos. Esta disposição foi
cumprida no orçamento de 2013 (artigo 7 da Lei do Orçamento 1/2013), que concretiza a política de
partilha de receitas, uma vez que inscreve 2,75% das receitas dos royalties para ser partilhado entre as
localidades de Topíto, na província de Nampula; Cateme, 25 de Setembro, Benga e Chipanda II, na
Província de Tete; e Pande e Maimelane, na província de Inhambane. O pressuposto base é que essa
partilha de receitas pode gerar benefícios significativos uma vez que fornecem um financiamento
adicional aos governos locais para enfrentarem os principais desafios de desenvolvimento da comunidade.
Assegurar que estes fundos sejam efetivamente geridos a nível local constitui, no entanto, um desafio
significativo de longo prazo.

Enquanto o tamanho e a trajectória da transferência das receitas de recursos naturais são questões
importantes de política fiscal, o impacto institucional destas transferências nos governos locais é
uma preocupação premente. Actualmente, os recursos partilhados correspondem a uma percentagem
relativamente pequena do total das transferências fiscais para os distritos ricos em recursos naturais. Após
o início previsto das exportações do gás da bacia do Rovuma, no fim da presente década, as receitas
fiscais poderão aumentar, mas se os formuladores de políticas nacionais continuarem a alocar 2,75% do
total das receitas dos recursos naturais aos governos locais, estas transferências continuarão a
corresponder a uma percentagem relativamente pequena do total do envelope de recursos dos distritos
ricos em recursos naturais.

Uma vez que a extracção de recursos e a partilha das receitas são assuntos relativamente novos em
Moçambique e considerando as limitações de capacidade dos governos locais, uma percentagem de
transferência limitada pode ser desejável nesta fase inicial. Todavia, provavelmente será necessário
aumentar a percentagem no futuro para atender tanto os objectivos de desenvolvimento do governo
central assim como os objectivos locais das comunidades afectadas. A eficácia do incremento das
transferências das receitas dependerá da eficiência na gestão das finanças públicas pelos governos locais.
A criação de capacidade será, pois, essencial para o êxito da política de partilha das receitas, assim como
a clarificação das funções e responsabilidades dos diferentes actores envolvidos na execução da despesa.

                                                     1
Por outro lado, acções adicionais serão necessárias para assegurar a participação significativa das
comunidades locais na determinação das prioridades de desenvolvimento social e económico.

Embora altamente positiva, a política de partilha das receitas não constitui ainda uma regra fiscal.
O governo actualmente determina o tamanho da alocação numa base anual com recurso ao poder
discricionário dos formuladores de políticas nacionais, o que levanta preocupações sobre a transparência
das decisões sobre as receitas. Este sistema também cria uma incerteza considerável nos governos locais
relativamente aos seus envelopes de orçamento anual e desencoraja a implementação de projectos
plurianuais. Para solucionar este problema, o governo poderia considerar o estabecimento de um sistema
formal que determine a taxa dos royalties transferíveis para os governos distritais. Isto poderia ser
alcançado através da fixação de uma percentagem a ser transferida, anualmente, num horizonte de tempo
determinado, ou adoptando uma fórmula que reflicta o crescimento projectado do envelope de recursos
provenientes dos royalties, a evolução das necessidades de gastos locais e a capacidade de implementação
dos governos locais.

As receitas dos recursos naturais são instáveis devido a imprevisibilidade da produção e a
volatilidade dos mercados internacionais de commodities; esta instabilidade pode ter impacto nos
orçamentos nos níveis nacional e local. Como solução, o governo central poderia poupar as receitas “em
excesso” durante o período em que os preços das commodities e os seus volumes de produção são altos e,
em seguida, usar estas poupanças durante os períodos subsequentes de redução das receitas. Diversas
variações neste sistema também são possíveis. Por exemplo, (i) o governo pode determinar o valor a ser
transferido com base na média plurianual da receita, ao invés de receitas reais por ano; (ii) poderia
estabelecer um valor mínimo a ser transferido, sobre o qual uma parte de eventuais receitas “em excesso”
pode ser adicionado ou (iii) transferir as receitas recebidas no ano anterior.

É crucial minimizar a volatilidade para a eficácia da partilha das receitas. Enquanto o tamanho ideal
da transferência das receitas de recursos naturais depende das circunstâncias de cada país, a estabilidade
é crucial em todos os casos. Flutuações não controladas de receitas podem comprometer a previsibildade
orçamental dos governos locais, prejudicando a eficiência da política fiscal e desencorajando a
planificação do investimento plurianual a nível local e regional. Por outro lado, a transferência estável e
previsível de recursos financeiros pode ajudar a alcançar os objectivos chave de desenvolvimento através
da construção de capacidada administrativa a nível local e reforço do capital social nas comunidades
afectadas pela extracção de recursos naturais. A transferência das receitas dos recursos naturais é mais
efectiva quando complementada, por um lado, por esforços visando melhorar a selecção, implementação e
avaliação de projectos e, por outro, por processos participativos de tomada de decisão e mecanismos
locais de responsabilização e supervisão.

Atrasos no desembolso das receitas dos recursos naturais comprometem a implementação de planos
de investimento a nível local. Esta situação levanta questões de fundo na gestão das finanças públicas,
uma área crítica para uma economia emergente rica em recursos naturais. Embora uma revisão profunda
da gestão das finanças públicas a nível nacional esteja para além do escopo desta Nota de Políticas, uma
série de acções imediatas podem ser desenvolvidas pelo Ministério das Finanças no sentido de reforçar o
sistema de alocação das receitas dos recursos naturais para as localidades-alvo, ajudando a garantir o
desembolso oportuno de fundos.

Ao longo do tempo, o governo poderia considerar a expansão do sistema de partilha das receitas
para incluir os distritos não-produtores de recursos naturais. Um programa nacional de transferências
fiscais descentralizadas precisa de ser introduzido de forma gradual tendo em conta os constrangimentos
relacionados com a capacidade administrativa, e as lições aprendidas com o actual sistema, o que é
fundamental para o seu sucesso. No entanto, enquanto o alargamento do âmbito de aplicação do sistema
de partilha das receitas oferece muitos potenciais benefícios, este não deve vir em detrimento das áreas
                                                    2
produtoras de recursos naturais, que ostentam uma parte desproporcional dos custos envolvidos na
extracção de recursos. A manutenção da equidade exigirá que áreas produtoras de recursos continuem a
receber transferências suficientes para compensar os impactos negativos (sociais, económicos e
ambientais) da exploração de recursos naturais.

Para promover os objectivos da política nacional, o governo deveria fornecer uma orientação clara
sobre o uso das receitas dos recursos naturais para garantir a conformidade com as prioridades
estabelecidas na circular 1/MPD-MF/2013 e, por outro lado, considerar o uso da abordagem de
desenvolvimento dirigida à comunidade (community driven development ) no sistema de partilha de
receitas. A experiência inicial de partilha de receitas ilustra a extensão com que os padrões de gastos
locais tendem a ser inconsistentes com os objetivos da política tal como definida na mencionada circular.
A estratégia de desenvolvimento de Moçambique enfatiza a necessidade urgente de se resolver o défice
enorme de infra-estruturas no país, e a importância de melhorar o acesso aos serviços e bens públicos
básicos como um princípio orientador para os governos locais. Os governos provinciais deveriam ser
motivados a ajudar as comunidades no estabelecimento de prioridades locais que sejam consistentes com
este objectivo geral bem como na elaboração de planos de desenvolvimento de curto, médio e longo
prazos. Cada comunidade deveria formular um plano para ultrapassar as lacunas locais de infra-estruturas
e alcançar os objectivos específicos de desenvolvimento socioeconómico. Estes planos e metas deveriam
ser regularmente revistos e actualizados a partir de reuniões consultivas envolvendo as partes
interessadas, incluindo funcionários do governo local, líderes comunitários, representantes da sociedade
civil e sector privado. Eles deveveriam ser integrados no Plano Distrital de Desenvolvimento, que fornece
a base para alocar e gerir receitas dos recursos naturais a nível local. Para além da circular 1/MPD-
MF/2013, que define os princípios gerais do sistema de transferência de recursos, o governo poderia
considerar o uso de uma abordagem de desenvolvimento dirigida à comunidade para alocar e gerir as
receitas de recursos naturais a nível local.

Os governos locais deveriam melhorar a transparência orçamental e prestação de contas bem como
reforçar os mecanismos de orçamentação participativa. Governos locais nas zonas afectadas pela
extracção de recursos deveriam publicar informação clara, acessível e detalhada sobre os recebimentos e
uso de receitas advindas dos recursos naturais. Uma maior transparência iria facilitar a tomada de decisão
participativa e promoveria a prestação de contas no uso das receitas dos recursos naturais. Enquanto a
publicação online tornou-se padrão para os relatórios financeiros a nível nacional, as rádios comunitárias,
reuniões públicas e outros canais de comunicação podem ser mais apropriados.

Finalmente, o governo deveria difundir, para todo o país, numa linguagem simples, orientações
relacionadas com o uso das receitas de recursos naturais. Certos elementos da política de transferência
parecem ser bem definidos e geralmente aderidos, tal é o caso do uso imperativo de receitas de recursos
naturais para os gastos de investimento apenas. No entanto, o foco do governo central, relativo ao reforço
de infra-estruturas socio-económicas, não é sempre consistentemente aplicado pelos governos locais.
Estabelecer prioridades detalhadas de despesas para a transferência de receitas de recursos naturais
permitiria uma maior coordenação em prol dos objectivos de desenvolvimento nacional. Equilibrar os
interesses do governo central com a capacidade das autoridades locais para determinar suas próprias
agendas de investimento é e será um desafio constante. A existência de uma orientação explícita sobre os
tipos de infra-estrutura socioeconómica a serem financiados através das receitas dos recursos naturais
pode ajudar a coordenar as decisões de investimento, mas o governo deve estar atento para assegurar que
as comunidades locais retêm um grau significativo de discrição sobre o uso dos fundos transferidos.

                                          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



As in many other resource-rich countries, the development of Mozambique’s mining and natural
gas sectors has raised important and challenging questions regarding the distribution of resource
revenues, particularly in areas directly impacted by the extractive industries. Mozambique is
estimated to possess vast reserves of coal, natural gas and other mineral resources. If they can be managed
properly, these resource reserves have the potential to transform the country’s economy by financing
much-needed infrastructure investment and supporting vital economic diversification and poverty
reduction efforts. However, ensuring that resource revenues are allocated efficiently and equitably
presents a serious challenge, as policymakers often face intense pressures to channel resource rents to
influential constituencies. In this context, establishing clear fiscal rules for revenue sharing, including the
mandatory allocation of rents to communities in affected areas, can help to shield resource revenues from
undue influence and guarantee that a meaningful share of the returns to resource extraction is devoted to
offsetting its social, environmental and infrastructure costs.

In 2013 the Government of Mozambique (GoM) allocated 2.75 percent of the royalties generated by
the mining and natural gas sectors to seven localities in three resource-rich provinces. This policy
builds upon two laws passed on June 27th 2007 (Articles 19 and 11 of Laws 11/2007 and 12/2007), which
mandated that a certain (though unspecified) percentage of resource royalties be earmarked for
community development in the areas in which extractive-industry projects are located. This provision was
fulfilled in the 2013 budget (Article 7 of Budget Law 1/2013), which implemented the revenue-sharing
policy by setting aside 2.75 percent of resource royalties to be divided between the localities of Topito in
Nampula Province; Cateme, 25 de Setembro, Benga and Chipanda II in Tete Province; and Pande and
Maimelane in Inhambane Province. This revenue-sharing policy is expected to generate significant
benefits by providing local governments with the funding necessary to address key community
development challenges. Yet ensuring that these funds can be effectively managed at the subnational level
presents its own set of significant long-term challenges.

While the size and trajectory of resource revenue transfers are important fiscal policy issues, the
institutional impact of these transfers on subnational governments is a more pressing concern. At
present, resource revenue sharing represents a relatively small percentage of total fiscal transfers to
resource-rich districts. After the projected start of gas exports in the Rovuma Basin toward the end of the
decade revenue transfers are expected to increase, but if national policymakers continue to allocate just
2.75 percent of total resource revenues to subnational governments, these transfers will remain a small
percentage of districts’ overall resource envelope. Given that resource extraction and revenue sharing are
both relatively new to Mozambique, and considering the capacity limitations of its subnational
governments, a low transfer rate may be desirable at this stage. However, it will likely become necessary
to increase the transfer rate in the future in order to meet both the central government’s development
objectives and the local goals of affected communities. The effectiveness of increased revenue transfers
will hinge on the expenditure capacity and public financial management efficiency of subnational
governments, and building this capacity will be essential to the success of Mozambique’s resource
revenue policies. No less important is the need to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the different
actors involved in investing resource revenues, and further action will be required to ensure the
meaningful participation of local communities in determining their social and economic development
priorities.

Though a highly positive step, the revenue-sharing policy does not constitute a fiscal rule. The
government currently determines the size of the allocation on an annual basis at the discretion of national
policymakers, which raises concerns regarding the transparency of revenue decisions. This system also

                                                      4
produces considerable uncertainty among local governments regarding their annual budget envelopes and
discourages them from undertaking multiyear projects. To address these issues the government could
consider establishing a formal system for determining the rate at which resource royalties are transferred
to subnational governments. This could be achieved either by fixing a percentage to be transferred
annually over a given time horizon, or by adopting a formula that reflects the projected growth of
resource royalties, the evolution of local spending needs, and the implementation capacity of subnational
governments.

Resource revenues are inherently unstable due to unpredictable production schedules and the
volatility of international commodity markets; left unchecked, this instability can impact budgets at
both the national and local levels. As a remedy, the central government could save excess revenue
during times when commodity prices and production volumes were high, then draw on these savings
during subsequent revenue shortfalls. Several variations on this system are also possible. For example, (i)
the government could determine the transfer amount based on a multiyear revenue average, rather than
actual revenues in each given year; (ii) it could establish a minimum transfer amount to which a share of
any excess windfall revenue could be added or (iii) could simple transfer the revenues received in the
previous year.

Minimizing volatility is crucial to the effectiveness of revenue sharing. While the optimal size of
resource-revenue transfers depends on the unique circumstances of each country, stability is crucial in
every case. Unchecked revenue fluctuations undermine budgetary predictability among subnational
governments, damaging the efficiency of fiscal policy and discouraging multiyear investment planning at
the regional and local levels. Conversely, stable, predictable resource transfers can advance key
development objectives by building subnational administrative capacity and enhancing social capital in
communities affected by resource extraction. Resource-revenue transfers are most effective when
complemented by efforts to improve project selection, implementation and evaluation, and by support for
participatory decision-making processes and local accountability and oversight mechanisms.

Delays in the disbursement of earmarked revenues undermine the implementation of investment
plans at the local level. This underscores larger issues in public financial management and expenditure
execution, two critical policy areas for an emerging resource-rich economy. Although a thorough review
of national-level public financial management is beyond the scope of this policy note, a number of
immediate actions are available to the Ministry of Finance that could greatly strengthen the system for
allocating resource revenues to target localities, helping to ensure the timely disbursement of earmarked
funds.

Over time, the government may consider expanding its revenue-sharing system to include non-
resource-producing districts. A nationwide program of decentralized fiscal transfers would need to be
phased-in gradually to account for administrative capacity constraints, and the lessons learned from the
current system of revenue sharing in resource-producing districts could prove instrumental to its success.
However, while extending the scope of the revenue-sharing system offers many potential benefits, these
should not come at the expense of resource-producing areas, which bear a disproportionate share of the
costs involved in resource extraction. Maintaining equity will require that resource-producing areas
continue receiving sufficient transfers to offset the negative social, economic and environmental impacts
of extractive industries.

To advance its national policy objectives the government must provide clear guidance on the use of
resource revenues to ensure compliance with the priorities set forth in 1/MPD-MF/2013 circular,
yet at the same time it should provide a greater role for community driven development in the
revenue-sharing system. The government’s initial experience with revenue sharing illustrates the extent
to which local spending patterns tend to be inconsistent with the goals of the policy as defined in the
                                                    5
1/MPD-MF/2013 circular. Mozambique’s development strategy emphasizes the urgent need to address
the country’s enormous infrastructure deficit, and the importance of enhancing access to basic public
goods and services should be a guiding principle for local governments. Provincial governments should
be encouraged to assist communities in establishing local priorities that are consistent with this
overarching objective and designing development plans for the short, medium and long terms. Each
locality should formulate a plan to address local infrastructures gaps and achieve specific social and
economic development goals. These plans and goals should be regularly revised and updated through
consultative meetings involving relevant stakeholders, including community leaders, local government
officials, and representatives from civil society and the private sector. They should be incorporated into
the overall District Development Plan, which provides the basis for allocating and managing resource
revenues at the local level. In addition to the 1/MPD-MF/2013 circular, which sets out the broad
principles of the resource-transfer system, the government should consider using a community-driven
development approach for allocating and managing the resource revenues at the subnational level.

Local governments should work to improve budgetary transparency and accountability and
strengthen mechanisms for participatory budgeting. Local governments in areas affected by resource
extraction should publish clear, accessible and detailed information on the receipt and use of resource
revenues. Greater transparency would facilitate participatory decision-making and promote local
accountability for the use of resource revenues. While online publication has become standard for reporting
national-level financial information, at the local level community radio, public meetings and other
communication channels may be more appropriate.

Finally, the government should clarify its nationwide guidelines for the use of resource-revenue
transfers. Certain elements of the transfer policy appear to be well defined and generally adhered to, such
as the mandatory use of resource revenues for investment spending only. However, the central
government’s focus on enhancing economic and social infrastructure is not always consistently applied by
local governments. Establishing more detailed expenditure priorities for resource-revenue transfers would
allow for greater coordination in the pursuit of national development goals, and balancing the interests of
the central government with the ability of local authorities to determine their own investment agendas will
be a continuous challenge. Offering explicit guidance as to which types of socioeconomic infrastructure
are to be financed through resource-revenue transfers may help to coordinate investment decisions, but
the government must be careful to ensure that local communities retain a meaningful degree of discretion
over the use transferred funds.

                                                      INTRODUCTION

1.       Following years of extensive resource exploration and successive large-scale discoveries,
Mozambique is now poised to become a major exporter of natural gas, coal and other valuable
minerals. The country is estimated to possess vast reserves of extractable resources, and in the coming
years it is expected to become a significant force in international commodity markets, not only regionally
but worldwide. Massive coal deposits in Tete Province, in the country’s central-western region, have
attracted the attention of both domestic and international stakeholders. There are currently over 32 billion
tons of confirmed coal deposits in Mozambique, and full exploitation of these resources could make the
country one of the world’s leading coal exporters. Though remarkable, the economic potential of
Mozambique’s coal reserves is dwarfed by its emerging natural gas sector. Natural gas extraction and
processing began in 2004 at the Sasol gas-processing plant in Inhambane, in southern Mozambique, but
the recent discovery of enormous gas fields in the Rovuma Basin, along the border with Tanzania, will
radically transform the structure of the Mozambican economy for decades to come. The Rovuma Basin
holds 130 trillion cubic feet of confirmed gas reserves, and it is likely that further discoveries of
substantial commercial value will be made in the near future. The continued development of the natural
gas sector could allow Mozambique to become a major exporter of liquid natural gas (LNG) and other
hydrocarbon fuel products over the medium term (World Bank 2013).

2.       If managed properly, these resource reserves have the potential to transform Mozambique’s
economy by financing much-needed infrastructure investment, as well as economic diversification
and poverty reduction programs. However, ensuring that resource revenues are allocated efficiently
and equitably presents a serious challenge, as policymakers will continuously face strong pressure to
distribute resource rents to influential constituencies. In this context, establishing clear fiscal rules for
revenue sharing, including the allocation of resources to communities in affected areas, can help to shield
resource revenues from undue influence and guarantee that a share of the returns to resource extraction is
devoted to offsetting its social, environmental and infrastructure costs.

3.       A growing recognition of the considerable risks posed by natural resource development has
prompted increased attention to questions of equity in the distribution of resource revenues,
including the allocation of funds to areas directly affected by extractive industries. The resource
sector is very different from other spheres of economic activity. The extraction and sale of nonrenewable
resources is an inherently unsustainable activity; it frequently generates damaging economic distortions,
especially in countries with undiversified economies and limited policy capacity; and it imposes
considerable negative externalities that impact local communities in resource-rich areas (Stiglitz et al.,
2007). Over time, extractive industries permanently diminish the value of a region’s stock of natural
wealth. In order to justify these costs, nations and communities alike must receive adequate compensation
for their extractable resources, and they must use the revenues from resource extraction to build the
foundation for enduring economic growth (Otto, 2001).1

4.      Beyond the purely economic case for equity, the international experience has shown that
political instability is too often a consequence of the poorly managed development of natural
resources. If economic growth comes at the expense of resource-rich regions, if infrastructure access,
public service delivery and overall living standards rise faster in areas that do not bear the costs of
resource extraction, or if local communities regard themselves as unable to influence decisions about the
use of resource revenues, the perception of distributive injustice may lead to political unrest or open
violence. In recent memory, equity concerns regarding the use of resource revenues have been a major

 The principle of reinvesting resource revenues in productive physical and human capital in order to offset declining natural

5.      Recognizing the importance of ensuring equity in the returns to natural resource
development, governments have designed and tested a variety of systems for offsetting social,
environmental and infrastructure costs of extractive industries. These systems reflect each country’s
unique legal and institutional framework, and each is distinct in terms of its methodology and objectives.
However, the broader principle of revenue sharing has become increasingly accepted as a pillar of
responsible and effective natural resource management.

6.       In this context the Government of Mozambique (GoM) has established a legal framework
for allocating a share of resource revenues to local communities in areas affected by extractive
industries. In 2013 the GoM allocated 2.75 percent of the royalties generated by mining and petroleum to
seven localities in three resource-rich provinces.2 This allocation was mandated in the annual budget law,
and the objectives of the revenue-sharing policy, which focused on boosting broad-based growth and
poverty reduction through accelerated infrastructure investment, were defined in the 1/MPD-MF/2013
circular. This document comprised a set of guidelines issued jointly by the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Planning and Development regarding the management of subnational transfers. However, the
circular was not published until May of 2013, well after the start of the fiscal year, and it provided only
limited guidance on how to utilize the transferred funds. In addition, the disbursement of revenues in
Moatize district was significantly delayed, and by the end of the first half of the fiscal year none of the
earmarked revenues had been transferred.

7.      This note analyzes the institutional and policy context in which Mozambique allocates and
manages resource revenues at the subnational level. Its objectives are (i) to better understand the
extent to which the current revenue-sharing system advances the country’s stated development goals, (ii)
to identify any significant weaknesses or constraints in the current system, and (iii) to provide
recommendations for strengthening the policy framework and institutional mechanisms for sharing
resource revenues. This analysis is informed by the international experience with allocating and managing
resource revenues at the subnational level, and it applies a number of important lessons learned.

8.       The policy note is divided into five sections. Section 1 presents projections for future resource
revenue transfers to subnational governments, both in absolute terms and as a share of each district’s total
budget. Section 2 reviews the international experience with resource sharing and identifies key lessons to
inform successful policies. Section 3 presents a broader look at fiscal decentralization in Mozambique.
Section 4 discusses the main findings of the analysis and situates them in the context of Mozambique’s
current revenue-sharing policies. Section 5 concludes the note by laying out recommendations to improve
Mozambique’s institutional and policy framework for allocating resource revenues at the subnational
level.

9.      This policy note is based on a survey of the international literature on fiscal decentralization
in general and resource revenue sharing in particular. This survey is complemented by the team’s
extensive experience in Mozambique and informed by a thorough review of the legal and policy
documents related to revenue sharing. As part of the groundwork for this analysis a number of meetings
were held with the Ministry of Planning and Development, the National Budget Directorate of the
Ministry of Finance, the Provincial Directorates of Planning and Finance in Nampula and Tete Provinces,
the District Governments of Moma (in Nampula province) and Moatize (in Tete Province) and several

 A share of resource revenues is currently allocated to three provinces: Inhambane, which produces natural gas, Tete, which
produces coal, and Nampula, which produces heavy mineral sands. In the near future the GoM expects to expand its revenue-
sharing program to include other resource-producing areas.

        1. PROJECTED RESOURCE REVENUE TRANSFERS TO SUBNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS

Revenue Transfers to Areas Impacted by Extractive Industries

10.      Resource revenue sharing currently represents a relatively small percentage of total fiscal
transfers to resource-rich districts. Natural gas production in the Rovuma Basin is projected to begin
toward the end of the decade, after which resource revenue transfers will increase. However, assuming
that national policymakers continue to allocate 2.75 percent of resource royalties to subnational
governments, over the near term resource revenue transfers will remain relatively small as a percentage of
the total resource envelope available to the target districts, though they will represent a more substantial
and growing share of district investment budgets.

11.      As part of this policy note an analysis was conducted to gauge the sensitivity of resource
revenue transfers to a variety of shocks. The full analysis is included in the attached Annex, but its
principal conclusions are presented here. Compared with the baseline projections for coal and gas
revenues price shocks of one standard deviation (both positive and negative) produce large variations.
Meanwhile, even relatively modest production shocks also generate considerable revenue volatility.
Moreover, due to Mozambique’s current system of discretionary allocations the share of resource
revenues transferred to subnational governments is itself an additional exogenous variable. At the current
rate of 2.75 percent, resource revenue transfers are expected to rise from US$1 million in 2014 to US$13
million in 2032, and cumulative transfers over the next two decades could exceed US$170 million.
However, this projection depends entirely on the maintenance of the 2.75 percent share.

12.     In extreme scenarios involving price shocks in both the coal and natural gas markets, and
with production slowing in response to these price changes, subnational revenue transfers in 2032
could amount to anywhere between US$9 million and US$16 million. Natural gas revenues are more
sensitive than coal revenues to both price and production shocks. This is demonstrated by the observed
divergence in revenue curves beginning in 2019, when natural gas exports are expected to start in the
Rovuma Basin (see Annex). Price and production shocks in the coal market could cause revenue transfers
to vary between US$11 million and US$14 million by 2032, while in the natural gas sector a price shock
alone could cause revenues to range between US$10 million and US$15 million.



                                                            9
13.      As noted above, the volume of revenue transfers accounts for a relatively small share of the
budget of resource-producing districts. At present, revenue transfers do not amount to more than 5
percent of any district budget, and consequently revenue volatility is not a major concern. However, it is
important to note that at 2.75 percent Mozambique allocates a smaller proportion of its resource revenues
to subnational transfers than do many of its fellow resource-rich developing countries. In the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Nigeria transferred revenues routinely exceed 10 percent3 of total
revenues, while in Cameroon transferred revenues reach 25 percent. These shares are even higher in
developing countries elsewhere in the world, with local communities in both resource-producing and non-
resource-producing districts of Indonesia4 and Peru5 receive as much as 32-50 percent of total resource
revenues. While it is important to respect the absorptive capacity constraints of subnational governments,
Mozambican policymakers may find it necessary to increase the transfer rate in the future in order to meet
public investment objectives in affected communities. In the initial phase, however, the size of revenue
transfers may be less important than their institutional impact on local governments, particularly in terms
of social capital formation and the ability of local authorities to ensure effective stakeholder participation
in investment decisions.

14.     If policymakers were to increase the transfer rate to 15 percent, the amount received by
subnational governments would rise from US$8 million in 2014 to US$69 million in 2032, with
cumulative revenues over the period reaching almost US$1 billion. This would represent a dramatic
increase over the current transfer rate of 2.75 percent, and in this scenario transferred revenues would
form a significant share of local budgets in resource-producing districts. As a result, the impact of
resource revenue volatility would be greatly magnified. For instance, shocks in coal prices and production
volumes could cause revenue transfers to range between US$63 million and US$75 million by 2032.
Alternatively, price shocks affecting both coal and gas could cause revenues to range from US$53 million
to US$84 million by 2032.

15.      15. Increasing the transfer rate to 40 percent of total royalties would cause the total volume
of revenues allocated to resource-producing communities to rise from US$20 million in 2014 to
US$183 million by 2032. At this rate, the amount transferred in 2032 alone would be larger than the total
transfers made to these districts over the entire two-decade period at the current transfer rate of 2.75
percent (US$170 million), while cumulative transfers would amount to as much as US$2.5 billion. Such a
radical increase in the transfer rate would raise significant concerns about local absorptive capacity.
Under this scenario, a price and production shock in the coal sector could cause transfers to range
between US$169 million and US$199 million by 2032, and combined shocks in coal and gas prices could
cause revenues to range between US$142 million and US$224 million by 2032. As a result, managing
revenue volatility at the local level would present a critical challenge.

Sharing Resource Revenues with Non-Resource-Producing Areas

16.      While this policy note focuses on systems for sharing resource revenues with areas impacted
by extractive industries, the extension of revenue sharing to non-resource-producing areas will
likely become an important issue over the longer term. While the current size of resource-revenue
transfers in Mozambique is small, at just 2.75 percent of total revenue, its anticipated growth may raise
political-economy concerns regarding interregional equity. Just as a failure to share the benefits of
resource extraction with resource-producing communities may provoke political tensions, so too may the
exclusion of non-producing regions from the revenue-sharing system.

17.     Nationwide revenue transfers would need to be scaled-up slowly to account for local
capacity constraints, and the experience of the subnational governments currently involved in
revenue sharing could yield important lessons to guide the implementation of a national system. The
government could begin by setting a target for the number of districts to be included the revenue-sharing
system each year, with an overarching goal of reaching all districts by a given year, and transfer amounts
to each district could be gradually increased over time. Gradual expansion would also be crucial to avoid
rivalry between resource-producing and non-resource-producing districts, as it would be important to
ensure that the latter do not benefit at the expense of the former. Box 1, below, describes the challenges
faced by Brazil in extending its revenue-sharing system to non-resource-producing areas.

                                     Box 1: Resource-Revenue Sharing in Brazil

In Brazil, states and municipalities in which extractive industries are located receive 26.3 percent and 35
percent of resource royalties, respectively.6 Meanwhile, non-resource-producing states and municipalities
receive only 8.8 percent of resource royalties, which are disbursed via the State Participation Fund and the
Municipal Participation Fund (Barroso and Araujo, 2013). The distribution of revenue from petroleum
products is especially skewed in favor of oil-producing states. The states of Rio de Janeiro and Espírito
Santo, and the oil-producing municipalities within them, receive the lion’s share of petroleum royalties.
Rio de Janeiro alone received about 80 percent of petroleum royalties between 1999 and 2012 (ibid.).

Under a new revenue-sharing rule adopted in 2012 (Law 12.734/12), the share of resource revenues
earmarked for transfer to non-producing states and municipalities was increased to 49 percent, while the
share allocated to resource-producing states and municipalities was reduced to 22 percent and 7 percent,
respectively. The new law also changed the distribution rules for revenue from newly developed oil
fields, again favoring non-oil-producing states and municipalities. The large and sudden shift in revenue
allocation became a source of significant controversy, and three oil-producing states filed injunction
claims at the Supreme Court challenging the new law. The court has not yet resolved the case, but it has
suspended the law due to its potentially damaging effects on the finances of certain subnational
governments.

18.      Ensuring that revenue transfers to resource-producing areas do not decline in absolute
terms could provide a useful principle to mitigate the political risks involved in expanding the
revenue-sharing system. The projected increase in total resource revenues will open fiscal space to
extend revenue-sharing without forcing a shift in revenues from producing to non-producing areas.
However, the government should continue to bear in mind that offsetting the localized costs incurred by
extractive industries is a key objective of resource-revenue sharing, and revenue transfers to resource-rich
areas must at least offset the social, economic and environmental damage caused by resource extraction.
Ultimately the government must consider issues of both equity and equality when determining the
optimal allocation of natural resource revenues.

    The shares differ between the first and the second half of the royalty rate. Thus, the number presented is the average.
                                                                   11
                2. THE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH RESOURCE-REVENUE SHARING

Resource-Revenue Sharing in Selected Countries

19.      Systems for sharing resource revenue at the subnational level are becoming increasingly
common worldwide. Table 2, below, provides a brief overview of these systems and their governing
legislation. In some cases allocations are completely discretionary, raising issues of transparency and
predictability (Brosio and Singh, 2013). Recognizing the importance of establishing clear fiscal rules to
guide revenue sharing, governments have worked to develop appropriate regulations for allocating and
managing resource revenues. In Uganda, for example, the Mining Act of 2003 entitles the central
government to 80 percent of all mining royalties, while local governments in mining-affected areas
receive 17 percent, and the owner of the land from which the resources are extracted receives 3 percent.
Under the Democratic Republic of Congo’s 2002 Mining Law, 60 percent of resource revenues are
allocated to the national government and 40 percent to the provincial authorities, of which 10 percent
goes to local communities resource-producing areas. Cameroon’s 2002 Mining Code allocates 75 percent
of mineral royalties to the central government and 25 percent to local authorities, while its 1999 Forestry
Law evenly splits logging royalties between the local and national governments.7

20.      This trend towards statutory resource sharing is not restricted to Sub-Saharan Africa, and
similar laws have proliferated in Latin America. With the exception of Argentina, a classic federal
system, and Ecuador, subnational governments in both resource-producing and non-resource-producing
areas of Latin America typically have direct access to a portion of resource rents. In many cases revenue
sharing is among the few mechanisms available for addressing interregional economic disparities. This is
particularly true of Bolivia, Brazil and Peru (Brosio and Jiménez, 2012). Latin American countries also
exhibit considerable variation in the scope of resource transfers. While most Sub-Saharan African
countries allocate only a modest share of resource revenues to subnational governments, some Latin
American countries have experimented with large-scale revenue sharing. In Peru, for example, fifty
percent of income taxes paid by resource-sector firms and 100 percent of resource royalties are
transferred to subnational governments. However, in order to be effective revenue transfers must account
for local capacity constraints. A recent World Bank paper on the limited spending capacity of subnational
authorities argued that increases in transfers to subnational governments should be gradual and
complemented by measures to improve public financial management (Loayza et al., 2011).

                                    Box 2: Resource Revenue Sharing in Colombia

In Colombia, resource royalties are levied according to the value of production, with tax rates varying for different resources. Oil
taxes range from 8 to 25 percent, and rates progressively increase in line with the daily volume of production. Compensation
agreements include specific references to transportation infrastructure costs, environmental damage, and the social and cultural
impact of extractive industries. Municipalities that do not produce resources but whose territory is crossed by oil and gas
pipelines receive a share of the transportation taxes collected by the central government. Finally, indigenous communities are
entitled to a share of royalties levied on oil fields and mines situated no further than 5 km from their settlements. This share
amounts to 5 percent of royalties accruing to the local admnistrative department and 20 percent of royalties accruing to the local
municipality.

Colombian law regulates how these resources may be invested by the various subnational governments and public agencies that
receive them. Most of these resources must be used for investment in priority projects included in the General Development Plan
for each local administrative department. According to Article 15 of Law 141 of 1994 shared royalties and direct compensation
paid to local governments are designed for the following purposes:
         90 percent must be invested in development projects included in the General Development Plan, with priority given to
          projects in the environmental, health, education, electricity, and water and sanitation sectors;
         5 percent must be used for the technical supervision of these projects; and
         5 percent must be used to cover operational expenses, with as much as half used to pay management and administrative
          costs incurred by the national agencies tasked with the collection and distribution of royalties and other forms of
          compensation.

According to the Law on Royalties, the National Royalties Committee must consider the following criteria for the allocation of
resource revenues:

                                                                      13
         Regional differences in social and economic indicators as illustrated in the National Index of Unfulfilled Needs;
         The importance of promoting equitable and complementary development across regions;
         The environmental, social, and economic impacts of proposed investment projects;
         The environmental, social, and economic impacts of the extraction, transportation and processing of natural resources;
         The financing needs of regional development plans; and
         The relative population size of each region.
Colombian law explicitly considers equity criteria in revenue sharing. Under Law 756, as long as indicators such as infant
mortality, health and education outcomes, and water and sanitation access fail to meet basic thresholds, at least 60 percent of total
resource royalties must be allocated to these sectors.

21.     In Indonesia, the fiscal decentralization framework requires the central government to
allocate a share of the income from natural resources to provincial and local governments. Under
Law 33/2004, mandatory revenue sharing not only covers the oil and gas sectors, but also includes other
general mining operations, geothermal energy production, forestry and fishing. Revenue-sharing
arrangements differ according to the type of natural resources, the level of government, and whether or
not the recipient is located in a resource-producing region. Regional governments typically retain 80
percent of the revenues from natural resource extraction, with the exception of oil and gas. The flows and
shares of natural resource revenues are illustrated in Figure 1, below.

Discretionary Allocations versus Revenue Formulas

22.      There are advantages and disadvantages involved in both discretionary and formula-based
systems for sharing resource revenues. Under a fully discretionary system revenue allocations are
determined each year by national policymakers. In principle this should enable the government to adjust
allocations to reflect evolving priorities, including the maintenance of fiscal stability. In practice,
however, excessive discretion can leave policymakers vulnerable to pressure from powerful
constituencies, potentially threatening the transparency and efficiency of revenue sharing. Meanwhile, the
inherent unpredictability of discretionary budgeting can create uncertainty at the subnational level and
discourage the implementation of multiyear projects. Conversely, formula-based systems can promote
transparency in allocation decisions and enhance budgetary predictability, but the built-in rigidity of
allocation formulas limits their ability to adapt to new circumstances, and in some cases these systems
may tend to encourage fiscal procyclicality (Bahl, 2000).

23.     Worldwide, very few countries have chosen to use fully discretionary systems for allocating
resource revenues, and nearly all have adopted fiscal rules or guidelines that limit the discretion of
policymakers. The formulas that govern resource revenue sharing differ significantly from one country to
the next, and the international experience reveals a number of important lessons regarding the particular
merits and drawbacks of different approaches.

Revenue Volatility and Local Capacity Constraints

24.      Natural resource revenues are inherently volatile due to both the unpredictable nature of
resource production and the chronic instability of global commodity prices. Because of the wider
range of financial instruments at their disposal, central governments are typically better equipped to
manage these revenue fluctuations than are local authorities. Local governments are often forced to
respond to unanticipated revenue shortfalls with sudden expenditure cuts, which not only threaten to
derail multiyear investment projects, but may even endanger the provision of essential public services.
Conversely, revenue spikes can overwhelm a local government’s capacity to use resources effectively,
which may incentivize corruption and waste, or encourage policymakers to enter into unsustainable long-
term spending commitments. Inadequate expenditure capacity and limited access to appropriate savings
mechanisms are also frequently a concern at the national level, but these issues tend to be much more
severe among subnational governments and individual public agencies. Moreover, the central government
is generally the optimal place to address these issues, as volatile resource revenues often accrue to the
national government first. Consequently, actions to mitigate volatility at the national level can smooth
revenue fluctuations across the entire public administration, obviating the need for each local government
to adopt its own mitigation strategy (Brosio and Jiménez, 2012).

25.     Even when national governments have adopted appropriate measures to stabilize revenue
inflows, some degree of budgetary volatility may still be transmitted to subnational governments.
Using inherently unreliable resource revenues to fund either current expenditures or multiyear investment
projects carries an elevated risk that subnational governments may be ill equipped to manage. The use of
resource revenues to finance current expenditures has proven especially problematic, prompting a number
of countries, particularly in Latin America, to restrict resource revenues to investment projects only
(Brosio and Jiménez, 2012).




                                                   15
Options to Address Revenue Volatility and Boost Local Absorption Capacity

26.      A number of policy instruments can be used to address revenue volatility. Governments can
hedge against risk by setting up stabilization funds and by introducing fiscal rules governing the use of
resource revenues. In principle, futures markets could also be used to smooth revenue fluctuations over
time, but in practice their usefulness is constrained by inadequate information, high transaction costs and
political-economy concerns. In some cases subnational stabilization funds have been established to allow
windfall income to be saved and drawn upon when needed, but thus far these mechanisms have only been
employed highly developed countries such as the United States and Canada.

27.      Some countries have adopted fiscal rules that impose a ceiling on the debt-to-revenue ratios
of local governments or that explicitly link expenditure growth to the growth of revenues. Each type
of rule aims to curb the deficit bias of fiscal policy in order to maintain a manageable debt burden.
However, fiscal rules tend to be most useful during revenue spikes, when they help to prevent
unsustainable expenditure decisions from threatening the local government’s long-term fiscal stance.
These rules are less effective at maintaining adequate spending levels during revenue shortfalls unless
they can be linked to a stabilization fund or a similar savings mechanism.

28.      In many cases local governments lack the institutional knowledge and administrative
capacity necessary to design and implement more sophisticated policies for managing resource
revenues. Poorly developed systems for revenue management can threaten transparency and
accountability and reduce the efficiency of local policy actions (UNDP/World Bank, 2005). To address
these concerns, local governments in resource-rich areas must build their capacity to manage revenues
effectively, and national governments and their development partners should ensure that training and
support are available to local authorities. This is particularly urgent in Mozambique, where a revenue-
sharing system is currently being implemented, but where the specifics of revenue management are not
yet fully understood by subnational governments. In order to maximize the impact of revenue transfers
Mozambique and its development partners must work to improve the organizational, technical and
financial capabilities of subnational governments, enabling them to effectively manage their inherently
volatile and swiftly growing revenue streams.

Equity Concerns in Revenue-Sharing Systems

29.     Most extractive industries are focused on a relatively small number of geographic areas,
which bear an inordinate share of the costs associated with resource extraction. Resource revenue
sharing can only be consistent with equity concerns if it provides meaningful compensation to resource-
producing areas. This compensation should be adequate not only to offset the immediate economic, social
and environmental costs incurred by the presence of extractive industries, but should also be sufficient to
finance the long-term development of the region’s non-resource economy, ensuring that it is capable of
delivering a consistent stream of returns even as its natural wealth stock is inevitably depleted (Bahl,
2002).

30.     Equity concerns may arise from either inadequate or excessive compensation. The size of
incoming revenues should reflect the cost considerations described above, neither disproportionately
favoring the interests of communities in resource-rich areas, nor failing to appreciate them. In
Mozambique, the recently created Zambezi Valley Development Agency (Agência de Desenvolvimento
do Vale do Zambeze – ADVZ) can play an important role in ensuring an equitable distribution of benefits
to communities in the Zambezi Valley, both in areas that produce extractable resources and in those that
do not.


                                                    16
31.     Currently the ADVZ’s budget, which is also financed by resource revenues, far exceeds the
amount of the resource revenues transferred to subnational governments. In 2013 the ADVZ
received MZN 94.4 million, while just MZN19.2 million were transferred directly to production-affected
areas in the region (i.e. Moatize, Govuro, Inhassoro and Moma Districts). Going forward, it will be
important to ensure that the operations of the ADVZ are well coordinated with complementary public
investment efforts at the district level. It is still too early to determine whether Mozambique’s current
resource revenue-sharing system will be adequate to account for the costs of its nascent extractive
industry sector, or to overcome the larger issues involved in the nationwide distribution of revenues
described above, but equity concerns should be a guiding principle for policymakers as the system
continues to evolve.


                               3. FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION IN MOZAMBIQUE

32.      Mozambique’s political structure is divided into three levels: (i) the central government, (ii)
provincial governments, (iii) and district governments and municipalities. The legal basis for
municipalities was established in 1997 (Law 2/97), while the broader framework for decentralized
governance is regulated by the 2003 Law of Local Public Administrations (Lei dos Órgãos Locais do
Estado), which establishes the principles, competencies and functions of provincial, district and local
authorities. Under this law, the district is the focus of local administration, planning, economic, social,
and cultural development. Mozambique is progressively increasing the size of budgetary transfers to
subnational authorities, though these transfers are still relatively low as a share of total fiscal resources.
Districts are increasingly responsible for salary payments, and as a result increases in district spending
tend to be weighted toward recurrent expenditures. Municipal resources remain very modest in both
absolute and relative terms, but the municipal revenue structure is rapidly evolving.

Municipalities

33.      Public finance management reforms adopted in 2008 modernized municipal taxes, greatly
expanding their potential own-source revenue base. While municipalities are responsible for the bulk
of tax collection, the vast majority of taxes are levied by the central government and most revenues are
channeled to it. While municipalities have the administrative structure necessary for local tax collection,
their authority to levy taxes is limited. As a result, municipalities depend largely on transfers from the
central government to finance local spending.

34.      Municipalities receive a variety of transfers from the central government. These include the
municipal compensation fund (FCA), the strategic fund for the reduction of urban poverty (PERPU)8 and
the Road Fund. The total resource amount varies by type of transfer. The FCA initially received 3 percent
of total national tax revenue, but this was reduced to 1.5 percent after the tax system was modernized. The
investment fund for municipal initiatives (FIIA) receives 0.75 percent of national tax revenue (thought
this is not defined in the law), the PERPU receives MZN140 million (approximately US$4.4 million)
each year regardless of tax levels, and the Road Fund receives 10 percent of fuel-tax revenues.

The Provincial and District levels

35.     Revenue collection at the provincial and district levels is much more limited. Taxes collected
by provinces and districts are shared with the central government, but little information is available as to

8
  The PERPU aims to generate employment and promote social protection. Loans are provided, which need to be repaid so that
funds can be lent again, as part of a ‘rotating fund.’
                                                            17
how this sharing system operates. Districts and provinces also levy certain user charges, including fees for
commercial licenses and the use of public markets. Provinces and districts are free to set either nominal or
ad valorem rates for the revenue types they collect, as long as these rates conform to a number of general
criteria, such as equity concerns and ability to pay.

36.      There are three main types of fiscal transfer to subnational governments. The largest is a
block grant transferred to provinces for financing provincial- and district-level expenditures. In principle,
this transfer is allocated based on population size and local poverty rates. Districts also receive two
additional grants directly from the central government, a district investment fund (FID) and a district
development fund (FDD). FID is a budgetary allocation for the construction and rehabilitation of district
infrastructures. The FDD is a rotating fund that focuses on food production, employment and income
generation at the individual level. Although this is ostensibly a lending mechanism, repayment rates
appear to be low.

                                4. RESOURCE-REVENUE SHARING IN MOZAMBIQUE

The Legal and Policy Framework

37.     In 2013 the GoM allocated 2.75 percent of the royalties generated by the mining and
natural gas sectors to seven localities in three resource-rich provinces. This policy builds upon two
laws passed in 2007 (Articles 19 and 11 of Laws 11/2007 and 12/2007), which mandated that a certain
(though unspecified) percentage of resource royalties be earmarked for community development in the
areas in which extractive-industry projects are located. This provision was fulfilled in the 2013 budget
(Article 7 of Budget Law 1/2013), which implemented the revenue-sharing policy by setting aside 2.75
percent of resource royalties to be divided between the localities of Topito in Nampula Province; Cateme,
25 de Setembro, Benga and Chipanda II in Tete Province; and Pande and Maimelane in Inhambane
Province.

38.     This revenue-sharing policy is designed to provide local governments with the funding
necessary to address key community development challenges. Yet ensuring that these funds can be
effectively managed at the subnational level presents its own set of significant long-term challenges.
Currently, the amount allocated is based on the revenues collected in each jurisdiction according to the
so-called “derivation principle.” Although this share is relatively low, the size of the 2013 transfer is
already straining the expenditure capacity of the target localities. Given the projected rise in resource
revenues over the medium term, maintaining the quality of public spending in these areas will continue to
present a major concern.

39.      In Mozambique, royalty payments for mineral and natural gas extraction are based on the
sale prices of these commodities at the time of production. If no sales are made, the international
market price is used to determine the value of the quantity extracted.9 For natural gas products, the royalty
tax is determined by applying the weighted average prices of different hydrocarbon fuels at main
international export centers.10

40.      Direct transfers to affected communities overlap with broader regional development
initiatives that are also financed by resource revenues. In addition to the 2.75 percent of total resource
revenues allocated to local communities, Ministerial Diploma 107/MPD/GM/2013 issued by the Ministry
of Planning and Development and the Ministry of Finance in 2013 allocates a full 25 percent of revenues
from the production tax and surface tax to the Zambezi Valley Development Agency ( Agência de

    Article 7 of Law 11/2007.
10
    Article 5 of Law 12/2007.

Desenvolvimento do Vale do Zambeze – ADVZ). The remaining percentage of revenues is retained by the
central government and used to finance the national budget. The ADVZ is the successor to the
Department for Development Planning in the Zambezi Region (Gabinete do Plano de Desenvolvimento
da Região do Zambeze) and receives a share of the resource royalties collected in the Zambezi Valley.
The ADVZ’s core responsibilities include (i) undertaking studies and presenting strategies for the
economic and social development of the Zambezi Valley region, (ii) providing technical and financial
assistance to economic and social development initiatives, including the mobilization of resources and the
targeting of beneficiaries, (iii) working with local governments on planning and land-use issues, as well
as broader socioeconomic development strategies.11 The Zambezi Valley includes all of Tete Province,
where the mining firms Rio Tinto and Vale Moçambique are currently developing coal fields.

41.     Following the passage of Laws 11/2007 and 12/2007 and Article 7 of Budget Law 1/2013, the
Ministry of Planning and Development and Ministry of Finance issued the 1/MPD-MF/2013
circular,12 which describes the type of projects to be funded through resource revenue transfers.
According to the circular, eligible projects are aimed at building socioeconomic infrastructure in
communities affected by resource extraction. Target sectors include:

                  Education;
                  Healthcare;
                  Agriculture;
                  Forestry;
                  Commercial facilities such as public markets;
                  Roads, bridges and other transportation infrastructure; and
                  Water and sanitation systems.

42.      According to the circular these projects should be implemented in coordination with the
District and Provincial Sector Authorities, i.e. the Provincial Directorate and District Service
Agencies. The District Secretary is responsible for the management of the funds. While the circular
provides general guidance on how revenues should be invested, determining specific projects is the
responsibility of the local community. Project proposals must originate from communities directly
affected by extractive industries, and they must be evaluated, approved and prioritized by the local
Advisory Council. The proposed projects must be implemented within the territory of the locality; they
must be social and economic viable and sustainable; and they must maximize the use of the local human
capital and other productive resources.

43.      The Provincial Government of Tete issued the Ofício 57/DPPFT/Gab-Dir/58 on August 15,
2013, which broadly defines its investment priorities. The document allocates 30 percent of transferred
resource revenues to community infrastructure projects and 70 percent to projects aimed at increasing
food production, generating employment and raising incomes. Project objectives are determined using the
same criteria as the District Development Fund. Meanwhile, local authorities in Moma District, Nampula
Province, prioritized investment in local public administration facilities and communications
infrastructure.

Allocating Resource Revenues to Subnational Governments

44.       Development strategy at the district level is based on two overarching plans, the Strategic
Plan for District Development and the District Social and Economic Plan and Budget. Local
Advisory Councils assist in identifying development priorities and incorporating them into the District
Social and Economic Plan and Budget. District-level plans are then used to inform the Provincial Social
and Economic Plan and Budget, which in turn informs the National Social and Economic Plan and the
State Budget, which are formulated jointly by the Ministry of Planning and Development and the
Ministry of Finance. In principle, all projects to be implemented at district level should be incorporated
into district planning documents, but in practice this is not always the case.

45.      Resource revenue transfers between the central government and subnational
administrations are defined in the budget law. The funds are deposited in a specific account at each
District Office earmarked for local community development. Once the funds are available, the District
Office allocates financing to projects approved by the local Advisory Council. As noted above, these
projects must meet the following criteria: project proposals must originate from communities directly
affected by extractive industries; the projects themselves must be deemed necessary by the community,
and they must be evaluated, approved and prioritized by the local Advisory Council; all projects must be
implemented within the territory of the locality; and they must be socially and economically viable and
sustainable. In addition, local governments must use the transferred funds in accordance with relevant
laws on public financial administration, as is the case with other types of public resources.

46.     The share of resource revenues allocated to subnational governments is determined
annually as part of the budget process.13 Consequently, it is unknown what share will be set aside in
future budgets, or what the nominal amount of future revenue transfers will be. This system of annual
decisions generates considerable uncertainty on the part of local governments and discourages sound
budget management and multiyear investment planning.14

47.      Moreover, revenue volatility has generated significant disparities between the amounts
initially budgeted for revenue sharing and the amounts that were ultimately transferred. In 2013 the
national budget originally approved transfers of MZN32.8 million to local governments in areas impacted
by extractive industries. This was based on projections of resource royalties at the start of the fiscal year,
but by the end of the year only MZN19.2 million (US$629.9 thousand) had been transferred out of a total
of MZN698.1 million (US$22.9 million) collected. This difference was caused in part by the interruption
of coal exports in Moatize District due to flooding, highlighting the inherent volatility of resource
production. The MZN22.3 million initially budgeted for Moatize was revised downward to MZN8.6
million.15 And by the end of 2013 Moatize had received only 85 percent of the revised MZN8.6 million
meticais. The district government expected to receive the final tranche of the transfer in January of 2014,
but as of April it had still not been disbursed. Nationwide, actual resource revenue transfers equaled just
58.4 percent of the initial budgeted amount.

48.      Although the regulatory framework provides for the failure to transfer funds allocated to
subnational government, these provisions are not sufficient to ensure budgetary predictability.
According to the Ministry of Finance, any funds allocated to subnational governments that are not
transferred within the year are automatically added to the amount allocated for transfer in the following
year’s budget. In addition, any unspent balances from resource revenues remaining at the end of the fiscal
year are collected by the National Treasury Directorate and carried over to the following year’s budget.

subnational budgets, they do little to mitigate budgetary uncertainty in any given year.

49.     The difference between budgeted amounts and actual disbursements compromised the
implementation of development plans at the subnational level. When the first disbursement of
resource revenues reached the authorities in Tete Province, Moatize’s district government announced it
and encouraged local communities to submit project proposals according to the approved procedures.
However, the significant reduction in the amount allocated to Moatize frustrated community expectations,
and only a small fraction of eligible projects could ultimately be funded.

50.      These problems were exacerbated by delays in the disbursement schedule. Although officials
in Moatize’s government could monitor the amount budgeted for their district through Mozambique’s
financial management database,17 the initial funding tranche only became available in September.
According to the Provincial Directorate of Finance in Tete and the National Treasure Directorate in
Maputo, the delay in disbursement was due to technical problems with the classification of royalty
revenues in the database and the transfer of funds to the Single Treasury Account. These delays may recur
in 2014, as Moatize and Moma districts had not yet received any revenue transfers by April 2014 despite
these transfers appearing in the government’s execution report (Relatório de Execução Orçamental:
Janeiro-Março 2014). The considerable uncertainty surrounding the size and schedule of revenue
transfers has dissuaded district governments from pursuing multiyear projects regardless of their potential
benefits to local communities.

51.      Provincial and district governments have received limited guidance on how to use
transferred resource revenues. General guidelines were provided in the 1/MPD-MF/2013 circular
published by the Ministry of Planning and Development and the Ministry of Finance several months into
the fiscal year. Given the administrative capacity constraints facing local governments in Mozambique, as
well as the relative novelty of the revenue-sharing system, additional information on how best to utilize
these funds will be critical to ensure that spending decisions among provincial and district governments
are consistent with the government’s development objectives and the goals of the revenue-sharing policy.

52.     Due to the limited guidance offered in the circular and its late publication, projects financed
with resource revenues generally failed to reflect the central government’s prioritization of
investment in social and economic infrastructure. For example, Tete’s provincial government allocated
just 30 percent of its resource revenues for community infrastructure, while 70 financed various projects
aimed at bolstering food production, generating employment and increasing incomes according to the
same criteria used by the District Development Fund (FDD). Although an important policy instrument,
the goals of the District Development Fund are not always consistent with the policy objective of the
resource-sharing program, particularly given the latter’s focus on building socioeconomic infrastructure in
communities affected by resource extraction.

53.      While provincial and district governments are deliberately granted significant latitude in
defining local development objectives, it is important that these objectives be well coordinated and
contribute to broader national goals. As these goals have been inadequately defined, with limited
guidance provided on how to advance them, project selection has been unsystematic,18 and some local
authorities have tended to pursue the objectives of pre-existing programs with which they were already
familiar, such as the District Development Fund. However, the aims of these programs are not always
consistent with the central government’s spending rules that govern resource revenue transfers.

  The District Government of Moatize used a small share of its funds to build one water pump in Moatize-Sede and repair
another. This was the extent of its infrastructure investment. Meanwhile, the district financed 14 projects aimed at increasing
food production, employment and incomes. See: “Governo da Província de Tete. Relatório específico sobre o impacto das
receitas geradas na exploração mineira destinada a promoção do desenvolvimento comunitário. ” February 2014.
                                                                22
54.      In addition to the guiding principles for resource revenue transfers set out in the 1/MPD-
MF/2013 circular, the GoM should consider drawing on community-driven development (CDD)
approaches to the allocation and management of the resource revenues at the subnational level.
Many countries have used CDD grants to finance community infrastructure during the early stages of
their revenue-transfer systems, only later moving to programs focused on individual beneficiaries (such as
the FDD). Based on this experience, subnational governments in Mozambique should focus on using
revenue transfers to finance community infrastructure, rather than food production, employment or
income generation, at this stage in the development of the transfer system. This would require that local
governments adhere more closely to the 1/MPD/MF/2013 circular and its emphasis on infrastructure
investment. Drawing on CDD techniques can help subnational government to build productive
infrastructure by mobilizing and developing the capacities of local communities. As communities expand
their ability to collaborate with local governments, they can begin to pursue a wider range of objectives
beyond infrastructure development. By vesting decision-making power in local communities rather than
regional or nation authorities, CDD seeks to empower the poor and encourage more democratic and
participatory forms of local governance (Guggenheim at al., 2004).

55.       Box 3, below, provides a brief overview of the CDD approach.


                              Box 3: Community Driven Development in Indonesia

THE KECAMATAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (KDP) is an initiative launched by the Government of Indonesia aimed
at alleviating poverty in rural communities and improving local governance. In 2004 the project covered 28,000 villages spread
across 30 of Indonesia’s 34 provinces. KDP provides block grants of between US$40,000 and US$114,000 directly to sub-
districts and villages to finance small-scale infrastructure, social and economic activities.

How KDP works
A facilitated planning process helps villagers decide how to use the funds offered through the program, which are made available
each year for up to five years. The funds are distributed within each sub-district through a sub-district forum. The forum consists
of village heads and local civil-society leaders, as well as three additional representatives (one man and two women) selected
from each participating village. The sub-district forum designates a Financial Management Unit to manage KDP funds and to
oversee any large procurement orders. The KDP project cycle includes six stages: (i) information and awareness; (ii) planning;
(iii) proposal preparation and verification; (iv) funding decisions; (v) implementation; and (vi) follow-up. Community
participation and transparency are emphasized at each stage of the process.

Information and Awareness
Communities are provided with information about the KDP systems through workshops held at the provincial, district and sub-
district levels. These workshops involve community leaders, local government officials, local media outlets, educational
institutions and NGOs.

Planning
Planning meetings occur at the village and sub-village levels. Facilitators disseminate information about KDP procedures and
encourage villagers to submit ideas for KDP funding. Women also hold their own separate meetings to formulate proposals. At
the second round of meetings, villagers’ ideas are discussed and the forum decides which ideas the village should propose to the
sub-district forum.

Proposal Preparation and Verification
Each village can submit up to three proposals to the forum. One of these must come from the women’s meeting and a second
from the women’s savings and loan group. The proposal format is very simple, providing basic information on the proposed
project’s location, number of beneficiaries, and general characteristics; it may include a rough cost estimation. The community
also selects a proposal preparation team to be trained by the facilitator. Proposals can include a range of social, economic and
infrastructure-related activities. Verification of the proposals’ technical elements occurs during the proposal review stage. The
sub-district verification team usually includes community leaders, sub-district facilitators, and appropriate technical staff
recommended by the District Engineer. The District Engineer also does a final check before the results of the verification are
presented to the sub-district forum. The verification team reviews proposals for (i) technical and economic feasibility; (ii) number
of beneficiaries and pro-poor targeting; (iii) provisions for long-term operating costs and/or debt service payments; (iv) plans for
maintenance and upkeep plans (or repayment plans in the case of economic loans) in place; (v) community participation in

                                                                23
proposal development; and (vi) local community buy-in.
Verification reports are presented to the forum. If any proposals are found to be unfeasible, these issues would be discussed with
the communities at the time of the visit, so that the proposal could be modified, or the community could understand the reason for
its rejection. However, while facilitators can recommend rejection, the communities must still make the decision themselves. The
verification phase usually takes three to four weeks and is crucial to screen projects for overall quality.

Project Selection
All proposals are discussed in the second forum meeting to determine a priority ranking. High-ranking proposals are subject to
detailed design and cost estimation. Project designs are developed by the village with assistance from the facilitator. These
designs are based on the results of technical surveys undertaken with community participation. Designs are discussed and
approved by the village and the facilitator, and then inspected by the district Management and Technical Consultant. Once the
designs are ready, the villages meet one more time to determine which proposals will be funded A grant agreement is prepared
for the chosen projects, which includes the specifics of the project’s design, its budget, a map, the commitment for community
contributions, and other requirements. It is then signed by the manager for KDP, the village chief, and the head of the Activity
Management Unit. The forum selects an independent oversight team to monitor all aspects of project implementation. On
average, a minimum of six elected representatives (three of whom must be women) from each village in the sub-district attend
these meetings. Final decisions from the forum meeting are posted on KDP information boards and shared with villagers at a
third village-level meeting, as well as smaller sub-village and group meetings.

Financial Management and Accounts
The head of the sub-district financial unit, the sub-district facilitator and a village representative open a KDP account at a legally
registered bank. Once the project agreements have been finalized, they are endorsed by the local government project officer, and
a copy is sent to the Office of the Treasury. The Treasury then orders an initial transfer to the KDP bank account. Funds are
disbursed in three tranches of 40 percent, 40 percent and 20 percent. Villages must provide reports to the community on the use
of the funds after each tranche has been utilized. The final 20 percent cannot be disbursed until a progress certificate has been
signed by the District Engineer.

Managing KDP II
At the national level, the Deputy for Regional Development for the National Development Planning Agency heads the National
Coordination Team that provides oversight, strategic planning, and evaluation for the KDP. The management of the KDP is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs Community Development Agency, which handles its day-to-day operations.
Government coordination teams representing various ministries also assist with the KDP. This structure is replicated at the
provincial and district levels. Each level of government is supported by teams of consultants who contribute to the technical
implementation of the program.

Participation, Transparency and Accountability

56.      Preliminary assessments of Mozambique’s revenue-sharing system indicate that local
Advisory Councils are not participating as actively in the management of resource revenues as
envisioned in the 1/MPD-MF/2013 circular. Local councils often have little information regarding the
availability of resource revenues or the procedures for utilizing them. In addition, their opportunity to
participate in the allocation and management of these funds is constrained by the lead role of the district
administrator. For example, in the locality of Topito, Moma District, the local council and the district
government had different priorities. The local council wanted to use the funds to build a vocational
school, while the district government prioritized local administration facilities and communications
infrastructure. While the local council’s proposal was arguably aligned more closely with the objectives
of the 1/MPD-MF2013 circular, the district government ultimately opted to pursue its own agenda. The
limited clout of local councils also raises questions of equity in the distribution of funds at the community
level, and in Moatize District village leaders have voiced their concern that not all communities affected
by the mining industry are benefitting from resource revenues. Going forward, the provision of training to
local council members and the adoption of measures to strengthen their role in public financial
management will greatly enhance the integrity of the revenue-sharing system.

57.    A lack of transparency regarding how resource revenues are allocated within districts
undermines the credibility of district authorities. Communities have little information on exactly how
revenues are being used, which weakens accountability at the local level. Timely and comprehensive

                                                                 24
publication of revenue transfers and a description of spending allocations would put communities and the
general public in a better position to scrutinize local decision-making.

58.      The standard of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is an important
tool for ensuring transparency and accountability in resource revenue sharing. EITI initially focused
on the transparent reporting of all payments and fiscal transfers between extractive industry firms and the
national government. However, both governments and companies are under increasing pressure to show
how the extractive industries are materially benefiting those communities affected by their operations
(RWI, 2008). Article 3.8 of the newly revised EITI standard, which the GoM has explicitly expressed its
desire to implement in full, states that, “…the multi-stakeholder group is encouraged to include further
information on revenue management and expenditures in the EITI Report, including: (i) a description of
any extractive revenues earmarked for specific programs or geographic regions. This should include a
description of the methods for ensuring accountability and efficiency in their use” (EITI, 2013). EITI
Reports in, Ghana, Guinea, and Mongolia already include subnational revenue transfers in addition to
fiscal flows between the national government and resource firms (RWI, 2008).


59.      In nearby Madagascar, the 2011 EITI report provided extensive information on the
management of resource royalties. The regular publication of reports on the status of extractive industry
development is consistent with the revised EITI standard. These reports not only record revenue transfers
received by regional and municipal governments, they also describe the use of resource revenues by
communities and regions practicing participatory budgeting,19 including a breakdown of current and
capital expenditures for each subnational government (EY, 2013).

Monitoring and Oversight

60.     In addition to providing guidance on the type of projects to be funded through resource
revenue transfers, the central government requires that local governments use the funds in line
with all relevant laws and regulations for public financial administration. Resource revenue transfers
are monitored by the Ministry of Finance and are subject to internal and external audit controls and
reporting requirements, though at present the primary publication on resource revenue transfers is the
execution report, which only provides information on the amounts transferred and, contrary to its name,
does not record expenditure execution.


                                     5. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

61.      While the size and trajectory of resource revenue transfers are important fiscal policy
issues, the institutional impact of these transfers on subnational governments is a more pressing
concern. At present, resource revenue sharing represents a relatively small percentage of total fiscal
transfers to resource-rich districts. After the projected start of gas exports in the Rovuma Basin toward the
end of the decade revenue transfers are expected to increase, but if national policymakers continue to
allocate just 2.75 percent of total resource revenues to subnational governments, these transfers will
remain a small percentage of districts’ overall resource envelope. Given that resource extraction and
revenue sharing are both relatively new to Mozambique, and considering the capacity limitations of its
subnational governments, a low transfer rate may be desirable at this stage. However, it will likely
become necessary to increase the transfer rate in the future in order to meet both the central government’s

19
   Participatory budgeting allows citizens to influence the budget through discussions and negotiations with local government
officials (Aslam et al., 2010). This ensures that citizens are involved in local political decisions and encourages them to become
active participants in community problem-solving (Rocamora 2004 in Aslam et al., 2010).
                                                               25
development objectives and the local goals of affected communities. The effectiveness of increased
revenue transfers will hinge on the expenditure capacity and public financial management efficiency of
subnational governments, and building this capacity will be essential to the success of Mozambique’s
resource revenue policies. No less important is the need to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the
different actors involved in investing resource revenues, and further action will be required to ensure the
meaningful participation of local communities in determining their social and economic development
priorities.

62.      In order to mitigate revenue volatility and enhance the predictability of subnational
budgets, the government must develop a system for reliably projecting the amount and
disbursement schedule of future transfers. Mozambique has only recently adopted a revenue-sharing
policy, and its limitations are in part a reflection of its novelty. Over time, the mechanisms by which
resource transfers are budgeted, disbursed and utilized by target communities will evolve as the
authorities work to address the weaknesses of the present system. The current practice of determining the
share of resource revenues to be transferred on an annual basis at the discretion of national policymakers
is a concern, as it greatly increases the already significant budgetary uncertainty faced by subnational
governments. To remedy this situation the GoM should consider fixing the rate at which resource
royalties are transferred to subnational governments. This could be achieved either by establishing a fixed
percentage to be transferred annually over a given time horizon, or by adopting a formula that reflects the
projected growth of resource royalties, local spending needs and the implementation capacity of local
governments.

63.      Given the small size of resource revenue transfers relative to the national budget, the
central government is well positioned to absorb the volatility risk by earmarking nominal amounts
of revenue for transfer, rather than a share of actual revenues collected. Mozambique’s current
revenue transfer system includes no measures to mitigate the impact of revenue volatility at the
subnational level. In 2013 the amounts transferred to areas producing coal deviated significantly from the
initial and even the revised budget. This exacerbates the uncertainty faced by subnational governments,
but it could be avoided by including a nominal transfer amount in the budget.

64.      Absorbing revenue transfer volatility at the national level would provide the government
with an opportunity to pilot a resource revenue savings mechanism. In order to ensure that the
specified transfer amount would be available each year, regardless of actual resource revenues, the central
government could save excess revenue during times when commodity prices and production volumes
were high, then draw on these savings during subsequent revenue shortfalls. Several variations on this
system are also possible. For example, (i) the government could determine the transfer amount based on a
multiyear revenue average, rather than actual revenues in each given year; (ii) it could establish a minimum
transfer amount to which a share of any excess windfall revenue could be added or (iii) it could transfer an
amount equivalent to a fraction of the revenues received in a previous year, for instance the scheduled
transfer for 2015 could equal the total revenue received in 2013.

65.     Minimizing volatility is crucial to the effectiveness of revenue sharing. While the optimal size
of resource-revenue transfers depends on the unique circumstances of each country, stability is crucial in
every case. Unchecked revenue fluctuations undermine budgetary predictability among subnational
governments, damaging the efficiency of fiscal policy and discouraging multiyear investment planning at
the regional and local levels. Conversely, stable, predictable resource transfers can advance key
development objectives by building subnational administrative capacity and enhancing social capital in
communities affected by resource extraction. Resource-revenue transfers are most effective when
complemented by efforts to improve project selection, implementation and evaluation, and by support for
participatory decision-making processes and local accountability and oversight mechanisms.

                                                    26
66.      The government should ensure that resources are transferred in full and on schedule. Delays
in the disbursement of revenue transfers exacerbate the uncertainty of the revenue-sharing system. Whether
due to technical issues or political interference, these delays disrupt the predictability of local budgets,
undermining the implementation of community plans and discouraging multiyear investment projects. To
some extent the government’s experience in 2013 reflected the unanticipated obstacles that frequently
accompany new public policies. However, proactive steps will be necessary to strengthen public financial
management and ensure that budgeted resource transfers are executed reliably and predictably.

67.     Over time, the government may consider expanding its revenue-sharing system to include
non-resource-producing districts. A nationwide program of decentralized fiscal transfers would need to
be phased-in gradually to account for administrative capacity constraints, and the lessons learned from the
current system of revenue sharing in resource-producing districts could prove instrumental to its success.
However, while extending the scope of the revenue-sharing system offers many potential benefits, these
should not come at the expense of resource-producing areas, which bear a disproportionate share of the
costs involved in resource extraction. Maintaining equity will require that resource-producing areas
continue receiving sufficient transfers to offset the negative social, economic and environmental impacts
of extractive industries.

68.      The government should build the capacity of local authorities and provide clear guidance
on the use of resource revenues to ensure compliance with the priorities set forth in 1/MPD-
MF/2013 circular. The government’s initial experience with revenue sharing illustrates the extent to
which local spending patterns tend to be inconsistent with the objectives of the policy as defined in the
1/MPD-MF/2013 circular. Mozambique faces an enormous infrastructure deficit, and the pressing need to
focus on basic public goods and services should be a guiding principle for local governments. Provincial
governments should be encouraged to assist communities in establishing local priorities and designing
development plans for the short, medium and long terms. Each locality should formulate a plan to address
local infrastructures gaps and achieve specific social and economic development goals. These plans and
goals should be regularly revised and updated through consultative meetings involving relevant
stakeholders including community leaders, local government officials, civil society, private sector and
they should be incorporated into the overall District Development Plan, which provides the basis for
allocating and managing resource revenues at the local level.

69.      To advance its national policy objectives the government must provide clear guidance on
the use of resource revenues to ensure compliance with the priorities set forth in 1/MPD-MF/2013
circular, yet at the same time it should provide a greater role for community driven development in
the revenue-sharing system. The government’s initial experience with revenue sharing illustrates the
extent to which local spending patterns tend to be inconsistent with the goals of the policy as defined in
the 1/MPD-MF/2013 circular. Mozambique’s development strategy emphasizes the urgent need to
address the country’s enormous infrastructure deficit, and the importance of enhancing access to basic
public goods and services should be a guiding principle for local governments. Provincial governments
should be encouraged to assist communities in establishing local priorities that are consistent with this
overarching objective and designing development plans for the short, medium and long terms. Each
locality should formulate a plan to address local infrastructures gaps and achieve specific social and
economic development goals. These plans and goals should be regularly revised and updated through
consultative meetings involving relevant stakeholders, including community leaders, local government
officials, and representatives from civil society and the private sector. They should be incorporated into
the overall District Development Plan, which provides the basis for allocating and managing resource
revenues at the local level. In addition to the 1/MPD-MF/2013 circular, which sets out the broad
principles of the resource-transfer system, the government should consider using a community-driven
development approach for allocating and managing the resource revenues at the subnational level.
                                                    27
70.      Local governments should work to improve budgetary transparency and accountability and
strengthen mechanisms for participatory budgeting. Local governments in areas affected by resource
extraction should publish clear, accessible and detailed information on the receipt and use of resource
revenues. Greater transparency would facilitate participatory decision-making and promote local
accountability for the use of resource revenues. While online publication has become standard for reporting
national-level financial information, at the local level community radio, public meetings and other
communication channels may be more appropriate.

71.      Finally, the government should clarify its guidelines for the use of resource revenue
transfers. Certain elements of the transfer policy appear to be well defined and generally adhered to, such
as the mandatory use of resource revenues for investment spending only. However, the central
government’s focus on investment in economic and social infrastructure is less consistently applied by
local governments. Establishing more detailed expenditure priorities for resource revenue transfers would
allow for greater coordination in the pursuit of national development goals. Balancing the interests of the
national government with the ability of local authorities to determine their own investment agendas will
be a continuous challenge in the management of resource revenue transfers in Mozambique. Offering
explicit guidance as to which types of socioeconomic infrastructure are to be financed through resource-
revenue transfers may help to coordinate investment decisions, but the government must be careful to
ensure that local communities retain a meaningful degree of discretion over the use of transferred funds.

                             ANNEX: RESOURCE REVENUE VOLATILITY

Natural resource revenue transfers to the sub-national levels will depend on royalties collected by the
government (which in turn are determined by the price, production and royalty rates of coal and natural
gas respectively) and the rate of transfer agreed upon to the districts. At the current rate of 2.75 percent,
resource revenue transfers are expected to rise from US$1 million in 2014 to US$13 million in 2032 with
cumulative flows over the 18 years reaching US$170 million. However these revenues are sensitive to
price and production shocks in both coal as well as natural gas. In order to gauge the volatility in these
revenue transfers, a number of shocks are introduced to the baseline revenue projections from natural
resources. Price shocks are introduced by means of standard deviation in the historical prices of the two
commodities, coal and natural gas. Production shock on the other hand is introduced in terms of
percentage changes to the production figures in the baseline. The effects of price and production shocks in
coal and natural gas are shown individually to see where revenues are more sensitive. In addition, the
effects of price and production shock in both commodities together are also looked at. Finally, given the
discretionary nature of allocations of the resources revenues, the rate of transfer is also considered an
exogenous variable and is changed to see how it would impact revenue transfers.

In order to show their sensitivity to price shocks in coal, one standard deviation change (both positive and
negative) in coal prices is introduced. Moreover, production shocks are introduced so that the baseline
production figures rise and fall by 25 percent each. No changes are assumed in the gas market at this
point. Thus, the change in revenues is entirely due to shocks in the coal market.

Revenue volatility emanating from price shocks in natural gas is also shown in terms of one standard
deviation change (positive and negative) to the baseline prices. Production levels for gas have been kept
constant during this entire analysis, assuming that Mozambique would still want to produce gas at the
installed capacity even if prices dropped given the high costs of installation. Coal prices and production
levels have been maintained at the baseline level. Thus the changes to revenues in this case come only
from a natural gas price shock.

The effect of price and production shocks coming from both coal as well as natural gas is also analysed. A
price shock, as explained above, is introduced. A production shock is also introduced in coal production
while keeping gas production constant. The change in revenues can therefore be attributed to both coal as
well as natural gas shocks.

The graph below shows how the natural resource revenue transfers would vary with these price and
production shocks. These revenue transfers include royalties from both coal and natural gas. The graph to
the left shows changes to revenue transfers coming from price and production shocks in the coal market.
The graph in the middle shows changes to revenues emanating from shocks in natural gas prices. The
right graph shows revenues with price shocks in both coal and natural gas as well as production shock
(only in coal). It can be seen that revenue transfers are more sensitive to natural gas prices than coal.
These price and/or production shocks can significantly change the revenue transfers.

   The figure above shows that revenue transfers are sensitive to price and production changes in the two
   commodities. Revenues are more sensitive to changes in natural gas prices than coal prices. This is
   because of the large quantity of gas that is expected to be exported, which also makes the change in price
   have a big impact on the royalties collected. A combined price and production shock in both the
   commodities has the biggest impact on the revenues.

   It is also possible that the rate of transfer also changes thus affecting the sum of revenues being
   transferred. The figure below shows revenue transfers to the districts with a 20 percent rise in the rate of
   transfer, to 3.3 percent. Revenue transfers would rise from US$2 million in 2014 to US$15 million in
   2032. Cumulative transfers between 2014 and 2032 would reach US$204 million. The changes in revenue
   due to price and production shocks from both coal and natural gas are also shown.

   While these charts show that revenues are sensitive to price and production changes, they remain
   relatively small. In 2014, the revenue transfers at the current rate of 2.75 percent constitute no more than
   5 percent of the total budget of the resources producing districts. Given the small sum being transferred,
   volatility emanating from these transfers will not have a very big impact on the fiscal management in
   these districts. Volatility would become a concern when the transfers are on a much higher scale.

   Generally, most resource producing countries, including Sub-Saharan Africa, have resource revenue
   sharing arrangements with sharing rates at no less than 10 percent. Some countries like Cameroon go
   even higher to up to 25 percent. Thus, the transfer rate to Mozambique is very small compared to these
   countries. Since resource extraction and revenue sharing is relatively new in the country a small transfer
   rate in the first stages of the development of a sharing model may even be desirable. However with time
   there may be increasing demand and pressure to increase the transfer rate in order to meet the local
   infrastructure and other goals and objectives.

   Figure 3 below looks at revenue transfers with a transfer rate of 15 percent, which will be in line with
   Mozambique’s peer countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. At this rate, revenue transfers would rise
   significantly from US$8 million in 2014 to US$69 million in 2032. Cumulative transfers over the two
   decade would be almost US$1 billion. This is much higher compared to US$170 million that would
   accrue to the districts at the current rate. These revenue transfers would also form a significant proportion
   of the total budget of these districts. However, with an increased transfer rate for revenue sharing,
   revenues would also be more volatile. While the proportional change in revenues given these price and
   production shocks (as mentioned above) remain the same, the sum of transfers involved are much bigger
   now compared to the current rate of 2.75 percent. Thus effects of volatility in revenue transfers to the sub-
   national levels can be more severe at this sharing rate.

   Increasing the rate of transfer even further, would increase the revenue transfers to these districts but also
   expose them to greater volatility. For instance, if the rate of revenue transfers were to be fixed at 40
   percent, natural resource revenues to the districts would rise to US$183 million by 2032. The revenue
   transfer in this one year alone would exceed the total revenue transfers over the two decades to these
   districts at the current transfer rate. Cumulative revenue transfers would be as high as US$2.5 billion.
   Such huge transfers would indeed raise concerns over the absorptive capacity in the districts. Moreover,

                                                                                                           33
   price and production shocks as mentioned earlier would have a severe impact on the actual transfers. This
   is clear from figure 4.

               with price & production increase                                       with price & production decline


   As figure 4, revenues could change dramatically with shocks from coal or natural gas or both. A coal
   price and production would make revenues vary between US$162 million and US$209 million by 2032
   with cumulative revenues raging between US$2.1 billion and US$2.9 billion. A price shock in gas would
   have a bigger impact with revenues by 2032 ranging between US$151 million and US$215 million. In an
   extreme scenario of a combined shock from both markets, revenues could vary between US$131and
   US$240 million by 2032. Cumulative revenues in such a situation would vary between US$1.7 billion
   and US$3.3 billion.

   This analysis shows that revenue transfers to the districts are sensitive to price and production change in
   coal and natural gas as the transfers depend on royalties collected by the government on the two
   commodities. However, given the current rate of transfer at 2.75 percent, the sum of transfers remains
   relatively small and hence volatility is not a big concern. Mozambique’s transfer rate is relatively small
   compared to other countries and there may be greater need to increase this rate later. In such a case, the
   flow of natural resource revenue transfers would be much bigger than the current rate. This would mean
   improving the absorptive capacity in these districts so that to ensure efficiency. Moreover, higher revenue
   transfers would also expose the districts to more volatility.
