ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS


This work would not have been started without the support of the Honourable Minister of Lands,
Country Planning and the Environment (MLCPE). I am particularly grateful to the collaboration
of key members of the MLCPE.

The immense work that went into research and meetings among the Expert Investigators (EIs) is
worthy of recognition. The whole exercise revolved around the expertise of this set of
professionals, who were always willing to meet or pick my calls to have clarity on legal concepts
and processes, civil society experiences, and the workings of government ministries, department
and agencies with anything to do with land matters. The detailed and excellent Background
Reports emanated from these people. I am equally indebted to all the Panel Members, whose
active interest and participation helped to reshape the some of the thinking of the EIs. I can never
express enough gratitude for the roles these two sets of people played in getting to Assignment to
this stage.

I would be amiss in this duty if I did not recognize the VGGT Team for their ever-present interest
in the Sierra Leone LGAF process, through which I was always invited to participate in their
Technical Committee, and Steering Committee Meetings. We learnt a lot from these interactions.

The Africa LGAF secretariat, based in Kenya and the global LGAF Secretariat, located in the
World Bank deserve special mention. Apart from getting Sierra Leone on the list of countries to
undertake the assessment, the supervision and monitoring of the work in Sierra Leone contributed
greatly to this product. There were times when I was so overwhelmed with this work that, had it
not been for Thea Hilhorst, and Sue Mbaya, I would have thrown in the towel long time ago. I am
personally grateful for the patience of these two ladies. As part of the African LGAF Secretariat,
the Technical Advisory Group of eminent land scholars in Africa improved the background reports
with their incisive comments. I thank each and every one of them.

As one of the last Country Coordinators to get on board, I am grateful to all the assistance provided
by the more experienced Country Coordinators, during meetings and through personal email
exchanges.

I take this opportunity to thank my Research Assistant, Mr. Salieu Mohamed Barrie for all the
work he put in over these past 9 months. While at this, I must thank The Economic Forum for
making its offices and facilities available to all the EIs, and for hosting most of the Panel Meetings.

The contributions by all these colleagues almost came to nothing with the advent of the Ebola.
This epidemic almost put a complete stop to the activities of the LGAF Team, but for the vigorous
intervention of the Government of Sierra Leone and its development partners.

World Bank. As a country we are grateful.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


There are two main types of land tenure in the country, these include; the Statutory System in the
Western Area and the Customary System in the Provinces. The former is regulated by statutory
law and the latter by customary laws. But the legal framework governing land delivery in both
systems is complex, as there are no fewer than twenty different statutes and regulations and most
of them having conflicting provisions, which present implications for land use and management.

The concept of traditional or communal tenure tends to be used in a static way, with some referring
to the notion of ‘customary’ tenures instead. A range of commonly used concepts of land tenure
such as” agreements”, or “the sale of land”, ‘freehold’ tenures, family lands and “ownership” or
“holding” of the land are used unclearly or synonymously.

The dualistic land tenure system in the country is relatively unreliable, because it is based on
registration of instruments of conveyance. This means it is the conveyance itself that confers title,
and not the registration of the instruments that executed the conveyance. In other words,
registration of deeds or instrument is record evidencing a transaction has taken place and not legal
proof of ownership. Proof of ownership rests with the courts.

Even more unreliable is the latter system, because it is based on different forms of unwritten
customary rules in different parts of the regions, and subjected so much to the whims, caprices and
captivations of family, community or chiefdom heads.

In spite of the challenges, the customary land tenure system is still operative and functional.
Although the system is not fully effective, customary rights are legally recognized, but not
adequately protected. This is mainly because land rights are not registered.

Only a small percentage of all lands in the rural and urban areas are recorded and mapped.
Recording and mapping these lands will greatly reduce the many conflicts that arise from land
grabbing. It will also make it easier for agribusiness enterprises to negotiate better with
landowners.

The constitutional provisions that guarantee right holders a legitimate right to access the justice
system to remedy a breach may not be accessible or do not necessarily result in timely and just
decisions.

There is no operational national land policy in Sierra Leone. However, the Ministry of Lands,
Country Planning and the Environment has just completed the development of a new National
Land Policy, which is proposing to individualize land.

Gender relations on land matters in Sierra Leone have remained largely unaddressed over all these
years. This is the reality for many women in rural Sierra Leone, a country where at least 95 percent
of its land is governed by customary law. This means that for the majority of citizens, the unwritten
traditional rules and practices of tribes or communities determine who is able to hold, use or
transfer land. In many ways, the application of rules of customary law in ordinary life has tended

7|Page
to affect women more adversely than men. On important issues, women are often treated as minors
- needing the agency of a man to act. In worse case scenarios, they are regarded as chattels.

The draft National Land Policy 2014 concedes that women, children and youth suffer
discrimination and denial of land rights under customary law. The policy makes some concrete
proposals to address these shortcomings.

There are a number of governmental ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) operating in
the land sector. The most important of these is the MLCPE. However, the assessment of the
Ministry shows that there are lots of capacity gaps in the outfit. This capacity gaps include both
human and equipment. The same can be said of the other MDAs. There are several instances where
there are conflicting mandates. In addition to some ministries, department and agencies (MDAs)
deliberately usurping the mandates of others, creating further confusion in the land management
arena.

There are hardly any town planning schemes against which change in land use or development is
approved. Where there are schemes, enforcement has been weak or lacking. In practice, effective
land use planning at national, regional and local levels does not really exist.

A policy on common property under condominium is lacking. However, in practice, very few
private developers have started offering common property under condominiums. In such instances,
they allow for effective management of urban properties. Since 2004, there has been a marked
improvement in the collection of property taxes.

Several recommendations have been put forward from each panel. Among them are:

          There is need to review the laws relating to tenure rights all over the country, as
           proposed in the new National Land Policy;

          Government and other stakeholders should ensure that the appropriate legal
           framework is in place to comprehensively address issues around rural land
           management, in a sustained manner;

          The draft National Land Policy contains robust provisions which carry the potential to
           break new grounds in protecting women's land rights in Sierra Leone. The challenge
           now is to make them better and stronger as the policy translates into legislation. These
           reform proposals could be significantly improved if, (i) surviving spouses and children
           are able to utilise community or family farmlands without interference; (ii) use rights
           of women such as the right to collect firewood, medicines, access water sources, etc.
           are protected under any circumstance; (iii) women's representation in land
           administration bodies are made mandatory; and (iv) a process by which family or
           community members could hold those controlling family or community property
           accountable is established.

          There is need for the Government to formulate an urban policy, which will address the
           issues of slum settlements and the formalization of informal settlements;

8|Page
        The Government must enact a new Town and Country Act to address the issues of land
         use planning and development control.
        Spatial planning should be integrated into the sectorial development strategies of all
         MDAs. Spatial planning in these context should provide a framework for the
         coordination of urban policies and major infrastructure projects, harmonization of
         development standards, comprehensively addressing the ecological footprints of
         urbanization, and a space for public discussion of these issues;

        That the MLCPE and the MWHI, the authority responsible for the issuance of building
         permits, collaborate to make sure that local councils keep track of newly erected
         buildings;

        Digitization/computerization of hard copy registry records at OARG;

        That property valuation should be divided into urban and rural areas and the process
         and format standardised across the country;

        A holistic review needs to be carried out to ensure that land disputes are brought to
         their barest minimum, and dealt within the shortest possible time. Issues ranging from
         titling to the judiciary should be reviewed and strong deterrent should be in place for
         to avoid land transactions resulting to dispute.

        The statutory mandates of the MDAs should be reviewed and harmonized to address
         the issues of conflicting and overlapping statutory mandates in land use planning, land
         management and administration;
        The formation of integrity committees at MLCPE and other MDAs should be
         operationalized, given the high levels of corruption on land related matters in all the
         MDAs;
        e-Governance and interoperability of land data should be introduced to enhance
         effective coordination and collaboration amongst government ministries, departments
         and agencies (MDAs);

        Given the roles played by civil society organizations, it is important for Government
         to consider the special roles played by civil society organizations in holding the feet
         of big agricultural investments companies to the contents of the agreements. They
         should be a part of all negotiations;

1.0         INTRODUCTION

The importance of land governance in the socio-economic development of a nation cannot be
overemphasized, as the allocation of land across competing uses can determine the type and level
of economic activities that can be carried out by individuals, groups, and businesses. The
competing use of land (the need for housing, agriculture, industry, mining, etc.) has become a
source of conflict in many countries where land governance and management are not clearly
defined.

The need for a systematic assessment of land governance arises from three factors: policy
importance, institutional fragmentation and technical complexity. Firstly, the institutional
arrangements governing land have emerged as a key factor for sustainable growth and poverty
reduction, which is increasingly supported by continental and global policy initiatives and also in
Sierra Leone. Examples are the 2009 African Union Framework and Guidelines on land policy
and the 2014 African Union principles for large scale land based investment, and the endorsement
in 2012 by the Committee for World Food Security (CFS) of the Voluntary Guidelines for
responsible tenure of land, forest and fisheries in the context of food security (VGGT).

The Government of Sierra Leone has included effective and sustainable land management as one
of its strategic objectives in the Agenda for Prosperity (AfP) 1 for 2013-2018, including the
adoption of a comprehensive land use policy that is understood by all, and aimed at ensuring
optimal gains for the overall development of the country. However, the Policy itself has not gone
through Cabinet yet. After which it has to go through Parliament.

Another development is the start of the VGGT process in Sierra Leone as part of the G8
commitment. Although at the onset of the CAADP, the VGGT process had not been conceived, it
there is now a clarion call the inclusion of the VG principles into CAADP investment compacts;
to harmonize policies of different ministries; and to set up complaint mechanisms at national
levels

The revised National Housing Policy, 2006 provides for access to safe sanitary and decent housing
and services, either on home ownership or rental basis, for all Sierra Leoneans, particularly for
low-income and vulnerable groups.

Secondly, as a result of institutional fragmentation and duality in tenure systems where
responsibility for land is spread over a large number of government institutions in Sierra Leone,
with often poor coordination and overlaps; there can be a wide gap between legal provisions and
their actual implementation.

Thirdly, the technical complexity and context specificity of land issues, and the fact that change
may be resisted by powerful stakeholders benefiting from the status quo, implies that progress will
depend on the ability to forge a consensus among experts in a participatory and deliberative
process, based on a comprehensive analysis.

The land governance assessment framework (LGAF) was developed by World Bank, in
partnership with FAO, IFAD, IFPRI, UN Habitat and the African union Land Policy Initiative to
facilitate An analysis of this nature, would allow for the comparison of the state of land governance
in Sierra to global good practices in key areas of responsible land governance such as: (i) how
rights to land (at group or individual level) are defined, can be exchanged, and transformed; (ii)
how public oversight over land use, management, and taxation is exercised; (iii) the extent of land
owned by the state is defined, how the state exercises it, and how state land is acquired or disposed
of; (iv) procedures in place to deal with large-scale land-related investment; (v) the management
of land information and ways in which such information can be accessed; and (vi) avenues to
resolve and manage disputes and hold officials to account.

The results of The LGAF in Sierra Leone will feed into the ongoing VGGT discussions. The World
Bank generally organizes a high level policy dialogue with the government to discuss key
conclusion and policy recommendations. There has already been a lot of collaboration between
the VGGT and the LGAF processes taking place in Sierra Leone. In fact, one of the
recommendations of the VGGT Multi-Stakeholders Meeting held in April 2014 was for the LGAF
process to take place in Sierra Leone.

This report starts with a presentation of the methodology used in the implementation of the LGAF
in Sierra Leone. It will provide an overview of the role of land in the economy and the history and
context of land and tenure governance in Sierra Leone. It then presents the results of the
assessments, followed by for improving land governance. Finally, it presents the policy matrix in
relation to land matters in Sierra Leone.

2.0       METHODOLOGY

Land Governance Assessment Framework or LGAF is a country level tool, for an independent and
comprehensive assessment of land governance guided by a framework of indicators, and
undertaken by local experts using existing data and information. It supports evidence based and
participatory policy development. The various stages used by the Sierra Leonean LGAF Team are
presented below:

2.1       Preparation Stage

During the preparation stage, the Country Coordinator worked with the LGAF Global Secretariat
and the African Secretariat to agree on expert 9 (nine) investigators (Table 1), who would gather
information on each of the nine panels identified in the LGAF manual:

         Land Rights Recognition
         Rights to Forest and Common Lands & Rural Land Use Regulations
         Urban Land Use, Planning, and Development
         Public Land Management
         Transfer of Large Tracts of Land to Investors
         Public Provision of Land Information: Registry and Cadastre
         Land Valuation and Taxation
         Dispute Resolution
         Institutional Arrangements and Policies

The Country Coordinator and EIs identified all existing legal frameworks related to the topics.
After this, relevant data was collected from the relevant government institutions, NGOs and private
sector participants, by the appropriate EIs.

2.2     Background Reports

LGAF Framework is based on international standards of good land governance and constructed
around nine thematic modules, each composed of land indicators and dimensions, with predefined
scores from A to D. The scoring is, as much as possible, quantified with the thresholds being
defined according to what is regarded internationally as good practice. The scores indicate where
a country is doing well and areas for improvement. The framework provides a format that
facilitates the communication of findings and recommendations with policy makers.
Using these guidelines, the EIs prepared Background Reports for all the Panels. These were briefly
reviewed by the Country Coordinator, and later sent to the LGAF Secretariat for more in-depth
reviews. Comments from the Secretariats were considered in revised reports by the EIs. After the
Secretariat clears a Background Report, it is forwarded to the Technical Advisory Group (TAG)
of eminent scholars on land issues in Africa. Comments from the TAG are taken into consideration
for a final revision of the Background Reports.

2.3     Panels

While all this process of reviews and revisions of the Background Reports were going on, the
Country Coordinator with the EIs identified a list of stakeholders with knowledge of areas relating
to all the panels, to participate in discussions relating to the scores provided by the EIs for each
dimension; and the attendant recommendations.

The Sierra Leonean Team conducted nine panel meetings to share the findings of the EIs. Each
Panel consisted of three to five experts, including specialists in the legal and legislative issues
regarding land use and property, civil society organisations, women organizations, government
institutions, and others working on land planning and development as well as managing public
lands.

To assemble these experts, the Country Coordinator prepared a list of institutions from
government, the private sector, NGOs and academia, and then contacted them to identify at least
4 members who would be interested in sharing their knowledge and experience with the LGAF
project. All the institutions responded favourably. In the end we were able to identify a total of 44
such experts.

The panel meetings took place over a 2-day period. The Country Coordinator began each panel
with a presentation about the objective of the meeting, its agenda and working procedures. He also
explained the dimensions related to each panel and the actual assessment procedures. Although
panel members had received assessment tables ahead of the meetings, it not all of them had taken
the time to go through their scores before the meeting. Participants, therefore, were given time at
the beginning of each meeting to do so. In order to provoke lively discussions, the moderator
displayed on a screen the preliminary scores that each panel member had given to the dimensions.
The second part of the meeting was dedicated to discussions and debate, aimed at reaching a
consensus in assessing each dimension. The panel also discussed possible recommendations for
policies, research and reforms. For some of the dimensions, the consensus score agreed by the

13 | P a g e
panel differed from those of the EIs. These final scores are presented in Annex 2, as the Sierra
Leone Score Card.

Each Panel produced an Aide Memoire, which covered how the discussions went and provided
the final scores and recommendations. The EIs then use the Aide Memoire to finalize the
Background Reports.

The Country Coordinator put together a Country Synthesis Report, from the revised Background
Reports.

2.4     Technical Validation workshop

The LGAF Global Secretariat and the African Secretariat agreed with the Country Coordinator to
organize a Validation Workshop just before the VGGT Second Multi Stakeholders Workshop,
scheduled for September 28th and 29th, 2015.

The LGAF Validation Workshop was conducted on September 25th, 2015. It was attended by
representatives of all the MDAs involved in land matters in the country, the President of the
National Council of Paramount Chiefs, Members of Parliament, the EIs, panel members, civil
society organizations (including National Federation of Farmers of Sierra Leone and the 50/50
Women’s Group), the local press, VGGT Secretariat, and representatives from World Bank,
including the Global Coordinator, Land Governance Assessment Framework.

After the opening remarks by the Global Coordinator; and the Formal opening of the Workshop
by the Permanent Secretary of the Minister of Lands Country Planning and the Environment, the
Country Coordinator described the land governance situation in Sierra Leone, based on the
Country Score Card. After this, each EI presented their panel scores, with justifications and
recommendations. Plenary sessions after each presentation took place, during which participants
challenged some recommendations. The discussions were very lively, and participatory. All the 9
panels were exhaustively discussed.

It was agreed that another session be arranged just for a review of the Panel Dimension Scores and
the Policy Matrix. This meeting took place on October 9th, 2015.

The Country Coordinator took all suggestions, agreed on during the Workshop, to improve on the
Synthesis Report, which will end up as a Final County Report.

Quality assurance and technical guidance to the country team were provided by the Africa LGAF
Secretariat and the global LGAF Secretariat located. An international Technical Advisory Group
(TAG) of key African experts working under the Africa LGAF secretariat has reviewed each
background report.

The background reports were ready by end February 2015; panels were held in the first week of
March, and draft synthesis report ready by mid-September 2015.

It is worth noting that the work on the LGAF was carried out during the peak of the Ebola epidemic
in Sierra Leone. Our work was, therefore, affected as indeed everything else in the country. The
Team was, however, resourceful enough to carry out our activities safely.

3.0       CONTEXT OF LAND GOVERNNACE IN SIERRA LEONE

3.1       Governance Systems

Sierra Leone was founded formally in 1787 and became a British Crown Colony in 1807. The
population of the Sierra Leone peninsula, Freetown and its environs increased following the
release of slaves from vessels arrested by the British navy off the coast of West Africa. These
“recaptives”, as they became known, settled in Freetown and the nearby villages, forming the
nucleus of a distinctive inter-African society linked by a common language, Krio, and an area that
has come to be commonly known as the Western Area. The 1890s saw the British advance into
the interior, and by a British Protectorate Ordinance of 1896, formal British rule had extended to
the rest of what we know today as Sierra Leone, divided between Colony and Protectorate.

The Sierra Leonean state is built around the system of indirect rule created by the British in 1896,
which is based on a symbiotic relationship between national politicians and local traditional rulers,
though the tradition is to a large extent invented, (Acemoglu, Chaves, Osafo-Kwaako, & Robinson,
2014). This system has lasted 119 years, though with some notable adaptations after independence
in 1961. It may even have in some sense become stronger after the civil war ended in 2002, when
real political competition emerged for the first time since the 1960s. The longevity of the system
and the way it was re-created after the civil war suggests that it has quite robust features, even if it
leads to a severe under provision of public goods.

Today, Sierra Leone is a parliamentary republic with a governance structure based on
a decentralised system of central government, and local (city-, municipal-, and district-) and
chiefdom councils. The country is operating under two types of governance systems that fall into
different geographical areas of the country.

         The Western Area and the capital Freetown (former British colony) operate under general
          law, comprising a system of pre-independence English common law and post-
          independence statutory law.
         The Provinces, to the North, East and South, (former British protectorate) operate under a
          dual system of general law and customary law, of which the latter is the most dominant.
          Customary laws, which vary between the chiefdoms, are mostly unwritten, but nevertheless
          enforceable, because they are recognised in national legal framework. In case of
          inconsistency between the two law systems, customary law can be overruled by statutory
          law.

The Provinces are ruled through a customary system of 149 chiefdoms with local administration
being coordinated through Paramount Chiefs and chiefdom councils, with section- or sub-chiefs.
Paramount Chiefs are endorsed by the president and rule for life, although they could be removed,
according to S19 of the Chieftaincy Act 2009, which states: A Paramount Chief may be removed
from office by the President for any gross misconduct in the performance of the functions of his

15 | P a g e
office if after a public inquiry conducted under the chairmanship of a Judge of the High Court or
a Justice of Appeal or a Justice of the Supreme Court, the Commission of Inquiry makes an adverse
finding against the Paramount Chief, and the President is of the opinion that it is in the public
interest that the Paramount Chief should be removed. They are elected by the councilors of the
chiefdom and come from a ruling family. The role of paramount chiefs was re-established and
strengthened following the end of the conflict via the chieftaincy act of 2009 and in the new
decentralized system, (USAID, 2010).

In the Western Area, local administration is supported by a customary system including village
headmen who are democratically elected and provide village representation.

The recent history in Sierra Leone has been turbulent and the country experienced a period of
conflict and violence from 1991 to 2002, causing much loss of lives, displacement (affecting more
than a quarter of the population at one time) and migration from the country to mostly Liberia and
Guinea. It destroyed the economy, infrastructure and also the social fabric of the country, with
many paramount chiefs killed during the period.

3.2       Socio-economic Context

Sierra Leone has a total land area of 71,620 square kilometers, of which the Western Area covers
an area of only 537 km2 or 0.7% of the total land mass. The country has an estimated population
of 6.2 million people with population growth having averaged 2.5% over the past decade, and of
whom 40% live in urban areas – mostly in the Western Area (WDI - 2014)2. Urban population has
grown particularly in the years of conflict, and resulted in many slums and urban sprawl. Only
23% of the urban population has access to improved sanitation facilities (2012 data -WDI)3.

The geography consist of a coastal zone (the “Colony” or Western Area) with mangrove forests
and the main urban centers, wooded hill country - with inland valleys and wetlands used for rice
farming, with fallow and forests, and fisheries, and upland plateau, and mountains in the north,
south and east of the country. An estimated 56% of the land is potential farm land and 37% was
forest in 2014 (WDI4). About 1% of Sierra Leone’s land is under cultivation, and roughly 5% of
cropland is irrigated. According to (African Development Bank, 2013), of all forest and
woodlands, 85% is community-managed and under customary tenure. The remaining forest are
State administered forests of which 48% are managed for biodiversity conservation and watershed
conservation. The country is rich also in mineral resources like iron ore, diamonds, rutile, bauxite,
gold and offshore oils.

In the last decade, Sierra Leone has exhibited high robust economic growth rates, ranging from
6% to 15% annually per year. However, the growth is significantly driven by the extractive
industry, which is largely non-inclusive and undiversified. The Gini coefficient is still high with
50% of income attributable to the top 20% of the population. Rapid economic growth has had
limited impact on poverty reduction and employment generation, creating resentment and limited
trust in the Government. The economy is driven by primary commodities, mainly agriculture and
mineral production. The mining sector contribution to GDP is projected to substantially increase

  World Development Indicators data base was accessed in august 2015

16 | P a g e
from 4% in 2011 due largely to the expansion in existing large scale iron ore operations.
Agriculture including forestry and fisheries still accounts for the largest GDP share, but that share
is expected to decline though it will remain largest employer for the foreseeable future, and
accounts for over 70% of the current labor force. The mining sector, the current driver of growth
in the economy, accounts for less than 3% of total formal labor force, due mainly to the capital-
intensive and enclave nature of mining operations and reliance on highly skilled labor. The service
sector, which is led by banking, retail, transport and tourism, has a 28% share of GDP in 2013
(AfDB, 2013)5.

Land in Sierra Leone is a vital natural resource that is not only rich in minerals, but fertile for
agricultural production. Its forests and other types of common property resources play a vital
role in the livelihood of the rural poor. In addition to the resources they provide, whether in
the form of fuel wood, fodder, grazing lands or other produce (all of which strongly supplement
and prop up agricultural economies) these land resources are critical to the maintenance of a
delicate ecological balance, the impact of which is felt far beyond their immediate
surroundings. The government has included effective and sustainable land management as one of
its strategic objectives in the Agenda for Prosperity (AfP)6 for 2013-2018, which is the economic
strategy paper of the country. One of the strategic priorities in the AfP is the adoption of a
comprehensive land use policy that is understood by all, and aimed at ensuring optimal gains for
the overall development of the country combined with a single national land register for all parcels
in the country using IT technologies and GIS. Such land policy, it is hoped, would strengthen
coordination between land institutions and overcome fragmented and unregulated land markets in
order to ensure the enhanced and sustainable management and exploitation of land in Sierra Leone.

The government has been very active in promoting large-scale foreign investment in arable land
in the country. The Sierra Leone Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SLIEPA) has, since
2009, been spearheading the drive for foreign direct investment in agriculture. However, this
investor influx on an industrial scale has set in motion a number of challenges exposing the
unpreparedness of MDAs engaged with dealing in investment in the land and agriculture sectors.
It has been estimated that 635,000 ha7 of agricultural prime land has been leased so far.

The GNI per capita increased from 470 USD/year in 2010 to 720 USD in 2014 (WDI data), but is
expected to decline due to the fall in iron ore prices on the World Market and the Ebola crisis.
According to the WDI, the value added of the agricultural sector to GDP increased from 56% in
2010 to 61.6% in 2014; the contribution of the forestry sector went down from 10% in 2010 to
7.6% in 2014 and mineral rents went down from 0.7% to 0.3% in 2014. The national Poverty
headcount ratio at $1.25 a day (PPP) (% of population) is 56.6% (2011) with a rural poverty
headcount ratio of 66.1% (2011) of the rural population and an urban poverty headcount ratio of
31.2% (WDI data).

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) has wrecked severe damage on the economies of the three most
affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. By end of August 2015, Sierra Leone has
reported more than 12,900 cases of EVD and over 3,900 deaths since the outbreak in 2014. In
recent months, substantial progress has been made, with up to 0 cases per week, since the start of
October 2015.

Employment rates are returning to pre-Ebola outbreak levels. However, the hours that people work
are still below baseline levels, especially in rural areas. Also, many households lack capital to
reopen their business and non-farm household enterprises. Nearly a third of the country’s
workforce—report lower revenues than before the Ebola crisis8.

The EVD has resulted in flat or negative income growth in all the affected countries, creating large
fiscal needs; and threatens to erode food security in all three countries. In Sierra Leone, for
example, approximately 215,000 tons of rice is estimated to be imported in 2015 according to the
UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) cited in (Kaindaneh, 2015).

3.3       Land and resource systems

Sierra Leone operates on a dual land tenure system, which has its origins in the Colonial period,
through the establishment of a “colony” (now Western Area) in the coastal area and the
“protectorate” (now the provinces) following the establishment of a protectorate via the British
Protectorate Ordinance of 1896 that expanded formal British rule to the rest of Sierra Leone. It
mirrors the two types of governance systems for different geographical areas of the country as
introduced earlier in this chapter and also affects the court system9.

         Western area (coastal strip): freehold system based on “general law” that includes the
          rules of law known as the common law, the doctrines of equity and all enactments of the
          legislature in force in Sierra Leone, as well as the received English Law in force from 1880
          to date.
         Provinces: unwritten customary laws is applied in the rural areas (the Protectorate Land
          Ordinance of 1927; Concessions ordinance of 1937, and Provinces Land Act Cap 122 of
          1960). Customary laws are based on the traditions, culture and customs of the ethnic

9
  The Constitution, Act No.6 of 1991, Sec. 120 vests authority in the Judiciary, of which the Chief Justice is the head.
Section 120(4) states that the Judicature shall consist of the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone, the Court of Appeal and
the High Court of Justice, which are the Superior Courts of Judicature, and such other inferior or traditional courts as
Parliament may by law establish. The Act recognised and retained the distinction between the English type and the
other traditional courts consisting of the Local Courts and the Group Local Appeals Courts established under the Local
Courts Act, 1963. By Section 132 of the Constitution, the High Court has jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters.
However, this jurisdiction is limited by Sec. 21 of the Courts Act, 1965, which specifically excludes any action or
original proceedings to determine the title to land situated in the provinces other than the title to a leasehold granted
under the Provinces Land Act. Sec. 13(1) of the Local Court’s Act, 1963 states: ‘the Local Courts have jurisdiction to
hear and determine all civil cases governed by customary law other than cases between Paramount chiefs or tribal
authorities involving a question of title to land’. Thus, jurisdiction to hear and determine matters involving a question
of title to land arising in the Provinces is expressly vested in the Local Courts as part of their general jurisdiction to
hear and determine all civil cases governed by customary law. However, where the matter is between two or more
Paramount chiefs or chiefdom councils on a question of title to land, these courts lack jurisdiction.


18 | P a g e
             groups, and, in reality, vary from one ethnic group to another, due to their established
             customs. For example, among the tribes in the Eastern and Southern regions of the country,
             women can be paramount chiefs, but not among the tribes in the Northern region.
             Customary Law courts operate in the provinces. In the formal setting, disputes are settled
             by the courts or some dispute resolution authority serving as arbitrator. In the informal
             settings, traditional leaders decide cases based on customs and traditions of the people with
             little or no reference to formal rules.

Customary law forms part of the general law, but is restricted in its application to the northern,
southern and eastern provinces of Sierra Leone. Paramount chiefs are expected to hold the land in
trust for land owning families and lineages attached to a particular chiefdom and have to approve
each significant land related decision. Customary law will determine locally how the land and its
resources are accessed; who can hold and use its resources, and for how long and under what
conditions they may be used. Chiefs can grant or obstruct access to land, especially for migrants
(strangers). They also preside over land disputes, and influence local social relations, such as
positions of the youth and women.

Transfer of land rights is effected in two main ways – a primary right (that is, right secured though
original settlement of unused land), or through direct allocation of land from the founding lineage
to a group member. Primary right can be transferred through inheritance, a gift to a relative or as
usufruct (tenancy) to another person on mutually agreed terms and conditions for specified periods
of time (rental, sharecropping and “stranger-resident” arrangements).

3.4          Land Tenure Related Legislation

This section presents a list of major legislations relating to the land sector in Sierra Leone and its
duality. It shows that most of the key laws addressing land rights and governance date before Sierra
Leone became independent in 1961.

Constitution of 1991 recognizes Sierra Leone’s dual legal system. It grants the right to the
enjoyment of property, but does not address the vesting or ownership of land. It preserves the
rights and freedoms of the individual including the protection from expropriation without payment
or adequate compensation and guarantees the protection from deprivation of property including
compulsory possession.10

Protectorate Land Ordinance of 1927 declared that all lands in the Protectorate were vested in
the Tribal Authority and that, they held such lands for and on behalf of the native communities
concerned. It regulated the exercise of power by the Tribal Authorities to permit the use of, and
occupation of Protectorate land by non-natives, S.4 of the Ordinance stated “No non-native shall
acquire a greater interest in land in the Protectorate than a tenancy for a term of fifty years; but
nothing in this section shall prevent the insertion in any lease of a clause providing for the renewal
of such lease, for a second or further terms not exceeding twenty-one Years.” This dichotomisation
of rights to land was further cemented by the Concessions Ordinance of 1937 which prevented
Tribal Authorities from granting concessions of any Protectorate land for the purpose of cultivation
except under the terms of the Ordinance and the earlier Protectorate Land Ordinance of 1927. Any
10
     Section 21, 1991 Constitution of Sierra Leone

19 | P a g e
concession limited to 1,000 acres; and where it could be shown that it will benefit the Chiefdom
needed the Governor’s consent. Leases granted by the Tribal Authority had to be for no more than
50 acres and must not last beyond 99 years unless such lease was to government or for the national
good.

Provinces Land Act Cap 122 of 1960, which replaced the Provincial Land Ordinance, 1927,
reconfirms that supreme authority over land in the provinces is vested in the Tribal authorities11,
who hold land for and on behalf of the native communities concerned. Sec. 3 states that no land in
the Protectorate shall be occupied by a non–native unless he has first obtained the consent of the
Tribal Authority to his occupation of such land. Any non-native who occupies land in the
protectorate without the approval of the District Commissioner is deemed as a tenant at will. Sec.
4 adds that no non-native is to acquire an interest in land in the protectorate more than a tenancy
for a term of fifty years. However, the tenancy can be renewed for a second or further term of
twenty-five years. The rents reserved under such leases are subject to review by the District
Commissioner every seven years, from whom there is a right of appeal to the Provincial
Commissioner. However no rent shall be sanctioned by the District Commissioner by reason only
of the improvements made by the tenant or his predecessors in title. By Sec. 5, the Tribal Authority
can purchase any fixture or building left by the tenant and can also pay compensation to the tenant
for any economic trees which have been planted by the tenant at a fair value to any incoming tenant
of the land. If rural land is required for public purposes, State authorities deal directly with the
Paramount chiefs.

The General Registration of instruments Act Cap 255, Act, Cap 256 of 1960 makes extensive
provisions for the registration of different legal instruments. It provides the time limits within
which certain legal instruments are to be registered, and whether such documents are to take effect
in the Colony or the Protectorate. By Sec. 11, the Registrar-General is empowered to register any
State Grant upon the production and request of the holder of such grant, and to cause to be copied
and registered in a Register Book kept for that purpose. Each instrument, apart from a will, is
required to have a certificate of registry as well as a plan of the land signed by the person who
made it, describing the land or referring to the allotment of land as numbered or described in the
instrument of conveyance from the State.

Unoccupied Lands Act, Cap 117 of Laws of Sierra Leone 1960 defines Unoccupied Lands as
land where it is not proved by the person who is claiming it that beneficial use thereof for
cultivation or inhabitation, or for collecting or storing water or for any industrial purposes, has
been made for twelve years before the commencement of this Act. By Sec. 3 of this legislation, it
is provided that whenever the Director of Surveys and Lands is of the opinion that any land is
unoccupied land, it shall be lawful for him to cause such land to be marked out and a notice to be
posted on a conspicuous part of the land that such land is ‘Claimed as state Land’, and such notice
is to be signed by the Director of Surveys and Lands and dated.

The Town and Country Planning Act, Cap 81 1960 established the Town and Country Planning
Board in the Western Area. Where the Board is of the opinion that a scheme is to be made for any
area, it can make representations to that effect to the Minister who may by order declare that the

11
   ‘Tribal Authority’ is defined in Sec. 2 of the said Act as the ‘paramount chief and their councillors and men of note, or sub -chiefs and their
councillors and men of note’.

20 | P a g e
area specified in the representation shall be a Planning Area. The value of any building or land in
such a Planning Area shall be deemed to be the value of the building or land at the date of such
declaration Sec.6 (4).

State Lands Act No. 19 of 1960 as amended (Crowns Land Ordinance) and is applicable only to
the Western Area or former Colony. It makes provision for situations where the government may
want to acquire certain lands in order to undertake ‘public works in the Western Area. By Sec. 3,
the Minister can authorise his agents or servants to enter into any land to survey and do other acts
as may be necessary with a view to appropriating such land. Where the Minister together with
Parliament decides that such land is needed for Public works, the Minister is then to do a warrant
to direct that such land should be acquired for the service of the State.

The Non–Citizens (Interest in Lands) Act, 1966 is applicable in the Western Area only. A non-
citizen is defined as any individual who is not a citizen of Sierra Leone, or any company,
association or body of persons with more than half of its members of which are not Sierra
Leoneans. Sec. 3 of the Act states categorically that no non-citizen shall purchase or receive in
exchange or as a gift any freehold land in the Western Area. By Sec. 4, no non-citizen is to receive
in exchange or as a gift, any reserved leaseholds in the Western Area without first obtaining a
licence from the Board. Reserved leasehold is defined as leaseholds which the unexpired term
exceeds 21 years.

Devolution of Estates Act No.21, 2007 aim is gender law harmonisation and states in S.1 (1),
“This Act shall apply to every person who dies leaving property in Sierra Leone irrespective of
religion or ethnic origin”, but the Act preserves the duality and indicates in S.1 (3), “This Act
shall not apply to family property, chieftaincy property or community property held under
customary law.”

Summary Ejectment Act of 2006: Being an Act to amend the Summary Ejectment Act so as to
increase the jurisdiction of Magistrates’ Courts in respect of summary ejectment.

Local Government Act of 2004 gives local councils, which include District Councils, the power
to acquire and hold land. They are also provided under s. 20 (2) (d) with responsibility for the
development, improvement and management of human settlements. Sub section (e) also provides
that local councils shall draw up and execute development plans. Sub section (j) provides that
local Councils shall approve the annual budgets of Chiefdom Council. The 2004 act included
also a timetable for the devolution of functions from central government to local councils, and
which stated that the Ministry of Lands, Country Planning and Environment will pass over
land surveying by 2008, survey units within local councils will be established starting 2006,
training will commence 2007 and actual surveying by 2008, including setting up land
registration units, training and commencement of registration. Collection of data for land use
planning is also set to be passed over by 2007. This remarkably detailed timetable was not
implemented.

Chieftaincy Act of 2009 provides for the qualification, election, powers, functions and removal
of a person as a Paramount Chief or chief and for other matters connected with chieftaincy.

The 1988 Forest Act creates several categories of forest: classified forest, national protection
forests, community forests, and protected forests.

Section 2 of the Act provides that should the Minister wish to make any land not owned by the
State into a national forest in the Provinces, a lease of not more than 99 years must be entered into
and subject to renewal for another 99 years and rent for such land must be agreed with the
Chiefdom Council. In the case of land in the Western Area, the Minister is allowed to purchase
the freehold. Section 18 of the Forestry Act makes provisions for the constitution of Community
Forests. The Chiefdom Council will be able to include a list of existing rights that will be confirmed
by the agreement creating the forest and which will hand the management of such Community
Forest to the Chiefdom Council (S.19) thus bringing it line with their custodianship of all other
lands in the Provinces.

A Draft Forestry Policy and Act was developed in 2011 to replace the 1988 Act and set up
according to similar guiding principles as the draft Conservation and Wildlife Policy. It
acknowledges the environmental role of forest areas and places emphasis on the preservation of
the forest environment and establishes a set of policy objectives around forestry land management,
forest-based industry and practices, ecosystem conservation, education and awareness, research
and monitoring, and capacity building. However, the new Forestry Act has not been approved yet.

Wildlife Conservation (Amendment) Act of 1990 captioned “Being an Act to Amend the Wildlife
Conservation Act of 1972” relates merely to the definition of terms, modifications and
qualifications. For instance, section 25 of the Wildlife Act of 1072 prohibits hunting of elephants
in protected forest reserves only whereas section 7 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act of 1990
prohibits hunting in any forests, protected areas or national parks without the written permission
of the Chief Conservator. Further, the 1990 Wildlife (Amendment) Act provided for the change of
name from the Forestry Department to the Forestry Division. Despite these minor amendments,
the 1972 Wildlife Conservation Act and the Forestry Act of 1988 are still regarded as the
substantive legislations on forest biological diversity in Sierra Leone.
Mining Act, 2012, establishes the National Minerals Agency to promote the development of the
minerals sector by effectively and efficiently managing the administration and regulation of
mineral rights and minerals trading in Sierra Leone, including geological survey and data
collection activities; to establish a National Minerals Agency Board to provide technical and other
support the agency and to provide for other related matters.

The Agency shall, specifically undertake the following activities:

   i.   Administer and enforce the mines and minerals Act of 2009, and any other Acts related to
        the trade in minerals and related regulation.
 ii.    Make recommendations to the Minister for amendment and other improvements in the laws
        and regulations specified in paragraph (i) above;
 iii.   Advice on policy matters related to mining and natural resources governance whether or
        not arising from any law referred to in paragraph (i) above;
 iv.    Formulates and implements plans and systems for managing the responsible development
        of the minerals sector and to promote the rights of communities.

Revised Fisheries Policy 2012 has a goal of ensuring an “ecologically sustainable and
economically efficient fisheries in Sierra Leone”. Consistent with this goal, the Policy sets out a
Vision and framework for the management and use of fisheries aimed at ensuring their biological
sustainability, reducing poverty and generating wealth in manner that contributes to the economy
of coastal and riverine communities. The Policy recognizes that this will only be achieved if
stakeholders are given a stake in the management process.

Five strategies are outlined to achieve this Vision as follows:

       i.    Conservation and sustainable use through risk assessment and regulatory action;
      ii.    Increasing stakeholders’ responsibilities for management and use;
     iii.    Development of an efficient and effective extension service to facilitate stakeholder
             engagement in management;
     iv.      Diversifying and increasing trade of fish products (building the business capacity of the
             fishing industry);
      v.     Sustainable aquaculture development.

3.5          Sierra Leone Land Reform

Over the years several there have been several attempts to reform the land tenure and land
administration; in order to ensure an effective land administration system and an equitable
distribution of land. The latter refers to the generally accepted definition that the Protectorate
Ordinance in fact excludes the Creoles12 from the Western Area from owning any land in the
Provinces, which is a point of much debate and contestation, and perceived by some Creole as
discrimination. However, this vision is opposed by the rural populations and voiced as such by the
paramount chiefs, since colonial times. The irony is that apart from the land-owning families, even
non-Creoles would not have freehold in the provinces, although a landowning family can allow
land use in perpetuity (See tenure Typology).

In the Western Area, lack of land titling has led to the use of fences, signs and watchmen to protect
land. There are concerns among civil society groups and NGOs about the lack of transparency and
weak regulatory framework surrounding larger investor land deals and confusion about the
availability of land for investment in rural communities.

In 1999, Government instituted the Justice Laura Marcus-Jones Commission of Enquiry to look
into the Leasing and Sale of State Lands in the Western Area. The commission report highlighted
issues including the inadequacies of existing land laws, lack of institutionalised approach to land
management and an absence of a land management and audit and control system based on a
coherent policy. This problem continued, and in 2008 the Ministry of lands announced a
moratorium on all land transaction in western areas due to problems with allocating lands, false
title deed and multiple claims for the same land. This moratorium has been lifted in 2011 officially,
but the issues are even worse now. Unfortunately, there are no new strategies to combat this, apart
from the provisions in the NLP. In 2003, the Law Reform Commission had mandated a review of
laws that presented as obstacles to investment in land, and in 2004, the mandated sub-committee
of the Commission submitted a bill titled “Commercial Use of Land Act” to the Attorney General
12
     Creole are people who speak Krio

23 | P a g e
and the Minister for Justice. Unfortunately, this bill was never approved by Cabinet for submission
to Parliament for ratification into Law. Other bills in relation to land include the Lands
Commission Act, 2006, and the Customary Law Courts Act, 2006 (Law Reforms Commission).

In 2005, Government –developed a Sierra Leone National Land Policy of 2005. The principles
guiding this Land Policy include: (1) protecting the common national or communal property held
in trust for the people; (2) preserving existing rights of private ownership; and (3) recognizing the
private sector as the engine of growth and development, subject to national land-use guidelines
and rights of landowners and their descendants.

However, the 2005 proposed land policy was not implemented. According to MLCPE officials,
the policy formulation process was not participatory; that it was more theoretical than empirical,
and failing to address the controversial and complex land issues that exist. Nevertheless, the Policy
document highlighted important problems that are believed to be hampering land administration
and land tenure in Sierra Leone, such as:

       Inadequate security of land tenure;
       Weak land administration and management systems;
       General indiscipline in the land market;
       Indeterminate boundaries;
       Illegal acquisition of State lands;
       Difficulty to access land for development purposes;
       Low level consultation;
       Shortage of accessible land in the Western Area;
       “Squatting” on State and private lands in the Western Area due to rapid urbanisation;
       Insecure tenure forms and rights due to the absence of a system of registration of titles;
       Lack of proper cadastral mapping and land information;
       Unclear and diverging tenure forms under customary law; overlapping jurisdictions for
        statutory and customary law;
       Weak land administration and management;
       Inadequate capacity within the Ministry of Lands, Country Planning and the Environment
        to carry out its mandate and;
       Inadequate protection against “land-grabbing”.

A mew national land policy (NLP, 2015) is on its way to Cabinet, and eventually to Parliament.
The draft policy document proposes major changes such as replacing the current system of deed
registration with a land title registration system. This new system will apply nationally, and will
include land held under customary tenure and cover all types of rights; and is proposing to end the
distinction between native/non-native rights to land in the country.

The new National Lands Policy makes provision for the establishment of a National Lands
Commission. The Ministry of Lands Country Planning and the Environment (MLCPE) shall
establish the National Land Policy and Reform Unit (NLPRU) to support the implementation of
the NLP. NLPRU will be headed by a senior MLCPE staff.

The National Land Commission shall:

24 | P a g e
   i.   Hold title to and administer all State/Government lands in Sierra Leone and shall perform
        all those functions currently performed by the MLCPE under the States Lands Act 1960;
 ii.    Compile an inventory and keep records of Public Lands which are vested in the State or
        Government and manage or superintend the management and administration of all such
        Public lands;
 iii.   Be responsible for the introduction of a system of registration of title to land in accordance
        with the relevant legislation to be enacted;
 iv.    Be responsible for the setting up a modern cadastral registration system and operation of
        electronic title registries at district, and where possible, at chiefdom levels;
  v.    As part of the process of the introduction of a system of registration of title, assist in the
        setting up of Land Adjudication Tribunals as and when necessary, to undertake
        adjudication as a prelude to systematic title registration;
 vi.    Levy and facilitate collection of, and manage all land tax revenues except rates levied by
        local authorities.

3.6     Land Tenure typology

Land tenure in Sierra Leone consists of three main types (i) land originally bought “on behalf of
and for the sole benefit of the free community of settlers” in the western area– which later became
“freehold”; (ii) land under customary dispensation – sometimes also referred to as a communal
system; and (iii) land owned by the state (“State Lands” or former crown lands), managed by
MDAs of government and used for government use or for general public use (including protected
areas for forestry and wildlife).
The concept of traditional or communal tenure has received much attention, but apparently it tends
to be used in a static way, with some referring to the notion of ‘customary’ tenures instead (Butler,
2009) A range of commonly used concepts of land tenure (such as” agreements”, of “ the sale of
land”, ‘freehold’ tenures, family lands and “ownership” or “holding” of the land are used unclearly
or synonymously. The concept and practice of the custodial role of (paramount) chiefs over land,
or trusteeship is unclearly referred to, (Moyo & Foray, 2009).
A closer examination of the evolving forms of land holdings in Sierra Leone suggest an even more
complex range of holdings (Table 2). Some of these are clearly based in statutory law (freeholds,
leaseholds), while others are provided for under customary laws (family lands, etc.). State lands
are based in statutory laws, although these are in some cases contested (e.g. urban reservations).
In between these forms are the now expanding and increasing controversial forms of tenure; the
declaratory holdings. Their validity is questioned by perception that they represent the grabbing of
state land.
In the case of long term customary tenancies, though the interest of the tenant in the land could be
described as a right of usufruct, yet the incidents of such tenancies are much wider in range, and
the tenant often acquires more than a mere right of occupancy and user (Renner-Thomas, 2010).
Much depends on the purpose for which the land is granted to endure in perpetuity. Such a right
to occupy land in perpetuity has the semblance of ownership, and the customary tenants in these
cases often regard themselves, and are regarded as “owners” of the land.


25 | P a g e
“There are conflicting authorities on the question of whether, and if so how, the interest of the
customary tenant under long-term or perpetual tenancy is transmissible on his death. According
to the opinion expressed by their Lordships of the Privy Council, in the Nigeria Case of Oshidi v.
Dakolo, a customary tenant has the right to transmit his holdings to his issue. Another view is that
upon death of a tenant his heirs are supposed to obtain consent of the grantors to continue in
occupation though, in practice, such consent is neither formally requested nor given ”. (Renner-
Thomas, 2010).

However, no matter how substantial the rights of the long-term occupancy may be, these cannot
ripen into ownership, and so long as the grantor’s reversion has not been extinguished in favour of
the tenant, it continues to be enforceable, no matter how long the tenancy might have been in
existence, (Renner-Thomas, 2010). This means, the tenant’s view of himself as an owner is
irrelevant, even if the grantor has also ceased for many years to keep in touch with the tenant, or
that the landlord has in any way encouraged the tenant to regard the land as belonging to the tenant
absolutely.

It is important to note the existence of squatters in the tenure topology. Although squatter rights
cannot strictly be a tenure type per se, these rights could be converted into leasehold or freehold
depending on whether the land squatted on is colony land (freehold) or communal land. It is
depends on whether the vested rights are limited in time or not.

Table 2, provides a summary of the tenure landscape within the country, focusing on the forms of
tenure, key tenure factors, the regions where such tenure occurs, and the legal provisions.

4.0       INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

Land governance in Sierra Leone is the responsibility of several state and private agencies,
departments, offices and officials. Table 3 illustrates how the various agencies relate to each other.

Ministry of Lands, Country Planning and Environment (MLCPE) is the main institution
responsible for taking leadership of all land matters in the country. It is responsible for land
registration, and preparation of land use plans.

         The Land Registration Project at MLCPE is in progress but has been constrained by the
          lack of sustainability of funding.
         There are no laid down protocols of coordination/collaboration between the MLCPE and
          Paramount Chiefs on land matters.
         The Surveys and Lands Division at MLCPE is not mandated to verify ownership of land;
          and is only verifying the accuracy of surveying computations submitted by Licensed
          Surveyors for private land and by Government Surveyors for State Lands.
         MLCPE has no proper coordination/collaboration with the Ministry of Works, Housing
          and Infrastructure, since the renaming of the Ministry of Lands, Housing, Environment and
          Country Planning to Ministry of Lands, County Planning and the Environment, with the
          “Housing” functions sent over to the renamed Ministry of Works, Housing and
          Infrastructure. Ideally the Housing Department of the MWHI conducts a Housing Needs
          Assessment and liaise with MLCPE to provide land for such housing development, but this
          has not been happening. The Housing Department should also issue Building Permits based
          on approved Survey Plans and Planning Permits obtained from the MLCPE, but the
          Planning Permits are no longer been issued by MLCPE.

Office of Administrator and Registrar General (OARG): only functions in the Western Area,
situated in Freetown, the capital city. It has as its supervisory Ministry, the Office of the Attorney
General and Ministry of Justice; and generates revenue for the government. The OARG is
responsible for the registration and administration of every instrument required to be registered by
law including land transactions, industrial property, business registration, marriages and
administration of estates of the deceased, apart from that of “births and deaths”.

        The main link between the MLCPE and OARG is that survey plans are prepared by the
         MLCPE and sent to OARG for registration. There has been an attempt to automate the link
         between OARG and MLCPE in the transfer of land documents through the implementation
         of the Land Registration Project at MLCPE and the Electronic Documentation of Land
         Records Project at OARG, both funded by the Investment Climate Facility for Africa.
The OARG is responsible for registering land instruments (survey plans and conveyances), as
established by the General Registration Act of 1960 (Cap 256). The first instrument registered in
Sierra Leone was done on the 22nd January 1845. Between 201o and 2014, the OARG registered
a total of twenty-eight thousand, two hundred and ninety three land instruments nationwide. These
included: (i) leases by the State to private individuals and other legal entities, (ii) lands leased by
tribal authorities in the Provinces and freehold conveyances for privately held land. Registration
by the OARG does not provide the parties with security of tenure. It is also important to note that

28 | P a g e
the OARG only maintains a deeds registration system and does not maintain a cadastre.
Boundaries, location and rights are not recorded.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security (MAFFS) is the fundamental decision
maker on national food security; and determines institutional administrative policy and procedures
pertaining to food and nutrition security.
     The Ministry is also in charge of developing a sustainable, diversified, agricultural sector,
        which ensures food self-sufficiency, increase exports and creates jobs opportunities as well
        as improving land and water management through supporting sustainable productive

Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone (HRCSL) is an independent Commission
established in 2004 by an Act of Parliament. Their mandate is to protect and promote human rights
in Sierra Leone. It has been instrumental in showing a detailed picture of large scale investments
in land; and how it relates to human rights. HRCSL has also produced a monitoring tool useful for
private investors and government.

Law Reform Commission (LRC) is the sole mandated entity dealing with law reform in Sierra
Leone. It was established through the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975. It reviews all laws in
force in Sierra Leone to determine their reform or repeal and subsequently reform, develop,
consolidate and codify such law. It reports on researched areas of the law and draft bills that are
submitted to the office of the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice. Consequently, most of the
laws are developed by the LRC before they reach Parliament. The Commission is presently
working on the Lands Act in a bid to resolve problems associated land ownership in the provinces.

Chiefdom Administration, which falls under the supervision of the Ministry of Local
Government and Rural Development, is responsible for all the affairs of each chiefdom, including
land related disputes or misunderstandings between subjects. Very active in land litigations at the
chiefdom levels.

National Council of Paramount Chiefs (NCPC) comprises all 149 Paramount Chiefs in Sierra
Leone and was re-established in 2010, with representative structures at national, regional and
district level. The NCPC is committed to developing the institution of chieftaincy to enhance its
relevance and effectiveness in national governance, aligning regard for tradition and culture with
good governance principles that modern Sierra Leone aspires to.

Local Councils, supervised by Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, work in
cooperation with Chiefdom Councils and shall continue to perform the functions provided for in
the Chiefdom Councils Act, in particular holding land in trust for the people of the Chiefdoms.
However they have not been very active in this capacity. The Local Councils Act mandates that
land administration in the customary laws system be devolved to the Local Councils, but this has
not happened due to the lack of the required staff at the Local Councils.

5.0        RESULTS OF LAND GOVERNANCE INDICATOR ASSESSMENT

This Chapter assesses the situation in Sierra Leone for nine thematic areas, based on background
reports prepared by expert investigators that lay out first the context for each theme. This is
followed by an assessment for each dimension of the land governance indicators. The results were
discussed in panel meetings and resulted in an agreement on where the Country stands in a range
from A to D. It also provides justifications for the scores and makes recommendations, were
appropriate.

Individuals' rural land tenure rights are legally recognized and protected in practice
These rights are protected under the customary system and they have remained virtually unchanged
since colonial days.

All rural lands, with the exception of reserved and protected forests, belong to families and this
recognised in law. The status quo has not been altered. The Paramount Chiefs, as custodians of
rural lands, have ensured non-interference in the ownership of lands in their domain. They are
strongly opposed to State acquisition of land in the provinces, due to the cultural and economic
significance of land in the rural areas. It is also in the best interests of the chiefs to maintain the
existing tenure system.

The legal framework governing land delivery in both systems is complex and affected by at least
twenty different statutes and regulations. Most of them having conflicting provisions, which
present implications for land use and management (see chapter 315 for more detail on the legal
framework). The Government of Sierra Leone has not reformed the land law a priority until

recently, despite the long standing wish to reform land tenure in the provinces as far back to the
Protectorate Land Ordinance 1927. The Creoles view this as discriminating against them.
However, any change in this Ordinance would be regarded the people in the provinces as an
attempt to expropriate the land in the provinces16.

The new National Land Policy proposes a unified national land tenure system that continues to
recognize land held under customary tenure, but proposes ending the distinction between
native/non-native.

By legislation, the Western Area refers to the land granted by the British Crown to the Sierra Leone
Company.17 The British introduced the concept of freehold and superimposed this on customary
systems.

These individual and collective rights are recognized on the basis of a freehold system based on
common law and received English Law in force since 1880
State Land is administered by the State Lands Act of 1960 and is land ceded by the Colonial
Government to the Government of Sierra Leone after Independence in 1961, Unoccupied Land,
and land compulsorily acquired by the government. Land tenure recognition is regulated by Statute
Law in the urban parts. The system is based on a number of Acts such as Cap 255 and Cap 256.

Titles of ownership are done by the courts, and are guaranteed; and supported by the appropriate
laws and registered in the property Register.

In the Provinces (North, East and south) which are mostly rural, right recognition is based on
customary laws that are recognized in statutory law (Protectorate Land Ordinance 1927;
Concessions Ordinance of 1937, and Provinces Land Act Cap 122 of 1960). All rural lands, with
the exception of reserved and protected forests, belong to families under customary law; and this
is recognised.

Paramount chiefs play key roles in land governance, as they hold the land in trust for those in the
chiefdom. The different areas within chiefdom (apart from community land) are held by
landowning families, who are able to trace their ancestry back to first arrivals in the area. It should
be noted that chiefdoms were formally established as part of indirect rule in colonial times. Ill-

16
   Any major discussion of land tenure in Sierra Leone usually evokes strong emotions from all strata of society. Already in May
1970, Prime Minister Stevens promised setting up a committee to examine the country’s land system and make
recommendations, but was not implemented due, in part, to pressures from provincial chiefs who, since colonial days, view any
attempt to change the tenure system with deep suspicion. It should be noted that most politicians come from the provinces and
many have ties with land holding families. Review proponents argued that reform of customary systems is needed for
attracting investments. Others argue that a change to lease term limits by making it open without a maximum term, is sufficient to
attract investment. Krio representatives are calling for the repeal of the 1927 Protectorate land ordinance and to give an
unequivocal right for all Sierra Leoneans to live and own land in any local without need for clearance by local authorities.
17
   As defined in 31 Geo. III Cap LV 1791, s. 154 as so much land as shall include the whole tract or district so commonly called
or known by the name of the Peninsula of Sierra Leone bounded to the north the river Sierra Leone, on the south by the river
Caramanca, on the east by the river Bunce, and on the west the sea to the west. In 1787, following the arrival from Britain of
former enslaved Africans (commonly called the ‘Black Poor’), agents of their benefactors in England cajoled the chiefs of the
Sierra Leone peninsular to cede some piece of territory about 20 square miles “for the sole benefit of the free community of settlers,
their heirs and successors.” The chiefs received £59 worth of trade goods in return. Subsequently, most of the lands in the peninsular
region, in theory, became (British) Crown lands and when Sierra Leone gained independence in 1961, they became State lands.


34 | P a g e
defined chiefdom and land boundaries have sometimes led to chiefdom land disputes. As indicated
in Chapter 3, at the end of the civil conflict in 2002), the position of paramount chiefs was
strengthened (Chieftaincy Act, 2009).

In customary systems, it is possible to clearly identify ownership of land in describing the
relationship between land and a person or a group of persons in whom that interest is vested. This
is because, customary law itself is sophisticated enough to recognise and discern the varying types
of interest in a particular piece of land. Allocation of land within extended families is usually done
by the family leaders, with a variety of arrangements are possible. These include regarding
permanence of allocation, crops (annual, perennial), and requirements to provide labour in return,
specific for the ethnic group.

Rights in the urbanized areas of the provinces can be recognized via leaseholds with customary
chiefs, which are subsequently formalized (see next section).

Regarding indigenous rights, Sierra Leone is a multi-ethnic country and the legislation as such
does not protect indigenous peoples as referred to in international legislation, but acts dealing with
the provinces has references to native/and non- native which implicitly protect ancestral rights.
However, the Creole from the western area have always viewed the 1927 Protectorate Land
Ordinance as an offence18, but which served as a protection for the protectorates otherwise called
the natives. Essentially the offence of this ordinance it is argued, is to deny “non-Natives” in
particular the Creole any rights in land anywhere in the Provinces beyond a leasehold of fifty years
and renewable for a further twenty one years.”19 It should be noted, however, that since colonial
times, protectorate chiefs vehemently opposed the land laws and other new pieces of legislation,
arguing that they were “nothing short of the total dispossession of their country.” They also
opposed legislation proposed in 1947 which would have given the chief commissioner of the
protectorate the possibility to appropriate protectorate land for public works20.

Recommendations



18The 1927 law was enacted at a time when the relationship between the British and the Creole had worsened, with the former
accusing the Creole of having incited the protectorate chiefs during the House Tax War of 1898, even though many Krio traders
were killed during the rebellion. British colonial policy was thereafter to keep the Creole out of the protectorate and in all major
administrative positions in the country. Legally, the Creole were foreigners in the protectorate just as the hinterland people form
the protectorate were aliens in the colony, could be expulsed (aliens expulsion ordinance) and were not represented in the colony
legislative council.
19
   The operative S.4 of the Ordinance says thus: “No non-native shall acquire a greater interest in land in the Protectorate than a tenancy for a
term of fifty years; but nothing in this section shall prevent the insertion in any lease of a clause providing for the renewal of such lease, for a
second or further terms not exceeding twenty-one Years.”
20
   During the colonial period, the British made other attempts to appropriate land in the protectorate. In 1947, during the annual
meeting of the Protectorate Assembly in Bo, the Chief Commissioner of the Protectorate, Hubert Childs, introduced a Bill in the
Assembly which sought to give the colonial administration the power to appropriate protectorate lands for public works. Assembly
members rejected the Bill in spite of the Chief Commissioner’s strong stance on the matter. A Paramount Chief argued that: If we
agree to the Bill, the people will be pushed into the corner and will not have sufficient land for farming purposes. . . . If land is
acquired in this way, the coming generation will only be strangers in their own land and I think they will blame their fathers for
selling the land. In the past, something of this nature was brought before the people, but they refused to accept it. This Bill is,
therefore, repeating what has been done in the past and has been rejected. When Government came to the Colony, it was just a
small portion of land that was bought. But now most of the lands in the Colony have become Crown lands . . . . We want Government
to continue to lease lands from the Chiefs and the people.


35 | P a g e
   Any proposed land reform should build on customary systems and institutions, which have
    proven to provide tenure security to most and flexible in adaptation to new situations.
    Customary tenure institution in rural areas are family and lineage based, ensure recognitions
    of these rights within the customary settings and disputes are easily settled to build this within
    a streamlined structure.
   Given that general courts can hear customary law cases, such a streamlining would make
    enforcement easier.
   The functioning of customary systems can be sustained by supporting internal governance and
    internal societal dialogue, which could be informed by experiences in other areas with strong
    customary systems such as east Africa or Ghana

Western area
Freehold Land owned by individuals and other corporate entities can be freely disposed of by the
owner. In the western area there is a difference between the more urban and the rural parts. In
urban areas lands are already becoming allodial, with rights of individuals increasingly registered,
particularly after sales and being inherited. Increasingly, also in the more rural parts of the western
areas where land is hold by families, allodial freehold ownership is extending. Individualization
of land rights is possible, if accepted by the family. People are able to not only have outright
ownership but are also able to pass it down in inheritance. Women’s freehold property rights in
the Western Area are recorded, as with all other rights.

The need for boundary demarcation is paramount and is increasing in practice for people who have
allodial freehold. Structure already exists, through conveyances, to have demarcated land surveyed
and validated.

In addition, land in the western area can be acquired by grant of State Land from the State. It
should be noted that ineffective governmental control and policy over the years, have enabled



36 | P a g e
many families to acquire vast tracts of State land in the Western Area as freehold. The government
is also encouraging the leasing to foreign investors of state controlled land in the western area21.

Selling and leasing land is permitted in the western area for freehold land. There are no restrictions
reported on sales (like for example on giving consent or land use categories that cannot be sold)
nor legal restrictions on land leases. In the Western Area, interest in owning a land is mainly for
the purpose of building a house and there is a huge demand for land for building plots with high
competition amongst buyers.

Some people’s lands in the western area are mapped and recorded in the Office of the
Administrator and Registrar-General (OARG), although large tracts of land owned by families
are not properly recorded and mapped. Local government bodies such as local councils and the
MLCPE have a rough inventory also of lands owned under the customary system. There is no
stand-alone data on land parcel registered. However, since every conveyance has maps, the number
of singed conveyances at the OARG is a reasonable approximation of lands registered in the
Western Area. It is very important to also understand that the in attempt to address these anomalies,
the Urban Planning Project established a total of thirteen survey control points within the greater
Freetown area. These are not enough and more need to done to completely address the situation.

There are too many illegal land sales in the Western Area. The land cases account for around 70%
of all the cases in the Western Area courts. The vast majority of these are related to illegal sales.

Women's property rights in lands as accrued by relevant laws are fully recorded, in the Western
Area, just as men’s, given the provisions of the statutory law..

Provinces

The customary land tenure system in Sierra Leone makes provision for security of tenure for
individuals investing in land, such as tree crops. For although land may belong to corporate family
groups, individual members of that lineage/family (and even outsiders) are free to utilise the land
for longer periods on certain conditions. This is an example of the flexibility of customary tenure
systems, which adapted in the first half of the 20th century to the opportunity to grow the then still
exotic coffee and cacao for export, which expanded particularly in southern and eastern Sierra
Leone. These economic changes necessitated adaptations to the customary tenure rules to permit
long-term investments in the land. Individual family members were then allowed to plant and own
tree crops on their family plots, and even “strangers” were given such rights on culturally agreed
terms. Such land is not permanently alienated to the individual but his activities would be
recognised and protected.

For strangers, which includes non-family members, where the land required is for the cultivation
of annual crops, usually no money is paid but at the end of each farming season the farmer must
give some token produce of the farm to the family head; this is usually the equivalent of a bushel
or two of rice and the purpose is to remind the farmer that he is a tenant of the family. To conclude,

21
  According to Section 4, Land Development Act, 1962, the Government can lease State land to foreign investor for commercial and industrial
use. However, no foreign investor/company can obtain or acquire Freehold on any land, State or private (Section 3, Land Development Act, 1962).
Just as it is in the Provinces, where foreign investors can lease land, but cannot get freehold, as is the case for non-native Sierra Leoneans.

37 | P a g e
individuals can under family or other arrangements, own vast parcels of land for the
cultivation of permanent crops.

The development of leaseholds, including formal registration is a practice that is gaining tract
in the more urban areas of the Provinces. In the provinces, in some cases, the families grant
leaseholds. In such situations, the procedure is that after the payment of the money to the land-
owning family, a surveyor is employed to demarcate the land and prepare a site plan. This goes
through the validation process and is signed by the grantor and the grantee, the Paramount Chief,
the Survey and Lands Division in the Ministry of Lands and Housing, and the Town Council. In
addition, a deed of conveyance is prepared by a solicitor and may sometimes be registered in the
Deeds Registry, at OARG.

Landowning families do also transact lands among themselves but these are not formally recorded,
but the cost in time, money, and difficulty to formalize such transactions with the state (MLCPE)
are beyond what many landowning families are willing to consider, even if benefits did accrue
from such registration. As a result these transactions go unrecorded within the formal system.
Quite often also leases are unwritten and can be so long that it is almost equal to outright
ownership. Illegality of lease contracts is not reported as an issue, but the legitimacy may be
disputed by families and lineages whose land was leased out by paramount chiefs.

Information on these trends, as well as emerging land utilization pattern is scanty. What is
becoming apparent though is that these transactions have been causing huge problems for the local
people currently working the land and who lost these lands to these investors. These activities have
in their wake brought problems and have restricted the access and use to such lands and in some
cases, the rivers in these areas. In addition, such concessions have brought in their wake, especially
the mining companies, huge environmental degradation.

Cadastre records (maps) are rare and often unreliable in the provinces because it is based on
different forms of unwritten customary rules in different parts of the regions, and subjected so
much to the whims, caprices and captivations of family, community or chiefdom heads. Land
holders in the provinces may also not always be in a position to clearly indicate the boundaries.

Regarding surveying and documentation of rights, there is, generally, no surveying and
documentation of farmlands and forest under community tenure. However, it is also worth noting
that large scale agriculture land investment are been mapped and rights documented. In addition,
though on a very small scale, individuals in the communities are surveying and documenting their
rights. This mostly happens in families with educated relatives who want to undertake some
agricultural developments.

Discussions with staff of MLCPE confirm that most of the cadastre maps produced for both the
Provinces and Western Area are unreliable. Contributing factor to this is the fact that the survey
control points that are used as reference for survey measurement are inadequate. Measurement,
most times, are based on false references. Compounding the problem is that the surveyors are
inadequately trained. These have resulted to the generation of incorrect property coordinates and
survey cadastre maps.



38 | P a g e
The number of illegal land sales is on the increase in the provinces.

Women’s property rights in lands as accrued by relevant laws are recorded.

Formal legislations on inheritance, particularly from parents and from spouses, are not a common
place in the customary setting of Sierra Leone

In statutory law, women can decide themselves on the transfer of property rights across
generations, given that both women and men have equal rights to matrimonial property in the case
of divorce (including for situation of polygamous marriage or marriages that are not formally
registered).

While women represent an extremely important part of the farming population and make vital
contributions to food security, they have no other rights to land other than user rights through male
relatives.

Because they are not acknowledged as part of the land owners, women are not present at
consultations with investors; and when they are present, they have no voice. As a result, women
are not entitled to a share of land rental fees on their own.

The position of women in customary law varies in extent from region to region, with the position
of women being better in the south and east of the country. In the south and east, women can
become paramount chiefs of which there are 13 amongst the 149 PC in the country (See Annex 1).

Men who had married into land-owning families could be given land to cultivate tree crops, if they
wished. This was because the in-law was now regarded as a member of the land-owning family
through marriage. These crops acted as a kind of social and economic security for the wife. In the
case of a divorce, the woman automatically inherited the tree crops planted on their family land.
In the north, however, patriarchal systems dominate from family heads through village elders
culminating in the Paramount Chief. Here, the patriarchal system vests control of family lands
in men, and it is only in rare cases that women rights to land are recognized. For example,
when the husband dies and there is no son, or an elderly male in the family.

Recommendations

   Improve the reliability of mapping in both western and Provinces (reference points, new
    technologies, training,
   Expand accessibility of possibilities for recording of customary rights to improve tenure
    security in line with customary practice
   Strengthen women’s rights to land in customary systems and in decis ion making over land
    use, and promote sharing of good practice in customary systems
   Explore options to improve gender balance in the assignment of state lands in the western
    area ( joint titling; preference for female headed households)
   Best practice approach should be adopted and as devolution takes hold, using the offices of
    local government to undertake proper mapping of lands within local communities reflecting
    ownership-say within families through Section and Chiefdom levels. Such demarcations

39 | P a g e
      should be captured in both the soft and hard formats; and records easily assessable to everyone,
      for posterity. Such recording and mapping land in the rural areas will greatly ease land
      conflicts in these areas and make for better utilization of these lands, but may be difficult
      to realize – unless the focus would be on mapping and registering the boundaries of the
      chiefdoms, land of lineages and families first.
     The state could require that all land transactions must be recorded and registered, which would
      be a gradual way towards formalization of land while respecting customary systems. The new
      National Lands Policy aspires in that direction but its prescription for registering land on a first
      come, first served basis risks disposing some genuine land owners, in case that their land be
      registered by somebody else mastering the system which is a real risk in a situation where land
      grab is a serious problem, and corruption occurs. For situations where the permanent alienation
      of land via sales is not the preferred option at the customary/traditional level, the way forward
      would seem to lie in beefing up on land lease management.
     Ensure that government follows the spirit of the law on land acquisition in the Provinces where
      proper consultations take place with rightful owners, ensuring that such land owners are
      adequately equipped to make free and fair decisions based on proper information on the need
      and consequences in our opinion would bring some sanity and legality to occupation and use.
      Land leases should be negotiated directly with chiefs and landowners, and every signatory to
      these negotiations should have copies of the agreement. All such negotiations should not be
      rushed; and the terms of the leases or even the land area covered should be clearly understood
      by every stakeholder.
     Explore lessons learned from other countries with recognized customary law like in Ghana
      where such rights are vested in Stools or skins, and are setting up customary land
      administration systems, who work in co-ordination with the Ghanaian Land Commission.

We start here by stating that this Assessment assumes that Common is synonymous with Public.

 Most forests and woodlands in Sierra Leone are located in the provinces and held under
customary law (85% of all forests), which is recognized as such by the Forest Act, 1988. The Act
empowers MAFFS to declare any area to be a protected area for the purpose of conservation of
soil, water, flora, and fauna and where this happens in the Provinces, by law it is a leasehold of no
more than 99 years with an option to renew for another 99 years. In addition, the Act allows
communities to apply for the establishment of community forests and define and determine the
purpose for which the land will be used and who will use it, but this has not been applied yet in
Sierra Leone. It can be concluded that forest are clearly identified in law.
However, the current extent of state-owned forestland (mostly protected areas) is unknown.

National parks have been identified, mapped and gazetted. The question is whether National
Parks are controlled or administered by the State or the chieftainships, as the latter tend to act as
custodians who will give permission to collect medicinal herbs or to hunt.

Management of most forests are thus under Community management regimes and is the purview
of customary rules and regulations. For forest that has been declared a protected area is State land,
although usufruct rights may still be recognized. The Forestry Division of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security (MAFFS) is responsible for forest management and
biodiversity conservation, but its capacity to manage the forests is hampered by an outdated legal
framework despite the adoption of a new forest policy in 2011, limited institutional capacity, and
lack of funding. Responsibilities for forest use are clearly assigned with customary institutions
playing a central role, also in protected areas. Implementation capacity of MAFSS is limited and
of traditional authorities not analysed.

There is considerable overlap in forest management and other environmental management
responsibilities between the Forestry Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food
Security (MAFFS) and other ministries, such as the Ministry of Lands and Country Planning,
Ministry of Works and Technical Maintenance, and Ministry of Mineral Resources. This makes it
extremely difficult to clearly identify government forest lands and who determine their uses.

In the customary traditions, the term communal may refer, firstly, to a right of commons like for
areas used for grazing, fishing, hunting or collection of firewood and building materials. It is not
the case with arable land, where the consent of some authority to initiate cultivation at a particular
location must first be obtained. Secondly, communal land may be used to refer to significant group
control over land that is apportioned for the relatively exclusive use of individuals or families of

the group (extended family, a lineage, a clan, or a village). “Communal” is also defined by common
descent, common residence, or some combination of the two principles. The essence of common
land is that it belongs to a whole community and members of that community have right of access
to it. Community land tends to be held by the chiefdom and is not claimed by land owning families.

Rural societies recognize, protect and acknowledge legal rights to property and protect the
commons, even without a formal demarcation of communal lands. There are customary boundary
demarcations of communal lands in Sierra Leone. All national parks, sacred groves and other
communal interests are well demarcated but using boundary markers acknowledged in customary
systems, like rivers but also trees, which could cease to exist. Where boundary lines between
chiefdoms or communities are not well defined, land disputes may erupt between neighbouring
communities.

All over Sierra Leone, users’ rights to key natural resources on land are legally recognized ,
although they may have to pay taxes, such as local taxes for living within the area, or levies for
fishing in the waters. In the provinces, permission has to be granted first by the chiefs. Individuals
along the coast line thus have the right the fish in the sea, just as everyone is allowed to fish in all
the rivers, when the chief gives the permission to do so. In rural communities, no one is denied the
right to cut trees for building homes and barns, from any forest, irrespective of who owns such
land. Hunting is encouraged in all forests and the youth can hunt bush meat in any forest on any
land, especially as the land owner has no crops on such lands.

The legal protection of customary tenure systems and recognition of customary institutions implies
that where there are no competitive claims on the land (for example leasing out land to companies
for plantations or mining) multiple rights are recognized and protected in practice. For
example, on family lands everybody is allowed to fish in the waters within that parcel, cut sticks
to build a house or fetch water for household chores. It is not uncommon for some to use the same
land for grazing especially when it is in fallow while others may still use it to gather fuel wood,
hunt for bush meat etc. Through the same land could be the road to the local river where members
of the community would walk to go fishing, usually the women who would also use the same
natural resource for laundry and even drinking water. In those circumstances, disputes are bound
to occasionally arise and where this involves different families on either side, it can fester for long
periods. One family may claim exclusive rights to produce of trees, tracing origins to their own
clan.

But as already noted concessions have in their wake restricted the access and use to forest lands
and in some cases, the rivers in these areas. While full information on these lands is hard to come
by, there is a case to argue that even where legislation applies, the government has not been able
to ensure its proper application

Multiple rights over land and mining/other sub-soil resources located on the same plot can legally
coexist. This is why in the same plot of land there could exist surface rights and mineral rights.

Legal co-existence of land is common place in Sierra Leone, even although multiple rights are not
acknowledged in the case of mining. Miners must obtain also the written permission of landowners
to engage in mining operations impacting residences, farming, cultural sites, and other sensitive
and economic land uses. The Act insists for instance that those wishing to mine in a particular area
42 | P a g e
must reach agreement with the land owners and part of the agreement should include compensation
for any economic loss. Chiefs and communities would have to rely on the agreements, which
should provide on how to deal with violations. In the areas of the south and east of the country,
the Act only permits blocks of land of no more than half-hectare per miner, but this restriction is
often breached.

Although not legally recognised, it should be noted that sophisticated customary systems exist to
regulate artisanal mineral rights, particularly in the south and east of the country. While formal
legislation controls commercial mining at the national level, the widespread and expanding
artisanal mining is “de facto” regulated via customary law. Chiefs are specify areas for mining and
allocated to individuals the right to carry out a mining activity.
Accessible opportunities do not exist for mapping and recording of group rights. As indicated in
the previous section, it has been decades since the last land mapping was done in Sierra Leone.
The current new National Land Policy touches upon registration of titles for customary land. While
this may at first sight appear to be a long awaited improvement, the plan now proposed will be on
a first come, first registered basis. This may actually disadvantage the poor and illiterate who may
have good title rights, but may not know how to register it on time or lack the resources.

Recommendation

       The legality of multiple rights over the same plot of land and its resources in rural settings
        does not imply that in the customary tenure system such rights are recognised and allocated
        either within the family or community. Problems usually arise out of the ad hoc nature of
        the allocation of rights and lack of recording. Because the law itself in Sierra Leone has
        always deferred to the preservation of customary tenure, a way forward could be for steps
        to be taken to encourage the recording of these rights and for which periods and to whom.
        That way, all interested parties would know their rights and these could be checked as
        necessary in times of disputes for example.
       Enact laws that will provide for affordable and clearly defined procedures for mapping of
        rights, with less room for discretion in their application. Government should also enact a
        law that will provide for all communal areas under customary law to have boundaries
        demarcated and surveyed, and associated claims recorded.
       Make use of the reinforced position of paramount chiefs to promote mapping and recording
        of all Common lands, in all chiefdoms. Paramount chiefs are well respected and this could
        help encourage forest protection and management, with support of a beefed up land
        management unit at the center level that would interact with paramount chiefs primarily on
        problems arising from identifying and managing common lands
       Improve forest management by mapping all forest lands, including environmental
        characteristics, identification of community forests and recording of management system
        in place and its use and sustainability and agree on improved forest management and land
        use with these communities, where needed, while building on existing customary
        structures to monitor and report such agreed land use, complemented with satellite
        imagery.




43 | P a g e
       Clarify authority over national parks as well as the conditions for the promotion of
        investments in tourism (decision making; local user rights, public – private partnership,
        local benefit sharing).

               swiftly transferred to the destined use.
               Rezoning of rural land use follows a public

               process that safeguards existing rights.
               For protected rural land use (forest, pastures,
   2 2      6  wetlands, national parks, etc.) plans correspond
               to actual use.


Specific lands in the rural are restricted in their use by communal conventions and sanctions. Such
land restrictions include: burial sacred grounds, open prayer grounds, and secret society grounds
(bush). Land use restrictions are also sometimes time related. Here we refer to by laws imposed
by rural communal agreement and conventional practices. Examples here include when
community members are forbidden to engage in oil palm harvest during certain times of the year
to priority in time to rice, cassava and other staple crops farming.

Public policy objectives are served by restrictions on rural land transferability, given that if rural
lands are freely transferable this could to landlessness of rural dwellers, who constitute over 70%
of the national population. Such a phenomenon could lead to population instability, as well putting
inordinate pressure on urban services. The justification for this restriction in found in Cap 122 of
the Laws of Sierra Leone, which prohibits the transfer for alienation of rural without the
intervention of Government through the tribal authorities.

Changes in such land use plans are made through the consent of the concerned public.
Consequently the burden is shared by everybody. Such transfers are swiftly made to its destined
used, especially when it is a community decision.

However, if the change is initiated by the Government, it may not be always swift or even happen.

In situations where there is rezoning, it is not done by just a handful of powerful people. The
community is fully involved as per the conventions.

44 | P a g e
Plans correspond to actual use of protected rural land use. However, due to poor enforcement, such
protections are sometimes violated.

De facto, on the ground, customary institutions are deciding on how land and resources are used
in the land under their control, as was discussed in the previous section, multiple land use is
regulated, primarily to prevent disputes, but there is no information on the importance of
sustainability consideration in customary decision making processes.

The only restrictions on land are that.

Recommendations:
    A well-developed vision on rural land use and restrictions should be available
    The new land policy, 2015, and the acts to follow on from the forestry and conservation
     and wildlife policies respectively should include measures for the enforcement of
     regulations intended for best public use of lands by both smallholders and concessions.
    The new National Land Policy, 2015 should include the need for any changes in rural land
     use plans to be done through public process, where government is the one that initiates
     such changes.
    The current fragmentation of environmental and natural resource management in Sierra
     Leone, creating a unique opportunity for joint management by communities. More
     specifically, since communities are jointly reliant on resources such as water and forests,
     they provide an opportunity for communities to come together and cooperate on issues of
     planning, allocation and development. Joint management also provides opportunities to
     inform government and others about regional or area-specific situations. These, coupled
     with a clear mandate of responsibilities and penalties for not adhering to the defined roles,
     would reduce vertical administrative overlaps.

5.3     Panel 3: Urban Land Use, Planning and Development

The focus of this section is mainly on urban development in the western areas.

Institutional responsibilities for urban land use planning
At present, the Ministry of Lands, Country Planning and the Environment (MLCPE) is the
authority responsible for town and country planning. The day-to-day land use planning matters
rest with the Department of Country Planning, with powers to prepare and implement legally
binding land use plans.

In 2000, the responsibility for Building Control was maintained in the MLCPE. In 2002, the
Housing division was transferred to the Ministry of Works which became known as the Ministry
of Works, Housing and Technical Maintenance, while all planning matters including development
control remained at the MLCPE. In 2008, the approval of building plans and issuance of building
permits was assigned to the Ministry of Works, Housing and Infrastructure (MWHI), and
responsibility for enforcement of development control and building regulations. The matters that
remained with the Planning division of the MLCPE were those of ‘enforcement of planning control


45 | P a g e
and building control including the demolition of unauthorized structures. In 2011, enforcement of
development control and building regulations was also assigned to the MWHI.

However, over the past years, the Ministry has given priority to land survey matters and the
administration of State land to the detriment of land use planning and the Planning Division is
under resourced.

The LGA started a process of devolving the planning in urban and rural areas and development
control in their respective areas to the local government institutions. The LGA states expressly that
local councils will be responsible for the development, improvement and management of human
settlements and the environment in the locality. The LGA also clearly specifies functions of the
MLCPE that are to be devolved to local councils. These are the preparation of land use plans
(strategic and detailed plans); and the issuance of building permits. In 2008, the function of the
issuance of building permits was taken from the MLCPE and transferred to the MWHI presumably
because the local councils have not been sufficiently prepared for the take-over of this function
completely. As already indicated earlier, the decentralization process is progressing rather slowly
affecting the ability of local governments to contribute to housing policies.

The Freetown Development Project (FDP), which is an urban planning project funded by the 10th
European Development Fund (EDF) and is implemented since February 2011 in collaboration with
MLCPE and the Freetown City Council (FCC). The specific objectives of the Freetown
Development Project are : (i) Setup an effective and integrated web-based GIS management
system for spatial planning; (ii) Develop a web-based spatial database system for Knowledge
Mapping Analysis; (iii) Develop a National Spatial Development Plan, Regional Structure Plan
for the Western Area, and a Freetown Structure Plan; (iv) Enhance the technical and institutional
capacity of the Ministry and FCC through training and logistic support; and (v) Review of the
planning laws and planning systems. This project will eventually provide the legal and institutional
framework as well as enhance the technical and professional capacity of the Ministry and the Local
Council (FCC) for effective urban planning and management. The National Development
Framework and the Structure Plans at the regional and local levels will serve as effective planning
instruments in guiding development projects and programmes in all sectors. One of the serious
challenges facing the MLCPE and Local Councils is the lack of requisite number of trained and
qualified professionals in Land Use Planning and GIS.

are enforced and implications.
46 | P a g e
Sierra Leone has a series of legislation that guide and restrict urban land use, which effectively
serve public policy objectives, but which is not applied.

Before any public control over the use and development of land was introduced, landowners were
free to use their land in any way they wished provided they acted within the boundaries of their
property and did not commit any nuisance or trespass against their neighbour(s). The first
introduction of public control on land use was the enactment of the 1900 Freetown Improvement
Ordinance for the City of Freetown, followed by Public Health Rules of 1927 (supplement to the
Laws of the Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone (1925). These two legislations imposed on
the authorities the duty of enforcing building by-laws and sanitary codes in order to remedy the
worst effect of insanitary living conditions. The Department of Public Works was the authority
responsible for planning and building control in areas declared as ‘Town Planning Areas’, while
the Department of Health and Sanitation was responsible for building control in other areas which
fell outside the application of the Ordinance. An attempt to deal with more general land use
problems led to the enactment of the Town and Country Planning Ordinance 1946. This law was
applicable only to the Colony but later extended to the whole of Sierra Leone.

By introducing the Town and Country Planning Ordinance the use of land was made a public
concern, while the ownership and right to sell and buy land remained a private issue. The individual
or private developer no longer had the right or freedom to use their land in the manner of their
choice without obtaining prior planning permission from the authorities if the land in question fell
within a ‘planning area’ in order to improve and ensure good living conditions and the health of
the inhabitants as the rapidly increasing population created congestion and overcrowded living
conditions in urban areas. The law was also intended to improve and ensure the long-term interests
of community development.
The Town and Country Planning Act (TCPA), Cap 81 of the laws of Sierra Leone 1960 (TCPA)
as amended is now the principal legislation that provides for town and country planning (land use
planning) in Sierra Leone. However, its provisions have rarely been used in recent times, its usage
being mainly limited to the declaration of ‘Planning Areas’ and the appointment of ‘Planning
Committees’.
The Freetown Improvement Act (FIA) as amended and its Rules, Cap 66 of the laws of Sierra
Leone 1960 (FIA) form the basic ‘development control’ tool for land use and building construction
in Freetown. They provide basic standards that are varied and extensive as regards the use of land,
buildings and building materials. They have been applied with some degree of success but have
also provided such high standards that have not been able to be met by a large portion of the
population. Successful implementation of the FIA provisions and Rules is visible in the older part
of Freetown in the area between the junction of Ross Road extending west wards to the Congo
Cross roundabout (which includes Cline Town, Fourah Bay Road, Central Freetown). However,
there are functional issues which, though may not have been envisaged by the FIA, presently need
much attention. These issues include inadequate space for parking, transportation, traffic,
inadequate markets and recreational areas.
The Freetown Improvement (Extension) Act Cap 77 of the laws of Sierra Leone as amended
extend the provisions of the FIA to other areas outside the city of Freetown within the first, second
and third urban areas. There are also the ‘Greater Freetown’ Zoning rules of 1969 which were

47 | P a g e
policy guidelines used by the Ministry of Housing and Country Planning to assist in planning and
building control.
The FIA and the TCPA are two separate though related legislations that both deal with the issue
of development control but which are meant to serve different purposes.
       The FIA came into operation as a result of the creation of a detailed plan made specifically
        for Freetown taking into account factors such as the topography of the place, soil conditions
        etc. The FIA provides for the issue of building permits based on the provision of guidelines
        set out in the Act which relate to a detailed plan.
       The TCPA provided the basic framework for plans, which had not yet come into existence
        and where land use had not yet been determined. The TCPA provides for the issue of
        planning permission not just the construction, alteration, repair to buildings but also for the
        development of land. In actuality, planning permission has no place if a ‘planning area’
        has not been declared. The TCPA provides for the preparation of planning schemes, which
        in themselves are limited to preparing plans of the areas that are declared as planning areas,
        and do not provide the visions for the future development context and the functional inter-
        relationship between the planning area and the urban areas around. Since the introduction
        of the TCPA no comprehensive development plan has been developed and most plans have
        remained unimplemented and only few provisions of some plans were carried out
        particularly in Freetown.

It should be noted that planning permission granted to construct, alter or repair a building under
Section 7 of the TCPA is different from that of a building permit issued under the Section 16 of
the FIA which permits a person to build only according to the plan (attached to application for a
permit) which must be in accordance with the detailed planning scheme that has already been laid
out. If there is no planning area under the law, then there can be no question of granting planning
permission as a means of development control for the use of land.
Enforcement provisions in both the TCPA and FIA are weak and inadequate. In Part V of the
TCPA (Execution of schemes) no procedure is set for determining planning applications. The
methods for the carrying out of enforcement functions by the planning authorities are not clearly
defined in the TCPA for effective implementation. These methods include enforcement notices,
stop notices, revocation of use certificates, etc. Neither are the procedures for enforcement action
fully laid out.

The TCPA contains penalties for non-compliance of its provisions. However, they have rarely
been used as a means of ensuring compliance. This is because they can only apply in areas which
are actively planning areas. Also, planning schemes have never been approved of under the TCPA.

The Environment Division of MLPCE is to ensure sustainable land development in the country,
serving as the agent to advice against misuse / improper utilization of land resources, such as
expansion of land degradation and also disaster prevention. The Environment Division thereof has
a statutory mandate to inspect all lands and to advice the Country Planning Division for the
issuance of a Planning Permit before any development activities. The inspection ascertains the
environmental vulnerability of the land location in terms of, for examples, its slope (steepness) to
establish that it is not potentially dangerous with regards to landslides and rock falls, and distance
from the coastline to ensure the land is not within the high water mark. If the proposed development

48 | P a g e
is for industrial, agricultural, factory, estate, road and / or bridge development, then the Division
recommends an EIA, and the EIA procedures should be followed in accordance with the EPA Act
(2008) and as amended in the EPA Act (2010). The Planning Permit, although no longer enforced,
can be the main issue linking the Environment Division to the other two technical Divisions in the
Ministry on matters relating to land administration.

Recommendations:

       Reviewed the Town and Country Planning Act, Cap 81 of Laws of Sierra Leone 1960 (as
        amended in 2001), the Freetown Improvement Act and Rules (Cap 66 of 1960) and other
        relevant planning laws. The following improvement are needed in the TCPA act:
            o Permitted development: The TCPA act provided for only one type of permitted
                development i.e. the expressed application for planning permission. The permission
                procedures must be revised and include the complete permission process.
            o Development control: The Town and Country Planning Act should set out
                procedures to guide the planning authority in determining which development
                should be granted or refused planning permission. Planning permission is currently
                not being enforced by the Ministry.
            o Enforcement procedures in both Acts must need to be reviewed and updated to take
                into consideration various factors of accountability and the need to redress appeals
                against adverse planning decisions. Provision should also be made to allow
                coordination with the State enforcement agency to facilitate enforcement measures
                and compliance with the provisions of the Acts. Provision for the establishment of
                a special body to deal solely with enforcement measures (e.g. an enforcement unit)
                is ideal; other matters to be provided for include enforcement registers; appeals
                against enforcement notice decisions.
       The Planning Authority in the past has shied away from applying the provisions of the
        TCPA as the main land use planning law and has concentrated on the FIA. Therefore, there
        should be mandatory provision that the TCPA must be used by the Planning authority as
        the legislation to be applied for all land use planning.
       The Ministry is proposing series of amendments for a new Planning Law, which will
        address the issues of land use planning and urban development in the country. It will ensure
        the effective monitoring of development controls to effect compliance of planning
        regulations and standards. The proposed amendments are currently under legal review by
        the Law Reform Commission.
       The mandates of the various MDAs responsible for land use planning and development
        control should be reviewed and harmonized. There are conflicting and overlapping
        mandates amongst the MDAs responsible for urban land use planning and urban
        development, and these MDAs include the MLCPE, MWHI, MAFFS, Office of National
        Security (ONS), EPA-SL, MMNR, MTCA, etc. This problem compounded by the lack of
        effective coordination and collaboration amongst these MDAs.
       e-Governance should be introduced to enhance effective coordination and collaboration
        amongst government ministries, departments and agencies.

                   land.

The Town and Country Planning Act makes provisions for the development of a “Planning
Scheme” (Section 10(2)) for an area declared a “Planning Area” (Section 8(1) (a)) for planned
urban expansion and infrastructure development. To make, carry out or enforce a planning scheme,
the Minister would notify in writing, the owners of land within the planning area to which the
scheme related; requiring them within thirty days to state in writing their interests, rights in the
land, buildings therein and also to state in writing the names and addresses of all those who they
knew had an interest and rights in the land and buildings in the area. The Act stipulates also that
before a planning scheme is framed or adopted, the planning scheme had to be deposited in the
place decided upon by the Ministry, and notice of such a place published in the Gazette and any
of the local newspapers. Public notices were also to be posted elsewhere in the area. The purpose
of this was to allow representations to be made by the public regarding the planning scheme. Two
months were given in which such representations could be made and the Ministry was obliged to
submit them with the planning scheme to the Minister for consideration (Section 16(3)).

In 1999, the whole of Sierra Leone was declared a ‘planning area’.

No Schemes have been approved since then; and all orders declaring planning areas within Sierra
Leone have long lapsed. Today, Land use development is taking place in urban areas almost
without any control. Building permits are being given based on decisions and policies made in
isolation and are not based on development plans or planning schemes.
Though, the new Section 6 of 2001 Town and Country Amendment Act 2001 provides for public
participation, it is insufficient to guarantee equity within the land use planning system.

As a result, there are hardly any planning schemes against which change in land use or
development is approved. Where there are schemes, enforcement has been weak or lacking. In
practice, effective land use planning at national, regional and local levels does not really exist.
Local land use planning is carried out in an individual or ad-hoc basis. The authorities often rely
on non-statutory plans with little coordination and visions for functional and rational urban
development.

50 | P a g e
The enforcement action provisions for ‘Development control’ in both the TCPA and the FIA are
inadequate. Planning authorities have invariably found it difficult to carry out enforcement actions
because of the lack of clarity within the provisions of both Acts. The procedures for enforcement
action are also not fully laid out.

The MLCPE has proposed the following amendments to the TCPA in its assessment report of the
relevant planning laws in Sierra Leone to ensure active public or community participation
(MLCPE, 2014):

    i.     Active and substantial public and stakeholder participation in the plan preparation
           process by established consultative procedures for community involvement in the
           definitions of general and neighbourhood development goals, discussion of eventual
           alternative plan solutions as well as participation in the final consultation concerning the
           final draft plan before a final approval by the Planning Authority.
    ii.    A special planning tribunal or body should be set up at national level to evaluate the
           fulfillment of the legal planning procedures in case complaints arise from concerned
           community members.
Procedures for obligatory stakeholder and/or community consultation should be established in the
case of:

     i.    Preparation and approval of the National Spatial Development Plans involving other
           ministries, local governments and private sector organisations;
    ii.    Preparation of Regional Structure plans involving ministries and the concerned
           City/Town and District councils;
    iii.   Preparation of City/Town and District Strategic Structure Plans involving the community
           members in general, the private sector organisations and local NGOs;
    iv.    Preparation of City/Town and District Local Plans (Sub Structure Plans) involving the
           community members in the plan area, the private sector and local NGOs;
    v.     Preparation of City/Town and District Area Action Plans involving the community
           members in the planning area including the land and business owners;
    vi.    The Community participation procedures should be legally binding indicating ways of
           invitation to the public consultation activity (announcements in local press and radio/TV
           of consulting procedures and the content of the proposed plans), the period and dates
           available for the consultation activity (minimum eight weeks for each consultation
           process) and the procedures for the assessment and consideration of the public opinion
           and contributions by the planning authorities.
    vii.   The same established public participation procedures should also be obligatory when
           making addendums to the plans or revising them;

       viii. Land owners and citizens living immediately adjacent to the planning site should be
             notified of the contents of the planning proposal;
       ix.      All proposals for preparation of land use plans be made easily available for viewing and
                reading in public space to make community members able to express their
                views/opinions;
       Public access to information concerning development and building applications:

        i.      Land owners and citizens living immediately adjacent to applications for development
                must be notified of the contents of the application;
       ii.      Planning authorities to be compelled to give reasons publicly in writings on enforcement
                action which is to be taken against unauthorized development;
       iii.     A register of development and building permit applications should be kept at all times
                and made accessible to the public.

Recommendations:

             Preparation of legally binding plans (to be revised periodically) should be made mandatory
              under the provisions of the TCPA.
             Planning and building permissions must by law only be given in accordance with relevant
              development and building regulations and the land use development policies and land use
              plans approved by the planning authority.
             The information on planned urban expansion should be available, easily accessible and at
              affordable the cost by the general public. It should be the responsibility of the Government
              (central and local) to make the information available, accessible and affordable.
             Active public or community participation should be provided for not only prior to
              declaration of planning areas for planning purposes, but at other stages which include
              before and after the preparation of a draft schemes or plans. These stages may include pre-
              deposit consultation, deposit of proposals and approvals of the planning schemes. The
              planning process should also ensure transparency and accountability on the part of those
              preparing the planning schemes.
             The TCPA and FIA should be revised to ensure compliance with land use and building
              regulations. Provision should be made to allow coordination with the State enforcement
              agency to facilitate enforcement measures and compliance with the provisions of the Acts.
              Provision for the establishment of a special body to deal solely with enforcement measures
              (e.g. an enforcement unit) is ideal; other matters to be provided for include enforcement
              registers; appeals against enforcement notice decisions. The following amendments are
              being proposed for a new TCPA and FIA22.


The new Act must clearly reflect decentralisation of the function which relates to the granting of
planning permission that is to be issued for all development projects and which is to ensure
compliance with the approved plans (structure, local action area plans). Therefore the MLCPE will

22
     (Cham, Muana, & Hope, 2014):
52 | P a g e
be responsible for issuing planning permission for any development project being carried out at
regional or national levels; or of which it has a special interest by virtue of the nature of the project:
   i.     Local Councils will only be responsible for issuing planning permission at the local level.
          Provision for creating an enforcement unit charged with responsibility of carrying out
          enforcement actions as a means of Development control;
 iii.     Provision for the publication of Land Development Control Guidelines which clearly set
          out prescribed forms of applications for planning permission to carry out development
          should be made mandatory;
 iv.      Provision should be made for mandatory consultation with other sector
          ministries/agencies if relevant before planning permission is granted. The MLCPE shall
          prepare and revise when needed the guidelines used in the process of determination of
          all planning permission applications;
  v.      Provision for the granting of building permits should be made under the TCPA with the
          condition that they do not contradict an identified legally binding land use plan. Further,
          these conditions must be attached to permits which obligate the holder to fulfill all the
          relevant building regulations. It shall be the responsibility of the MLCPE to support the
          process of granting building permits by making the necessary guidelines including
          drawing up a list of other national planning bodies and planning authorities to be
          consulted in special cases;
 vi.      Building Regulations under the FIA should be revised to meet universal standards and
          modern design. In particular, buildings are required to be designed, constructed and
          altered so as to be structurally safe and robust, and also so as not to impair the structural
          stability of other buildings. Ideally a new law should be enacted which enshrines a
          standardized building code for the whole country. The MWHI is currently in the process
          of developing the National Building Standards and Regulations for the whole country.
vii.      There should be a separate system of control over alterations to buildings, which are
          listed as being of architectural or historic interest ("listed buildings"). Alterations to such
          a building that affect its character or appearance should require "listed building consent"
          (and may also require planning permission if the scope of the proposed alterations or
          development is above that classified as ‘permitted development’). Such applications
          should be referred to the Monument and Relics Commission. The owner of a listed
          building can also be compelled to keep it in a good state of repair to safeguard its
          architectural or historic significance.

Housing policy

The revised National Housing Policy, 2006 provides for access to safe sanitary and decent housing
and services, either on home ownership or rental basis, for all Sierra Leones, particularly for low-
income and vulnerable groups. However, implementation of the policy has been very weak, and
the huge housing deficit continues, resulting from decades of neglect. Most of the housing units
are said to be of very low density and poor quality and 60% of the settlement areas in Freetown
are considered slums. In 2004, 82.3% of the Freetown households live in one-storey building.
Statistics on the housing deficits and densities in the urban cities of Bo, Makeni, Kenema and Kono
are not available.

The National Social Security and Insurance Trust have designed a program to invest in housing
and make them available to citizens. This venture has not entirely succeeded because the cost of
the housing units is way beyond the earning capacity of the marginalized. The Sierra Leone
Housing Corporation has long stopped investing in low cost housings.

In the draft Freetown Structure Plan 2014, the housing deficit for Freetown in 2012 was estimated
to be 134,000 units based on the population of 998,000 inhabitants (MLCPE & FCC, 2014). Based
on the UN standard of 2 persons per room and 6 persons per household, the 2014 Freetown
Structure Plan projects the housing needs in 2028 to be 286,000 residential housing units, with an
average density of 43 housing units per ha. The existing demand for land for such housing
development projects balances out with the available supply of land at 7,398 ha.

Planning of urban spatial expansion

Freedom was the subject of active urban planning form the 1940s to the 1960s23 since the rapid
growth in population in Freetown within a limited area was raising issues of overcrowding, poor
housing and sanitation and slum areas. In the mid 1940’s, when the TCPA was enacted, several
areas were declared planning areas in Freetown24 and planning schemes were prepared for these
areas as required by the Act with subdivisions of plots, road layouts, and identified public
infrastructure and facilities, and residential areas. This was followed in 1963 by the Freetown

23
   These problems occupied the attention of planners in the early planning of Freetown, such as; Fry and Farms (1944), Stevens (1955), Doudai
(1961) and Borys (1963).
24
   Fourah Bay Road Planning Area (PN18 of 1948), Wilkinson Road Planning Area (PN19 of 1948), Ginger Hall Planning Area (PN 20 of 1948)
and Cline Town Planning Area (PN69 of 1948).- based on the Fry and Farms (1944) Town Planning Scheme for Freetown who had also proposed
the development of outlying areas such as between Kissy Road and Ross Road on the eastern part, Brookfields, Kissy and Murray Town outside
the city boundaries, as residential suburbs, and the development of Hill Station area for middle and upper income groups, to address the problems
associated with slums in the city. The construction of the Mereweather Road and the King Harman Road in 1948 opened up the area of New
England which contains government department buildings constructed by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, as well as quarters
for government officers and the Brookfields hotel. The area was laid on a density of not less than three-quarters of an acre to a building plot (Jarret,
1954).

Comprehensive Redevelopment Plan25 that included a by-pass round the south-east of the city and
a continuous main artery along the northern side close to the sea. The two plans made
recommendations for the development of particular streets as main traffic arteries to which other
streets would act as feeders. There have been several more attempts to develop land use plans and
policies and include among others the following:
           i.  A National Urbanization Plan of 1965, which draws attention to the growing
               economic prosperity and population concentration in Freetown and the increasing
               disparity between the city and rural areas;
          ii.  The Preliminary Report and Development proposals for Central Kono (1969/70);
         iii. The Zoning Map and Rules prepared in 1969 and the local plans prepared for Kissy
               to Wellington in the east and Tengbeh Town in the west in the early 1970s;
         iv.   Studies carried out for the Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Investment
               Programme (FIRP, 1993) laid the foundation for the preparation of the Greater
               Freetown Structure Plan and Investment Programme, water master plan, drainage
               and sewage master plan, traffic management study, solid waste management study
               organization and financial review of Freetown City Council;
          v.   Greater Freetown Structure Plan and Investment Programme (GFSP 1997) is a
               comprehensive development plan and introducing the concept of strategic structure
               planning, with role for public and private sectors and local government. The plan
               also introduced the Simplified Planning Zone (SPZ) concept into the planning
               process to fast track processing of planning application, and to reduce the burden
               on potential developers.

However, since the introduction of the TCPA no comprehensive development plan has been
developed and most plans have remained unimplemented and only few provisions of some plans
were carried out particularly in Freetown. These vacuums of planning processing have created eye
sores of uncontrolled urban growth in these cities.

Currently, in Sierra Leone urban growth and expansion takes place without guidance in the form
of urban planning and human settlements tend to expand without proper strategic and detailed land
use plans, infrastructure, services and community amenities.

The planning scheme preparation methodologies as provided for in the current act focused on
isolated technical solutions for the land use, without considering the need for considerations taken
to issues such as geographic distribution and increase of population, employment issues, the socio-
economic development trends and strategic disadvantages resulting from the rapid urbanisation
and to consider what planning decisions should be taken to counteract them;

Urban planning and management staff shortages are also evident at the central and local
government levels. The capacity of and resources available for local government structures is
limited which affects their ability to identify local needs and develop effective strategies that
addresses these in line with national development policy.

There have been several other attempts to develop land use plans and policies for the provincial
headquarter towns of Bo, Kenema and Makeni, but because of the lack of the political will and
institutional capacity, most of the plans and policies were not implemented. The only known plan
was that for Kono (The Preliminary Report and Development proposals for Central Kono
(1969/70).
Today, land use planning is hardly being practised in urban centers in the provincial towns. As in
the Western Area urban, local land use planning for city expansion is carried out in an individual
or ad-hoc basis, and the authorities often rely on non-statutory plans with little coordination and
visions for functional and rational urban development. Recently in 2013, the Bo City Council
embarked on a “Development Planning Framework” project to develop a spatial plan for the City
of Bo in an effort to control the uncontrolled city expansion.

To conclude, the development pressure is ahead of the spatial planning and builds up faster than
that the (limited) plans are being prepared. The authorities in many cases have to rely on non-
statutory plans or make development control decisions on an individual and ad hoc basis. Local
land use planning is carried out in an ad-hoc basis with little coordination and visions for functional
and rational urban development.

The plans further on do not reflect any national aspiration as expressed in “Vision 25”. Planning
schemes do not coordinate with local or national economic development planning and vice versa.
There is inaccurate and inadequate consideration of the use of existing infrastructure and an
Inadequate review of the general and public needs and interest to be catered for in the plans; Lack
of up-to-date base maps and modern facilities to produce them has been a further constraint
Development of a vision and policies that address urbanization, settlement distribution and growth
in the country and that take into account the inter-relationships between different development
zones. Introduce interlinked land use planning at national, regional and local levels.
In Sierra Leone land use planning does not effectively guides urban spatial expansion in the largest
city. The Government is yet to recognise and appreciate the relevance and the need to make the
required investment in urban planning. There is also the lack of political will to make long-term
investments in urban planning and development.
The MLCPE has already drafted a National Spatial Development Framework, which will provide
a holistic approach to rapid urbanization, regional integration, foster strong rural-urban linkages
and complementarities, and put a spatial framework as an important policy instrument at the center
of the national development. This strategic framework provides for the strengthening Greater
Freetown as a platform for national, regional and international trade and business.
Recommendations

       The need for higher housing densities in certain areas of Freetown calls for the
        development of new design of housing in multi-storey buildings. The draft Freetown
        Structure Plan proses that 43% of the available urban land in Freetown should be used for
        housing development, allowing for an average density of 100 housing units per ha.
       Discus and approve the draft National Spatial Development Framework (NSDF), which
        define the spatial transformation required to develop Sierra Leone. The NSDF will provide
        a holistic approach to rapid urbanization, regional integration, foster strong rural-urban
        linkages and complementarities, and put a spatial framework as an important policy
56 | P a g e
        instrument at the center of the national development. This strategic framework will thereby
        create functional growth pole areas with comparative advantages that can bring about
        higher levels of prosperity and sustained socio-economic and agricultural development.
        The NSDF will also set the basis for the formulation of the National Spatial Development
        Plan and a National Urban Policy. The draft NSDF awaits public validation and cabinet
        approval.
       Implement the National Spatial Development Plan informed by the National Development
        Framework, which has already been drafted and awaiting cabinet approval.
       Discuss and approve the draft Freetown Structure Plan (FSP). The implementation of the
        Freetown Structure Plan will guide future spatial development of Freetown. The draft FSP
        awaits public validation and approval by Cabinet and Parliament.
       Fast track implementation of the results of the TCPA review by The Ministry of Lands,
        Country Planning and the Environment (MLCPE), which has reviewed and proposed
        amendments to the Town and Country Planning Act. The Government should endeavour
        to make the required investment so that new settlement areas will be adequately serviced.
        The MLCPE has also developed a Freetown Structure Plan, which will guide future urban
        development in the city. There is urgent need for this plan to be publicly validated,
        approved and implemented.
       Undertake research on challenges and potentials related to the physical environment and
        use this to develop more adequate guidelines, information and data for plan development;
       Need for a clearly defined and sufficiently powerful planning authority also to overcome
        the separation of the planning function between MLCPE and the ministry of Work,
        Housing and Infrastructure (see introduction) weakens the land use planning system
        because policy making, development strategies and land use planning have been separated
        from the enforcement of plans via development control. It can be seen that the present
        planning system at the institutional level includes several authorities, (the MLCPE, the
        MWHI, the local government authorities). A revision of TCPA must provide for
        procedures that ensure efficient information sharing and coordination at the decision
        making levels among the institutions mentioned above during the planning preparation
        process. It should also include coordination between the planning authorities and the
        Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, as land use planning must reflect on-
        going socio economic development
       MLCPE must coordinate with Development and Economic Planning Division in the
        MFED and the President’s Office on how to transmit the long-term development goals into
        physical planning. At local level, the local councils must ensure that the local development
        plans are reflected in the land use plans.
       Strengthen technical capacity of the Central Government agency (MLCPE) and local
        councils. MLCPE is responsible for land use planning, regarding legal skills (improvement
        in the legal framework) and planning, develop and implement plans at national and regional
        level and ensure guidelines for physical planning at local level. Currently the Ministry is
        inadequately staffed, financed and equipped to undertake physical planning. Local councils
        do not have the capacity to carryout physical planning functions and include long term
        development goals into their development plans.
       Mandate and promote coordination and cooperation between the various divisions in the
        Ministry and formalised information sharing, consultation and coordination regarding


57 | P a g e
        development programmes and development projects of importance for urban development
        and physical planning.
       Develop training facilities in the country for land use planning, data collection techniques
        using IT and GIS, development control and building inspections.
       The land use planning authorities and the local councils have to structurally engage
        stakeholder (NGO’s, civil society and private sector) and ensure public participation in
        local development planning including issues related to physical development.
       Developed a Web-based geospatial database system for effective and integrated land use
        management and spatial planning, and for effective inter-Ministerial collaboration and
        coordination.

Provisions for residential building permits are appropriate, affordable and complied with

The Freetown Improvement Act (FIA) and its Rules are used as building guidelines all over the
country. Though some of the building standard provisions are very high and unattainable for many
builders, they are limited in scope to meet modern day building designs requirements.

The non-compliance of the provisions for residential building permits may be attributed to the
weak or lack of effective monitoring and enforcement of development controls. That
notwithstanding, residential building permits are affordable, because for a two-storey within the
western area, the building permits costs just about US$50.00.

The mandate for “development control” is being shared by different institutions, primarily by the
Ministry of Lands, Country Planning and the Environment (responsible for issuing “planning
permission”) and the Ministry of Works, Housing and Infrastructure (MWHI) (responsible for
issuing “building permission”). The lack of coordination and collaboration between these
institutions makes it extremely difficult to monitor and enforce development controls for managing
urban growth and development.

The Service Charter of the Ministry of Works, Housing and Infrastructure (MWHI) stipulates 12
days for the application process to obtain a building permit for a residential dwelling.
1) Submission of application to the Chief Building Inspector                  – 1 day
2) Site inspection and review of the building proposal                        – 1 day
3) Payment of fees                                                            – 1 day

5) Issuance of building (construction) permit                                 – 8 days

A total of 650 building permits were issued for residential dwelling in Western Area Urban in
2014. Out of this, 56% (367 permits) were issued within 12 days; and 44% (283 permits) in one
month. The total number of building permits issued does not seem to reflect the total number of
residential constructions going on in Western Area Urban. It is hard to tell the actual number of
residential constructions because of the weak monitoring and enforcement of development control.
As a consequence, the Government is losing potential revenue sources, which could be used to
finance effective surveillance and monitoring systems.

Recommendation
 The MWHI is currently in the process of formulation new “National Building Codes and
   Standards” for the whole country. This process should be accelerated and should be done in
   collaboration with all relevant MDAs.
 The FIA should be revised in order to provide for a standardized building code which will form
   the basic guidelines to be used all over the country.
 Though it is acknowledged that implementation is a great problem, it would do well for
   enforcement notices to be defined clearly; for the procedure for making an enforcement notice
   to be clearly laid out including procedures for complaints made by the development control
   authorities; and an appeals procedure for an aggrieved person on whom an enforcement notice
   is served.
 The Government should develop effective surveillance and monitoring systems to enforce
   development control. The formulation of National Building Codes and Standard is a first step

The formalization process here referred to legal housing construction in urban areas. The
requirements for formalizing housing constructions include the following:
1) File a notice of commencement of building to the Chief Building Inspector;
2) Routine site inspection and reporting on the stages of construction work by the Ward Building
   Inspector/Area Supervisor;
3) Inspection of utilities (water, electricity, etc.)
4) File a Notice of Completion with the MWHI for final inspection of building;
5) Issuance of Certificate of Completion of building.

If formalization process relates to legal housing construction in urban areas, then certainly it is
feasible and affordable.

There are no policies or regulations in place to formalize housing constructions in informal
settlement areas such as slum areas, which are illegally occupied by squatters. Most of the slum
settlement areas are State Land. The draft Structure Plan 2014 identified over 20 slum settlements
in Freetown, and these include:
        In the foreshore/coastal areas: Dokoty, Banana Water, Kroo bay26, Susan’s bay, Moa
         Wharf, Old Wharf and Bonga Town;
        Along slopes of stream valleys: Granville Brook, Red Pump, Grey Bush,
        On hillside slopes: extending from Black Hall Road to George Brook;
        In inland slums: Kroo Town, Magazine Cut, Fire Burn, Alpha Morlai, King George
         Farm, George Brook, Cline Town, Ginger Hall, Bonga Town, and Odokoko.
Within the slums the housing is available. That is why slum dwellers go there in the first place.
There are ways of formalising informal occupations, as shown in Table 4.

   Kroo Bay is one of the largest slums in Freetown and a highly differentiated residential and commercial quarter within the city
of Freetown. It is characterised by a large variety of land uses (light primary sector activities, commerce and trade, playground,
facilities, residential, etc.) distributed within the entire area. On the other hand, and despite the existence of numerous facilities
within the settlement, Kroo Bay is connected through economic inputs and outputs, jobs and cultural relations – in particular
education and religion, to Freetown city center and fully dependent of these interrelations. The built environment is very poor,
mostly consisting of shacks built from temporary re-used material (corrugated iron sheets, wood). The housing units are generally
very small, providing an average of 12m² and composed by only one room.

There is currently no policy in place to formalize or regularize informal settlements on State land
or encroachment on private lands.

There is currently no policy framework in place that recognizes common property under
condominiums. However, in practice, very few private developers have started offering common
property under condominiums. In such instances, they allow for effective management of urban
properties.

Recommendations:

     There is need for the Government to formulate an urban policy, which will address the issues
      of slum settlements and the formalization of informal settlements. The draft Freetown Structure
      Plan proposes strategies for improvement of slum settlements in Freetown:
           o Establish a long-term slum upgrading plan identifying the areas in need and list of
              priorities.
           o Resettle slum dwellings in areas under threat of natural disasters such as flooding and
              landslides.
           o Promote slum upgrading projects in safe slum areas in cooperation with the state,
              private sector and NGOs involving the communities;
           o Identify sources of needed technical assistance and financing options, including micro-
              financing loan arrangements to support rehabilitation of slum areas by community
              members.
      Start developing a policy for condominium as part of the need for more densification in
       Freetown.

5.4      Panel 4: Public Land Management

Good governance requires transparent and accountable management of public land for the public
interest, including processes by which land is acquired and released by the State.

The “Public land”, “crown land” or “State land”, which is the term used in Sierra Leone, is the
category of land and water bodies reserved strictly for land managed by MDAs of government
Ministry of Works, Ministry of Transport, Sierra Leone Roads Authority, Ministry of Agriculture


61 | P a g e
Forestry and Food Security etc., It is land used for government use or for general public use27 as
defined in the States land Act of 1960 and the Crown Lands Ordinance, CAP 193, 1960. It includes
all shores, beaches, lagoons, creeks, river estuaries and other places and waters.

In customary systems, “public land” also exist for the land for which customary authorities have
assigned land and resources that is explicitly to be used and accessible to the public at large such
as grazing lands, forests or fisheries (Unoccupied Lands Act, Cap117 of Laws of Sierra Leone
1960 and the State Lands Act N0.19 of 1960). This category of land was discussed in module 2 on
“communal” or common lands and will not be discussed in this section.

The Urban Planning Project within the Ministry of Lands Country Planning and the Environment
(MLCPE) is responsible for Public lands and the Freetown City Council. However, most State
land in the western area is former crown land that was bought by the British and became state land
after independence. This land can be granted but is also “grabbed”.

Other sources of State land are land compulsory acquisition (expropriation) for the public interest
from land owners the procedure of which is laid out in the State lands Act (1960), including
compensation. Land owners are compensated by offering them alternative land to relocate and
financial payments like for example, in the case of the west-end of Freetown when the government
had to acquire land for road constructions.

Also under the Administration of Estates Act, Cap 45 of the laws of Sierra Leone, the State has a
right to take unclaimed assets of persons dying intestate as bona vacantia.

Compulsory acquisition (or even repossession on state land) can also result from unwarranted
development, such as individuals building without permit, undertaking constructions in identified
‘right of ways’, and putting up structures on state lands without permit. In such cases, government
does not compensate the ‘owners’ of such structures. On the contrary, these owners are expected
to do the demolition at their own expense. Failing to do so, Government can demolish and recover
the cost of such exercise from the ‘claimants’ of such lands.

The definition of State land is the same in the provinces, but here concerned MDAs wanting to
acquire land for public interest will negotiate with deal directly with the Paramount chiefs (The
Provinces Land Act Cap 122). The State land thus acquired is managed by devolved staff from the
MLCPE, concerned MDAs and the local councils, but in consultation with traditional authorities
and consist mainly of protected areas for forestry and wildlife.

Restrictions and exemptions on the disposal of crown lands:
“Except with the consent of the Governor first had and obtained or except as may be otherwise
provided in any law, no Crown lands shall be sold or otherwise disposed of for an estate in fee
simple. A grant under this Ordinance shall not, unless express provision to the contrary is
contained therein, confer any right to— (a) the water of any spring, river, lake or stream other
than such water as may be required for domestic purposes upon the land which is the subject of


27




62 | P a g e
the grant; (b) the foreshore or to the banks of any navigable water-way; or (c) any mineral or to
any mineral oil (Crown Lands Ordinance, CAP 193, 1960)

Approach for compulsory acquisition
The State Lands Act, CAP 116 of 1960 makes provision for situations wherein the government
may want to acquire certain lands in order to undertake ‘public works’ in the country.
 By Sec. 3, the Minister can authorise his agents or servants to enter into any land to survey
    and do other acts as may be necessary with a view to appropriating such land for Public works.
    The Minister must issue a warrant to direct that such land should be acquired for the service
    of the State. A notice is to be served on the owner or any person interested in such land within
    eight days from the date of such warrant.
 Within eight days of the intended appropriation, a plan of such land is to be drawn up and
    such plan and a certificate are to be registered at the Office of the Registrar-General. Section
    9 provides that any land that has been taken and appropriated for the service of the State, the
    registration of a plan of such land, together with the certificate in the Office of the Registrar-
    General, shall be conclusive evidence that such land has been set out, appropriated and taken
    for the service of the State under the provisions of the law.
 Within twenty–one days from the date of the publication of such warrant, the director of
    surveys and lands can enter such land with his workmen in order to take the portion of land
    as specified in the warrant. Such land is to be marked out and a notice posted in a conspicuous
    place.
 Sec. 15 of the Public Lands Act provides that the owners, occupiers and persons interested in
    such land that has been appropriated are entitled to and shall receive compensation for the
    value of the land taken and appropriated and for the damages sustained by owners, occupiers
    and other persons affected by reason of the exercise.
 Cases in which the owners of lands that have been marked out for public work and the owners
    of such lands refuse to give up possession are dealt with in sec 14 of the Act. In such cases,
    the Minister shall do another warrant directed to the Sherriff ordering him to deliver
    possession of the said land to the Director of Surveys and Lands. If the owner still refuse to
    give up the land will be compulsorily acquired. The costs accruing as a result of the execution
    are to be taxed by the Court, and deducted from the compensation.
   a) Section 17 provides that if there is dispute over compensation due, the matter shall be
        handled by the High Court. In determining the quantum of compensation, section 18
        provides that the Court shall consider the following (i) The market value at the date of the
        publication of the warrant under section 4 of the Act; (ii) Any increase in the value of other
        land of the person interested likely to accrue from the use to which the land acquired will
        be put; (iii) The damage, if any sustained by the person interested at the time of the taking
        possession of land by reason of severing such land from his other land; (iv)The damage, if
        any, sustained by the person interested at the time of the taking and appropriation of the
        land by reason of the acquisition injuriously affecting his other property whether movable
        or immovable in any other manner or his actual earnings; and (v) If, in consequence of the
        acquisition, he is compelled to change his residence or place of business, the reasonable
        expense, if any incidental to such change.

                   allocations to private interests is publicly

Sierra Leone has an appropriate legal framework to manage state land, dating from the 1960s such
as the Crown Lands Ordinance, CAP 193, 1960; State Lands Act, CAP 116 of 1960, Unoccupied
Lands Act, Cap117 of Laws of Sierra Leone 1960, and the Provinces Land Act Cap 122 but is also
influenced by the constitution of 1991. As described in the introduction, the law defines public
interest, procedures for disposal, procedure for compulsory acquisition and management
responsibilities. The Town and Country Planning Act, Cap 81, establishes a Town and Country
Planning Board, which handles such matters. The Board can cause a whole or any part of an area
to be entered upon, examined and surveyed for the purpose of deciding whether or not a scheme
should be made in respect of it or any part thereof.

Before now, the administration of state lands starts with the identification of the land by the
Surveys and Lands Division. They conducted a perimeter survey to demarcate the land. This was
handed over to Country Planning Division for both physical planning and development control.
Country Planning Division officers consulted with the Environment Division for environmental
inspection of the demarcated land. This Division issued a Planning Permit based on their findings.
The Country Planning Division prepared a Layout Plan for the demarcated land identifying
suitable locations for public facilities, and determining how many town lots to be issued to one
applicant. The Administration Division used this layout plan to offer plots of land to applicants.

The system is no longer ‘synergistic’ between the Divisions as it used to be. Over time, there have
been so many obstructions in the system that it is no longer coordinated as before. Political
interference in the allocation of state lands is one of the factors largely responsible for this scenario.
The Planning Permit, for example, which was the main area of involvement of the Environment
Division, is no longer enforced. The role of this division in the land delivery process has therefore
disappeared. Country planning staffs role is sometimes overridden and / or subsided in the delivery
of state lands, as state lands can be issued without their involvement. These in effect are creating
undue problems in the documentation and recording of state land transactions.

64 | P a g e
However, there is ambiguity reading the definition of public purpose, because under the
constitutional provision public purpose includes also takings that ‘promote the public benefit or
the public welfare of citizens’ (Art. 21(1) (b) but without defining exactly what elements of ‘public
benefit” or “public welfare” are grounds for compulsory acquisition (see also next section).

Regarding compulsory acquisition, when government acquires public land, it must be gazetted.
But these gazettes are not regularly published, though when published, they are easily accessible
at the Government Bookshop.

All public land is vested in the Ministry of Lands, Country Planning and the Environment and its
Minister is responsible for the administration of State Land Act No. 19 of 1960, as amended.
Implementation capacity is however another challenge. The LGAF investigations indicate that,
presently, there are no proper control or management measures in place, at MLCPE. This creates
an appreciable level of ambiguity, thereby failing to lead to the attainment of equity and efficiency
in practice. The MLCPE, like most public institutions has very inadequate resources for land
management responsibilities in general. There is also dissatisfaction by local governments
regarding the way that the central level is managing state lands.

Record keeping is another challenge. The Government has no compete recording of public land.
Given that mapping has not been done in Sierra Leone since the 1960s, the recording of public
land is incomplete. Moreover, it can be concluded from interviews with staff at the MLCPE and
MAFFS that most of the records on public lands that did exist were either destroyed during the
war or have been misplaced. One implication of absence of records and limited management
capacity are the indications that state land has been appropriated and registered as freehold.
The draft National Land Policy (2015) has made provisions for recording of all state land to be
done at both national and regional levels.

The government has the authority to allocate State land for private interest, within restrictions of
the law (see introduction and relates to process of granting permission and excluding lands with
domestic water sources, beaches and minerals). However, there is no policy on land allocation and
there is no complete record of the amount of State land being granted by government to individuals.
Although there are legal requirements for record keeping public land allocation to private investors
and public accessibility of these records, through the General Registration Act Cap 255 and the
Registration of Instruments’ Act CAP 256, this is not strictly adhered to, leading to situations
where such records are only partially kept, though publicly accessible.

Given that the Ministry was unable to provide any evidence of comprehensive records of all state
lands both in the Western Area and the regions, makes it highly possible for the same piece of land
to be allocated more than once.
Although provisions in the laws of Sierra Leone for accessibility of all essential information, as
carried out by the OARG, most times there are challenges associated with this.

Recommendations



65 | P a g e
    Government should undertake very comprehensive set of records for state lands all over the
     country. Documents showing the use, to which these lands are meant to be put, should be
     easily accessible to anybody, so that their actual use could always be verified.
    Strengthening of State land management capacity and oversight functions within the relevant
     MDAs- particularly to ensure also that State land are managed in such a way that they
     contribute to economic development
    Responsibilities should be assigned clearly and unambiguously which will facilitate effective
     monitoring of public land and avoid corrupt practices
    Prepare a policy for allocation of State land to individuals
    Government should upgrade its gazette system and incorporate on a more regular basis
     activities on public land.

                  pre-emptive action by private parties.


The State land Act defines public interest for compulsory acquisition (expropriation) as follows:

        “Public purpose is defined as “means and includes– (a) for exclusive Government use or
        for general public use; (b) for or in connection with sanitary improvements of any kind,
        including reclamations; (c) for or in connection with the laying out of any new Government
        station or the extension or improvement of any existing Government station; (d) for
        obtaining control over land contiguous to any port or airport; (e) for obtaining control
        over land required for defence purposes; (f) for obtaining control over land required for
        civil aviation purposes; and (g) for obtaining control over land the value of which will be
        enhanced by the construction of any railway, road, or other public work or convenience
        about to be undertaken or provided by the Government”

Compulsory acquisition is taking place for development purpose, such for road works in Freetown.

However, this definition is being broadened via the constitutional provision public purpose
includes also takings that ‘promote the public benefit or the public welfare of citizens’ (Art. 21(1)

66 | P a g e
(b). However, the definition of public interest had been expanded and now also includes
compulsory acquisition for private investors. For instance, government recently expropriated land
for investments in rubber and rice plantations by the Chinese. This land is being transferred.
The LGAF team was not able to make a full overview of all expropriations that have taken place
recently, and how much was transferred for private interest, reason why this dimension could not
be scored.

There is no information on pre-emptive action because of expropriation. Whatever actions have
been taken, so far, are after the start of operations.

Recommendations
 Record keeping on transfer of state land that is compulsorily acquired has to be complete and
   kept up to date. Such records should indicate how much land was transferred for private
   interest; and on what conditions, with a monitoring system in place to ensure compliance.
 These data should be made available to the public.

   4 3         5
                   about acquisition.

In the introduction, the legal provision for compensation in the case of compulsory acquisition
(expropriation) were presented as listed in the The Public Lands Act, Cap 116 of the Laws of
Sierra Leone 1960 and the Town and Country Planning Act, CAP 81. Both make provisions for
compensation to be paid in case of compulsory acquisition of all rights with a recorded status,
according to market values according to the law. In practice, for land in the Western Area, the
government will negotiate with the landowner to determine the quantum of compensation for the
value of the land that is legally recorded. For example, compensation for the reconstruction of the
road at Hill Court road was determined by the government through the Ministry of Transport,
Land, the Local Council, SLRA, etc. This may not be the market value. In addition, no
compensation is paid to those with unrecorded rights. Payment is slow and normally less than 30%
received compensation within one year.



67 | P a g e
As already indicated, compensation can be in kind (another piece of land) or in the form of cash
payment, but compensation is not prompt. In spite of the legal instruments, expropriated owners
are not adequately compensated in the eyes of the land owners, in most cases. This is due to the
lack of an objectively verifiable market price.

In the provinces, the analysis of this indicator is more ambiguous given that the long-term land
leases of customary land are perceived as expropriation, although officially this is not the case.
Long term leases will be discussed in the next section as “public lease”, although these are not
“clear-cut public” leases, as these are between customary authorities and investors, with
facilitation by government.

An appeal to the national courts on compulsory acquisition related issues is available to all
aggrieved parties in accordance with the State Lands Act No.19 of 1960 and the Public Lands Act,
Cap 116 of the Laws of Sierra Leone 1960. Although the courts are very accessible, the panel
members observed, however, that land owners with low income are restricted in using the courts,
because they do not know the procedures involved and do not have access to, or cannot afford the
lawyers to defend them.

There are no accurate statistics on caseloads relating to amount of complaints received and whether
decisions made are timely. However, it is estimated that over 70% of civil cases are related to land
in the Freetown High Court. In the provinces though, jurisdiction to determine customary land is
vested in the Local Authorities or Local Courts. In both cases, though, the impression is that
complaints about expropriations are not attended to in a timely manner as court cases take a long
time (see section 8).

Recommendations

       Independent and professional assessment of land value for compensation
       Timely payment of compensation
       Improve appeal and redress mechanism for those aggrieved by compulsory acquisitions.

5.5  Panel 5: Transfer of Public Land to Private Use Follows a Clear, Transparent, and
Competitive Process

The previous section discussed the extent to which compulsory acquired land is transferred for
private use. This section assesses policies for transfer of all types of public land for private interest,
not just expropriated land. Sierra Leone has a particular situation for rural land as most land
transferred to private parties (investors) is customary land, not state land, and through long-term
renewable leaseholds instead of sales. The direct transfer of State land to private parties is
concentrated in the Western areas can include individuals and firms, a process that has already
been assessed in the previous section.

The government of Sierra Leone has been very active in promoting large-scale agribusiness and
attracting FDI. Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) are great opportunities for countries like Sierra
Leone that are not particularly attractive to investors, but these should be undertaken with
transparency and equity at the back of our minds. FDIs generate investment money, introduce new

68 | P a g e
technologies and build skills, may create jobs and attract additional investors, while the state is
bound to benefit from various revenue streams accruing from the operations of the FDIs (corporate
tax, income tax etc.). The Sierra Leone Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SLIEPA) has
been spearheading the drive for foreign direct investment in farmland. Established in 2007 by an
Act of Parliament, and under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Trade, SLIEPA is tasked to (i)
facilitate registration of business enterprises and assist investors in obtaining permits, licenses,
certificates or clearances needed for the commencement of business (that is, acting as a “one-stop”
centre); (ii) assist potential investors in identifying joint venture partners in Sierra Leone and (iii)
promote investors' entry into the country without hindrance and to facilitate business start-up28.
The government also passed the Business Start-up Registration Act with amendment in 2007
providing a legal basis for investor companies to do start business without bureaucratic delays. 29
SLIEPA has been instrumental in encouraging foreign investors to invest in Sierra Leone. In 2009,
Sierra Leone attended an investment conference in the United Kingdom were it invited investors
to develop industrial agriculture in the country. The country attracted 10 active investors into the
agriculture (including biofuel), particularly in the provinces of Sierra Leone.30 Agriculture and bio-
energy have attracted interest of over 40 investors mostly interested in the Provinces. About 30
signed a lease agreement but of which only 631 are active.32 The rest have not taken up their leases
to start activities.

There are no complete and reliable statistics for all large farms or the land use in Sierra Leone.
NGOs estimate that in the Provinces at least 1,154,777 ha, (about 21 % of the country’s total arable
land) was leased out for a 50 years with possible extensions of 21 years to investors for large-scale
industrial agriculture (Baxter et al 2013).

Most of the investor companies were aided by government through SLIEPA and MAFSS. The
other investors started business on their own. Government have continued to encourage investors
to invest in the land sector in spite of the growing call for caution by CSOs in response to the
problems on the ground, such as disrespect for legitimate land rights and even dispossession (see
assessments). There are three important parliamentary committees relevant to this discussion,
namely: (i) the committee on lands; (ii) the Committee on Agriculture Forestry and Food Security;
and (iii) the Committee on Mines and Minerals These basically provide oversight responsibility to
those ministries and ensures that the business of Government is implemented and protocols
followed. Parliament also ratifies government policies.

5.5.1 Transfer of public land to private use follows a clear, transparent, and competitive process
and payments are collected and audited (with the exception of transfers to improve equity such as
land distribution and land for social housing).

                        and monitored.

Land transactions involving state land or customary land are not conducted in a transparent
matter. State land allocation for private use in the western areas is not following an open tender
process. There are announcements referring the public to the availability of public lands; and
their subsequent disposal through acceptable procurement processes, which will ensure market
prices.

Protected State land can also be assigned for private interests as a lease 33 . For instance, when
decisions are taken to bring forest reserves into use for development, only MAFFS and MLCPE
are involved. Such lands are transferred to individuals and companies without any open and
transparent process.

The majority of land transactions are in the provinces, but there are no official statistics of the
amount of land that is under long-term lease to investors or under negotiations. Equally, in the
Provinces long-term land leases with (external) investors are not allocated via auction or open
tender process in the past three years. Land leases are negotiated directly with chiefs and other
landowners. The Chief is expected to consult with heads of families of land owners before
reaching a conclusion with the government (usually there is involvement of an MDA). When
Chiefs signed contracts with investors, sometimes they do not adequately inform their
community members or the public on consultations, negotiations and the details of the final
contract agreement between customary authorities and investors on compensation for public land
or on the role of government agencies. However, panel members reported that the signatories do
not always have copies of the contracts and are not fully aware of the terms of the leases or even
the land area covered by the contract.

The Assessment expresses a general concern over the lack of transparency and public disclosure
for all aspects of the existing land lease deals. Research has shown that most landowners whose
land is now being occupied by investors did not give a free, prior and inform consent. 34 There is
also little critical or accurate media coverage of the land deals.
33
  According to Section 4, Land Development Act, 1962, the Government can lease State land

Market prices are probably not being used in determining the lease value for State land or
customary land is leased at market prices. There is no official process for determining the land
value and there is no standard of what constitutes a base value. The yardstick used by investors
is the location of the land and availability/proximity of infrastructure (major road, electricity,
water, access to ports).

The assessment did not find a procedure for price setting for the allocation of State land in the
western area. In the provinces, the government is involved in negotiations between the investor
and the paramount chiefs who represent the actual landowners. The fee is based on the estimated
value of the land and additional damages sustained by such owners. It not clear on what basis
valuation of this land is done. For example in the case of Addax, one of the better known examples
of long-term leases, the lease value of USD 3.35/ha was set as fee, but this is perceived as too low
(does not allow a meaningful maintenance of social and economic status that existed before the
land was leased) and not being paid. It is reported that Agri-capital Ltd operating in the Bumpeh
Gao chiefdom involved in rice production on 3,036 acres is paying just one bushel of paddy rice
per acre annually as rent over a period of 50 years.35.

There seems to be no government policy to ensure that the public captures benefits arising from
changes in permitted land use. On the contrary, investors are given subsidies in the form of tax
holidays. Agricultural investments benefit from 10-year corporate tax holidays and zero import
duty. The country allows 100 percent foreign ownership of enterprise ownership in all sectors;
there are no restrictions on foreign exchange, no limits on expatriate employees and full
repatriation of profits, dividends and royalties. There are discussion in the Minister of Finance and
Economic Development to review the regimes of tax and duty exemptions as these are eroding the
government’s tax base.

Payments for public leases are collected for most leases in the western areas, where government
collects the fees for public leases. The National Revenue Authority (NRA) is charged with the
responsibility of collecting all payments for public lands yet these payments are not monitored.
Furthermore, there is no coordination between government institutions dealing with revenue
collection for government property including land; and there is also scarcity of data on such
transactions.

No official prescribed method is in place for making payments for customary land leased in the
provinces. Leaseholders are bound to pay their rent, as per the agreements signed between lessee
and the representatives of the landowning families in the Provinces. Most investors pay royalties
to the traditional authorities in the provinces and sometimes perform their social corporate
responsibilities in terms of undertaking development activities in the communities. Lease rent
payments have been largely done in public through the chiefdom authorities often in the presence

of government representatives at district level and security agencies. The payments are often in
cash.

There is a procedure in the provinces for dividing the lease hold fees from large scale land leases:
Land owners = 50%, Chiefdom council 20%, District council 20% and consolidated fund 10%,
but there is no evidence that the latter is being put in place.

However, discussions with land owners in the Bo Reservation, where Government had built houses
for senior Government Officials, since colonial times, shows that the obligations for the annual
lease payments for land acquired from land owning families, have not been honoured by the
government for over 30 years.
There is no explicit policy in Sierra Leone to assign state land to private interest from an equity
perspective (such as plots for low income groups for housing or land distribution to the land less).
The 2005 Land Policy did not adequately address equity in land asset access by the poor through
state land redistribution. The new National Land Policy (2015) will address this issue.

Recommendations

     A modern method of land valuation should be adopted and a base value for land in parts of
      Sierra Leone should be established and reviewed regularly.
     Individual land holdings must be calculated and paid out at the individual family/clan level.
      Payment for community/public land is made through the chiefdom authorities and in
      public.
     Land sales whether public of private should be made open and made public for
      accessibility.
     There should be a distinction between community/public land and family/clan land and
      these should be separated through proper land demarcation and documentation in the form
      of land titling particularly when it when it will form part of a larger estate of an investor.
     There should be established a public means of communicating availability of land for land
      transaction.
     All land transactions (small or large) should be made public and should be accompanied
      by the values

    5    2     5   regularly monitored and remedial action taken

                   Safeguards effectively reduce the risk of
    5    2     6   negative effects from large scale land-related
                   investments.
                   The scope for resettlement is clearly
    5    2     7   circumscribed and procedures exist to deal
                   with it in line with best practice.

Evidence abounds that land owners are disgruntled because of the highhanded manner in which
their lands are ‘taken away’ from them. This is due to the provisions of CAP 122 of the Laws of
Sierra Leone, which vests the title deeds of such lands, in the provinces, to statutory trustees.

The social-cultural and environmental impacts of these transfers are negative, and they are not
selected in an open process. The community members do not even participate in these transactions,
let alone being transparent, although there are processes in place. For instance the MAFFS
guidelines clearly spell out the need for investors, in agriculture, to embark on out-grower schemes
for local farmers. However, it appears that investors ignore them. For example active companies
like ADDAX, SOCFIN, SLA/Geoffpalm that are in advanced stages of implementation, have not
directed investments in out-grower schemes, as required.

A number of institutions with decision making powers can be identified. The ministry responsible
for lands (MLCPE) has the surveying department within its structures advising on survey methods
and applications. The Ministry responsible for agriculture (MAFFS) advises on crop mapping in
the country, e.g. regions in the country suitable for what type crop. They advise on available
incentives for agro-based businesses. Advise on the MAFFS guidelines and follow through with
implementation. The agency responsible to attract investors into Sierra Leone (SLIEPA) supports
investors as they come in country. SLIEPA assists the process of a one-stop shop for business
registration. SLIEPA assist investors navigate the myriad processes of land acquisition. The office
of the President hosts an agricultural advisor and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The former advises the President to take critical decisions on agricultural policies of the
government and the latter is the agency that advises on environmental issues and further grant
licenses to huge projects that causes environmental degradation. The institutions have the
competencies and levels of capacity. However, they are under-resourced and have inadequate
incentives that should engender follow-ups that will lead to the derivation of social benefits from
investors.

The Assessment concludes that there are no safeguards are established and applied in procedures
and regulations to prevent investments involving large tracts of land from infringing on or

73 | P a g e
extinguishing existing legitimate tenure rights. Procedures hardly relate to the remedies for
infringement or voiding of existing tenure rights. Such remedies are sought through compensation
via the court system, but which may not always be accessible (see section on expropriation).

Civil society groups like ALLAT, Green Scenery, NAMATI and SiLNoRF have consistently
monitored investments such as ADDAX, SOCFIN and Sierra Leone Agriculture/Geoffpalm, to
ensure that existing tenure rights are not just disregarded without adequate compensation and that
there is compliance.

There has been no coordination and no policy on land uses and rights. There are being developed a
land use planning and land policy documents, but are not yet approved by Parliament. At the
moment, therefore, land use and land right is loosely being decided by some ad hoc arrangements
depending on the individuals or communities involved. The land policy has recommended the
establishment of a land commission. The policy has also proposed the establishment of an effective
and publicly accessible land information system. The information system should include but not
limited to land cadastre or land use planning. Indications of prime locations and other information
to determine value should form part of the information design.

In addition, there are several institutional and administrative overlaps. However, the lack of a
clear policy framework on large-scale investments results in much ad-hoc policy decisions by
the MDAs involved. Mandates are not clearly identified and it is therefore difficult to avoid
institutional and administrative overlap. Public institutions involved in transfer of large tracts of
land to private investors do not systematically share land information and there are no effective
inter-Ministerial coordination mechanisms in place to timely identify and solve competing land
use assignment (incl. Sub-soil for mining).

The EPA requires an Environmental, Social Investment Analysis of all such investments; from
which safeguards are identified. However, due to the lack of effective monitoring capacity of EPA,
the transferees don not adhere to the safeguards

Sierra Leone has no policy for cases where resettlement is needed possible are thus also no clearly
circumscribed and procedures to carry it out are in place. Resettlement plans are in existent but on
a case by case basis and usually as part of the investment agreement. While there has been no
resettlement in the agricultural sector, there has been several in the extractive sector. For instance
Sierra Rutile, the company that extracts Titanium, has undertaken a number of settlement activities
based on their own model.

Recommendations

       A proper tool should be designed to assist investors and communities follow a step-by-step
        procedure of how to acquire land in the provinces. The procedure should be transparent
        and inclusive of not only land owners but also land users.
       Ways to make land available to large scale investments must be explored for instance
        investment into the practice of sedentary farming could be done to examine the outcome.
       A study of agricultural/investment models that should entertain benefit sharing or
        incorporate the means of supporting host communities with long term sustainable growth

74 | P a g e
        through farming practices and technology transfer should be undertaken with the intention
        that the end results will be adopted/adapted.
       Institutions must be resourced and staff incentivized to cope with the demand to deliver the
        required services that will ensure the derivation of social benefits
       To avoid administrative overlaps, institutional collaboration must be instituted.
       The land commission should primarily be responsible to administer land. Its function
        should not be to own land, neither should it be to ascribe land to anybody.
       A well developed and progressive information system should be designed and regularly
        updated. This should be available to the public through web-based systems.
       Agencies responsible for monitoring of investors for whatever purpose of compliance
        should ensure it is done rigorously and regularly.
       Civil society organisations must be given space to monitor compliance and a way of
        augmenting the efforts of government.
       As a matter of urgency, there is the need for a resettlement policy and law which must be
        based on human rights principles and international best practice.

MAFFS' investment guidelines into the agriculture sector requires a proposal in the form of a
business plan with sufficient evidence of capacity, sustainability (out-grower scheme) as well as
social and environmental benefits and safeguards by the investment. There is also a performance
monitoring of the investment in the policy which warrants that should provide a bank guarantee as
safeguard for failure during the 5-year incentive period. The capacity of the ministry to rigorously
interrogate business plans viability and sustainability is inadequate. The guidelines require
consultations which invariably are provided. The quality of representation in the consultations is
mostly inadequate, meaning that participation is often than not exclusive ensuring unfair
representation of community shade; especially women and young people.

There is free, prior and informed consent on the part of the land owners.

The new National Land Policy is requesting sufficient information from investors for government
to assess the cost-benefits of the proposed investments. There is also a performance monitoring of
the investment in the policy which warrants the investor to provide a bank guarantee as safeguard
for failure during the 5-year incentive period.
As indicate in the previous section, there are no free, direct and transparent negotiations between
right holders and investors. In addition, legitimate rights holders do not have always access to
information.

It is always important to note that title in provincial land is not vested in the land owners, but
rather in statutory trustees, “who hold such lands for and on behalf of land owners. .

The agreement is debated by Parliament, which constitutes the peoples’ representatives; and the
final conclusion of the agreement is reflected in an Act of Parliament. This is made available to
the public at points of sale. In addition the MPs are given copies to interpret and disseminate in
their constituencies.

Recommendations

       It must be mandatory that all investment documents are fully assessed and reviewed, with
        recommendations adhered to before investors proceed with their operations.
       Land owners should be made to be involved in the negotiations of lease
       Affected communities must be supported with lawyers during negotiations for lease fees

       Contracts or Memorandum of understanding should be made public to avoid wrong public

The information is also available to the public through other government institutions and agencies,
such as the Office of the Administrator and Registrar General, which records and stores all
transactions dealing with land as well as the registration of businesses. The storage of hard copies
of the information exposes them to the risk of damage and loss. Quite recently however, the agency
is making effort to digitize the information.

The spatial information seems not to be used to minimize overlap with other forms of land uses.
The panel members observed that some spatial information documented in the agreement is
inconsistent with records on the ground.

Both the state lands act and EPA make provision for safeguards to ensure environmental
sustainability.

The State Lands Act No.19 of 1960 and the Public Lands Act, Cap 116 of the Laws of Sierra Leone
1960 makes provision for this. It states “In every agricultural lease under this Act, there shall by
virtue of this Act be implied by the lessee a covenant that he will improve and develop the natural
resources of the land in a prudent and business-like manner and will abstain from the undue
destruction or exhaustion of any timber, trees or Plants for the sale or cultivation of which the land
is leased.”

It is the Environmental Protection Agency's responsibility to address ecological and
environmental goals in Sierra Leone. EPA requires all large-scale investments with strong
potential to degrade the environment to undertake an environmental and social impact
assessment (ESIA). Safeguards in the form of Environmental Impact Assessment and Social
Impact Assessment are designed, to a large extent, in line with international best practices and
are stipulated to be applied, as such. Any land leased or sold for use other than residential is
subject to an EIA. However, this is not always monitored effectively, resulting in many
violations. Even when the EIA Certificate is issued corrupt practices usually lead to its non-
applicability.

There are no easily available avenues for legitimate right holders to air complaints if investors
do not meet contractual obligations. One problem is that the right holders on the ground are not
usually direct parties to investor agreement, but represented through chiefs. In some instances,
right holders may contract directly with investors for the use of their surface land. As it stands
now, the only ones benefitting from these leaseholds are the large scale investors, while leaving
the local members of the land owning families who are losing the land in the cold for both land
concession and lease arrangements. Government officials, local council officials and paramount
chiefs may draw some benefits too.
The constitutional provisions that guarantee right holders a legitimate right to access the justice
system to remedy a breach may not be accessible or dot not result in timely decisions and may
also be perceived as unfair. These weak options for redress of contracts or ensure compliance
may be a reason why sabotage and violence are common phenomena in cases where investments
have infringed on legitimate rights and did not respect safeguards.
Recommendations


77 | P a g e
Mechanisms for safeguards of all forms; labour, tenure rights, resettlements, pollution etc. must
be designed and effectively implemented. The safeguards should be enforceable regulations.
     Land mapping should be done throughout the country and must not just be subjected to
       public land. This mapping should recognize land use, spatiality, other data such as
       demography, vulnerability to degradation, elevation, ownership etc.
     This information should be made public and made easily accessible.
     A compliance monitoring agency specializing in other forms of safeguards apart from the
       EPA that looks specifically at environmental issues should be setup to carry out annual
       monitoring of safeguards in collaboration with the EPA.
     Effective mechanism such as a land complaints board with total independence and binding
       recommendations must be constituted. Its paramount role is to deal with complaints from
       land rights holders in a speedy way. To carry out its functions it must be made to work with
       relevant bodies (government, CSOs and other independent bodies set up by government).

5.6     Panel 6: Public Provision of Land Information - Registry and Cadastre

MLCPE is the principal institution charged with the responsibility for the management and
administration of State land, public provision of land parcel information, Surveying and Mapping
of all Lands of the Republic of Sierra Leone as enshrined in the Survey Ordinance of 1950. MLCPE
has four Divisions, as follow: Surveys and Lands; Country Planning; Environment and
Administration. Specifically, the Surveys and Lands Division has the mandate to develop state
topography to: provide cartographic and topographic data, implement a standardized national
coordinate system, survey of all lands (including urban, sub-urban, and rural territories), demarcate
private and state land boundaries, conduct a comprehensive registration of land titles, and compile
and maintain a comprehensive record of lands in the country. The Division of surveys and lands
is also responsible to map and provide relevant statistic on total land parcel mapped and unmapped
nationwide.

A comprehensive land information system will adequately provide basic relevant statistics on
mapped and unmapped land country wide, however, such activities could not been undertaken by
MLCPE due to inadequate capacity. Against this backdrop, the Government of Sierra Leone
through the MLCPE initiated the Land Documentation Project and Land Registration Project in
2009 and 2010 respectively. The Land Documentation Project aimed at digitising or computerising
existing paper land documents and establishing a database of these at MLCPE. It started digitising
Offer Letters, Conveyances and Survey Plans and storing these on disk. The Land Registration
Project was to streamline the land delivery process by automating the work flow process and
institutes a GIS platform that stores and analyse GPS data and produces corresponding survey
plans automatically; a GIS database at the MLCPE to interface with the Electronic Database
created at OARG in order to automate and ease the land administration process through
computerised documentation and processing. However, both projects have not been sustainably
maintained, and MLCPE has not realised the benefits that were envisioned from them.

The OARG is still responsible for registering land instruments (Survey plans and conveyances) as
established by the General Registration Act of 1960 (Cap 256). Registration of instrument by
OARG can be traced as far back to the colonial period. The first instrument registered in Sierra
Leone was done on the 22nd January 1845. The OARG has registered a total of thirty-eight

78 | P a g e
thousand, three hundred and thirty three land instruments nationwide since it commenced
operation to date. This number include as follows: Conveyances; Mortgages; Freehold Agreement;
Leasehold Agreement; Statutory Conveyances; Statutory Declaration; Tenancy Agreement;
Contract Agreement; General Agreement; Powers of Attorney ( Executed in Sierra Leone) and
Powers of Attorney ( Executed Overseas).

The main link between the MLCPE and OARG is survey plans prepared by the MLCPE and sent
to OARG for registration. There has been an attempt to automate the link between OARG and
MLCPE in the transfer of land documents through the implementation of the Land Registration
Project at MLCPE and the Electronic Documentation of Land Records Project at OARG. The Land
Registration Project at MLCPE is in progress but has been constrained by the lack of sustainability
of funding from donors.

Law Reforms Department is still responsible for settling land disputes involving ownership. The
Ordnance Survey did not mandate the MLCPE to verify ownership of land; rather the
responsibility of the Surveys and Lands Division at MLCPE is restricted to verifying the accuracy
of surveying computations submitted by Licensed Surveyors for private land and by Government
Surveyors for State Lands. Although the Law Reforms Department will in most cases consult with
the Surveys and Lands Department in settling land conflicts, the implication and perhaps the root
of most these conflicts about duplication of land sales is that those who are responsible for
demarcating and measuring the land cannot verify who owns it.

    6 1      5
                  significant informal fees.

In the Western Area a poor person in possession of land can claim legal rights in line with local
norms, through the provision the Statute of Limitation. This Statute provides land rights to the
claimant after a 12-year period of non-counter claim.

In the provinces, the family cannot be disposed of its land by a settler occupying a piece of land
for a period immemorial, unless the settler can prove that he has not paid over the same

79 | P a g e
immemorial period, the traditional crop tributes, from the land in question, to his counter
claimants.

Non-documentary evidence is effectively used to help establish rights in the provinces. The
formal recognition of the the customary land tenure system in the provinces where interests in
the land are not registered, non-documentary forms of evidence would allow full recognition of
claims to property in the absence of other forms of evidences. Long-term unchallenged possession
is formally recognized via the Limitation Act 1961 and the Statutory Declaration 1835, but this
applies mostly to private land. In this regard, the squatter must prove that there has been a period
of adverse possession of at least twelve or at most between 30 and 40 years. In effect a possessory
title is converted into instrument by declaring under the provision of the Statutory Declaration Act
1835. The Declarant would declare that he had been in possession of the particular land for years
either by himself or through his predecessor in title which is supported by two witnesses. A survey
plan is prepared for the said land and attached to the instrument or document. The declaration is
made on oath and registered under the provision of Instrument Act cap 256.

On demand recording of rights is possible in Sierra Leone but does not include proper safeguards
to prevent abuse.

List of the actions or documentation required and associated costs for formal registration:

        1. Site Survey Plan signed by DSL - Le 2000 (USD4.00) for less than 1 acre; Le 4000 (USD
           8.00)/Acre
        2. Deed of Agreement prepared by a lawyer – 10% of the value of a 2 town lot36
        3. Administrative Activity Cost - Le 100, 000 (USD20)
        4. Judicial Costs / Taxes Incurred - 0.1% (stamp duty) cost of land

The costs are exceeding 5% of the property volume and the major factor that has an impact on the
time and cost of first time registration is the lack of adequate capacity and logistics within the
MLCPE to conducted land parcel survey and prepare site cadastre maps/survey plan required for
the lease document to enhance registration at the OARG. Especially for commercial and
institutional leases these tasks take a long time to be accomplished. The maps ( Cadastral plans)
covering the Western Area and country wide are out-dated and not computerized coupled with
limitations in the required resources of personnel and logistics. As a result of these limitations,
officers assigned to carry out field surveys exercises hence would have to take money from client
outside the official arrangement. Additionally, the approval process also takes time due to the fact
that all the approving authorities (Hon. Minister, PS, DSL etc.) are most of the time busy with
urgent state matters.

Although first time registration does not entail significant informal fees, it is worth stating that
concerns about informal fees for conducting survey, registration of land interest have been raised
by the general public against MLCPE officers. Such concerns need to be verified by the Ministry
in order to effect appropriate necessary action.

    Review and upgrade relevant legislation bothering on process for formal recognition of
     possession and should include both state and private lands.
    Upgrade legislation on the cost of processing survey plans at MLCPE
    Enact legislation to control fees of private surveyor and lawyers
    Update cadastre maps for western utilizing GIS/GPS techniques in conjunction with satellite
     imagery technology. This should be extended to other areas within the country.
    Strengthen institutional capacity through staff recruitment. People who can be trained easily
     should be recruited while attention is given to upgrading the skills of existing staff.
    Service Delivery Charter indicating service provided and their corresponding fees and time
     frame should be published by MLCPE and OARG.

The recording of property transfer is the responsibility of OARG, which is the land registry of
depository, where documents including instruments are deposited to inform the general public that,
for example, a transaction has taken place between parties concerned. It does not guarantee
ownership. The recording of property transfers is guided by the Registration of Instruments Act
Cap 256 and fees are as per Service Charter, which is displayed for public attention. The
registration process in the OARG simple and straight forward, yet informal payments may be
incurred before final registration due to the pre – registration bottleneck tax clearances. The total
formal cost of a recording property transfer is shown in Table 5.
However, due to high level of taxes, property owners in most case do not declare the true value of
the properties.

OARG depends on the cadastre information from MLCPE of all survey plans signed (copy of plan
attached to the document to be registered) and sent weekly (“weekly returns”) in order to effect
registration of properties. But in most cases properties are registered without the weekly returns
which may be attributed to delay in sending the said returns or property interested in by the OARG
executive(s).

Information held in records is also not linked well to maps that reflect current reality and it is
estimated that less than 50% of records for privately held land recorded in the registry are readily
identifiable in maps. Most importantly due to the fact that the maps (cadastral plans/maps) are

82 | P a g e
out-dated, such maps cannot reflect the current reality on the ground, hence map revision is
necessary and very urgent. The revision of maps country – wide but starting with the Western Area
is important and urgent due to the fact the pace of physical development in the field is just too fast.
Relevant private encumbrances are recorded but this is not done in a consistent and reliable
manner. Private encumbrances such as easements, mortgages, and restrictive covenants can be
found in the conveyance register, but are not registered or recorded in the charges register, as in
the case of Title Registration – the land registry. It is worth noting that cross referencing in
conveyances for private encumbrances can be a problem, which is why there are incidents where
a mortgage or easement may not show against a property in the OARG.

Relevant public restrictions or charges are recorded, but this is also not done in a consistent
and reliable manner. As with private encumbrances, public restriction or charges forms the body
of Government Documents or leases registered at OARG, but not recorded in the charges Register
as in the case of Title Registration and the Land Registry. However, public restrictions or charges
are covered by statutes such as State Land Act No. 19 of 1960 (re – entry of lease lands, public
Lands Act cap. 116 (Compulsory Acquisition of Land) to name but a few.

There is a timely response to requests for accessing registry records. Copies and extracts of
documents recording rights in property can generally be obtained within a day of the request. Once
request has been made and the prescribed fees paid, an extract or copy of any entry in the register
or ledger kept in the OARG can be obtained as a Certified True copy of the original.

The process of obtaining copies and extract of documents, recording right in property, has been
improved through the development and deployment of VPN link between MLCPE and OARG,
and the digitization into electronic format of all hard copies document recording right in property
at OARG. The link ensures survey plans prepared at MLCPE (“weekly returns”) are provided to
the OARG in good time and land records digitization provide OARG the opportunity to search
registry records in a rapid and flexible manner. These are being achieved through the
implementation of the Land Registration Project at MLCPE and the Electronic Documentation of
Land Records Project at OARG.

Obtaining processed survey plans from MLCPE can take days. This is as result of the manual filing
system still practiced there. It is very common for survey plans to get missing at MLCPE.

The registry is searchable and the records in the registry can be searched by both right holder
name and parcel, which is represented by serial number, page volume and year of registration on
one hand. On the other, in each document registered, there is a signed survey plan by the Director
of Surveys and Lands at the MLCPE bearing the name of the property owner with identification
number, referred to as LS number which is done serially to avoid duplication and enhances the
searching process. Computerization of Land records at OARG has made it flexible to search the
registry and has reduced the searching time. Several search requests can be completed in a day.

Land information records are easily accessed because copies of extracts of documents recording
rights in property can be obtained by anyone who pays the necessary formal fee at the OARG. In
the case of the MLCPE, the service is free to obtain information in respect of recorded land owners.
This is easily achieved by the LS number records for private land and LOA, LOB, LOC etc. records

83 | P a g e
for state owned land leases and freeholds. However, the records are not normally accessed within
a short time.

Recommendations
     Upgrade legislation on the cost of processing survey plans at MLCPE
     Enact legislation to control fees of private surveyor and lawyers
     Update cadastre maps for western utilizing GIS/GPS techniques in conjunction with
      satellite imagery technology. This should be extended to other areas within the country.
     Develop and deploy a GIS based National Land Information System Database at MLCP.
      The NLISD at MLCPE should be deployed to other MDAs and its regional offices through
      a WAN. This technology will allow the cadastre databases at the regions to be updated
      concurrently and reflected into the central cadastre database created at MLCPE
      headquarters.
     Legislation on recording of private encumbrances should be reviewed and upgraded to
      catch with the current economic demand.
     Introduce a robust mechanism for recording private encumbrances in a consistent and
      reliable way.
     Review and update outdated existing legislation on public restrictions or charges
     A robust and modern land delivery process is required at MLCPE. Digitize and automate
      land administration and management at MLCPE to include an electronic database of all
      processed cadastre maps. There should be electronics backups and disaster recovery plan
      for the database.
     The Land Documentation Project at OARG be reviewed and extended
     The Land Registration Project at MLCPE be reviewed and extended.
     Extension of Land Registration Project to regional offices requiring that they are equipped
      with the necessary staffs and equipment.

  6 3     2
               reality on the ground

The foundation of a prudent and judicious land administration and management is an effective
land information system, which is lacking in Sierra Leone. The current situation is dismally
unhelpful, with existing land records not properly maintained and almost inaccessible by the
public. There is lack of public trust in authorities responsible for land administration and
management. Many land transaction records are believed to be either manipulated or technically
inaccurate, and therefore duplicitous.


84 | P a g e
Records are paper based and not digitized. The capacity of the administrators to carry on their
designated functions such as demarcations, surveys and registration of land transfers will not
improve and they cannot cope with the growing demand for land administration services in the
wake of rapid urbanization and huge demand for land for monoculture plantation agricultural
investments

Information in the OARG public registries is synchronized with the MLCPE cadaster record to
ensure integrity of rights and reduce transaction cost and has been established through a VPN link
to improve on land management services. The link is however less effective due to delay on the
side of MLPCE to timely deposit cadastre records for the information of the OARG. Effective
implementation of the VPN links and checks are insufficient to eliminate a significant number of
potentially fraudulent transactions in the entire system. Also, coordination between MLCP, OARG
and relevant stakeholders in management of land information system is very weak and non-
existence in some cases. In this regard, checks are insufficient to eliminate the potential fraudulent
land deals which are a serious security threat to the country.

Registry/Cadastre information is not reliable, given that less than 50% of the ownership
information in the registry/cadastre is correct. This is partially due to incorrect land parcels survey,
with land parcel coordinates not corresponding to reality on the ground, as a result of inadequate
trained and qualified personnel, out dated maps, and lack of equipment. Normally, if MLCPE
cannot update the cadastre system for the signed survey plans, which are attached to each document
for registration to reflect ground reality, then OARG will have no update registry records.
However, this is hardly done.

The inadequate staffing level situation is such that, though there are several vacant positions at the
Surveys and Lands and the Country Planning Division, they have not been filled due to availability
of suitably trained and qualified candidates. The Divisions had made efforts to recruit staff through
the Public Service Commission, but this has been hampered by the availability of suitable
candidates. The small group of professional staffs currently in post have not been able to
effectively handle the work load, and as result, there has always been a huge back log of work in
the various units at the Division. Surveying practices are therefore limited to very few personnel
in Sierra Leone37 .

37
  In 2009: The Surveys and Lands Division had twenty-one (21) active Sub –Professional Government surveyors and
only three (3) professional surveyors (Farmer, 2009) and twelve (12) Licensed Surveyors (Lusanie, 2009) in private
practice in the entire country.

85 | P a g e
The non-functioning state of the former Surveying Training School 38 has further exacerbated the
problem the lack of trained and qualified surveyors in the country, thereby necessitating a situation
that allows inadequately trained surveyors to assume responsibilities for surveying practices and
field data collection, with risk of errors.

Lack of reliable trigonometric reference points known as Ground Control Points (GCPs) over the
past decades have resulted to the generation of incorrect land property coordinates and hence
incorrect survey plans in Western Area and the provinces. This has thus seen an increase in the
number of land-related conflicts and litigation among residents in Freetown and the provinces.

A gap therefore exists between current surveying practices in Sierra Leone and modern electronic
mapping and surveying algorithm. The professional survey practice in Sierra Leone has
dramatically deteriorated over the years due to the out-dated Survey ordinance, obsolete surveying
methodology currently practiced, out-dated equipment. Property survey in Sierra Leone is
determined by compass bearings and tape measurement, which have high potentials for erroneous
results if not done with precision. Caught in the middle of all of these is that the Survey Ordinance
actually requires “Theodolite and Steel Band Survey” in all property measurements. These two
dimensions are actually old, out-dated and very impractical taking into consideration the modern
trend in surveying practices.

Recommendations

    An effective land information system requires an expedient land administration and
     management by replacing the existing manual recording system with digital / computerized
     systems. The current situation therefore establishes the need for a complete overhaul of the
     land administration / management information system.
    Revival of the Sierra Leone National Survey Training School increase the number of qualified
     surveyors and certify their level of competence and ensure standards in their professional
     practice through the introduction and use of modern surveying and mapping techniques39
    Review and modernisation of the survey ordinance
    Develop and deploy a GIS based National Land Information System Database at MLCP. The
     NLISD at MLCPE should be deployed to other MDAs and its regional offices through a WAN.
     This technology will allow the cadastre databases at the regions to be updated concurrently
     and reflected into the central cadastre database created at MLCPE headquarters.
    MLCPE and OARG to develop and publish their service delivery charter. The service charters
     should indicate the cost for all service and time frame of each service at any level.
    In terms of refreshing synergies between the different Divisions of MLCPE, and between
     MLCPE and other relevant MDAs, it is recommended that regular workshops be organized at
     the MLCPE to create opportunities for staffs to meet regularly and exchange ideas, discuss
     difficulties they encounter in executing their respective functions, highlight areas of overlap of
     38
       The Surveying Training School was established in 1925 used to have an international recognition and reputation
     for high standards of training in Land Surveying, Mathematics, field practice, Land Law and Management,
     Draughtsmanship and Map Revision, when it was fully functional, and was actually approved for the professional
     examination of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The school was closed in 1999.

     duties, and decipher the draft National Land Policy (2015) for their full understanding and
     compliance to its provisions. Similar workshops should be organized for the MLCPE and the
     other MDAs.
    MLCPE should undertake project to upgrade its cadastre maps and automate its operations to
     reflect the current realities. OARG should undertake similar project to update its information
     base.
    Resources must be allocated for the continuous updating of the registry/cadastre information.
    Upgrading the human resource capacity through in house and external training programs is a
     priority.

In terms of revenue collection, the Ministry has excelled over the years in the area of revenue
collection. The Ministry collected the sum of Le 17,111,001,987 (Seventeen billion, one hundred
and eleven million, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty seven Leones) or approximately
US$3.4 million, as revenue between 2011and 2014. In spite of this, the MLCPE is poorly
resourced, as these monies are paid into the Consolidated Fund, from which Government then
allocates to all MDAs.

Total fees collected by the registry are less than 50% of the total registry operating cost. Due to
the high level of taxes, property owners in most case do not declare the true value of the properties.
This coupled with the fact that significant percentage of the cost of land transaction ( over 80%)
is paid to the private surveyors for land parcel survey and lawyers for property registration makes
the revenues from registration fees and stamp duties insignificant for the government.

The registry and the cadaster are therefore not financially sustainable through fee collection to
finance its operations.

The revenue generated by MLCPE is deposited into the consolidated fund every month. MLCPE
budgeted in 2014 a total of six billion, two hundred and sixty-six million, eight hundred and fifty-
seven thousand, nine hundred and five Leones for it operations and programmes nationwide. Only
two billion, four hundred and sixty-nine million Leones was however allocated to MLCPE in 2014
fiscal, leaving the MLCPE with funding gap to implement it programmes and activities. This
situation is similar to what obtains at the OARG. Budget figures could not be presented for the

87 | P a g e
registry as a result of difficulties in accessing budgetary data. Another problem often encountered
with this process is the late disbursement of financial allocations to the Ministry.

It can be concluded that investment in land administration is not sufficient to cope with demand
and provide high quality services. There is very insignificant investment in capital in the system.
In the case of OARG, there is some investment as their operations are being computerised. MLCPE
is underfunded with little or no investment in capacity surveying, mapping and capacity building
(Surveys and Land Training School). The Division lacks trained and qualified staff, especially the
senior cadre, survey equipment, and means of transport etc. There are no resources to update the
Cadastre maps at MLCPE even although these no longer provide accurate topographic
information. The National Surveys and Lands Training school responsible for training of surveyors
nationwide has been non-functional since 1999 to present resulting in untrained surveyors to carry
out survey practice.

Challenges facing MLPCE can be put into two broad categories 1) the public interest and need for
land, and the duties and responsibilities of the Ministry with regard to addressing these needs and
2) the capacity of the said Ministry to meet the public needs and interests, and to discharge its
responsibilities.

The prerequisite for strong, client centered and reliable land management system are legislation to
support modern best practices, an effective and efficient computer platform that facilitates online
business transaction and access and, up to date business practices that is client centered and
designed to make best use of system and platform. MLCPE has none of these features. Land related
legislations are outdated. Limited staff strength and competence undermine the ability of MLCPE
to carry out its responsibilities adequately. Training needs of MLCPE are huge and would take
several months to accomplish.

The small group of professional staffs currently in post have not been able to effectively handle
the work load, and as result, there has always been a huge back log of work in the various units at
the Division.

Recommendations
     The OARG should be transformed into an autonomous Agency. This will enable the
      OARG to utilize part of the resources generated to build its staff capacity and improve on
      service delivery.
     In order to deal with the diverse issues raised by the present complex institutional
      framework, it is recommended that MLCPE set up a National Land Commission. It is of
      the opinion that the National Land Commission will retain part of the revenue generated
      and reinvest it.
     Funds should be provided to MLCPE to revive the Surveys and Lands training school and
      update the outdated cadastre indexed map sheets.
     MLCPE should fill existing vacancy. Retention of competent and qualified staff is always
      a crucial issue in a working environment where conditions of employment are not very
      attractive as in the Government departments of Sierra Leone, with MLCPE being of no
      exception. It is therefore recommended that in filling the existing vacancies with qualified


88 | P a g e
      personnel, it should be considered to have them recruited preferably by the proposed Land
      Commission and under a relatively more attractive scheme of conditions of employment.
     Build staff capacity at MLCPE and OARG.

   6 5     3

A clear, rationale schedule of fees for different services is publicly accessible and receipts are
issued for all transactions. Nevertheless, the Ministry is using its old schedule of fees to collect all
formal fees through the NRA and receipted. The list of all payment is compiled by MLCPE Rent’s
Collection office to effect checks and balances with the NRA office attached to the Ministry in
respect of monies paid into the consolidated fund by NRA. These fees include all state land lease,
freehold and rents. In the case of OARG, all fees (formal) are collected as per Service Charter and
receipted.

Mechanisms to detect and deal with illegal staff behavior run across the board in all MDAs.
However, much has not been done to control illegal staff behavior. The MLCPE has, over the past
years, established an Internal Audit Unit to support the campaign against illegal staff behavior. It
is along similar lines that in 2014 the Sierra Leone Anti-Corruption Commission established
integrity committees across all MDAs. All these measures help to discourage informal payments.
However, these efforts have yielded very minimal dividend. Most of the culprits are hardly brought
to book due to political interventions. The low level of Government salaries has been cited in many
quarters as contributing factor to illegal staff behavior. However, a huge awareness campaign of
service users to know their rights and applicable procedures is vital

To reduce transaction cost and unnecessary burden on the general public, it mandatory on all
MDAs to publish Service Charters displaying the services and their corresponding costs. There are
a number of published service standards. However, effort by the registry to actively monitor its
performance against these standards is minimal. Some of the Published service stand in Sierra
Leone include: (i) the Civil Service Code; (ii) the General Service Order; and , (iii) Letter of
Appointment of Civil Servants. MLCPE in 2014 started working on developing a service delivery
charter, but which is yet to become operational. A draft Service Charter document has been
achieved, the Ministry is now working on finalizing the draft document through a consultative
meeting involving all relevant MDAs and the private sector. This process is anticipated to be
completed in 2015. The Service Charter will publicly display land management and administration
services and their corresponding cost.

To conclude, the land sector attracts a good number of players and all trying to earn a living in the
system. Such players, apart from lawyers and Licensed Surveyors, include Land Agents,

89 | P a g e
unqualified surveyors, MLCPE officers and host of other personalities. As a result, standards have
dropped, customer satisfaction remains a big challenge and illegal behaviors of staff and non-staff
are in the increase. Therefore, in the absence of standards, strict procedures and processes to
enhance efficient customer service, informality and illegal behavior of players in the land sector
will grow beyond control.

Recommendations
         It is mandatory on all MDAs to produce and publicly display service delivery charter. It is
          therefore recommended that service delivery charter for all MDAs should be published on
          the web for greater circulation.
         Relevant legislation is upgraded to provide for the publication of all service delivery fees
          in other media that are widely available.
         It is recommended that a complaint unit be set up and a help line established for the public
          to file in their complaint against corruption and other forms misconducts.
         An active campaign should be designed and launched against corruption in the land sector.
         It is recommended that an M & E unit be set up at OARG and MLCPE. The M&E unit will
          have the responsibility to gauge customer satisfaction, monitor day to day operations and
          provide support to the Sierra Leone Anti-Corruption Commission.
         Civil service code and the Sierra Leone General Order be upgraded and regularly monitored
          to ensure adherence to the enshrined provisions by staff.


5.7           Panel 7: Property/Land Valuation and Taxation


Before 2004 when the decentralization programme was established, property taxation40 was only
limited to the Freetown City Council and the four Town Councils of Bo, Makeni, Kenema and
Koidu New Sembehun, as per Cap 295 of the Townships Act. The decentralization programme
which was established in 2004 created 19 local councils through an Act of Parliament called the
Local Government Act of 2004 (LGA2004), and also transformed the Town Councils into City
Councils, taking the total of city councils to five. The remaining councils included thirteen district
councils and one municipal council (Bonthe Municipal Council).

One of the main objectives of decentralization is to empower local authorities to take responsibility
of their development. This required that local councils should generate local revenues so that they
can be able to provide local public goods and services. The LGA2004 identified broad range of
local revenues, including property tax, which should be collected by the local councils. The
revenue provisions of the Act covered all local councils – City, Municipal and District councils,
thus paving the way for all 19 local councils to collect property taxes. The district councils were
new to collecting property taxes and therefore lacked the necessary capacity and human resources
to do so, but have received support to carry out this mandate effectively (see assessment).

The LGA2004 provides the legal basis for the taxation and valuation of properties. Part VIII of the
Act covers valuation, collection, institutional set-up and penalties relating to property taxes. The

40
     Property tax was and is also referred to as city rate or town rate

90 | P a g e
LGA2004 repealed all other laws41 relating to the administration of local councils, including the
imposition and collection of property taxes.

According to the LGA2004, the tax base for property taxes is the Assessed Annual Value (AAV)
of buildings only. This excludes taxing of land. The two major land legislations, the Concessions
Act of 1931, Cap 121 and the Provinces Land Act of 1961, did not have any provision for the
taxation of land. As such, land with no structural improvement on it is not taxed in Sierra Leone.

However, there are taxes and fees and charges relating to the acquisition of land. The taxes and/or
fees and charges to be paid will depend on the type of acquisition. Section 57 through to Section
61 of the Income Tax Act of 2000, which deals with Gains and Losses on Disposal of Assets,
describe in details when taxes will be levied, and when ownership of an asset including a given
piece of land, changes hands. In addition to those taxes set out in the Income Tax Act, Conveyance
registration fees of 10% of the value of the land will have to be paid at the Registrar General’s
Office (see also the previous section on transactions).

The role of central government agencies, such as the Ministry responsible for local government
and the ministry responsible for finance, were limited to providing regulations and guidelines to
standardize property taxation and valuation across the country. Local councils are empowered to
determine the rate that they will apply to the AAV in order to arrive at the taxable amount.

The LGA2004 also makes provision of the institutional arrangement regarding property taxation
and valuation. The Act is clear that local councils (District, City and Municipal) are to collect
property taxes as one of their own revenue sources. The Act requires local councils to appoint
valuers who are to be responsible for the assessment and valuation of buildings for the purpose of
taxation. Local councils are also to appoint Assessment Committees to oversee and approve the
valuation rolls prepared by the valuers. The Act does not define the minimum qualification of
valuers and there is no statutory or professional valuation body or institute that set standards and
regulate the activities of valuers. As such, most local councils had people working as valuers who
did not have any academic or professional training on valuation.

Unlike the repealed Freetown Municipal Act of 1973, which defined the AAV as the amount at
which a premise can reasonably be let out in the open market over a period of time usually a year,
the LGA2004 did not define the AAV. This led to local councils adopting different approaches to
arriving at the AAV. Some local councils used area (square meter) occupied by the building, while
others used number of bedrooms to arrive at the AAV. With the intervention of the development
partners (mainly World Bank and UNDP) and, technical support by the LGFD, the situation is now
being standardized across the country, with area occupied by a building being the acceptable
standard, as it is considered to be more equitable in arriving at the AAV than number of bedrooms
of a building. The same automated system is provided to all local councils and they are being
encouraged to use an area based system with adjustment factors.

41
  The LGA2004 repealed: Cap 63 Parts III and IV of the Local Tax Act; Cap 75 The Rural Areas Act; Cap 76 The
Sherbro Urban District Council Act; Cap 79 The District Councils Act; Cap 80 The Bo Town Council Act; Cap 295
The Townships Act; City Council of Freetown (Validation and Confirmation of Acts) Act, 1960; Local Authorities
(Audit) Act, 1964; Local Authorities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965; Local Authorities (Warrants for Rates)
Act, 1966; Freetown Municipality Act, 1973.


91 | P a g e
The issue of enforcement and penalties are also provided for in the law to enable local councils to
be able to impose and collect property taxes. Sections 78 through to 80 of the LGA2004 provide
the legal basis to ensure that local councils are able to collect taxes from all assessed property. The
provisions include seeking legal redress in the court of law for the sale of a property, where the
owner fails to pay the property tax levied.

The district councils are new to collecting property taxes (since 2004 only) and therefore lacked
the necessary capacity and human resources to do so. District councils were not able to collect
revenues from property taxes in 2004 and 2005, as they did not have any data base on properties
within their jurisdictions and did not have officers to assess properties and do the collection.

The government and its development partners were therefore concerned about the sustainability of
the decentralization, if the local councils cannot generate adequate own revenues, and they
therefore decided to support the local councils in revenue capacity building, with particular
attention to key revenue sources including property taxes. They therefore hired a consultant 42 to
do an assessment of the revenue potential and capacity of local councils, which revealed that the
local councils have potential to generate own revenues, but that they lack capacity to do so. One
of the critical issues identified was the lack of a database on own revenue sources, including
property tax. As a first step creating an efficient property tax system, the government and
development partners, mainly the World Bank and UNDP, supported selected local councils to
develop their property cadastre as a pilot phase from 2006 to 200843. The support included data
collection on properties, developing automated systems44 and building capacity of valuation
officers. The support led to an increase in the number of properties in the valuation rolls in the
local councils as new properties were discovered and revenue generated from property taxes
increased substantially across some of the supported local councils. For instance in Kenema City
Council, revenue from property taxes increased by 90% in 2010 over the 2009 level. However,
due to the weak capacity in the local councils and the resistance to change, not all the local councils
are fully utilizing the automated systems installed and they have not been able to update their
valuation rolls.

The city councils were able to collect some revenues from property taxes using their outdated
valuation rolls, which before the intervention of the central government and development partners
had not been updated for over a decade. The city councils that were already used to collecting
property taxes have some staff and infrastructure to collect taxes, but were also plagued with
numerous problems, such as low morale of staff to collect taxes and enforce the laws. Freetown

 The Government of Sierra Leone, under the World Bank Funded Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project, contracted Gordon
Muswygie (a former CEO of Kampala City Council, Uganda) to assist.
43
  The World Bank funded the exercise in Freetown, Bo and Koidu New Sembehun City councils; while UNDP funded
Kenema City and Kenema District councils. Makeni City council was initially funded by ENCISSS and later the
World Bank as part of an initiative by the Local Government Finance Department (LGFD) to standardize the property
tax system across the country. The outcome of the pilot in the selected local councils highlighted above, encouraged
the UNDP to support similar exercise in Tonkolili and Moyamba district councils; IFAD supported the initiative in
Koinadugu and Kailahun District Councils; the EU supported the Bo district council; and the World Bank supported
the same initiative in Port Loko district council.
44
  The automated system is property cadastre software that hosts the records of all properties, generate property tax for each property based on set
parameters, and print out demand notices.

92 | P a g e
City Council did receive support to upgrade but failed to use the collected data and did not fully
embrace the automated system, as valuation officers saw the transparent nature of the system as a
threat to their subjective powers to impose taxes arbitrarily based on their personal interests.
Without the automated system, valuation officers determine the Assessed Annual Values of
properties and also impose tax on them. This function is separated in the automated system with
various levels of administrative rights.

The district councils have additional problems and had to contest with chiefdom authorities, as to
whether they can impose property tax in rural areas and if they could do so, who should collect the
taxes. This eventually led to a negotiated settlement where district councils are sharing the
revenues collected from property taxes with chiefdom authorities.

There is no clear process of property valuation. The LGA 2004 stated that property tax shall be
levied on the Assessed Annual Value (AAV) of all buildings in a locality, but falls short of defining
what the AAV is or how to determine it. This has created a situation where the AAV is open to
several interpretations and the various local councils who are in charge of property tax, until
recently45, used different methodologies to arrive at the AAV. Equally, the State Lands act
indicates that market value should be paid in case of compulsory acquisition, but the methodology
is not defined.

In Sierra Leone, ‘property’, as defined in Section 69(1) and Section 70 of the LGA2004, refers to
buildings, whether complete or incomplete, and inhabited or uninhabited. This definition of
property in the Act does not include land. Thus property valuation does not take into account the
value of the land, but rather only the improvements thereon. The Act stated that property tax shall
be levied on the Assessed Annual Value (AAV) of all buildings in a locality, but falls short of
defining what the AAV is or how to determine it. This has created a situation where the AAV is
open to several interpretations and the various local councils who are in charge of property tax,
until recently46, used different methodologies to arrive at the AAV. Also important to note is that
fact that there is no clear mention or reference to market values in the current Act (LGA2004).
Therefore the AAV is the base on which the rate is imposed.

45
   The Local Government Finance Department (LGFD) in the Ministry of Finance and economic Development, which is responsible to build
capacity of local councils and monitor their performance in own revenue mobilization, has, with support from the world Bank and UNDP, supported
the local councils to use similar methodology in arriving at the AAV, albeit minor differences in adjustment factors.

the local councils to use similar methodology in arriving at the AAV, albeit minor differences in adjustment factors.

93 | P a g e
The current practice of most local councils, particularly the five city councils, is to first categorize
buildings based on their use/purpose and then determine the AAV of each category. A uniform
rate is then applied for each category. The major classifications of buildings are: Commercial,
Residential/Dwelling, and Mixed (that is buildings that are used for both commercial and dwelling
purposes). However, the Commercial category does not include certain types of buildings, such as
Hotels, Banks, Office Buildings, etc. Initially a flat rate which varies from one local council to
another was applied to these type of buildings, but as the system has evolved, the same process of
valuation for other buildings is followed but a much higher factor is applied in calculating the
AAV.

Once the buildings have been categorized, the process of determining the AAV starts with
determining the area occupied by each building. This involves physically measuring each house
to determine the square meter occupied by the structure(s) on the land. The area (square meter) is
then multiplied by a factor, depending on the category of the building, to arrive at the Initial
Ratable Value (IRV). The IRV is then adjusted to take into consideration certain features of the
building. Adjustment Factors, such as location, type of roof, wall type-concrete/mud/board,
electricity connectivity/availability in the locality, availability of pipe borne water, etc., are then
applied to the IRV to arrive at the AAV. The adjustment factors to be applied vary across local
councils. For example, some local councils take into account whether the house is connected to
the electricity; others do not consider it as an adjustment factor. A uniform rate for each category
of building is then applied to the AAV for each building to get the tax amount to be paid by
owners/occupiers. The system of valuation have been automated for some of the councils using
software developed by private sector firms, with support from the World Bank and UNDP47, and
technical backstopping by the Local Government Finance Department (LGFD) in the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Development. The software system, which was first developed in 2008,
has undergone several updating as the process evolves.

It is clear that failure by the LGA2004 to define what AAV has left it to open interpretations by
local councils, leading to the current process or definition they have adopted. Sections 71 and 72
(1) of the LGA2004 require that each local council should appoint Valuers who will carry out the
process; and they are to be supervised by an Assessment Committee to be set up by the local
council. The valuation units of local councils, with the exception of the city councils, are staff with
only one Valuer and two support staff.

Although the Valuers are graduates/Higher National Diploma holders as per the requirements of
the Local Government Service Commission, most of them (over 80%) are not qualified and trained
Valuers, and they find it difficult to use the automated system efficiently and effectively. As a
result, the system is not functional or fully utilized in some local councils, and Valuers have
resorted to their old ways of subjective valuation, were they do not apply laid down rules and
procedures48. The Assessment Committee is not fully functional in all the local councils. They do
not provide the required oversight of vetting the Valuation Rolls prepared by the Valuers. The

and Bo City Council. UNDP supported Kenema City Council and Makeni City Council.

points allocated to Adjustment Factors in arriving at the AAV are subjective and left to the
discretion of the Valuers, instead of being decided in a participatory process involving the
Assessment Committee. The system is, therefore, heavily prone to abuse by Valuers in particular,
who can arbitrarily decide which adjustment factors to consider for a particular building in
calculating the AAV. It is not unusual, therefore, for property owners to offer bribes for
undervaluation of their property.

The flat rate applied to certain buildings (Banks, Hotels, etc.) makes the valuation process
inequitable. Under such circumstances, it is possible that in the same locality, a small Bank
building might end up paying higher property tax than a residential building, even though the
residential building would have a higher market value if markets rates were applied. This would
be inequitable because property tax, in theory, and to a large extent, should be taxed on the value
of the property and not the purpose for which it is used. The purpose for which it is used can attract
a separate set of taxes or fees and charges.

The tediousness of measuring each and every building has prevented frequent assessment and
reviewing of the valuation roll. As such, the AAVs of buildings on the roll are not updated and
new buildings, which have not been measured, are not assessed and therefore have no AAV to
levy tax rate on. In this instance, the property owner, who wants to be on the side of the law, is left
with no other option, but to go to the council and insist that his property be valued so he can pay
his taxes. There have been instances where property owners would make several trips to councils
for them to send a Valuer, with the proviso that some money is paid upfront as ‘transportation’ for
the Valuer. Such lack of professionalism does not only affect new property owners. There are cases
where property that had been taxed in one year could go for two three years without getting notices.
Property owners are forced to go through this exercise not necessarily from altruism, but because
when such taxes accumulate over decades, they could just find themselves unable to pay; and
subsequently lose their property.

The process of valuation as outlined above is not known to the general public in most local
councils. Particularly in councils were they do not use automated systems to print out demand
notices. The public receives demand notices that only show the total value of property tax they
should pay with no explanation of how it was arrived at or the breakdown of the elements that go
into it. In Local Councils where they use automated systems49, the demand notices give breakdown
of the adjustment factors and the points they attract.

The rudimentary state of the real estate market in Sierra Leone and the lack of expert Valuers have
also contributed to local councils not adopting a market-based approach to property valuation.
There are very few private real estate businesses that are engaged in buying and selling land and
buildings.

Valuation rolls exist but are not publicly accessible.

Section 72(2) of the LGA2004 states that:


49
  Local councils that use automated systems include; Bo, Makeni, and Kenema City Councils. None of the district councils have started using
automated systems.

95 | P a g e
        ‘Any person owning or in occupation of or interested in any assessable building shall be
        entitled to inspect the Valuation Lists or Rolls and to take copies of or extracts from them
        on payment of a fee to be determined by the local council’.

From the above clause it would appear that the local councils are not mandated to display the
valuation rolls in public places, but rather interested persons can access them on demand for a fee.
However, the Act in Section 74 also, makes mention of a rate book, that local councils should
make available for inspection during office hours. The valuation rolls and the rate book are slightly
different in terms of the structure and the information they provide.
What is however clear, is that public access to the Valuation Rolls/Rate Book is limited for two
reasons: (i) the bureaucratic process that is involved to access the roll and; (ii) the fees to be paid.

These are further compounded by the fact that for all the local councils, such information are
centralized at the head office of the local councils posing additional cost and challenges for
property owners who live far from the local council office. All of these pose a question – to what
extent are the valuation rolls publicly accessible?

It is not clear from the Act that local councils are mandated to make the valuation rolls publicly
accessible. Instead, the public should express their interest in seeing it and pay fees before they
can access it.

Recommendations
    Every Local council should set-up a Valuation Committee in line with the Act and should
     provide the committee with the necessary support to ensure that it is functional.

  7.2          4       Receipts from property taxes exceed the cost of
                       collection.

Exemptions from property taxes are justified and transparent is clear and laid out in the
LGA 2004. Properties that are exempted are: buildings use for public worship; public health
facilities; buildings used for charitable purposes; buildings used for public education; burial
grounds; and buildings owned by diplomatic missions. The exemption list is justified but not
exhaustive, as it leaves out other buildings that are similar in their use to those on the exemption
list. The law does not leave room for exemptions to be granted by either the local councils or the
central government for any other building except those stated in the Act.

There is no evidence that arbitrary exemptions are being granted by the local councils. Not
collecting tax from assessable properties, because of lack of capacity or willingness to collect
taxes, does not amount to exemption.
Property holders liable to pay property tax are listed on the tax roll but the Act is silent on the
frequency of general assessment of all properties by the local councils. However, the law is clear
that local councils should update their records annually as new buildings are constructed and
existing properties are altered each year. This is important as the rate is levied on the assessed
annual value. The annual update should however not replace the general assessment that will cover
all properties.

General assessment has not been done for all of the local councils since 2008/2009 when the World
Bank and UNDP funded general assessment and the establishment of an automated property
cadaster system in the selected local councils mentioned above. Since those exercises, no council
has undertaken general assessment or even partial assessment to update their valuation rolls with
new buildings. Of course, field workers on their routine field work will capture information on
new buildings, but no concerted effort has been made by any council to undertake an assessment,
whether full or partial.

The rapid population growth rate in cities, particularly Bo, Kenema, Makeni and Freetown has led
to massive expansion of these cities with new buildings being constructed at a pace too fast for the
valuation department of these local councils to update their rolls. In the Freetown City Council
(FCC) and the Western Area Rural District Council (WARDC) in particular, there are communities
for which these councils have no records for the buildings erected. The LGFD, which is responsible
to monitor the own revenue performance of local councils believe that FCC and WARDC do not
have more than 70% of properties within their respective jurisdictions in their valuation rolls.
Cities like Bo, Kenema and Makeni that are relatively smaller are estimated to have about 80% of
properties within their jurisdictions in their valuation rolls. For the Five cities and WARDC
combined the proportion of liable property tax holders that are on the valuation roll will not exceed
70%.

97 | P a g e
Assessed Property Taxes are not fully collected from assessed properties. The local councils are
finding it difficult to collect revenue, due to a combination of factors. Firstly, the valuation rolls
are outdated and have not been updated for several years, and secondly, local councils themselves
are not proactive enough in their assessment of properties. Some property owners run after the
councils for assessment of their properties, to avoid accumulating of unpaid taxes. In the end
though, the local councils will expect all back taxes to be paid, irrespective of whether it was their
fault not to assess and collect on an annual basis.

The local councils who are responsible to collect property taxes are finding it difficult to collect
revenue, due to a combination of factors. Firstly, the outdated valuation rolls which have not been
updated for several years, is a bottleneck to local councils in realizing their revenue potential from
property taxes. The other barrier is the weak capacity to collect revenue for property they have on
their rolls and have been assessed. The centralized payment system is not encouraging to tax
payers, who are living far away from the central offices of the local councils. Tax payers are
unwilling to go through the hassle of going to the local councils and deal with the bureaucratic
processes to pay property taxes that they may not, in the first place, agree with, as the system of
arriving at the taxes are not clear to them. The local councils should also explore the use of
electronic payment systems using mobile phone technologies. They can also consider linking the
payment of property tax with other utility bills payment.

Table 7 shows that collection of assessed taxes has been very low for both city and district councils.
The councils in the table below together account for over 80% of the total households in the
country, but they can together only collect 29% of the rated values of properties in their localities,
with 71% outstanding.

It is clear that collection of property taxes is very low across the country. Local councils lack the
capacity to effectively collect the taxes. Enforcement of the law is very weak. Local councils
sometimes threaten to take legal action against defaulters but it amounts to nothing. The LGA2004
empowers the local councils to ensure that taxes are collected from all rated properties, but the
local councils lack the political will to do so. Enforcement has been particularly weak for large
taxpayers who are politically connected51. As such, the group of property owners that would have
potentially given more revenue to local councils is not paying their taxes and therefore collection
has been greatly affected.

The ratio of the total cost of collection to the total amount collected is one of the indicators of
efficiency, as it shows whether an entity is collecting less or more than it is paying to do the
collection. Receipts from property taxes exceed the cost of collection. Property Valuation
Departments of local councils across the country seem to be overstaffed, as the systems are not
automated. However, because these are mostly junior staff, they fall in the lower grades category
of staff and their salaries are therefore small. The costs that are huge are the other administrative
costs: fuel, transportation, stationery, etc.

Data from Local Government Finance Department in the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development show that for 3 of the 5 city councils, the total amount of property taxes collected is
more than 5 times the cost of collection, while that for the two remain city councils is between 3
and 5 times the cost of collection, as shown in Table 8.

Recommendations
  Exemption to include agricultural buildings, such as rice milling and storage facilities
  The law must provide for the frequency of updating of valuation rolls
  Local councils must endeavor to do general assessment at most within 10 years of the
    previous general assessment
  Review should be done at least every two in view of the speed of housing developments.
  Local councils must update their maps as rapid growth and expansion have taken place in
    the recent past
  Local councils should coordinate with MLCPE to get permits to aid effective tracking of
    new buildings.
  Demand notices for payment of property taxes must be detailed to show the basis of the tax
    value
  Local councils should either consider decentralizing payment systems or explore electronic
    payment options using mobile phone technologies in order to make it easier for the public to
    pay property taxes
  Local councils should develop a proper collection strategy, motivate revenue collectors
    through an incentive scheme, and enforce the law to improve compliance,
  Close monitoring of collectors
  Local councils must improve collection through innovative ways, such as the use of mobile
    technology and thereby reduce on labour cost
  Decentralize the payment collection offices to various areas within the locality
  Increase public awareness.

5.8         Panel 8: Dispute Resolution

The Constitution of Sierra Leone Act No. 6 of 1991 establishes the judiciary. As the third arm of
government, the judiciary is responsible for the administration and dispensation of justice. Cases
are heard and tried more or less exclusively by the judiciary with few exceptional ones. Parts I to
VI deal entirely with the superior courts of judicature and spells out their composition and powers.
Each of the superior courts of judicature namely, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the
Supreme Court are identifiable by constitutional provision and operations are guided by rules of
court. Land matters, except for customary land, are usually decided at the formal court system
namely the High Court. See hierarchy of courts in Table 9.

Table 9: Hierarchy of Courts in Sierra Leone

  The Supreme Court (Presided by the Chief justice, this is the highest court of appeal in the
  land)
  The Court of Appeal ( This hear only appeals from the High Court)
  The High Court (This has unlimited jurisdiction in matters and hears appeals from lower
  courts namely the Magistrate Court. This has many divisions)
  The Magistrate Court/Group Local Appeal Court (The Group Local Appeal court has now
  been abandoned but it was the equivalent of the Magistrate court at the local level) The
  Magistrate now sits as Chairman with assessors in case there is a matter related to
  customs/traditions.
  Local Court (The lowest court in the land but has jurisdiction over land in the provinces)


Section 21 of the Courts Act 1965 states that the High Court does not have jurisdiction in regard
to any action or original proceeding to determine the title to land situate in the provinces other than
the tile to a leasehold interest. Also, it does not have jurisdiction over the existence or dissolution
marriage governed by customary law or claims found neither on such marriage nor about the
administration of the estate of deceased person where such administration is governed by
customary law.

The Local courts Act 1963 establishes local courts with limited jurisdiction to hear and determine
civil matters relating and affecting people of their locality including the determination of the estate
of the deceased, civil cases governed by customary law not related to conflict between tribal
authorities or Paramount Chiefs involving questions of land. It is important to note also that the
traditional leaders as custodians of the land are expected to understand the traditional matters
connected to any piece or parcel of land within their locality. This is only applicable in the
provinces. It is also important to highlight that lawyers do not represent clients in Local Courts.
This means that a litigant who does not understand the procedure during trial will be at the mercy
of the tribal authorities or chiefs. There are no set criteria but usually it is a court presided over by
a single chief. Local courts are found in every Chiefdom. The Local Courts has exclusive
jurisdiction in determining title to land in the provinces, marriage governed by customary law and
the administration of estates governed by customary law.

Local courts are not bound to make records of their rulings, which are based on tradition and
customary law. However, this does not exclude jurisdiction of High Court because High Court has
Conflict resolution mechanisms are accessible to the public.

In 2011 all formal and traditional/Local courts have been brought under the jurisdiction of the
Chief Justice. The Minister of Internal Affairs administered all these prior to these changes.

The District Officer (DO)/Customary Law Officer (DO) can be found in each district and he has
exercised tremendous authority especially in the settlement of disputes arising from land. He is the
main government representative in the district and can hear all concerns of the residents of the
particular district in which he operates for onward transmission to the relevant government

101 | P a g e
department. He is advised by the Customary Law officer who is a representative of the Attorney-
General and Minister of Justice, the foremost legal adviser of government. The DO hears
complaints sometimes called appeals from local courts and provides advice. Although he does not
sit as a court, his opinion is widely respected.

In the provinces, as indeed in the Western Area, dispute settlement sometimes takes an informal
route. Elderly members of the community who command popular respect would sometimes
intervene to settle a dispute in the locality between or among its members. ADR can take the form
within the community and even in land matters. Although such decisions are not binding they carry
the weight and authority of the elderly, which are not easily challenged or ignored. It is strong
mechanism for dispute resolution among particular tribes in Sierra Leone including Fullah, Limba,
Yalunka and Temne notably found in the north of the country. This process hardly follows a set
procedures and the diversity in culture and heritage among the different tribes makes ADR an
inconsistent mode of dispute resolution without binding authority, in other words, parties to ADR
other than arbitration can always bring a legal suit for the same complaint if they feel it is better
settled by a formal court system.

In accordance with the provisions of Chapter 98 of the Laws of Sierra Leone 1960, each of the 16
native tribes of Sierra Leone represented as living in the Western Area can appoint a Headman to
hear and determine complaints among its members which touches and concerns customs and
traditions of their respective members and nothing more. The exercise of any powers under this
law is absolutely limited and the Headmen, even though they are regarded as important leaders of
the tribes, do not have the same authority as chiefs in the provinces. Their jurisdiction is limited
and do not have powers to impose a penalty, although they can resolve traditional/customary
matters affecting natives living in Freetown. Their decisions are not binding. In other words, they
have no proper authority.

5.8.1 Assignment of responsibility: responsibility for conflict management at different levels is
clearly assigned, in line with actual practice, relevant bodies are competent in applicable legal
matters, and decisions can be appealed against.

There is clear assignment of responsibility in terms of limitation in hierarchical jurisdictional
powers for conflict resolution, in both the Western Area and the provinces. The Local Courts Act,

102 | P a g e
2011 now incorporates land disputes in its jurisdiction, but not to the expressed exclusion of
parallel avenues at the local level.
Conflict resolution mechanisms are accessible to the public. At every level of the judicial system,
institutions are open to all nationals and businesses. In the majority of communities, institutions
for addressing dispute resolution are available at the local level. Affordability at the formal/non-
traditional levels, however, hinders administration of justice, and particularly for appeals.

The High Court has unlimited jurisdiction to hear and determine matters of all kinds and appeals
within its jurisdiction and the amendment, execution or the enforcement of any judgment or order
made on any such appeal, and for the purposes of any other authority expressly or by necessary
implication given to the High Court by the Constitution or any other law, the High Court has all
the powers, authority and jurisdiction vested in the Court from which the appeal is brought.

At every level of the judicial system, institutions are open to all nationals and businesses and
accessible. Affordability at the formal/non-traditional levels hinders administration of justice.
Appeal procedures are usually costly and demand the deposition of funds into court to cover the
cost of appeal for the opposite party in the case where the appeal fails. In terms of first instance
conflict resolution, it is noted that informal institution are more accessible. That notwithstanding,
conflict resolution mechanisms are accessible to the public.

Decisions made by informal or community based dispute resolution systems are recognized,
because of the legal recognition of customary system. However, agreements reached amicably and
equitably, without recourse to the courts, are always the preferred option.

Alternative dispute resolution system is recognised by the laws of Sierra Leone. This Arbitration
Act set clear rules for dispute arbitration and procedure outside the formal court system. That law
gives the parties to the conflict the leverage to agree on what can be tried or decided in the case of
conflict and who can decide their differences and even under which law. Arbitral awards are
enforced in a similar way as courts orders once the necessary procedures are followed. Although
lawyers can represent their clients in arbitral panes, court rules and procedures do not apply.


There is a process for appealing dispute rulings, but the procedure is expensive. It requires the
deposition of funds into court to cover the cost of appeal for the opposite party, in the case where
the appeal fails. This cost, which will be deposited at the Master’s Office, is usually set at the
minimum of Le 5 million (Approximately US$1,000). Such appeals usually take a long time to
conclude.

A litigant that is unhappy with the outcome of a case from the Magistrates court can file an appeal
to the High Court. The appeal is filed with the Master and Registrar of the High Court; and the
other party is notified, within the time limit provided in the rules. The Master and Registrar will
set the time for hearing the appeal and put the file before a judge who listens to the legal arguments
on the grounds appealed on although sometimes a retrial may be entertained.

                   conflicts.
Increase in demand for land and the inefficacies of the land administrative system leads to increase
in disputes over land in the Western Area. The insecurity in the land tenure system and ownership
of land is largely due to weak and inefficient land administration by the responsible authorities.
About 75% of commercial litigation cases in the High Courts are related to land matters in the
Western Area, and about 50% of the adjudication cases facing the lower courts in the provinces
and chiefs entail land disputes. Some of the cases are unduly taking between two and six years to
resolve – in some cases even longer. As a result, the courts are having vast backlogs of outstanding
legal cases relating to land issues awaiting resolution
In the provinces, land disputes can be very expensive and protracted. This does not encourage a
rapid recourse to the formal courts.


.

There are few long-Standing land conflicts, which take more than 15 years to resolve, but on
average, the majority of land cases take between three and five years to be resolved before any
appeals proceedings in the High Court. Land matters usually have lots of competing interests,
which may require further enquiry even when the respective claims have been made. Because of
this reason and some other reasons settling them take a much longer period than others matters.


Recommendations
      Court of first instances judges should be grounded in land law;
      Magistrates must not exercise jurisdiction in land matters involving title or recovery of
        possession only ejectment proceedings;
      All case files to be numbered, dated and the information stored;

                 minimal and do not cause friction or dispute.
                 Ambiguity in institutional mandates (based on
   9 1     6
                 institutional map) does not cause problems.

The roles of policy formulation, implementation, and arbitration are separated. Land policy
formulation is the responsibility of the MLCPE. However, there are other MDAs involved in the
implementation of the policies. These bodies are identified in the policy document. These include
OARG, MAFFS, EPA, SLIEPA, MMMR, and MWHI, local government bodies under the
MLGRD, etc.

Arbitration is left in the hands of formal and informal courts systems.

It should be noted that there is no land policy as at the time of this Assessment; and most of the
laws were formulated in the 1960s and are in need of review. There are efforts to resolve this with
the new National Lands Policy, which is yet to get through Cabinet, before eventually getting to
Parliament. This Policy is part of a wider land reform process which is being carried out, looking
at existing laws and regulations concerning land in Sierra Leone.

The responsibilities of the ministries and agencies dealing with land in Sierra Leone do
regularly overlap at the horizontal level. As illustrated by the institutional mapping (Chapter 3).
Although the MLCPE is the main institution responsible for taking leadership on all land matters
in the country, its effectiveness is very questionable, at the moment, due to these overlaps.




105 | P a g e
      Development Control i.e. who has responsibility for authorizing development on any piece
       of land is a concern when ministries are renamed, for example, the Ministry of Works and
       Infrastructure was renamed Ministry of Works Housing and Infrastructure, basically
       removing ‘Housing’ from the then Ministry of Lands, Housing and Country Planning and
       the Environment. Before the change of names, development control was entirely with the
       latter Ministry, which issued planning permits and building permits. After the changes in
       the names, issuance of planning permits remained with the MLCPE, while the issuance of
       housing permit moved to the MWHI.

      Demolition Powers is another area of concern. Investigations during this assessment show
       that there are several MDAs claiming responsibility of demolition powers. Among these
       are: Local councils, MLCPE, MWHI, SLRA and even the National Assets and Government
       Property Commission. It is a common sight to have demolition signs on buildings from at
       least two of such MDAs, along a single street.

Vertical Administrative overlap between central and decentralized levels is avoided within
the MLCPE, and every division is aware of its responsibilities, so that there are no administrative
overlaps. What is common though is that within the Divisions, there are confusions about the roles
and responsibilities of individual staff. There are also challenges with the de-concentration and
devolution for key elements of land administration.

MLCPE has neither power nor instruments to check the registration of transfer of land ownership
and prevent double sales. The 2004 local government act is still not clear and the devolution
process is not effective in most of the areas because the devolved functions are not clear or not
supported by transfer of resources enabling the local government to implement. The 2004 act also
states that all surveying functions should be devolved to local council, but in practice this is not
feasible. Moreover, regional and international boundaries are beyond the jurisdiction of a local
council.

It can be concluded that there is ambiguity in institutional mandates given the numerous
MDAs that handle land related matters, which leads to problems relating to tenure in the provinces
in relation to leaseholds for large investments and in urban land management.

Information on land ownership and use is shared among responsible institutions and
relevant parts are freely accessible to the public. Although the MLCPE and various other
ministries hold information related to land it is sometimes difficult to gain access to this
information as data are paper based and not always shared or integrated. There has been initiative
to set up nation data infrastructure systems. Another issue is that data used in policy planning can
be outdated such as on land use status.

Information on land ownership and use is shared not always freely accessible to the public
Although the MLCPE and various other ministries have access to information related to land rights
and use, it is sometimes difficult for the general public to gain access to this information. The
barriers presented in some of these ministries can hinder progress trying to be made in relation to
land issues. Some institutions, in fact, expect some sort of payment for allowing people access to


106 | P a g e
information that should be free. However, a resilient individual or corporation would buy all the
Acts from the Government Bookshop to have access to such information.

The main feature of the tenure typology in Sierra Leone is the duality between the western
areas and the provinces. On the whole, the overlaps are minimal and do not cause friction or
dispute. The risk of overlap in duality is most obvious in dispute resolution, also recognised in
S.76 of the Courts Act 1965, which do allows English-type courts to apply customary law: “when
determining matters arising in the Provinces” in civil jurisdiction only, provided such customary
law is not “repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience”.

                 There is regular and public reporting indicating
  9    2    5
                 progress in policy implementation.
                 Land policies help to improve land use by low-
  9    2    6    income groups and those who experienced
                 injustice.
                 Land policies proactively and effectively reduce
  9    2    7
                 future disaster risk.

Although there are claims that during the formulation of the new National Land Policy (NLP)
visits were to all 149 chiefdoms, in the provinces, the Assessment discovered that land owners, as
stakeholders were left out. It was also discovered that most stakeholders were not involved in the
several validation workshops held for the NLP.

Land legislation development is slow in the case of approved policies (forestry and wildlife) and
for land awaiting the new NLP. Regulations are not developed in a participatory manner.



107 | P a g e
The new Land policies will address equity and poverty reduction goals and include guidance
for public monitoring of progress, by taking into means of ensuring that low income groups are
aided to improve land use.

It is expected that the implementation of land policy is costed, matched with benefits and
adequately resourced. Currently the new draft Land policy and its implementation has been
costed by the MLCPE
It is the Environmental Protection Agency's responsibility to ensure compliance with ecological
and environmental goals in Sierra Leone as formulated in the Environmental Protection Agency
Act of 2008. Any land leased or sold for use other than residential is subject to an EIA. However,
this is not always monitored consistently and even when the EIA Certificate is issued corrupt
practices usually lead to its non-applicability.

There is no regular and public reporting indicating progress in policy implementation, which could
be the main reason why implementation has been slow. Reporting allows for accountability and
for raising the alarm of what is going wrong. It also provides recommendations to ensure smooth
implementation.

Land policies need to proactively and effectively reduce future disaster risk, but this is not
the case. Every year, there are fatal accidents involving the loss of several lives simply because of
having settlements in high risk areas such as water ways, or under rocks that are precariously
hanging due to erosion caused by the removal of forest cover.

Recommendations

Ensure that the aspects that provide for proper coordination between MLCPE and other MDAs in
the new National Land Policy (2015) are effectively monitored.

With the current fragmentation of environmental and natural resource management in Sierra
Leone, there is a unique opportunity for joint management by communities. More specifically,
since communities are jointly reliant on resources such as water and forests, they provide an
opportunity for communities to come together and cooperate on issues of planning, allocation and
development. Joint management also provides opportunities to inform government and others
about regional or area-specific situations. These, coupled with a clear mandate of responsibilities
and penalties for not adhering to the defined roles, would reduce vertical administrative overlaps.

     PANEL 1: Land Rights Recognition
     LGI 1: Recognition of a continuum of rights
                 Individuals' rural land tenure rights are legally recognized and
     1 1 1
                 protected in practice.
     1 1 2 Customary tenure rights are legally recognized and protected
                 in practice.
                 Indigenous rights to land and forest are legally recognized and
     1 1 3
                 protected in practice.
     1 1 4 Urban land tenure rights are legally recognized and protected
                 in practice.
     LGI 2: Respect for and enforcement of rights
     1 2 1 Accessible opportunities for tenure individualization exist.
     1 2 2 Individual land in rural areas is recorded and mapped.
     1 2 3 Individual land in urban areas is recorded and mapped.
     1 2 4 The number of illegal land sales is low.
     1 2 5 The number of illegal lease transactions is low.
                 Women's property rights in lands as accrued by relevant laws
     1 2 6
                 are recorded.
     PANEL 2: Rights to Forest and Common Lands & Rural Land Use Regulations
     LGI 1: Rights to Forest and Common Lands
                 Forests are clearly identified in law and responsibility for use                 x
     2 1 1
                 is clearly assigned.
        1        Common lands are clearly identified in law and responsibility                    x
     2       2
                 for use is clearly assigned
        1        Rural group rights are formally recognized and can be
     2       3
                 enforced.

                Users' rights to key natural resources on land (incl. fisheries)
   2   1    4
                are legally recognized and protected in practice.
                Multiple rights over common land and natural resources on
   2 1 5
                these lands can legally coexist.
                Multiple rights over the same plot of land and its resources
   2 1 6
                (e.g. trees) can legally coexist.
                Multiple rights over land and mining/other sub-soil resources
   2 1 7
                located on the same plot can legally coexist.
                Accessible opportunities exist for mapping and recording of
   2 1 8
                group rights.
   2 1 9 Boundary demarcation of communal land.
   LGI 2: Effectiveness and equity of rural land use regulations
                Restrictions regarding rural land use are justified and
   2 2 1
                enforced.
                Restrictions on rural land transferability effectively serve
   2 2 2
                public policy objectives.
                Rural land use plans are elaborated/changed via public process
   2 2 3
                and resulting burdens are shared.
                Rural lands, the use of which is changed, are swiftly
   2 2 4
                transferred to the destined use.
                Rezoning of rural land use follows a public process that
   2 2 5
                safeguards existing rights.
                For protected rural land use (forest, pastures, wetlands,
   2 2 6
                national parks, etc.) plans correspond to actual use.
   PANEL 3: Urban Land Use, Planning, and Development
   LGI 1: Restrictions on Rights
                Restrictions on urban land ownership/transfer effectively serve
   3 1 1
                public policy objectives.
                Restrictions on urban land use (disaster risk) effectively serve
   3 1 2
                public policy objectives.
   LGI 2: Transparency of Land Use Restrictions changes in land use and management regulations are made in
   a transparent fashion and provide significant benefits for society in general rather than just for specific groups.
                Process of urban expansion/infrastructure development
   3 2 1
                process is transparent and respects existing rights.
                Changes in urban land use plans are based on a clear public
   3 2 2
                process and input by all stakeholders.
                Approved requests for change in urban land use are swiftly
   3 2 3
                followed by development on these parcels of land.
   LGI 3: Efficiency in the Urban Land Use Planning Process: Land use plans are current, implemented, do not
   drive people into informality, and cope with urban growth
                Policy to ensure delivery of low-cost housing and services
   3 3 1
                exists and is progressively implemented.
                Land use planning effectively guides urban spatial expansion
   3 3 2
                in the largest city.
                Land use planning effectively guides urban development in
   3 3 3
                the four next largest cities.
   3 3 4 Planning processes are able to cope with urban growth.
   LGI 4: Speed and Predictability of Enforcement of Restricted Land Uses
                Provisions for residential building permits are appropriate,
   3   4    1
                affordable and complied with.
                A building permit for a residential dwelling can be obtained
   3   4    2
                quickly and at a low cost.


119 | P a g e
   LGI 5: Tenure regularization schemes in urban areas
                Formalization of urban residential housing is feasible and
   3   5    1
                affordable.
                In cities with informal tenure, a viable strategy exists for
   3   5    2   tenure security, infrastructure, and housing.

             A condominium regime allows effective management and
   3   5    3
             recording of urban property.
   PANEL 4: Public Land Management
   LGI 1: Identification of Public Land and Clear Management
                Criteria for public land ownership are clearly defined and
   4   1    1   assigned to the right level of government.

   4   1    2   There is a complete recording of public land.

   4   1    3   Information on public land is publicly accessible.
                The management responsibility for different types of public
   4   1    4
                land is unambiguously assigned.
                Responsible public institutions have sufficient resources for
   4   1    5   their land management responsibilities.

                All essential information on public land allocations to private
   4   1    6
                interests is publicly accessible.
   LGI 2: Justification and Time-Efficiency of Acquisition Processes

   4   2    1   There is minimal transfer of acquired land to private interests.
               Acquired land is transferred to destined use in a timely
   4   2    2
               manner.
               The threat of land acquisition does not lead to pre-emptive
   4 2 3
               action by private parties.
   LGI 3: Transparency and Fairness of Acquisition Procedures
                Compensation is provided for the acquisition of all rights
   4   3    1
                regardless of their recording status.
                Land use change resulting in selective loss of rights there is
   4   3    2
                compensated for.
   4   3    3   Acquired owners are compensated promptly.
             There are independent and accessible avenues for appeal
   4   3    4
             against acquisition.
             Timely decisions are made regarding complaints about
   4 3 5
             acquisition.
   PANEL 5: Transfer of Large Tracts of Land to Investors
   LGI 1: Transfer of Public Land to Private Use Follows a Clear, Competitive Process and Payments are
   Collected
              Public land transactions are conducted in an open transparent
   5 1 1
              manner.
   5 1 2 Payments for public leases are collected.
                Public land is transacted at market prices unless guided by
   5   1    3
                equity objectives.
                The public captures benefits arising from changes in permitted
   5   1    4
                land use.

120 | P a g e
                Policy to improve equity in asset access and use by the poor
   5   1   5    exists, is implemented effectively and monitored.

   LGI 2: Private Investment Strategy
                Land to be made available to investors is identified
   5   2   1    transparently and publicly, in agreement with right holders.

                Investments are selected based on economic, socio-cultural
   5   2   2    and environmental impacts in an open process.

                Public institutions transferring land to investors are clearly
   5   2   3
                identified and regularly audited.
                Public bodies transferring land to investors share information
   5   2   4    and coordinate to minimize and resolve overlaps (incl. sub-
                soil).
                Compliance with contractual obligations is regularly
   5   2   5    monitored and remedial action taken if needed.

                Safeguards effectively reduce the risk of negative effects from
   5   2   6    large scale land-related investments.

                The scope for resettlement is clearly circumscribed and
   5   2   7    procedures exist to deal with it in line with best practice.

   LGI 3: Policy Implementation is Effective, Consistent and Transparent
                Investors provide sufficient information to allow rigorous
   5   3   1    evaluation of proposed investments.

                Approval of investment plans follows a clear process with
   5   3   2
                reasonable timelines.
                Right holders and investors negotiate freely and directly with
   5   3   3    full access to relevant information.

               Contractual provisions regarding benefit sharing are publicly
   5   3   4
               disclosed.
   LGI 4: Contracts Involving Public Land are Public and Accessible
               Information on spatial extent and duration of approved
   5 4 1
               concessions is publicly available.
               Compliance with safeguards on concessions is monitored and
   5 4 2
               enforced effectively and consistently.
               Avenues to deal with non-compliance exist and obtain timely
   5 4 3
               and fair decisions.
   PANEL 6: Public Provision of Land Information: Registry and Cadastre
   LGI 1: Mechanisms for Recognition of Rights
               Land possession by the poor can be formalized in line with
   6 1 1
               local norms in an efficient and transparent process.
               Non-documentary evidence is effectively used to help
   6 1 2
               establish rights.
   6 1 3 Long-term unchallenged possession is formally recognized.
               First-time recording of rights on demand includes proper
   6 1 4
               safeguards and access is not restricted by high fees.
   6 1 5 First-time registration does not entail significant informal fees.


121 | P a g e
   LGI 2: Completeness of the Land Registry
   6 2 1 Total cost of recording a property transfer is low.
               Information held in records is linked to maps that reflect
   6 2 2
               current reality.
   6 2 3 All relevant private encumbrances are recorded.
   6 2 4 All relevant public restrictions or charges are recorded.
               There is a timely response to requests for accessing registry
   6 2 5
               records.
   6 2 6 The registry is searchable.
   6 2 7 Land information records are easily accessed.

               Information in public registries is synchronized to ensure
   6 3 1
               integrity of rights and reduce transaction cost.
               Registry information is up-to-date and reflects reality on the
   6 3 2
               ground
   LGI 4: Cost-effectiveness and Sustainability of Land Administration Services
               The registry is financially sustainable through fee collection to
   6 4 1
               finance its operations.
               Investment in land administration is sufficient to cope with
   6 4 2
               demand for high quality services.
   LGI 5: Fees are Determined Transparently
               Fees have a clear rationale, their schedule is public, and all
   6 5 1
               payments are accounted for.
   6 5 2 Informal payments are discouraged.
   6 5 3 Service standards are published and regularly monitored.

   7 1 2 Valuation rolls are publicly accessible.
   LGI 2: Collection Efficiency

   7 2 2

   8 1 1
               resolution.
   8 1 2 Conflict resolution mechanisms are accessible to the public.
               Mutually accepted agreements reached through informal
   8 1 3
               dispute resolution systems are encouraged.
               There is an accessible, affordable and timely process for
   8 1 4
               appealing disputed rulings.
   LGI 2: The Share of Land Affected by Pending Conflicts is Low and Decreasing
               Land disputes constitute a small proportion of cases in the
   8 2 1
               formal legal system.

   PANEL 9: Institutional Arrangements and Policies
   LGI 1: Clarity of Mandates and Practice


122 | P a g e
               Land policy formulation, implementation and arbitration are
   9   1   1
               separated to avoid conflict of interest.
               Responsibilities of the ministries and agencies dealing with
   9 1 2
               land do not overlap (horizontal overlap).
   9 1 3 Administrative (vertical) overlap is avoided.
               Land right and use information is shared by public bodies; key
   9 1 4
               parts are regularly reported on and publicly accessible.
               Overlaps of rights (based on tenure typology) are minimal and
   9 1 5
               do not cause friction or dispute.
               Ambiguity in institutional mandates (based on institutional
   9 1 6
               map) does not cause problems.
   LGI 2: Equity and Non-discrimination in the Decision-making Process
               Land policies and regulations are developed in a participatory
   9 2 1
               manner involving all relevant stakeholders.
               Land policies address equity and poverty reduction goals;
   9 2 2
               progress towards these is publicly monitored.
               Land policies address ecological and environmental goals;
   9 2 3
               progress towards these is publicly monitored.
               The implementation of land policy is costed, matched with
   9 2 4
               benefits and adequately resourced.
               There is regular and public reporting indicating progress in
   9 2 5
               policy implementation.
               Land policies help to improve land use by low-income groups
   9 2 6
               and those who experienced injustice.
               Land policies proactively and effectively reduce future disaster
   9 2 7
               risk.
