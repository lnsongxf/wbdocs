OVERVIEW
As Uganda has sought growth in investment in the forestry sector through public-private partnerships, changes in land use in
some instances have caused frictions to flare between stakeholders. In 2011, the government of Uganda claimed responsibility
for the eviction of community members from Central Forest Reserves in Uganda, stating that the land had been demarcated
for commercial forestry plantations and had been illegally occupied. The company operating the plantations, the New Forests
Company, is an investee of the Agri-Vie Agribusiness Fund, a private equity fund supported by the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group.
In December 2011, two affected communities lodged complaints
                                                                            “Life is changing and I am humbled
to IFC’s independent recourse mechanism, the Compliance Advisor
                                                                            by the tireless efforts of CAO, Oxfam,
Ombudsman (CAO).
                                                                            and NFC.”
This case study tells the story of what happened next. CAO provided a       Mrs. Tumuhirwe Khedris, Member of the
neutral, impartial process for the company and affected communities         Mubende Bukakikama Co-operative Society

to jointly explore resolution of the issues—a process that moved
beyond judgment and finding fault to focus on practical, effective, and sustainable solutions for all involved. As part of the
process, the focus shifted from rights violations and reparations to a forward-looking focus on sustainable financial benefits
and collective development for the community. Today, the agreements reached between the parties have started a process
through which community livelihoods are being enhanced and restored, and more broadly, have helped build community
capacity, foster social cohesion, and promote economic independence.

    THE COMPLAINTS


    In December 2011, CAO received two complaints from                                                                        plantations in the Mubende, Kiboga, and Bugiri districts. One
    communities in the Kiboga and Mubende districts of central                                                                of the company’s investors is the Agri-Vie Agribusiness Fund,
    Uganda. The community members filed their complaints with                                                                 a private equity fund supported by IFC. The company claimed
    assistance from Oxfam, an international nongovernmental                                                                   that it had identified two communities living in the Central
    organization (NGO), and the Uganda Land Alliance, a national                                                              Forest Reserve where it was licensed to plant in 2007–08.

                                                                                                                              worked with the government of Uganda and the communities
    The complainants claimed that thousands of community                                                                      to resolve the issue as humanely as possible. According to
    members had been forcibly evicted from their land to make                                                                 the company, it requested permission many times from the
    way for commercial forestry plantations, thereby destroying                                                               Ugandan government to compensate the communities to
    private property, foreclosing livelihoods, and compromising                                                               move off the reserve, but the government prohibited such
    health and education opportunities. The complaints also                                                                   compensation.
    voiced broader concerns about IFC’s due diligence related
    to the project, including a lack of meaningful consultation                                                               CAO found the complaints eligible for assessment in January
    regarding the evictions.                                                                                                  2012. A CAO team travelled to Uganda soon after to meet
                                                                                                                              with members of the Kiboga and Mubende communities,

      BOX 2. PROVIDING CONFIDENTIALITY
      CAO does not impose a predetermined scope of
      confidentiality on the parties. The parties themselves decide
      on the principles of confidentiality that they believe to be
      appropriate throughout the process. For example, parties
      may request a space away from outside scrutiny while they
      negotiate. At other times, they may feel the need to make
      certain information publicly available to ensure awareness
      and greater external scrutiny. CAO facilitates these
      discussions between the parties in an attempt to reach

     ROLE OF OBSERVERS AND ADVISORS

     The New Forests Company and the affected communities
     agreed that Oxfam should participate in the mediation as
     an observer, offering ongoing support and advice to the
     affected communities. Oxfam played a role in building the
     communities’ capacity to engage in dispute resolution, as well
     as offering ongoing trauma counselling. A Ugandan lawyer
     was also employed by Oxfam to advise and support the
     community representatives throughout the mediation
     process.

FORMING COMMUNITY COOPERATIVES

While negotiations were ongoing between 2012 and 2014, it
became clear that individual compensation or redress would not
be achievable in this case. Both affected communities therefore
decided to establish cooperatives that could receive financial
and other development support on their behalf. This was a
critical step in ensuring a rational and comprehensive approach
for developing the communities’ capacity to benefit collectively
from the process and, in turn, for them to manage inputs for
collective projects.

     the way the company has offered additional support to the
     cooperatives—support that extends beyond the terms of the

     chickens for members to raise, and training on the production
     of biomass coal for their energy needs. The company has

“Oxfam welcomes that both the Mubende and Kiboga communities were able to reach
agreements with NFC through mediation. Oxfam supported the communities in the
mediation process upon their request as an advisor because we felt that it offered the
best opportunity for the communities to achieve redress. The complaints also raised
concerns about weaknesses in IFC’s pre-investment due diligence and the breach of IFC

those communities have with the New Forests Company.
The process addressed the real and pressing need to build

development and economic independence a reality. CAO has
appointed a Cooperative Development Coordinator to help the
cooperatives develop their capacity to engage collectively and
benefit from communal land ownership. The Coordinator has
been instrumental in identifying appropriate income-generating

The Mubende Cooperative faces immediate and pressing
challenges. There are no nearby schools for the children to
attend. The nearest water source is almost a three-mile walk
away. The nearest health services are several miles away.
Storage facilities are required for harvested crops to ensure
that they can be adequately preserved before being sold at
the local markets. Through the Joint Development Forum, the
community and the New Forests Company will work together
to meet the communities’ most pressing needs.

ongoing challenge for the elected officers. Directly linked to this

          BOX 4. MEASURING SUCCESS
          Is reaching agreement the only indicator of a “successful” mediation
          process? What does “success” mean in the context of dispute
          resolution? Who decides whether the mediation has been successful?
          These questions are not unique to the work of CAO and are a matter
          of ongoing debate among dispute resolution professionals. There
          are many nuanced outcomes that are hard to measure, such as
          relationship building and transformation, capacity building, and the
          costs avoided by preventing future conflicts. For all these reasons,
          it is important to monitor agreements until they are firmly in place
