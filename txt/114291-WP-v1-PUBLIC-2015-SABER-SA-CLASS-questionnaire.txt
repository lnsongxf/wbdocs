INTRODUCTION



Dear Colleague,

Thank you for joining us in our efforts to collect data on student assessment systems around the world. We are excited
to work with you. Your efforts are an important contribution to the SABER program, and a valuable input into the
SABER-Student Assessment domain in particular.

What is SABER?

The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) is an evidence-based program of the World Bank to help
countries systematically examine and strengthen the performance of their education systems. The World Bank
launched the SABER program to support the implementation of its Education Strategy 2020. The initiative is being led
by the Education Global Practice of The World Bank. Information on SABER can be found at
http://go.worldbank.org/NK2EK7MKV0.

What is SABER-Student Assessment?

SABER-Student Assessment is one of the domains of the SABER program. The purpose of SABER-Student Assessment
is to benchmark student assessment systems in developed and developing countries with the goal of promoting
stronger assessment systems that contribute to improved education quality and learning for all. The World Bank is
committed to supporting countries in their development of more effective student assessment systems; SABER-
Student Assessment is a key component of this support.
The SABER-Student Assessment domain uses standardized questionnaires to collect information about a country’s
assessment system in the following areas: Classroom Assessment, Examination, National-Large Scale Assessment, and
International Large-Scale Assessment. The data collected with these questionnaires are used to benchmark the
country’s assessment system, indicating the level of development (latent, emerging, established, or advanced) of each
assessment type.

What is Your Role in the SABER-Student Assessment Data Collection Efforts?

As the person responsible for collecting the data needed to complete the SABER-Student Assessment questionnaires
for a particular country, you have an important role. The information you collect will be used to benchmark the
country’s assessment system, produce a report that describes the strengths and weaknesses of this system, and
generate policy options for the country to consider. The information that you collect will also be made publicly
available on the SABER website.

We are here to support you in your data collection efforts. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions.

FOCUS OF THE SABER-STUDENT ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRES

Each SABER-Student Assessment questionnaire focuses on a different facet of the assessment system:

Classroom Assessment Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of system-level (for example, country) information on
classroom assessment policies and practices for both primary and secondary education and public and private schools.
The first section of the questionnaire focuses on enabling factors and quality assurance procedures that support classroom
assessment activities while the second section inquires about the uses of classroom assessment information.

Examination Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of system-level (for example, country) information on examination
programs for both primary and secondary education and public and private schools. For each program, the questionnaire
collects data on overall characteristics (section 1), as well as the specifics of the last few examination rounds (sections 2
and 3). (A separate questionnaire should be answered for each examination round for which data are being collected.)
The last section of the questionnaire applies only to systems that do not have an examination program in place; it collects
information that is relevant for developing such a program in the future.

National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA) Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of system-level (for example, country)
information on NLSA programs in primary and secondary education. For each NLSA, the questionnaire collects data on
overall characteristics (section 1) as well as the specifics of the last few rounds (sections 2-4). (A separate questionnaire
should be answered for each NLSA round for which data are being collected.) The last section of the questionnaire applies
only to systems that do not have an NLSA program in place; it collects information that is relevant for developing such a
program in the future.

International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA) Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of general information on a system’s
participation in one or more ILSAs during the last decade (section 1) as well as the specifics of the last few ILSA rounds
(sections 2 and 3). (A separate questionnaire should be answered for each ILSA round for which data are being collected.)
The last section of the questionnaire applies only to systems that have not participated in an ILSA in the last 10 years; it
collects information that is relevant for future participation in such assessments.




                                                                                                                           2
BEFORE STARTING DATA COLLECTION

Before you start completing this SABER-Student Assessment questionnaire, please:
 Identify the point person on the SABER-Student Assessment team with whom you will work to complete this
  questionnaire. You can get this information from the country Task Team Leader (TTL) with whom you have been
  communicating regarding the SABER-Student Assessment initiative.

 Confirm with the country TTL the level at which you will be completing this questionnaire. The questionnaire
  asks for information at the “system level. ” In most instances, this will mean the country or national level. However,
  it may, as required, also be used to refer to state, provincial, or other levels of the system. Please answer all
  questions with regard to the chosen level of the system, as confirmed by the country TTL.
 Familiarize yourself with the layout of this questionnaire. The questionnaire has two sections. Section 1 asks about
  enabling factors and quality assurance procedures supporting classroom assessment. Section 2 asks about the uses
  of classroom assessment information.

 Familiarize yourself with the format of the questions. Response options for questions that employ the “drop-down”
  function in the electronic version of this questionnaire are listed in full in Annex 1.

 Make sure you collect data for the correct type of schools. Please confirm with the country TTL the number of
  Classroom Assessment questionnaires that you will be answering. At the beginning of each Classroom Assessment
  questionnaire (questions 1 and 2), indicate for which level of the education system (primary or secondary) and for
  which type of school (public or private) you will be completing the questionnaire. There are often important variations
  in classroom assessment for different types and levels of schools. For instance, classroom assessment may vary
  considerably between primary and secondary education, or between public and private schools. If you want to collect
  information on classroom assessment for the entire school system, the recommended approach is that you complete
  four separate Classroom Assessment questionnaires, one for each of the following: (a) primary education in public
  schools, (b) secondary education in public schools, (c) primary education in private schools, and (d) secondary
  education in private schools.

 Provide the most up-to-date information on classroom assessment. You will be completing the questionnaire using
  information about classroom assessment for the most recent school year. If this information reflects recent changes
  to classroom assessment , please specify in the “Comments” section of the relevant question the nature of the change
  and when that change took place.

 Identify key individuals you will contact who have primary knowledge of classroom assessment and access to
  relevant information. Please provide information on the individuals who contributed to answering this questionnaire
  in the “Respondent Contact Information” section. You are also expected to use other sources of information (for
  example, reports, documents) as necessary. Please utilize multiple sources of information to validate your responses.

 Consult official sources. Responses to certain questions require information as published in official sources (for
  example, written policies, guidelines, or equivalent). Please refer to the relevant documents to provide the
  requested information.
 Carefully read the definitions provided and keep them in mind as you answer the questionnaires. This is
  important to ensure the comparability of data collected across countries and education systems.


                                                                                                                           3
 Answer every question unless otherwise indicated. Each question has a “Comments” section. Please use this area
  to provide additional information supporting your answer selection. For a question to which you do not know the
  answer, indicate “Do not know” and note the efforts that you made to obtain the requested information.




                                                                                                                    4
COMMONLY USED TERMS


During your data collection efforts, you may come across certain terms. Please find below definitions of commonly-used
assessment terms.

Classroom assessment: The process of collecting, synthesizing, and interpreting information on student learning to aid in
classroom decision making, support future student learning (that is, formative assessment), or judge student performance
at a specific point in time (that is, summative assessment). Primarily carried out by teachers and students in their
classrooms, it encompasses grading or scoring of student work, informal observations of students, oral quizzes, peer-to-
peer assessment, student self-assessment, and end-of-year testing.
Curriculum: The body of material that operationalizes learning standards or goals and guides their translation into
classroom instruction. Includes teaching materials, student learning materials, and learning activities.
Data reporting: The process of producing communication tools (for example, reports, brochures, online resources) and
communicating assessment results to the public, key stakeholders, or individual students.
Examination: A high-stakes assessment, the results of which are typically used to certify students (for example, for a
secondary school diploma) or select them into further education (for example, university entrance examination). Usually
covers the main domains (behaviors, competencies, knowledge, and skills) of the school curriculum, typically organized
into subject areas (for example, language arts, mathematics). Usually involves standardized administration of a test(s) to
a cohort of students under strict security conditions. School-based assessment is a special type of examination that uses
assessments generated, designed, and/or administered in schools and evaluated by students’ own teachers. School -based
assessments typically involve some form of external moderation or standardization that ensures at least a minimum
acceptable level of comparability across different schools.
International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA): Measures student performance with the aim of comparing overall
performance levels across countries or education systems. Information is collected using standardized procedures on
nationally-representative samples of students at a particular age or grade level. Typically provides information on related
or contributing factors that may affect student performance. Results can be used to inform both education policy and
practice. The best-known ILSAs include the Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education
[Laboratorio Latinoamericano de Evaluación de la Calidad de la Educación] (LLECE), Programme for the Analysis of
Education Systems [Programme d'analyse des systèmes éducatifs de la CONFEMEN] (PASEC), Progress in International
Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Southern and Eastern Africa
Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ), and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study
(TIMSS).
Item bank: Pool of questions, items, or tasks that can be retrieved for the preparation of a test or, in some instances, use
in classroom instruction. Typically, the questions, items, or tasks are classified by subject area, instructional objectives,
skills, and difficulty level, among other groupings. These classifications make it possible to retrieve questions, items, or
tasks with known characteristics and build tests that match given test specifications. It also makes it possible for teachers
and students to retrieve those that match their pedagogical and learning needs.




                                                                                                                           5
Learning standards: An outline of what is valued, recommended, or required for educators to teach and for students to
know and be able to do. Meant to provide clear expectations for students and enable better preparation and
communication among teachers, principals, parents, and education system leaders. They typically include three
components: content standards (what students should know and be able to do), process standards (the cognitive skills
that students should master, such as reasoning, problem solving, analyzing, and synthesizing), and performance standards
(the degree to which students are expected to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in order to be considered successful
learners).
Moderation : The process of establishing comparable standards for evaluating student responses to assessment questions,
items, or tasks in order to ensure that the data are valid and reliable for the intended purposes. In schools, it involves
groups of teachers reviewing examples of student work, discussing the extent to which these meet the expected standard,
and coming to agreement on the level of attainment represented by each example. The group may comprise staff from
the same school, from different schools, or across authorities.
National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA): Measures student performance with the aim of describing overall performance
levels in the education system as a whole. Usually covers the main domains (behaviors, competencies, knowledge, and
skills) of the school curriculum or what is deemed important for life in modern society (for example, language arts,
mathematics, problem solving, and use of technology). Usually involves standardized administration of tests to a sample
or population (census) of students at a particular age or grade level. Typically provides informa tion on related or
contributing factors that may affect student performance levels. Results can be used to inform both education policy and
practice, and consequences may be attached to the results.
Performance level: Involves classifying and describing student performance on a test in terms of the corresponding degree
of competence in the domain (that is, subject area, behavior, skill) being tested. Performance levels define the knowledge
and skills that students must typically demonstrate to be considered at a particular level of competence (for example,
advanced, proficient, needs improvement) in the domain.
Private schools: Schools that are not fully owned, operated, and financed by the government. These include independent
private schools (schools that operate completely separate from any government contracts, ownership, or finance),
government-funded private schools (schools that are privately operated but receive payments or subsidies from the
government), and privately managed schools (the state contracts with nongovernmental organizations to manage
publicly-owned schools).
Public schools: Schools that are owned, operated, and financed by the government.
Stakeholder: A person or collective entity that has an interest or concern in education, such as students, parents, teachers,
policy makers, business leaders, teacher unions, parent organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and the media.
