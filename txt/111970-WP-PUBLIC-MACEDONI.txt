Improving the country’s labor market performance and economic competitiveness will require a more skilled and better
educated labor force, as well as increased technology absorption, the diffusion of knowledge, and innovation. Although access
to education has improved, there is a challenging disconnect between the products of the education system and private sector
needs, as companies complain about the quality and availability of skills despite high unemployment. At the same time, the
regulatory, institutional, and financial environment needs to be strengthened to further promote innovation at the firm level
and improve the commercial significance of the country’s academic science and technology assets. The Government of FYR
Macedonia is committed to investing in quality education, innovation, and information technology, identified as top strategic
priority areas in its Work Program for the period 2011–15 as well as in the South Eastern Europe 2020 Strategy. To accomplish
these objectives, the Government has sought support from the World Bank to advance its reforms to achieve better quality
higher and vocational education and innovation systems.

The Project Development Objective is to improve the transparency of resource allocation and promote accountability in
higher education, enhance the relevance of secondary technical vocational education, and support innovation capacity in FYR
Macedonia.

The Project is designed to support interventions that foster education and skills relevant to the job market and enhance the
innovation capacity and activity of firms in FYR Macedonia. It will also address key missing elements of the Macedonian
innovation system and ailing aspects of the research sector that are likely to be vital for improving the competitiveness of the
enterprise sector and FYR Macedonia’s longer-term economic growth prospects. .

The impact of the global financial crisis and economic downturn in 2009 reduced prospects for growth, exports, foreign direct
investment (FDI), and private transfers. In addition, poverty has remained high and is likely to increase due to the impact of
the crisis. In this context, the need for effective and efficient social safety nets takes on increasing importance. Safety nets are
part of a broader poverty reduction strategy interacting with social insurance, health, education, financial services, and other
policies aimed at reducing poverty and managing risk. Safety nets have both short-run roles in alleviating immediate poverty
and inequality and long-term impacts by enabling households to make better investments for their future. The Government
has recognized that the impacts on human capital and a reduction in the intergenerational transmission of poverty can be
particularly powerful when safety net programs are directly linked to incentives for investing in education and health through
conditional cash transfers (CCTs).

The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of FYR Macedonia’s social safety net
through (a) the introduction of CCTs; and (b) improvements in the administration, oversight, monitoring, and evaluation of
social assistance transfers.

The Project is addressing the objective by supporting the implementation of a CCT program for poor families conditioned
on secondary school enrollment and the attendance of their children, and helping identify and develop possible extensions of
the CCT model in health, labor, and/or other levels of education. In addition, the project is supporting improvements in
safety net administration, service delivery, oversight, and monitoring and evaluation.

Results achieved:

        In the school year 2013–14, approximately 7,500 children from poor families regularly attended secondary schools
         due to the CCT benefit.
        The coverage of the CCT secondary education program increased from about 67 percent of eligible children in the
         first year of implementation to about 86 percent this year. The impact evaluation of the CCT secondary education
         program shows impressive results on enrollment, especially among older youth who are disproportionately likely to
         drop out of school. The CCT program could thus explain the increase of 10 percentage points in secondary school
         enrollment in Macedonia and also the lower dropout rates among older youth.
        Management and information systems for cash benefits have been upgraded to allow for better administration,
         monitoring, payment, and service delivery.

Improving the performance of the energy sector is crucial to sustaining economic development and improving
competitiveness in South East Europe (SEE). Power supply in the region is projected to tighten significantly during the next
few years, which will constrain economic activity and affect the quality of life of the citizens if not addressed in a timely
fashion.

The Development Objective of the Energy Community of South East Europe Project is to support the integration of FYR
Macedonia into the regional power market by financing investments in power transmission and institutional development that
would support market participation.

Specifically, the project has provided investment support and technical assistance to MEPSO (the public electric power
transmission company) to strengthen transmission and dispatch and improve the company’s efficiency and to bolster its
functioning in the regional power market through (a) financing the investments necessary to rehabilitate and upgrade the
power transmission network, (b) financing investments to increase the level of interconnection with neighboring power
systems, and (c) strengthening the institutional capacity of MEPSO.


Results achieved:

            With the completion of a 19-kilometer transmission line to Greece, regional power trade has been facilitated.
            In FYR Macedonia, power transit has increased by almost 200 percent since the finalization of the line.
            38 transformation substations throughout the country have been rehabilitated, including the main substation
             for the capital of Skopje, the capacity of which has been increased by 78 megavolt amperes (MVA). This has
             improved system stability and has resulted in a reduction of technical losses of 2.2 megawatts (MW) during
             peak hours.

Although the road network of FYR Macedonia, consisting of 3,781 kilometers of regional roads and 8,496 kilometers of local
roads, is considered mostly adequate in coverage, its condition falls far below the standards of similar networks in other
European and most neighboring countries. A technical assessment undertaken in 2007 classified the condition of the regional
and local roads as having “significant defects and weakened structural resistance requiring resurfacing or re -gravelling” but
not needing the pavement demolished or the road base rebuilt. This unsatisfactory condition of the roads is principally the
result of inadequate attention to the management and financing of the network over the past 15 years.

The Project Development Objective is to reduce the cost of safe access to markets and services for communities served by
regional and local roads in the Guarantor’s territory and improve the institutional capacity for investment planning and road
safety.
The project’s implementation period is 2008–15. It is financing the rehabilitation of roughly 284 kilometers of paved regional
roads (about 9 percent of the country’s regional roads) and roughly 420 kilometers of paved and unpaved local roads (about
5 percent of the country’s local roads). Following the Board-approved restructuring in 2013, the project also provides
heightened assistance to the Public Enterprise for State Roads (PESR) to improve its institutional capacity, modernize its
approach to the management of the road network, and help it adequately consider road safety.
Results achieved:
    • Regional roads: completed rehabilitation of 284 kilometers; local roads: completed rehabilitation of 408 kilometers in
        73 municipalities;
    • Created a “Model Road Safety Road” on a section of a regional road;
    • Ensured undisturbed road access and improved safety on two high-frequented roads through completing landslide
        remediation works;
    • Technical audits of completed road works carried out and their recommendations being followed up;
    • Increased the sustainability of rehabilitated roads and improved road safety through additional works on drainage,
        replacement, and installation of road signs and lane markings and road side equipment, such as guardrails;
     Currently replacing all road signs and road markings on regional roads in line with the newly enacted laws and
        regulations, which are consistent with European best practice;
    • Strengthened the capacity of municipalities to plan, maintain, and invest in local roads (through the recommendations
        of technical audits and the production of “Guidelines for the Identification and Design of Improvements to Local
        Roads”);
    • PESR introducing a Road Asset Management system for the road network and completed condition survey on full state
        road network;

FYR Macedonia embarked on a decentralization reform process a decade ago. The need for the more efficient provision of
local services is widely recognized in the country. Public services such as water, sewerage and solid waste, public lighting, street
cleaning and parks, marketplaces, and cemeteries are provided through municipal-owned communal service enterprises. Most
of these services have suffered pervasively from rigid tariff controls, neglected maintenance, overemployment, and poor
financial management, leading to a vicious cycle of further deterioration and lack of funding for new investments. The
prevailing institutional and policy framework does not support the sustainability of services, let alone generate funding for
improvements.
The Project Development Objective is to improve the transparency, financial sustainability, and delivery of targeted
municipal services in the participating municipalities. The project aims to focus on infrastructure and services under the
responsibility of participating municipalities and their communal service enterprises, such as water supply, sanitation, and solid
waste management, but may also include support for other functions such as energy efficiency, urban transport, and other
services under municipal provision. It provides subloans to municipalities for investments in revenue-generating public
services and other high-priority investment projects, as well as technical assistance grants for subproject preparation, local
capacity building for municipalities and communal service enterprises, and national-level institutional strengthening. The
project has been restructured to accommodate additional finance that established a grant window for rural infrastructure.
Results achieved:
 Subloans have been signed with 42 municipalities, of which 25 have been successfully completed and 13 are under
    implementation. A further 29 municipalities are preparing investment projects with support from the project
    management unit (PMU).
 People in participating municipalities have been provided with access to regular solid waste collection, better and
    cheaper public lighting, rehabilitated local streets, better storm drainage, improved heating in public schools through
    energy saving, and improved water supply through the rehabilitation of water supply networks.
 In Bogdanci, and Novaci, the population benefits from better and more energy-efficient street lightning, cutting energy
    consumption by more than 50 percent; the project entailed the replacement of old mercury bulbs with new compact
    florescent light bulbs. The project encompassed all inhabited areas. A total of 12,200 inhabitants benefited from the
    project. The same project is due to be finalized in Gostivar and Veles, substantially increasing the number of
    beneficiaries. Other energy-efficiency projects, such as school insulations, are ongoing.
 The city of Skopje procured equipment for street cleaning and new waste containers; 17 solid waste trucks and 60,000
    waste bins have been purchased, serving about 250,000 inhabitants.
 The municipality of Ilinden purchased and installed a heating pump for an elementary school, resulting in more efficient
    heating.
 The municipalities of Pehcevo, Vevchani, Krushevo, Kichevo, Vinica, Gradsko, Gostivar, and Kriva Palanka bought
    new solid waste trucks, construction machines, and multifunctioning machines with snow clearing equipment to serve
    their inhabitants.
 The municipalities of Kochani, Kisela Voda, Vasilevo, and Veles reconstructed part of their water supply network,
    which is now providing a more reliable water supply to many of their citizens, while Prilep, Dolneni, GJorce Petrov, and
    Vevchani reconstructed crucial road networks in their municipalities, facilitating transport and trade for local
    communities, thus contributing to the local economy.
Key Partners: The Bank team is working closely with the (i) Ministry of Finance, which is responsible for overall policy setting as well as
for project management; (ii) Association of Municipalities (ZELS); and (iii) participating municipalities, as the ultimate recipients of loan
resources through on-lending arrangements. A Key Development Partner is USAID, which provided technical assistance to
municipalities, and the EU, which provides IPA funds to establish a new rural investment window for the project.

In 2005, the real estate cadastre covered less than 43 percent of the country, and uncertain property rights and weak land
registration services created significant constraints to foreign investment. Confidence in the registration and cadastre records
was low, as the records were significantly out-of-date and 60–70 percent of apartments were not registered at all. The lack of
confidence and the difficulty caused by incomplete records had negative effects on private sector investment and the
development of the economy overall; many land transactions were not registered, and cadastre and other records (courts,
notaries) were incomplete and outdated, leading to uncertainty and a lack of trust in the property markets. Property ownership
was not registered consistently in any central place and the lack of secure title made mortgage financing difficult or impossible
for most citizens.
The Project Development Objective is to build an efficient and effective real estate cadastre and registration system,
contributing to the development of efficient land and real estate markets.
The Project has helped the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC) to transform itself from a technical organization focused
on surveying to a service organization focused on customers. One of the main objectives of the project was improving the
agency’s management and monitoring, which consequently led to a more efficient and client-oriented way of working. At the
same time, the policy work under the project has contributed to the new Law on Land Survey, Cadastre, and Registration of Real
Estate Rights, which allowed for the development of private sector surveyors. The Government and the Bank agreed on an
Additional Financing loan of €9.0 million in 2010, and the project was extended for three years to complete the additional
activities, including the digital cadastre map and a national spatial data infrastructure that will contribute to more and better
services to citizens and other government partners.
Results achieved:
  Since the project’s start in 2005:
   A Real Estate Cadastre has been established in the whole country.
   The annual number of registered transactions nationwide tripled from 42,000 in 2005 to 147,600 in 2014.
   The number of mortgages registered in the land administration system each year increased from 3,000 in 2005 to
      17,500 in 2014, demonstrating a substantial increase in using ownership rights as collateral. Since the project began,
      over 91,000 mortgages have been registered. The growing trend has been exceeding all estimates.
   The average time to register a purchase and sale transaction has been reduced to 2.4 days in urban and 1.5 days in
      rural areas, down from 60 days in 2004.
   At the end of 2014, there were 249 accredited private surveyors and 196 registered companies providing services
      directly to citizens—up from 14 private surveyors and zero registered companies at project commencement.
   The Authority for Legal and Property Affairs (ALPA) operates with a new management information system that
      enables greater efficiency in its work, and 25 out of 35 local offices operate in improved premises. A vision and
      strategy for ALPA’s future role were developed and are under implementation. ALPA has resolved 170,000 urban
      land privatization cases.
Key Partners: The Bank team has worked closely with the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC), the main implementing
agency. Other key government partners include the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transport, both of which are
members of the Land Policy Advisory Committee and have been involved in land policy activities.
Key Development Partners include the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the Japanese
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Governments of the Netherlands and Norway. All have provided grant

FYR Macedonia is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. Between 1989 and 2006, floods constituted 44 percent of natural
and technological disasters. Data from the past 20 years reveal a steadily rising trend of natural disaster incidence, flood
severity, and flood intensity. The country is doubly impacted as not only has flooding shown a rising trend, but the effects of
climate change have also increased the incidence of droughts. In addition, FYR Macedonia is located in the Mediterranean
seismic belt. An earthquake in 1963 killed more than 1,000 people and damaged 80 percent of the building stock in Skopje.

The Project Development Objective is to help increase the access of homeowners, farmers, the enterprise sector, and
government agencies to financial protection from losses caused by climate change and geological hazards.
The program will support the South East Europe and Caucasus (SEEC) countries’ efforts to join Europa Re by financing their
membership contributions to the facility. Europa Re, in turn, will facilitate the growth of catastrophe risk insurance markets in
the member countries. For the program’s first phase, this component will be financed by Internat ional Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loans (for Serbia and FYR Macedonia) and International Development Association
(IDA) credits (for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia). The SEEC CRIF will also work on building technical capacities
through a grant, financed by donor funds and a Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant and implemented by Europa Re,
that includes: (i) risk mapping and modeling for participating countries; (ii) design and pricing of appropriate catastrophe risk
insurance products; (iii) small weather monitoring stations to support parametric weather insurance; and (iv) technical
assistance for regulatory and policy reforms to create an enabling market environment.
Results achieved:

     The most important expected result of the program is the increased access to affordable weather risk coverage and
      catastrophe insurance for millions of people and thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the
      region. The aim is to raise catastrophe insurance penetration among beneficiaries from the current 1–5 percent to 15
      percent of homeowners, farmers, enterprises, and government entities over the next five years.
     The key beneficiaries of SEEC CRIF are homeowners, farmers, the enterprise sector, and government
      organizations/agencies that will be able to buy dependable catastrophe insurance coverage and/or index-based
      parametric weather risk insurance contracts at competitive prices. Direct beneficiaries also include local insurance
      companies in the participating countries that will be able to expand and deepen their insurance business.

Key Partners: The Bank team works closely with (i) the Ministry of Finance, which is responsible for overall policy setting as
well as for project implementation; (ii) the Insurance Supervision Agency; and (iii) private insurance companies.

Key Development Partners include the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, which is providing a US$4.5 million
grant to finance the establishment of the Europa Re company. The Bank team is also closely coordinating with the EU
Delegation in FYR Macedonia.

As a landlocked country, FYR Macedonia is particularly dependent on a well-developed road and rail network for its economic
and social development. Key elements of this network are also part of the Trans-European transport network (Corridor X,
which goes from Austria to Turkey, and Corridor VIII, which connects Albania with the Black Sea ports in Bulgaria). The
main challenges facing the country have been to reduce the economic distance to markets and lower the costs of transportation
arising from the poor road condition of Corridor X and major delays at key border crossing points. The road network’s overall
condition fares poorer than EU averages. Roads in the country are categorized as follows: (1) national roads; (2) regional
roads; and (3) local roads. The current road network in Macedonia includes a total mileage of 14,159 kilometers. As such, the
road network is considered to be close to appropriate in density but in need of improvement, mostly as a result of the age of
existing infrastructure and irregular and insufficient maintenance. The national roads, relative to other road categories, are in
a better condition, but due to the higher traffic they carry, they are in need of rehabilitation to ensure their longevity and
decrease transport costs for freight and passengers. Regional roads are in greater need of investment, due to past backlogs in
investment in these lower-trafficked roads

The Project Development Objectives are to enhance the connectivity of selected national and regional roads, primarily to
Corridors X and VIII, and to improve the Public Enterprise for State Roads’ (PESR) capacity for road safety and climate
resilience.

The project’s implementation period is 2014–19. The project will rehabilitate national and regional roads that connect to the
main road corridors X and VIII and to the 15 road border crossings of the landlocked country. The project will work with
PESR and the National Council for Road Safety to improve the safety elements of road infrastructure, in line with the National
Transport Strategy and recognized best practice. Priority is put on: introducing infrastructure safety management measures
that are binding for contractors and road authorities in all stages of planning and execution; improving security standards on
road-railways crossings; eliminating black spots; supporting proper and efficient road maintenance; and ensuring visibility on
the roads by eliminating physical and illegal obstacles. The project complements the ongoing Regional and Local Roads
Support Program that included the rehabilitation of the regional and local road network.


Results achieved:
   Project launch workshop was organized on November 5, 2014, where PESR, the World Bank, and all relevant
      national institutions, as well as the EU delegation, discussed the details of the project’s expected results and also
      identified possibilities for cooperation. Procurement is starting, with a procurement package for Component 1 under
      Bank review.


Key Partners: The Bank team works closely with (i) the Public Enterprise for State Roads (PESR), the Borrower and
implementer of the project; (ii) the Ministry of Transport and Communications, which is responsible for overall policy setting;
and (iii) the National Road Safety Council.
Key Development Partners include the European Union and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

The proposed project is partnering with Stopanska Banka, a leading bank in the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, to support its trade finance activities. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) was a holder of 10.8
percent of equity stakes until its exit in July 2010.

The project is part of IFC’s regional business partnerships with subsidiaries of the National Bank of Greece (NBG). It
is also in line with the “Joint IFI Action Plan,” which is supporting the banking sectors of Central and Eastern Europe
through the coordinated intervention of international financial institutions (IFIs). The project established a US$4 million
Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) trade nominal limit to Stopanska Banka with a risk weighted limit of US$2
million for up to one year.

The Project Development Objective. The objective of the project is to support the bank’s trade finance operations
as well as to expand IFC’s GTFP partner bank network in FYR Macedonia, which consisted of only one partner bank
(NLB Tutunska) at the time of investment. In this regard, the project contributes to the expansion of the trade finance
business of the bank, making it less reliant on parent support.

The development impact of the project is expected to include:
       Contributing to economic growth through the increase of financing available for international trade;
       Enhancing the bank’s ability to provide export finance and contribute to export growth;
       Helping a major Greek bank sustain its franchise and maintain its operations in South East Europe (SEE)
        countries.

Universal Investment Bank, established as Balkanska Banka with mixed capital from Macedonian and Bulgarian legal entities
and individuals, was bought in 2003 by the owners of FIBank, Sofia, Republic of Bulgaria, which is a current IFC client.
Following the acquisition, the name of the bank was changed to its current name, Universal Investment Bank, in 2004. The
bank services the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) segment in the country with a stronghold in the retail market and
has a limited exposure to the corporations of FYR Macedonia.

The bank’s main shareholders are Ivaylo Mutafchiev and Tzeko Minev, who are also the main shareholders of FIBank in
Bulgaria, which is a current client of IFC through the GTFP, currently under discussion for an Energy-Efficiency line of up
to US$30 million. A trade line with UniBank was considered at the time that a trade line was proposed for FIBank in Bulgaria
at the end of 2009; however, due to a breach of certain important covenants, mainly the open loan exposure ratio, the Team
felt it would be better to hold the investment until the bank had increased its provisioning levels.

The Project Development Objective. The objectives are to support the trade finance operations of UniBank, one of the
second-tier banks in FYR Macedonia, servicing SME clients in the market. UniBank, which is the sister bank of an existing
IFC client in Bulgaria, has been adversely affected, as the crisis has increased the costs of trade substantially. The project is
expected to establish a relationship with UniBank, the seventh-largest bank in FYR Macedonia servicing SME clients in the
country, which has been constrained by the global financial crisis. The project fits well with IFC’s strategy for FYR Macedonia,
as it contributes directly to one of the main strategic objectives of expanding access to short-term finance to SMEs in the
country, which is key to economic growth and job generation.

IFC’s expected additionality includes:
       Support for the trade finance operations of UniBank, since with no support from a strong multinational parent,
        UniBank is faced with limited access to lines by international banks;
       Support for real sector clients in FYR Macedonia, which rely on trade finance for their operations and have been
        negatively impacted by increased costs and the non-availability of lines.

EVN Macedonia AD (the “Company”) is FYR Macedonia’s sole electricity distribution company serving more than 812,000
customers and a population of 2 million people. After the unbundling of the state-owned utility into separate generation,
transmission, and distribution companies, the Company was subsequently privatized in March 2006, with 90 percent of its
shares sold to EVN AG for €225 million. Ten percent of the Company’s shares remain with the Government. Unfavorable
macroeconomic conditions in the country continue to have a negative impact on the Company’s financial performance through
increases in the impairment of receivables and high grid losses. Consequently, the Company continues to record losses. EVN
AG (the “Sponsor”) is Austria’s second-largest integrated utility company, providing electricity, gas, heating, water, and waste
incineration services in Austria and 20 other Central Eastern European countries. EVN AG was partially privatized in 1990
and is currently owned 51 percent by the Province of Lower Austria and 49 percent by other utilities and shareholders. EVN
AG is listed on the stock exchanges in Vienna, Munich, and Frankfurt with a market capitalization of approximately €2 billion
as of February 26, 2013.

The Project Development Objective. The project’s expected development impacts are: (a) supporting the Company during
power sector deregulation by providing long-term financing, (b) continuing to support EVN with its turnaround strategy that
essentially focuses on increasing bill collection rates and reducing energy losses, which will lead to significant electricity savings
for FYR Macedonia, and (c) promoting proper sector reform and the development of a competitive power market in the
country.

    IFC’s expected additionality includes:
            Providing debt financing with adequate maturity as long-term financing is unavailable in the Macedonian
             market;
            Helping the Sponsor with its turnaround of the Company;
            Bringing IFC’s global experience in financing electricity distribution projects in markets where deregulation is
             taking place;
            Mitigating regulatory risk, given the limited track record of the Regulator (ERC) and the new regulatory
             framework that is being introduced;
             Continuing to offer a “stamp of approval” regarding the Company’s environmental and social action plan, in
             line with World Bank Group requirements.

The Project is integral to the Societe Generale IFI Action Plan for Central and East Europe (CEE) (IFC/R2010-0137),
which would help expand the lending programs of Societe Generale’s (“SocGen”) subsidiaries in CEE countries, primarily to
penetrate various economic sectors such as agribusiness, climate change, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Moreover, this plan is consistent with the strategy of the World Bank Group to reinforce the financial sector in this region.
Strong, transparent, and coordinated action by parent banks and international financial institutions (IFIs) is much needed to
minimize economic vulnerabilities in the CEE banking sector. This action would counter the negative outcomes provoked
by economic contraction, reduced investment and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, and scaled-back credit to the private
sector, all of which are now hindering SME growth and leading to job losses. Moreover, IFC’s strategy is t o balance the
allocation of financing requested from Western European banks for their subsidiaries in the region between the different
countries, given the significant increase in demand for such financing.
The Project Development Objective. The project would further expand SME lending in FYR Macedonia through a funding
package of up to €20 million in the form of senior and subordinated loans to Ohridska Banka A.D. Ohrid (“Ohridska Banka”),
a SocGen subsidiary and one of the country’s most stable banks, whose market share is 7.6 percent in terms of total assets.
The first portion of the project was committed and disbursed as a senior loan at €10 million. The bank has requested IFC to
convert the uncommitted portion of the facility, which was approved as either a subordinated loan or senior loan to be used
for SMEs (€10 million), into a senior loan to be on-lent for renewable energy/energy-efficiency (RE/EE) products; the
negotiations are still ongoing. The project would allow Ohridska Banka to tap into new funding sources, as international
financing is scarce amid the European economic downturn. Strongly linked to IFC’s regional objectives, this investment
would directly boost access to finance for SMEs, a key to economic growth and job creation.
IFC’s expected additionality includes:
     IFC would provide long-term funding to Ohridska Banka, as longer-term financial resources are now in short supply
      especially in frontier markets like FYR Macedonia. IFC’s engagement is critical to augment SocGen, the parent
      company, now facing challenging market conditions that could impede continual support to its subsidiaries. IFC’s
      additionality, therefore, would assist Ohridska Banka in diversifying funding sources and in supporting real sector
      clients in FYR Macedonia that rely on trade finance for their operations and have been negatively impacted by
      increased costs and the non-availability of lines.
     IFC would boost Ohridska Banka’s lending to SMEs, which play a crucial role in both economic growth and job
      creation.
     Increased access to finance: The project would contribute to economic growth in FYR Macedonia by increasing access
      to finance for SMEs—a vital economic segment—through a well-managed local bank supported by an international
      strategic investor.
     Long-term maturities and improved capitalization: The project would assist Ohridska Banka to more effectively manage
      the bank’s asset and liability positions with longer-term maturities otherwise in short supply; the subordinated debt,
      qualifying for Tier II capital, would subsequently strengthen the bank’s capital to underscore anticipated future growth.
     Demonstration effect: As a SocGen subsidiary, Ohridska Banka is expected to demonstrate market best practices in
      pivotal areas, i.e., credit policies, risk management, and environmental and social systems.

The Project is one element of an umbrella credit facility to NLB Group, a regional financial services group owned and
controlled by its parent company, Nova Ljubljanska Banka dd. (“NLB”), based in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The facility is
designed to provide longer-term funding to NLB Group subsidiaries to support small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). The project consists of a SME financing credit line of up to €25 million to NLB Tutunska Banka A.D. Skopje
(“Tutunska”), the third-largest bank, with a growing presence across retail, corporate banking, and SME lending. The
project would allow Tutunska to tap a new source of financing at a time when international funding sources for
Macedonian banks are drying up due to the impact of the global financial crisis, and it also assists the Macedonian SME
sector, which contributes around 90 percent of the country’s economic output, in a time of economic hardship.
The Project Development Objective. By supporting SME lending activities of the bank and the leasing company in a
market where private sector credit/GDP is at significantly lower levels compared to the EU, IFC will contribute to
expanding access to term finance and support SMEs’ capital investment plans. The successful implementation of the
project will help an experienced, strong local sponsor to grow further as a regional player, and facilitate the transfer of
capital and modern banking practices from Slovenia into the lesser-developed markets in the region. It will also support
a system bank in lending to the SME sector, which is crucial for the creation of new job opportunities.

IFC’s expected additionality includes:
     Support during the Crisis: By providing funding to the bank, IFC helps to maintain Tutunska’s lending activities
      and acts as a counterbalancing force in the absence of private sector funding. Without the project, the bank might
      need to curtail its lending activities and reduce its balance sheet as existing funding becomes due.
     Longer Term Funding: IFC provides longer-term funding that Tutunska would find difficult to source from the
      private sector market, particularly for frontier markets such as FYR Macedonia. This is relevant in the context of
      the global crisis that has affected the ability of European banks and their subsidiaries to raise long-term funding.
     Long-term Partnership: Through the project, IFC is building a long-term strategic partnership with NLB and the
      bank, which would provide a platform for IFC to undertake other initiatives across the region. NLB is one of the
      key regional players, and such a partnership would give IFC further reach into many of the smaller markets in the
      region, as in the case of the project.
     Access to Finance: The investment supports the SME lending activities of the NLB Group and the bank in a
      rather underdeveloped market such as FYR Macedonia. IFC contributes to expanding access to term finance and
      support for SMEs’ capital investment plans. The SME sector is an important driver of the Macedonian economy
      that is still offering attractive growth opportunities.
