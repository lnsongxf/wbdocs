As depicted above, Easypaisa products have been released sequentially to give the market sufficient time
to absorb them. By offering an OTC experience at the outset, Easypaisa’s aim was to educate customers
gradually and drive both foot traffic and transactions at agent locations. This gradual introduction has, of
course, been accompanied by intense communication and field marketing campaigns.
