     Annex 2: Kenya – survey of informal firms (2013)


     Description of the Informality Survey

     The World Bank’s Informal Enterprise Surveys (IFS) collect data on non-registered business activities
     in every region of the world. The IFS are implemented in parallel to the World Bank’s Enterprise
     Surveys (ES), which interview formal, private, non-agricultural firms in countries around the world
     (www.enterprisesurveys.org). The IFS use a standardized survey instrument designed to assess the
     business environment for non-registered businesses within a well-defined universe of activities,
     which have been identified using information from previous iterations of the studies. The IFS cover
     business environment topics including: general business characteristics, infrastructure, crime,
     sales & supplies, finance, labor, registration, business environment, and assets. The objective of
     the IFS can be summarized as follows:

        • To provide information about the state of the private sector for informal businesses in client
           countries;
        • To generate information about the reasons of said informality;
        • To collect useful data for the research agenda on informality; and
        • To provide information on the level of activity in the informal sector of selected urban centers
           in each country

     The IFS are conducted using a uniform sampling methodology in order to minimize measurement
     error and yield data that are comparable across the world’s economies. The primary sampling units
     of the IFS are non-registered business entities.For consistency, “registration” is defined according
     to the established convention for the Enterprise Surveys in each country. In these surveys, the
     requirements for registration are defined on a country-by-country basis consulting information
     collected by Doing Business and information from the in-country contractors. For the case of
     Kenya, informal firms were defined as those not registered with the Kenya Revenue Authority
     (KRA). The survey was conducted between April,18th and May, 11th2013.

     In each country, the IFS are conducted in selected urban centers, which are intended to coincide with
     the locations for the implementation of the main Enterprise Surveys. Each urban center is divided
     into an appropriate number of zones. The zones are identified using regional considerations and
     the concentration of informal business activity through consulting local knowledge. The overall
     number of interviews is pre-determined, and these interviews are distributed between the selected
     urban centers, according to criteria such as the level of business activity and each urban center’s
     population, etc.In Kenya, a total of 533 firms were interviewed. The urban centers identified were
     Nairobi (137 firms), Mombasa (110), Central (103), Nyanza (93), and Nakuru (90). These urban
     centers were divided into 122 zones and at least four interviews were completed for each zone. In
     order to provide information on diverse aspects of the informal economy, the sample is designed
     to have equal proportions of services and manufacturing (50:50). These business activity sectors
     are defined by responses provided by each informal business to a question on the business’s main
     activity included in the screener portion of the questionnaire.

Due to lack of proper sampling frame and the limited geographical coverage, the informality
survey for Kenya (and other countries) is not necessarily representative of the informal sector in the
country or even the informal sector in the urban centers covered. Hence, all the results presented
below using IFS for Kenya should be treated with due caution as pertaining to the sample of firms
surveyed and not necessarily the informal sector more broadly. Nevertheless, Enterprise Surveys
take appropriate measures to keep the IFS as truly random so that the results based on these
data are not systematically biased in one direction or the other. In the case of Kenya, the following
steps were taken to ensure randomness of the selection process:

   • Each interviewer receives one or more maps of the geographic sectors he/she has to cover
      with the indication of the starting points and the direction to follow.
   • The interviewers were instructed to follow the direction of the street.
   • Four interviews (two services and two manufacturing firms) were completed from each
      starting point. The instruction was that interviews be conducted in every address (or stall)
      passed until 4 completed interviews have been achieved.
   • GPS coordinates of the interviewed business were recorded.

     Annex 3: Business environment and productivity


     To answer this question, we replicated some of the analysis that was produced by Gelb et al in 20099
     which examines firm productivity by contrasting informal firms with their formal micro-enterprise
     and SME counterparts. They speculate that growth and productivity within the informal market is
     dependent on the quality of the business environment. Their hypothesis is that when the business
     environment is poor, informal and formal firms will be less distinguishable, and conversely, in
     a higher quality business environment, differences in growth and productivity between formal
     and informal firms will emerge. Their hypothesis rests on a differential treatment of firms in a
     higher quality business environment through “sticks” in the form of tougher enforcement limiting
     informal activity and/or through “carrots” in the form of improved business service access for
     formal firms.

     In particular, they find (using this same Enterprise Survey data from the World Bank but from
     2007-2009) that informal firms from four countries in East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and
     Rwanda)) exhibit productivity profiles that are indistinguishable from their formal counterparts
     while informal firms in southern Africa (Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa) are considerably
     poorer performers than their formal sector counterparts. This uni-modal vs bi-modal finding for
     the probability density of productivity in each country drives their entire result. The Gelb et al 2009
     paper shows Kenya Informal firms in 2007 to be indistinguishable from their formal counterparts
     (Figure 3b). Using the new data, we find that the informal firms are now distinguishable from their
     formal counterparts (Figure 3c). This suggests that the quality of the business environment—at
     least as differentially experienced by formal and informal firms—in Kenya may have changed since
     the last survey.
