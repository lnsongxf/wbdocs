Global trends
Global Average Total Cost increases slightly
In Q3 2016, the Global Average cost for sending remittances was 7.42 percent, recording a decrease
from Q2 2016 (7.60 percent). This decrease follows consecutive quarterly increases in Q1 and Q2
2016. The Global Average remains below 8.00 percent, as it has since Q3 2014 (see Figure 1 and
Table 2 in the Annex). Overall this represents a decline of 2.25 percentage points since Q1 2009, when
the figure was recorded at 9.67 percent. A decrease of 1.31 percentage points can be observed over
the last year between Q3 2015 and Q3 2016.
International MTO Index decreases
The International MTO Index tracks the prices of MTOs that are present in at least 85 percent of
corridors covered in the RPW database.i A convergence between the Global Average and the
International MTO Index was noted in Q1 2014. This convergence continued for several quarters. In
Q3 2016 the International MTO Index continued its downwards movement from 8.14 percent in the
previous quarter to 8.05 percent. This follows the decrease seen in the Global Average.

Global Weighted Average
In addition to the Global Average, a weighted average total cost is calculated, which accounts for the
relative size of the flows in each remittance corridor.iii The Global Weighted Average of sending
remittances, as illustrated in Figure 2 (see also Table 2 in the Annex), has at times shown a different

pattern from the simple average. The Global Weighted Average has exhibited a slight increase since
Q2 2016, increasing from 5.68 percent to 5.73 percent.


              Figure 2 Global Weighted Average for sending USD 200 (Corridors Present in Q3 2015)




Global trends remain unaffected by RPW sample increase
In the last three quarters, RPW’s coverage has increased substantially – from 227 corridors in Q3 2015
to 300 in Q4 2015, and again to 365 in Q2 2016. To account for this notable improvement in the sample,
several indicators were calculated considering only those corridors covered in Q3 2015 before
coverage was expanded.
When considering only the 227 corridors monitored until Q3 2015, the 227 corridor Global Average in
Q3 2016 was 7.43 percent, which is nearly equal to the 365 corridor Global Average of 7.42 percent.
The Global Weighted Average for the 227 corridors is 5.81 percent, which is also very close to the 365
corridor Global Weighted average of 5.73 percent. The differences between the two sets of averages
of the 227 corridor sample size and the 365 corridor sample size are not significant, thus we can
conclude that increasing the corridor sampling in the RPW database is a progressive move and will
provide increasingly more accurate statistics for the global remittance market.

The Smart Remitter Target (SmaRT)
To complement the Global Average and Global Weighted Averages described above, the World Bank
introduced the SmaRT indicator in Q2 2016, which more accurately reflects the cost that a savvy
consumer with access to sufficiently complete information could pay in each corridor.
SmaRT is calculated as the simple average of the three cheapest services for sending the equivalent
of USD 200 in each corridor and be expressed as a percentage of the total amount sent. In addition to
transparency, services must meet additional criteria to qualify for being included in the SmaRT
calculation, including transaction speed (five days or less), and accessibility, determined by geographic
proximity of branches for services that require physical presence, or access to any technology or device
necessary to use the service, such as a bank account, mobile phone, or the Internet.iv
In Q2 2016, the SmaRT average was stated to be 7.05 percent. Due to a procedural adjustment which
improved the manner in which SmaRT Access Criteria were applied, the recalculated SmaRT average
for Q2 2016 is now recorded at 5.40 percent.v In Q3 2016, the Global SmaRT average was 5.36 percent
– just over 2 percentage points lower than the Global Average.
The full potential of SmaRT can be appreciated at the corridor level. In Q3 2016, 52 of the 365 corridors
had fewer than 3 qualifying services. 8 corridors did not meet SmaRT Access Criteria. Comparing the
corridor SmaRT average with the corridor average including all services illuminates the importance of
the role of financial inclusion and access.
As the methodology of SmaRT further improves and a time series is built, this indicator has the potential
to play a major role in informing policy actions.


Trends in Average Total Costs                      Figure 3 Distribution of Average Total Costs
Figure 3 shows that compared to Q1
2009, 15 percent more corridors in
the dataset are at a cost between 5-
10 percent in Q3 2016, one percent
lower than in Q2 2016. The number of
services in the 0-5 percent range
increased since Q2 2016, by 1
percent. A total of 76 percent of all
services recorded in the RPW dataset
are available below the cost of 10
percent. Conversely, the number of
services at the higher ranges of costs
is steadily decreasing. In Q2 2016, 5
percent of services were available at
15-20 percent – this remained true in
Q3 2016. The major change occurred
in the highest total cost range – those
services priced at greater than 20
percent. Since Q1 2009 the number
of services in the RPW dataset priced
at this range has decreased from 5
percent of those services sampled to
less than 1 percent (0.27 percent).

G8 and G20 countries
Cost of sending remittances from G8 countries decreases slightly
The G8 countries include some of the major sending countries in the world. The average cost for
sending remittances from the G8 countries experienced a modest decrease from 7.19 percent in Q2
2016 to 6.97 percent in Q3 2016. This is a modest quarterly variation, but reflects an overall yearly
decrease of 0.75 percentage points.
As Figure 4 illustrates, there are significant disparities in the cost levels across these countries. The
average cost of sending money from Japan, Germany, and Canada are consistently above both the
Global and G8 average, while costs in Russia, the United States, and Italy are consistently below.
France, until recently, was among the countries above, but has remained below the global average
since Q4 2015. The UK tends to oscillate between the two – typically above G8 average but below
Global Average, like in Q1 and Q2 2016. This remained true in Q3 2016.


                                   Figure 4 Total average in G8 countries




The largest increase was seen in Canada (8.01 percent to 8.36 percent). Russia remains the least
expensive sending country in the G8, with an average cost of 1.71 percent. Japan experienced the next
largest decrease, from 12.48 percent in Q2 2016 to 11.30 percent in Q3 2016, a decrease of 1.18
percentage points. The quarterly and yearly variation figures can be found in Table 3 in the Annex.

Cost of sending remittances from and to G20 follows trends in the Global Average
The cost of remitting from G20 countries was recorded at 7.57 percent in Q3 2016, a modest decrease
from 7.65 percent in Q2 2016, as shown in Figure 5 (also see Table 5 in the Annex). This is still slightly
higher than the 7.46 percent average seen in Q4 2015.

Regional trends
The cost for remittance services varies significantly depending on the region where the money is being
sent (see Figure 9 below and Table 6 in the Annex). Different trends are observed in different regions.
All regions experienced very modest changes or remained stable. South Asia (5.41 percent) maintains
its position as least costly region to send money to, falling from its Q2 2016 level of 5.56 percent. Sub-
Saharan Africa experienced a small decrease from Q2 2016 to Q3 2016, falling from 9.58 percent to
9.52 percent. This maintains its trend of remaining below 10 percent average total cost.

Due to the peculiarity of the Russian market and its heavy influence on the ECA region, an additional
value for the ECA region, excluding Russia, has been calculated and considered: the average excluding
Russia was recorded at 7.49 percent – a little over one percentage point higher than the average
including Russia, recorded at 6.36 percent in Q3 2016.

Costs by RSP Type
RPW tracks the cost of sending remittances for three main RSP types; commercial banks, MTOs, and
post offices. Figure 10 provides a time series visual of all of the RSP Types included in the RPW
dataset.
Over time, Banks and MTOs have seen a general decline of total average costs, while Post Office
services have led a volatile trend and overall recorded an increase since the historic low recorded in
Q3 2013. Banks are firmly above the Global Average, whereas Post Offices and MTOs remain below.

Figure 11 provides an overview for each RSP Type in Q3 2016. Banks continue to be the costliest
RSP type, with an average cost of 11.18 percent, a modest decrease from 11.32 percent seen in Q2
2016. Post Office services remain below the global average, recorded at 6.36 percent in Q3 2016. The
cheapest service is Pre-Paid Card services, recorded at a total average cost of 1.75 percent. Mobile
operators are the second cheapest, recorded at 3.46 percent.

Costs by Service type
Cash services remain one of the most widely covered in RPW and are among the cheapest ways to
send money, with an average cost of 6.78 percent, as shown in Figure 12. Account to account services
are still the most expensive, recorded at 8.92 percent in Q3 2016, a slight increase from the Q2 2016
statistic of 8.78 percent. The cost of transfers within the same bank (or to a partner bank in the receiving
country) was cheaper at an on-average cost of 6.13 percent. The cost of account to account services
continues to converge towards the price of cash services and, for the seventh time, as recorded by
RPW, bank transfers within the same bank (or to a partner bank in the receiving country) were cheaper
than cash to cash services.
Pre-paid card services emerged as the least expensive product type at 3.53 percent in Q1 2016, but
still account for a very small share of services covered by RPW. In Q3 2016, Pre-paid card services
were recorded at an on-average cost of 2.58 percent.

Notes
i The International MTOs Index includes all MTOs that are present in over 85 percent of RPW corridors. Thus far, it has
included Western Union and MoneyGram, which operate in 99 percent and 92 percent of the country corridors covered in
the database, respectively.
ii
 Figures for the global average were adjusted in Q1 2014 following a thorough clean-up of the entire database. Some
values slightly vary from data published in the past.
iii
  It is important to note that, while official data on remittance flows by bilateral corridors are currently not available, estimates
(Ratha and Shaw 2007, last updated in 2014, available at http://go.worldbank.org/JITC7NYTT0) have been used in this
calculation. These estimates are based on the Balance Of Payments (BOP) and factor in migrant stocks, destination country
incomes, and source country incomes. The methodology for these estimates has been questioned, as well as the accuracy
of official data on remittance flows and migrant stocks. However, this still represents the only available comprehensive
dataset on bilateral remittance flows. It also seems likely that overall the dataset is sufficiently accurate to reflect at least
the proportion between the different corridors, hence offering a good approximation to weight the relevance of each corridor
in terms of flow size.
ivFor additional information on the methodology used to calculate SmaRT see
https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/smart_methodology.pdf
v Due to a technical change in the SmaRT Access Scoring procedures applied to all services in the RPW dataset, the Q2
2016 average is now recorded at 5.40 percent. This procedural change concerned the order in which SmaRT Access
Criteria were applied. The procedure used in Q2 2016 resulted in exclusion of services that were accessible via
alternative methods. For example, a Bank Account Transfer that was inaccessible via a Bank Branch location (the
sending country’s Bank Account Ownership level did not satisfy the SmaRT Access Criteria stated in Table 1) but was
accessible via the Internet was not included in the calculation as performed in Q2 2016, as it was scored first on Bank
Account Ownership. However, using the new procedure those services that have alternative access methods would have
the appropriate SmaRT Access Criteria applied to them. Operating under the “savvy consumer” assum ption, a remittance
service client would access a Bank Account Transfer as in the example above via the Internet rather than use a Bank
Branch or Agent location. Using this new procedure, we gain a clearer view of what services are most accessible and
inaccessible in each corridor.
