                                             Box 1: What is Agency?
        This study draws upon the concept of agency to enrich the understanding of female empower-
        ment in agriculture. The questionnaire used in this study built upon the Women’s Empowerment
        in Agriculture Index (WEAI) (Alkire et al. 2013), and was designed specifically to focus on trends
        in the feminization of agriculture due to male out-migration. Agency, then, is a quality or capacity
        exercised when a person is able to capitalize on endowments and economic opportunities to lead
        to desired actions. Sen (1989) defines agency as an individual’s ability to act on behalf of what the
        individual values and has reason to value.
        Agency is not “global” but rather multidimensional in the sense that an individual can exercise dif-
        ferent levels of agency in pursuit of multiple aims (Alkire 2005). These aims can be very diverse and
        someone may have variation in her level of agency with respect to different aims (Alkire 2008). A
        woman may have significant say in decision making over what kinds of food to buy, but no control
        over the amount of income she is allocated by her husband out of their earnings.
        Consequently, the measure of agency used captures three different dimensions of rural women’s agen-
        cy related to agricultural and non-agricultural variables: (i) soft agency; (ii) non-agricultural agency;
        and (iii) agricultural agency. Each of these measurements is built using three components, as described
        in Table 2. A description of each variable is included in Appendix C, along with a brief explanation
        of the methodology used to construct the agency measurements (principal components score). This
        study also includes a broader agency index that combines all nine variables into a single index.
        One important part of the survey instrument was the deeper exploration of “soft agency.” Based
        on qualitative work, the survey questionnaire was developed with several modified psychosocial
        scales to measure women’s self-determination and self-esteem. This section included questions on
        women’s self-perception on specific qualities of agency in contrast to other women like her and her
        perception of cultural norms to contextualize what kinds of choice and behavior are perceived as
        possible in a community. This soft agency section serves to test some of the psychosocial scales in a
        new context amongst rural women and to test links between soft agency and other factors of agency,
        like decision making and access to endowments and economic opportunities.

Other Variables of Interest
Dependency ratio: The dependency ratio refers
to the ratio of the number of household members
under age 15 and over age 64 to the number of
working-age household members.
Food insecurity: Variable based on a standard set
of nine questions measuring household food inse-
curity (for an example of the questions, see:
http://www.unscn.org/layout/modules/resourc-
es/files/Household_food_insecurity_Sp.pdf, p. 6).
The scores range from 0 (least food insecurity) to
27 (most food insecurity).
Food diversity: Households were asked whether,
over the previous 24 hours, anyone in the house-
hold consumed vegetables, fruits, meat (beef, chick-
en, or pork), fish/seafood, eggs, and milk or milk
products. One point was given for each “yes” and
zero for “no,” such that this composite score ranges
from 0 to 6.
Time spent on agriculture: Number of hours
the respondent spends working in agriculture “on
an average working day.”
Time spent on other income-generating ac-
tivities: Number of hours the respondent spends
“on an average working day” on income-generat-
ing activities other than agriculture.
