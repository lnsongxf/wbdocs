I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Moldova perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Moldova
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Moldova
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From May to June 2016, 528 stakeholders of the WBG in Moldova were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 255 stakeholders participated in
the survey (48% response rate).

Some respondents received and completed the questionnaire online on an independent survey
platform, while others received and responded to the questionnaire via courier. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Moldova; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the
WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in Moldova; and the WBG’s communication and information
sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 80%, N=303). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Respondents who
belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of the
FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those of
the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 95).

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey were significantly less
        familiar with the WBG than respondents in the previous FY’13 Survey (weighted mean
        in FY’16 = 6.1; weighted mean in FY’13 = 6.6)1.
       Stakeholder difference: Respondents from the parliamentarian and the office of the
        President/Prime Minister/Minister were significantly more familiar with the WBG than
        respondents from other stakeholder groups.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Moldova, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Moldova, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Moldova, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Moldova. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at financial markets; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at energy.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Moldova, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at land administration;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at private sector development and foreign direct
               investment.

the following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Moldova? (Choose no more than TWO)

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 293  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 241

By weighting, FY 2013 and FY 2016 have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable.
The weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank
Group interacts with them in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past
aggregated annual global data. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

 less well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the
 following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Moldova?
 (Choose no more than TWO)
  1    Consistent economic growth
  2    More reliable social safety net
  3    Greater access to micro-finance for the poor
  4    Greater voice and participation for citizens to help ensure greater accountability
  5    Greater access to health and nutrition for citizens
  6    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., to start small and medium sized businesses)
  7    A growing middle class
  8    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
  9    Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas
  10   Better employment opportunities for young people
