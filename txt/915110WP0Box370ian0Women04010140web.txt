Foreword


Women are an important and powerful economic force. They make critical contributions as political leaders,
entrepreneurs and employees. Their contributions are even more valuable in the case of countries emerging
from conflict, where as a result of war, women make up the larger part of the population and where in order to
earn a living and sustain and provide for their families and communities they build businesses. However, women
in post-conflict economies face a number of challenges. Often their businesses stay at embryonic stages only,
due to three key limitations relating to: knowledge of business vision and management; access to finance and
markets; and access to role models and networks. Added to the complexity is the risk of having to start all over
again due to their countries’ political instability and the limited infrastructure to make their businesses prosper
and become more efficient over time.

After several years of civil war, Liberia has made good progress in building an environment suitable for women
entrepreneurs and political leaders. The election of H.E. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as the first female president in
Africa opened up economic opportunities for Liberian women. Additionally, a number of reforms have been
initiated to enable women to further partake in Liberia’s private sector development and economic growth.

The World Bank Group, including the World Bank Institute (WBI) and the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) Conflict Affected States for Africa (CASA), supported by their donor partners, Sweden, Denmark, and the
Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), has been working through different projects to further enhance
economic opportunities for women. These include helping the Liberian government revise relevant policies,
creating the Liberia Business Registry and working with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Ministry
of Gender and Development and Liberian women entrepreneurs to enhance women’s voice and visibility and
increase peer-to-peer learning.

The “Striving for Business Success: Voices of Liberian Women Entrepreneurs” report provides further insight on
the opportunities for women entrepreneurs to fully participate in the economic growth of Liberia. The women
interviewed for this report highlighted how obstacles, such as limited financial infrastructure, restricted access
to markets, and most importantly, insufficient networks to support women entrepreneurs, stifle efforts to create
sustainable solutions for women entrepreneurs. The report offers operational lessons and recommendations on
how to address these challenges and support women’s economic participation and empowerment.

We applaud the efforts of the Liberian women entrepreneurs featured in this report as well as the many others
who, although not highlighted here, are bringing their fair share to the growth of the Liberian economy. We
thank the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Gender and Development for their continued
focus on women’s empowerment as a means for overall growth in Liberia. We hope that this report will provide
opportunity for stronger initiatives from government, private sector and women-business owners to change the
face of women entrepreneurship in Liberia.

     This report was prepared under the World Bank project entitled “Lessons on Gender Inclusion in Fragile and
     Conflict-Affected States—Women’s Access to Rights, Resources and Voice.” It is the outcome of collaboration
     between the Government of Liberia (Ministry of Commerce and Industry—MoCI), the International Finance Cor-
     poration (IFC) and the World Bank Institute (WBI). It was prepared by Maria Elena Ruiz Aril (Consultant) under the
     supervision of A. Waafas Ofosu-Amaah (Task Team Leader). The task team consisted of Marième Esther Dassanou
     (IFC), Lwanzo Amani, Sanam Naraghi Anderlini, Dexter Merchant, and Haddas Wolde Giorgis (Consultants).

     The team conveys special thanks to the Minister of Commerce and his staff and the Ministry of Gender and
     Development, especially the Adolescent Girls’ Unit for their guidance, as well as to the UN Women Office
     in Liberia, especially Emily Stanger, who was instrumental in the identification of case study subjects. Most
     importantly, the team acknowledges the individual women entrepreneurs—especially the founding members of
     the Liberia Women Entrepreneurs Network (LIWEN)—for their willingness to share their stories.

     The team also gratefully acknowledges the following World Bank Group staff for their technical guidance and
     collaboration: Coleen Littlejohn (AFMLR); Frank Ajibola Ajillore (CAFW7); Kobina Egyir Daniel (CAFCA); Michael
     Nyumah Sahr (AFRSC); Shubha Chakrabaty (AFTPM); and Evariste Nduwayo (IFC SME Ventures Program). We
     thank the staff of the World Bank and IFC Country Offices in Liberia who provided valuable administrative,
     logistical, and production support, and we especially acknowledge the assistance of Esther Bryant, Collista Jean
     Harris, Yayea Kheahley, and Felton Yeayen.

Executive Summary


This report presents findings on the situation of women entrepreneurs in Liberia. It discusses the challenges
that female entrepreneurs face as well as enabling factors that they encounter when operating their businesses
in Liberia’s post-conflict environment. Through the voices and experiences of women—as in the IFC series
Voices of Women Entrepreneurs that inspires it—this report sheds some light on the specificities of women
doing business in fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS), such as those in Liberia. It identifies operational
lessons and proposes recommendations on how to support women entrepreneurs and contribute to their eco-
nomic empowerment in the transition from post-conflict to reconstruction and development.

WHO ARE LIBERIAN WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS?

Liberian women are dynamic entrepreneurs. They predominate among informal businesses in small-scale
retail and trade. Women in Liberia are much more likely than men to be self-employed (69 percent of women
compared to 56 percent of men).1 Almost a decade after the end of the conflict, 34 percent of Liberian women
manage a fairly significant share of registered small and medium enterprises (SMEs).2 However, the majority of
female entrepreneurs in Liberia continue to work informally and in low-productivity sectors, mainly in small retail
and trade (World Bank 2012a). Indeed, 75 percent of women, compared to 61 percent of men, worked informally
in Liberia in 2010.3 Among entrepreneurs, women are more likely than men to own completely informal enterprises
(60 percent of women, compared to 45 percent of men).4 Wholesale and retail trade, the second-most important
sector for overall employment in Liberia after agriculture, employs as much as 35 percent of the female workforce
(compared to just 15 percent of employed men).5 In 2006, the majority of women in greater Monrovia worked as
vendors and in petty trade (68 percent of the urban female labor force).6 Seven years later, although more women
have registered their businesses, a majority remains in the informal sector and in low-productivity sectors.

LIBERIAN WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS AND THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE

Despite substantial improvements in recent years, both men and women entrepreneurs encounter several
obstacles to doing business in Liberia. The investment climate is gradually improving in Liberia, which is
now ranked 149th (out of 185) by the Doing Business Report. This ranking is five positions higher than in the
previous year. However, women-owned businesses continue to be particularly vulnerable to investment climate
constraints, as they are overrepresented among small and informal businesses. Most of the women interviewed
mentioned corruption, taxes, and limited access to credit and skills as major obstacles to developing their
business activities. An example of how investment climate constraints hit women harder in Liberia is that of cor-
ruption, particularly in the form of gender-based violence. Sexual assault from government authorities in return
for official permits/transactions is a pervasive problem in certain sectors, such as cross-border trade (in Liberia
but also elsewhere in Africa). Gender-based violence imposes an additional tax on women-owned businesses,
increasing the cost of doing business.

     “My father’s determination to keep a Liberian-owned factory and to be competitive inspired me and I
     followed in his footsteps and took over the wood factory, a business seen as limited only to men.”
                                                          Fatu Addy, Liberia Woodwork Construction Company

     “I know that I got a head start in business because I not only got knowledge of business from my parents
     but inherited much of their property. One major challenge that many business people face is access to
     finance. Interest rates are too high and the time accorded for repayment is too short. This is preventing
     many Liberian businesses from growing.”

     “Customs and police officers at the border are out of control and there is no law to govern them. In the era
     of HIV/AIDS, raping innocent women who are trying to make ends meet is a death sentence.”

     “My advice for women that want to go into business is that they should be resilient and never tell themselves
     that they cannot achieve something. It is also important not to seek short cuts but take the time to come
     up with a well thought-out business strategy that analyses your cost, your anticipated earnings, and
     competition. Lastly, I advise women to carefully read the terms of the loans before they sign on, because
     there is nothing worse than starting your business off with a huge amount of debt.”
                                              Ade Jones-Captan, Groovies Entertainment Center & Restaurant

     “Women in business need to learn how to save when their business is successful to address future investment
     needs. Unfortunately, the few people who are able to take loans from banks use the money to buy fancy
     cars, gold, or other lavish goods, instead of using the money for their business, as was their initial intention.”
                   Maureen Shaw, Liberian Entrepreneur & Co-founder of the Liberian Business Association

     “Before, women were not respected. Now, since we are informed, we are having meetings with Immigration,
     Security Forces, Police, and Customs Officers. It makes us know our rights.”
                                                                            Rebecca Sumo, Liberian Entrepreneur

      Box 1. Portraits of Liberian Women Entrepreneurs

      While the phrase “Liberian women entrepreneurs” might at first call to mind Monrovian “market women,” this stereotype
      is quickly becoming outdated as more and more women launch competitive businesses on par with those of their
      male counterparts. Most of these businesses started “small small,” as their founders like to say, during or after the war,
      and overcame many hurdles to grow into strong enterprises with many employees. Some of the women entrepreneurs
      featured in this report ventured into woodworking and large-area farming—sectors predominantly occupied by men.
      Others began trading “small small” during the war and are now traveling to China and importing containers packed with
      merchandise worth thousands of dollars several times a year. This is how they do it. Liberian women travel to China in
      groups of 10 or 12. Before embarking on the trip, they do a thorough market assessment of what customers in Liberia
      and the surrounding countries like. A typical itinerary might take them through Ghana, Nairobi or Ethiopia, and Bangkok;
      then it’s on to Guangzhou. To save on costs while abroad, they share accommodation. Once in China, they go to the
      market and present Chinese suppliers with their own designs, samples, and specimens, which will be used to produce
      the merchandise. For example, T-shirts with catchy phrases such as “chop my money,” “marry me,” or “my money is my
      money” are very popular back home. Usually, the merchandise is produced in a matter of days, and after that it is time
      to go back home, back to business.

                                                          and have a greater influence on decisions that impact the private sector.
                                                          “Liberian women need to be proactive in their advocacy to ensure equal
                                                          participation in government and in the private sector.” If there were more
      female lawmakers, women would play a greater role in pushing for constitutional reforms, especially on issues related to
      land, labor/skills, access to finance, as well as increased opportunities for women entrepreneurs and their ability to access
      contracts. This is even more relevant for women farmers, who often work on the land but do not own it.

      Making it easier for women to trade across the border. Women are prominent actors in informal cross-border
      trade across Africa. The case studies in this report trace the journey of two Liberian women who started out trading in
      neighboring countries but are today bringing over thousands of dollars worth of goods from China to Liberia. Over the
      past few years, the Liberian government has adopted a series of reforms to improve cross-border trade. In 2009, the
      government reduced the fees required for customs clearance and port and terminal handling of goods. In 2010, the
      government created a one-stop shop that brought together various ministries and agencies, thus streamlining export and
      import processes. In 2012, the government adopted an online submission system for customs forms and has enhanced
      risk-based inspections. Women interviewed acknowledge that “the time it takes to clear a shipment from customs has
      also improved ever since the government introduced a one-stop shop at the port.”

      Promoting collateral flexibility for loans. In Liberia, as in many countries, women are less likely to own property or
      assets that could qualify for collateral. This automatically limits the ability of women-owned SMEs to access finance
      through commercial banks. In 2012, a new commercial code broadened the selection of assets that can be used for
      collateral. This is expected to have a positive impact on female borrowers.

      Creating and promoting the use of a credit bureau. Research has shown that women are better payers and depositors
      than men. By developing a credit bureau and encouraging institutions to use it, not only will it positively impact the credit
      culture but it can also benefit women as their higher repayment behavior will favorably add to the bankers’ decisions on
      approving their requests for loans.

      Women’s Desk at the Registration Bureau. The Liberia Business Registration Bureau opened a Women’s Desk in 2013.
      Staffed by one female official, the desk provides information and assistance to women entrepreneurs in the process of
      formalizing their businesses.

      Box 4. Gender-based violence (GBV), an extra tax for women-owned businesses in Liberia


      GBV imposes a high toll on Liberian women entrepreneurs, directly impacting their ability to do business. The use of
      sexual violence from government authorities in return for official permits/transactions is a serious form of corruption and
      abuse reported by women. This is a pervasive problem in certain sectors, such as cross-border trade in Liberia, but also
      in other places in Africa, as reported by UN agencies (UN Women 2011).

      In Liberia, as in many other FCS, impunity for gender-based violence offenses as a result of a weakened rule of law has a
      clear impact on women’s business in the form of an extra tax—and an expensive one for that matter, as the testimonies
      below show:

      “Customs and police officers at the border are out of control and there is no law to govern them. In the era of HIV/AIDS,

      “Knowledge and skills are major roadblocks for Liberian women entrepreneurs. Their lack of business and financial
      management knowledge hampers their ability to run strong and profitable companies and compete with male-owned
      enterprises.”
      Eyvonne Bright-Harding, owner and CEO of Sharks Entertainment Inc., started her business during the heat of the
      Liberian civil unrest selling bags of water and food. “I had to find a clever way to survive, and food was the solution. Every
      part of the city was overtaken by the rebels and I knew they needed to eat, so if I could get them food and something to
      drink, I would be ok,” she says, remembering the very trying times Liberia has seen.

      Eyvonne’s real dream was to open an ice cream manufacturing plant. In 2000, with a small loan from LBDI, she had the
      opportunity to go to the US, where she purchased two homemade ice cream machines from Walmart, each costing
      $19.99 and taking her 45 minutes to make half a gallon of ice cream. Today, with a total of 25 employees, Sharks has three
      commercial machines that enable Eyvonne to make two and a half gallons in 30 minutes per machine. Also, as access
      to electricity is difficult in Liberia, Eyvonne saw an opportunity to offer an additional service to her clientele by selling
      prepaid electricity. As of June 2013, Sharks had over 13,000 clients from the prepaid electricity alone.

      “Knowledge has been the greatest asset for me,” says Eyvonne. “I went to school to become an accountant, but I will
      say this is not enough to claim to be an entrepreneur. As an ice cream manufacturer, I had to learn about everything,
      the different ingredients, flavors, etc. But I also had to learn about branding and marketing and how to position myself
      in the Liberian market, which is filled with imported ice cream brands. Of course, this is in addition to learning how to
      write my business plan and keep my finances in order.” Knowledge and skills are a major road block for Liberian women
      entrepreneurs. Their lack of business and financial management knowledge hampers their ability to run strong and
      profitable companies and compete with male-owned enterprises. When business training is made available, very few
      women attend, as they fear being absent from their activities for too long with no one to manage operations for them. It
      is therefore important to structure the training sessions around the women’s busy schedules, and make learning practical
      so that they can apply it right away in their businesses.

           also provides processing services to secondary carpenters and builders. Fatu’s opportunity to study abroad, during which
           she obtained a degree in Business Management, as well as her work experience in Ethiopia, Burundi, and Guinea, have

           “Among the many challenges we face as entrepreneurs, one of the major ones is access to finance. In an unstable
           environment, nobody wants to invest, let alone invest in the long term. Ours is a long-term business. Financing is critical
           to rebuilding the Liberian economy and developing the local private sector.” It is even more critical for Liberian women
           entrepreneurs who, although courageous and bold, may not have the knowledge or the collateral to approach banks to
           ask for a loan. And when they do, the requirements imposed by financial institutions—which have been burnt by a large
           number of people who have not repaid their loans—are so demanding and the interest rates are so high that it does not
           make sense to take the loan.

     Box 7. Secured Transactions and Collateral Registries: A Solution to Access to Finance for Women
     Entrepreneurs*


     Lack of access to finance is consistently cited by business owners as one of their most limiting constraints, and it
     disproportionately affects women. Most studies find that women are not more likely than men to be rejected for loans or
     be subject to higher interest rates. But women are less likely to apply for loans than men.

     Microfinance has made a major contribution to enhancing women’s access to credit. It is estimated that eight out of every
     10 microfinance clients are women. But the rigidities of microfinance can be limiting for women. By definition, amounts
     lent are small, interest rates tend to be higher than commercial bank rates, and lending periods are short. Lack of access
     to land title can be a major impediment for both men and women seeking finance in formal systems that are frequently
     highly collateralized. But the problem is likely to be significantly worse for women. Reforms to a country’s secured lending
     system to enhance the use of movable securities can have a significant impact on access to credit across the board.

     For example, in 1999, Romania undertook a package of measures, including legal reform, to make it easier for a wider
     range of movable assets to be used as collateral. Since then, more than 200,000 notices of security interests have been
     registered, the number of borrowers has increased threefold, and the volume of credit has grown by 50 percent. Following
     similar reform in the Slovak Republic in 2002, more than 70 percent of new loans to businesses are now backed by movable
     assets. Additionally, in Sri Lanka women commonly hold wealth by way of gold jewelry. This is accepted by formal banks as
     security for loans. Finally, in Tanzania, Sero Lease and Finance, a woman’s leasing and finance company, provides loans to
     women to purchase equipment for their businesses, using the equipment as security through leasing agreements.

     Women’s problems in accessing finance are compounded by a number of factors, including lack of a credit culture,
     lack of confidence, and lack of valid collateral.

                                                      and designer fashion. Today, she operates a guesthouse and restaurant, providing
                                                      catering services to conferences and employs 20 people. She also has a registered

                                                      she bid successfully on a US$125,000 contract to produce curtains for four
                                                      government buildings. Maureen’s next business venture is to open a Convention

                                                   For Maureen, business associations are critical to advocating for business
                                                   interests. She is a founding member of the Liberia Business Association (LIBA)
                                                   meeting for the past eight years, held every last Thursday of the month at 5 pm with
                                                   fellow business men and women. LIBA has been instrumental in voicing the interests
                                                   of businesses as part of the ongoing reform process in Liberia. The association has
                                                   also been very active in providing input about the investment code to the National
                                                   Investment Commission, as well as working with entrepreneurs to enhance their
                                                   ability to get financing. In the past, LIBA has acted as collateral for their members to
                                                   access loans. “Business Plans were a new concept then,” says Maureen. Therefore,
                                                   they established a loan committee that reviewed business plans and ensured the
           funding received was used for its intended purposes. The loans were repaid at 100 percent and the association was able
           to double the amount to be on-lent to SMEs. An association such as LIBA but devoted specifically to women would help in
           advancing the growth of women’s businesses in Liberia. “We are stronger together, and the LIBA model offers an example of
           how business associations can potentially help entrepreneurs in accessing key services, such as finance.”

                                      Rebecca was raised by an aunt who was a successful business woman. From her,
                                      Rebecca learned her first business skills. At the age of 16 and in 10th grade, she quit
                                      school and began selling goods in the market full time. By 2000, she had saved enough
                                      to open her first small shop. By 2006, her business was steadily growing. But in 2006, her
                                      shop was completely destroyed in a fire. She was able to restart. Rebecca concentrated
                                      on saving so that she could trade in China, where she now travels with other women
                                      several times a year to buy merchandise. Today she operates three shops, two in Bong
                                      County, and one in Monrovia, trading goods imported from neighboring countries
                                      (Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) or as far as China.

  Association originally started as a group of rural women, and with support from the Ministry of Gender and UN Women
  was formalized as a nationwide association that operates in all counties. One of the benefits of the association for their
  members is that women have learned about their rights. They know how to report violations and make complaints when
  custom officers misbehave. They have also learned that crossing the borders in a group and sometimes with men also
  provides protection. They work closely with and can report to the Ministry of Gender. But as one member says, there is
  still a lot of work to be done: “I know the laws in Liberia, but not the laws in Guinea. We need more information on the
  laws on the other side of the border.”

                        LIWEN was created in October 2012 by a group of 25 Liberian business women who felt there was
                        a need for a better environment for women entrepreneurs to maximize their potential and achieve
                        profitable and sustainable growth.

                       LIWEN’s mission is to develop a platform to empower women entrepreneurs to undertake business
                       initiatives, create a conducive environment in which they can be active and productive participants
                       of the Liberian private sector while giving them access to equal opportunities. The network
                       provides leadership and mentorship among its members and encourages non-members to follow
  suit. LIWEN also provides training, networking, and exposure to local, regional, and international opportunities.

  “Since we’ve launched LIWEN our members have learned tremendously from one another and partnered on projects.
  Together they have prepared for national events, which have given them great visibility and won contracts based on
  information shared within the group. We are starting small but our hope is to count all the serious women entrepreneurs
  of Liberia as members one day.” Adelaine Lavala – President, LIWEN.

     Economic Empowerment Project


     The Liberia Young Women and Adolescent Girls Economic Empowerment Project (EPAG) was launched in 2009 to
     provide 2,500 young Liberian women with livelihood and life skills training and facilitate their transition to productive
     work. Implemented by the Government of Liberia with financial support from the Nike Foundation and the Government
     of Denmark, and administered by the World Bank, the program consists of a six-month phase of classroom-based
     training, followed by a six-month mentoring and support phase in which the trainees are supported in their transition to
     self or wage employment. A mid-term impact evaluation of the project shows strong positive impacts on employment
     (which was boosted by 52 percent) and earnings (an increase of 115 percent for program participants) as well as various
     measures of self-confidence.

     Felemah, one of the program graduates, is now a security guard, after completing the EPAG security guard training.
     Her plan is to finance her way through university by working as a security guard, study criminal justice, and become the
     Chief of Police.

     Luisa, another EPAG graduate, has completed the painting course and is now a professional painter and small business
     woman with 14 other classmates. Her teams of painters use their mobile phones to organize business and go around to
     the many construction sites in Monrovia, marketing their services.

  Internships for girls and the trade-off between education and earning. Fatu Addy’s furniture company has tried
  to bring in young women as apprentices. However, according to her, it has been tough for both the company and the
  interns. From the interns’ side, the pressure from male co-workers on the factory floor and the perception by both
  men and women that carpentry is a male domain has discouraged some young women from applying for the job or
  staying the course. However, the owner explains that the main issue has been money. When the interns have families to
  support, they need higher-paying jobs. While the company provides a stipend, it does not commensurate to a full-time
  employment salary. These young girls have too many responsibilities at their age and are looking for quicker ways of
  making ends meet rather than going through an apprenticeship.
