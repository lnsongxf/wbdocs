eLearning Benin Project

Winner of the 2015 Youth Innovation Fund
The eLearning Benin Project is a winning project from the 2015 Youth Innovation Fund. The Youth Innovation Fund
provides young employees at the World Bank Group with an opportunity to design and implement projects
focusing on innovation, efficiency and impact on youth development in client countries.

These initiatives provide funding, technical assistance and knowledge exchange through partnerships with local
youth and organizations. Many of the outcomes of these projects have contributed to increased employability,
community engagement, and life skills.

The winning proposals receive funding and mentorship from senior World Bank Group officials.


Project Background

                            The higher education system in Benin is facing several challenges, including
                            insufficient infrastructure, equipment and financial resources, and over-
                            populated amphitheaters.

                            While the higher education system is facing these challenges, the Beninese
                            Government’s vision for the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector
                            is to transform Benin into the “digital capital of Africa,” taking advantage of the
                            country’s location and its access to international connectivity. Important reforms
have been implemented in the ICT sector through the e-Benin project, and complemented by an investment
in international connectivity through the West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Program
(WARCIP) project.

The vision of Benin as the “digital capital of Africa” reflects a growing need for Beninese university students
to be prepared to meet this challenge by developing the appropriate skillset to be competitive on the local,
regional and international job markets.

Since the end of 2011, the growth of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) has reshaped access to higher
education in the world, as well as the design of university courses. Some courses combine videos,
assessments, tutoring, corrections by peers, and online interaction with teachers, and can assemble up to
160,000 students across in the world. (Source: France Université Numérique)




                                                                                             eLearning | Benin    2
    Project Objectives
    The objective of the "eLearning Benin" project is to increase the awareness of teachers and students about
    the wealth of educational resources (e.g. MOOCs) available digitally --- educational resources through which
    Beninese students in higher education could improve and develop competitive skills in preparation for local
    and international labor markets.
    In this context, the project team held working sessions during the month of June 2015 with representatives
    from a number of public and private higher education institutions, and a one-day workshop during August
    2015, to discuss educational needs or gaps and identify the subjects and courses that could be enriched with
    MOOCs and other online educational resources.

    Our steps were organized as follows:




                          1 - Focus Groups
                          •Gather a selected group of local professors and students to identify subject areas
                           through which students would hone and develop competitive skills to prepare
                           them for local and international job markets.




                                2 - Analysis and Investigation
                                •With the input of local instructors and students, identify education materials
                                 from freely available Massively Open Online Courses (MOOC) and curriculum
                                 that meet these needs.




                          3 - Synthesis Workshop to share solutions
                          •Online: a repository to host or link to key resources & MOOCs platforms
                          •Off-line: a sustainable solution to make digital education resources available without
                           internet.

Desired Outcomes:
We hope the project participants become ambassadors of e-learning within their communities.

   •   Professors: we ask professors to (1) leverage the platforms they have learned about to augment their
       courses/curricula with free online resources during the academic year, and (2) share this knowledge
       within their educational institution, and across their region.

   •   Students: we ask students to (1) leverage resources that they have learned about to supplement their
       education during the academic year, and (2) to share this knowledge with fellow students, and other
       professors within and outside of their educational institution.

   •   Ministry Representatives: We ask the ministries to (1) support the spread of e-learning as an
       educational method throughout the country, (2) support professors wanting to augment educational
       curricula with e-learning resources, and (3) help in mobilizing financial and logistical resources to
       increase MOOCs/e-learning awareness nationally.




What is a MOOC ?
MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), which emerged in 2008, are online distance learning courses open to
everyone at all educational levels.

   •   “Massive” speaks to the quantity of participants, which is typically in the range of tens of thousands
       of students per course.
   •   “Open” refers to who can join, which is anyone with high-speed Internet access.
   •   “Online” is the platform of the course: all course content and interactions take place via the
       Internet.
   •   “Course” designates that the information presented is topical in nature, similar to a standard
       college course, such as basic computer programming or introductory physics.
