Recent Economic Developments and Prospects


Global Outlook
The recovery in global activity anticipated in the April MENA Economic Monitor is on track. The
global economy is projected to grow by 2.9 percent over the next two years, up from 2.4 percent
in 2016 (Figure 1.1). The uptick in global growth reflects strong domestic demand, improved
industrial production, and increased exports in almost all countries (Figure 1.1, right panel). The
recovery is led by a pickup in growth in advanced economies including the United States, the Euro
Area, and Japan. Growth in East Asia and Pacific, Eastern Europe and Central Asia remains robust.
Economic activity in commodity-exporting developing countries is accelerating, contributing to
the global recovery.

After years of slow growth, economic activity in oil exporters is starting to improve because the
oil market has reached some stability, although at low prices. Russia, Nigeria and Brazil are
expected to emerge from recession and growth could turn positive in 2017 and beyond. In oil-
importing countries, economic activity points to solid momentum. In low income countries
growth is expected to rebound in 2017 by 1 percentage point, projected at 5.4 percent, compared
to the last year. The rebound is due primarily to rising metals prices, which raised production in
metals exporters, and infrastructure investment in others.

Risks to the outlook still tilt to the downside. Increased policy uncertainty; an increase in volatility
in commodity prices, especially in the oil market; and weaker growth potential over the long term
could cloud the prospects for a growth rebound. While inflation remains low, as actual growth
continues to exceed potential growth, increasing inflation and closing output gaps could lead to
the prospects of less accommodative monetary policy, which could dampen global growth going
forward. Over the long run, reforms to boost potential output are important.

Developments in the Oil Market
Oil prices have stayed within the $48 to $55 per barrel range since mid-2016 due to the ongoing
market imbalances, mainly from the supply side (Figure 1.2). Rising U.S. shale oil production,
reaching its highest level in two years, has offset some of the impacts of the production cuts
among OPEC members and their allies. Moreover, the overall compliance with production cuts
within OPEC is estimated at 75 percent. Among OPEC members, Libya, Angola, and Nigeria
increased output by an estimated 350,000 barrels per day only in August. As a result, the
inventory buildup peaked at approximately 4.6 million barrels of crude oil during the same
period, higher than the 4 million barrels forecasted by the International Energy Agency (IEA). As
predicted in the MENA Quarterly Economic Brief, the stagnation in oil prices is expected to
continue into 2020 (Devarajan and Mottaghi 2016a).

Several factors will contribute to keep oil prices low for longer, including the oil production
growth in the U.S.; the weakening impact of OPEC and non-OPEC cuts; and the rise of electric
vehicles, specifically in China (Petroleum Monitor 2017).

Going forward, rebalancing in the oil market is expected to be delayed. Estimates by the
International Energy Agency (IEA) show that the global demand for oil will continue to grow at a
slower pace than the global supply, at least until the end of the decade. Non-OPEC output is
expected to double to reach 1.4 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2018 from the previous year.
Due to cost efficiency measures, an increasing number of oil projects world-wide could break
even at $30 per barrel and lower. This lower price could significantly increase oil production
beyond the U.S. (that is, in Canada and Brazil). These last two likely would add to the already high
oil inventory and, in the absence of a pickup in demand, could hold oil prices down for longer.
Uncertainty about compliance among some OPEC members including Iran, Iraq, Libya, and
Nigeria is a challenge facing OPEC in battling the excess supply. There are speculations that the
OPEC cut of approximately 1.2 million barrels a day will be extended until March 2018. It remains
to be seen how the extended cut and the excess supply will affect the sentiment in the oil market.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook for MENA
The pickup in economic activity in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region that started
in mid-2016 is expected to moderate in 2017 due to slower growth in MENA’s oil exporters. Oil
production cuts will weigh down growth in almost all countries in the subgroup. Growth
prospects for the MENA region is projected to improve in 2018 and 2019 with growth exceeding
3 percent. Both MENA’s oil exporters and oil importers will benefit from a steady improvement
in the global growth; increased trade with Europe and Asia; more stabilized commodity markets,
especially oil; and reforms undertaken in some of the countries in the region (Figure 1.3).
Nevertheless, MENA’s overall growth levels are half of what they were before the 2011 Arab
Spring, making it difficult to address the youth unemployment problem and the needs of massive
numbers of people who are displaced across the region as conflicts continue. Fiscal and current
account balances are expected to improve over the projection period ending in 2019, resulting
from both fiscal consolidation efforts and some stability in the commodity markets, including oil.

Growth outlook in MENA’s oil exporters is expected to improve in 2018 and 19, as governments
are slowly adapting to the “new normal” of low oil prices. To counter the impact of falling oil
prices, most of the governments have adopted new revenue measures and spending cuts. These
measures range from increases in corporate income tax in Bahrain and Oman, and introduction
of value-added tax (VAT) in 2018 in all Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, to spending cuts
that include reducing fuel, water, and electricity subsidies elsewhere in the region (Figure 1.3,
bottom left panel).

After a contraction in 2015, a growth recovery is projected for the group of developing oil
exporters in the short term. Growth prospects in the subgroup is contingent on recovery in the
oil sector while non oil sector activity is expected to remain subdued. Iran and Algeria showed a
strong recovery in the oil sector in 2016 and early 2017. Economic growth in Libya is expected

to increase significantly in 2017 and continue through 2018 and 2019 due to the resumption of
oil production. However, oil production still remains below potential due to violent conflict. The
war on ISIS and low oil prices are expected to weigh on the Iraqi economy in 2017, but growth
will accelerate in the following years. After a grinding three-year recession, growth is expected
to rebound in Yemen in 2018 and 2019. Economic outlook in 2018 and beyond will depend on
whether an end to the on-going conflict will allow for rebuilding the Yemeni’s economy.

Growth in the GCC subregion is expected to remain low in 2017, at below 1 percent. Among the
GCC countries, UAE is more diversified and has a large fiscal buffer that helps withstand sustained
low oil prices. Qatar is feeling the brunt of political turmoil with neighboring countries, and its
growth projections for 2017 are revised downward to 2 percent.

projected to improve over the projection period ending in 2019, ranging from 3.5 percent in
Kuwait to 2.1 percent in Saudi Arabia in 2019. The overall growth in GCC countries for 2019 is
projected at 2.7 percent, below the levels seen prior to the 2014 oil price shock. The average
growth rate prior to 2011 for the GCC countries was around 4.5 percent.

In Saudi Arabia, low oil prices, coupled with reduced oil output resulting from the OPEC oil
production cuts, are keeping investment subdued and harming private consumption. Although
the fiscal grip was relaxed to some extent this year, the overall stance remains tight, with public
employees’ salaries still frozen and several infrastructure projects postponed. Financial
challenges have exhausted Saudi Arabia’s foreign reserves, which hit a 6-year low in July 2017
(Figure 1.3, bottom right panel). Lower-than-expected oil prices, limited crude production, and
widespread geopolitical risks will lead the economy to slow down this year. The World Bank
expects Saudi growth to fall to 0.3 percent in 2017, before rising to 2 percent in 2019, which is
down 1.4 percentage points from last year.

Challenges remain, particularly in debt issuance volumes across GCC counties. Moody estimates
the debt-to-GDP ratio across the GCC will rise from 10.5 percent in 2014 to 31.6 percent by 2018,
adding another $154 billion in government debt in 2017 and 2018. Bahrain and Qatar likely will
continue to rely solely on market funding whereas Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and UAE will issue
debt and make use of government reserves. Bahrain and Saudi Arabia will record the largest
increase in debt between 2016 and 2018, with the government-debt-to-GDP ratio rising by
around 14 percentage points. For Kuwait and Oman, Moody expects lower debt increases of 8 to
9 percentage points of GDP. On the other hand, the debt burdens of Qatar and UAE, having pre-
financed part of their 2017 deficits, are expected to stabilize in 2017 and decline in 2018.

Among oil importers, Egypt’s economy is projected to perform better going forward with growth
expected to accelerate to 5.3 percent in 2019. This growth is due mostly to liberalization in the
exchange rate market and recovery in merchandise exports and tourism. Of the remaining
economies in the subregion, Morocco likely will grow faster in 2017 than in 2016 due to a strong
rebound in the agricultural output. However, the rebound is unlikely to sustain because the
economy is prone to drought. The protracted Syrian conflict remains an impediment to the return
to potential growth in Lebanon and Jordan. For the fifth year, Lebanon remains the largest host
(on a per capita basis) for displaced Syrians. This influx has significantly strained already weak
public finances.

The short-term prospects of improvement in MENA’s economic activity are contingent on many
factors. First, rising global risks aversion and geopolitical uncertainty arising from protracted
conflicts in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen can impact the overall performance of both oil exporters
and oil importers. Second, the region is dealing with massive numbers of refugees and internally

displaced persons (IDPs). This influx brings development challenges and impacts the economic
performance not only of the countries of origin but also of the neighboring host countries.

Economics of MENA: A Longer Term View
Economic performance in the MENA region has stayed below potential for at least 40 years.
There were periods of sharp growth followed by sharp falls, but growth was never sustained.
Historical data show that most of the output growth in the region occurred during boom years
and because of increases in oil production: the region grows by oil and slows by oil.
Approximately two-thirds of the countries in the region are oil exporters and, over the past five
decades, have benefitted immensely from several episodes of oil price shocks. The positive
spillovers of the boom years also have benefitted oil importers who are recipients of foreign
direct investment (FDI), remittances, and tourism. Nevertheless, the volatile pattern of long-term
growth in the region reveals that MENA countries initiate growth but fail to sustain. This pattern
is clearly seen in the high volatility of growth across the region (Devarajan and Mottaghi 2016b).
Among countries, volatility of real GDP growth in oil exporters has been twice that of the oil-
importing economies. A major consequence of the volatile growth is the region’s high youth
unemployment rate of 30 percent: the highest rate in the developing world. The rate for females
is even higher, standing at around 50 percent in some MENA countries.

To address these long-standing challenges, in the short run, MENA countries need to grow faster
to enable them to create more jobs for the youth bulge. However, in the long run, it is necessary
to for these countries to increase their potential output. To boost the growth potential in MENA
countries, the right mix of policies is needed. Although policies may differ by country, the need
for reforms is urgent, particularly to diversify away from oil in oil exporters, thus strengthening
the business climate to unleash the potential of the private sector (Devarajan and Mottaghi
2017). Reforming the business climate and making it more competitive through enforcing
competition policies and reducing the power of monopolies is very important.

Rationalizing fiscal policies by replacing untargeted and wasteful energy subsidies with targeted
cash transfers is equally important. A related challenge holding back growth is the low female
labor force participation rate. In this vein, promoting the formal private sector is important.
Equally important is the need to reform the education system and skills training programs. These
programs can improve the education system by making teachers more accountable to students
and their parents; and by better adapting the curriculum to the modern world. Even in the short
run, such reforms could start producing positive effects on the macroeconomic indicators,
particularly on employment and output, thereby increasing potential output in the long run.

Conversely, crises and conflicts could permanently reduce the supply side capacity (losses in
output and employment) that could weigh on the potential output over the medium and long

terms. Studies show that there is a strong likelihood of a large negative impact of prolonged crisis
on potential output in the short run, followed by a prolonged period of slow growth as economies
adjust to their post-crisis growth paths. A "permanent level loss" in potential output means that
the economy eventually would return to its pre-crisis potential growth rate but would fail to
recoup all of the lost output. The total effect depends on an assessment of the various channels
through which the crisis could impact labor market developments, investment, and productivity.

MENA is among the most conflicts affected regions in the world and the Syrian refugee crisis is
among the worst such crisis since World War II. The protracted stay of refugees in hosting
communities, now in its sixth year, not only has increased the risk to MENA’s economic outlook
but also has brought refugees’ long-term development challenges to the forefront. Meeting
these enormous challenges requires collective efforts, which are the subject of the next chapter.

                                Refugee Crisis in MENA
                 Meeting the Development Challenge


Introduction
The current refugee crisis in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) stands out for many
reasons. First, Syrians account for the bulk of the refugees and displaced people regionwide,
followed by Iraq, Libya, and Yemen, in which conflicts are ongoing. Second, the Syrian conflict
has seen exponential growth of refugees during 2012 to 2016. In July 2012, 100,000 Syrians were
registered refugees. This number increased 15-fold in 1 year, and that new number quadrupled
by the end of 2016 to reach 5.4 million. There are estimates that the number of unregistered
refugees in MENA could be as many as those registered.1 Third, and most important, more than
75 percent of the refugees hosted in MENA are concentrated in only 2 countries: Lebanon and
Jordan.2 In 2016, Lebanon ranked among the top 10 hosting countries worldwide in per capita
numbers (UNHCR 2017). The remaining top hosting countries were in Africa.

The massive scale of the inflows of refugees has brought increasing social and economic burdens
to hosting communities, exacerbating their pre-existing development challenges while leaving
refugees with uncertain futures. In the past, refugees’ welfare was viewed primarily as a
humanitarian, rather than a development, issue on the assumption that once the conflict
stabilized and emergency needs were met, longer term solutions would be addressed after
returnees reached their homelands. However, the protracted refugee crisis3 in MENA has
brought development challenges to the forefront. Specifically, refugees face four interlinked

  This may result from differences between country’s official statistics and the UNHCR statistics due to the fact that
"the UNHCR calculates the number of those registered with it as refugees, while Jordan, for example, classifies a
refugee as any person who enters its territory from the nationalities that cannot return to their countries for any
reasons.
2
  Civil war in Syria has displaced 50 percent of the population, 33 percent of them outside the country. The conflict
in Yemen has touched every aspect of Yemenis’ lives. Violence in Libya has displaced 10 percent of its 6 million
people internally, and approximately 125,000 externally, particularly to Europe because of its proximity. The 2011
Arab uprising caused some movements between and within other states, but for short periods. For example, before
the Arab uprising, approximately 2 million Libyans had left their countries, most moving to Chad, Egypt, Italy, and
Tunisia. While official data are not available, after the fall of Gaddafi, many Libyan refugees were encouraged to
repatriate.
3
  Defined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) refugees can be regarded as being in a
protracted situation when they have lived in exile for more than five years, and when they still have no immediate
prospect of finding a durable solution to their plight by means of voluntary repatriation, local integration, or
resettlement.

crises: limited or no access to, and poor quality of, education, health care, jobs, and livelihoods.
If not addressed, these four interlinked crises continue to fuel long-term problems.4 Targeting
these challenges not only helps hosting communities deal with their development challenges but
also prepare refugees for the time that they can return to their homelands.

This chapter provides a perspective on the long-term development challenges faced by refugees
in MENA which are (1) basic health services, (2) education needs, (3) jobs and accommodation of
refugees in local labor markets, and (4) civil, social, and economic rights including freedom of
movement. The chapter further lays out specific development policy responses to tackle these
challenges.

Specifically, we address three fundamental questions:

    1. Why is the welfare of refugee a development challenge?
    2. What are the development challenges and how should they be tackled?
    3. How can the development community do better?

While the details will be country specific, this chapter suggests enhancing an early transition from
humanitarian aid to development assistance. For example, at the time of crisis, Sierra Leone
received more support in the form of development aid than did Liberia, giving Sierra Leone more
predictable support for education. The transition cannot happen without reliable statistics, which
are lacking globally, particularly in some hosting countries. There is an urgent need for more data
and an integrated monitoring system, for both registered and unregistered refugees.5 In this vein,
creating specific development indicators for refugees and their children and integrating these
indicators in the global development indicators could help immensely to monitor refugees’
welfare. At the country level, an improved data system is even more important. It would improve
understanding of the micro-implications of the refugee crisis, especially poverty measurement.

Equally important is the need for refugee-specific policies focusing on empowering women
refugees, increasing mobility, and developing their skills. The longer refugees are unemployed,
their chances of finding a job diminishes because they become deskilled and they find themselves
dependent on the country’s resources.




4
  There is evidence that malnutrition contributes to a longer-term development problem, especially in education.
The effect on refugees’ children is larger because they have experienced violence and trauma and interrupted
education. These experiences damage children’s cognitive functioning, thus affecting their educational performance
throughout adolescence and into adulthood. Studies have shown that the cognitive damage to children from
receiving no education lowers their school performance and cuts their future earnings by an average of 22 percent.
5
  For example, the Jordanian government estimates that the total Syrian population in Jordan is close to 1.3 million,
compared to the approximately 680,000 Syrians in Jordan who have been registered by the UNHCR.

Why Is the Welfare of Refugees a Development Challenge?
Welfare of Refugees as a Global Public Good

The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, itself based on the 1948 Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, requires any signatory country to protect refugees who are on their
territory. Initially designed to accommodate European refugees after World War II, the
Convention has been reinterpreted in light of the dramatically different patterns of refugee
movements since 1951. Large numbers of refugees have arrived in relatively small and
economically vulnerable countries (including Lebanon and Jordan) only because of their
proximity to the conflict countries of Somalia and Syria. Drawing on the preamble to the 1951
Convention, which emphasizes international cooperation, scholars have identified two
obligations with respect to refugees: (1) asylum, which is the responsibility of the state that hosts
the refugee; and (2) burden-sharing, which reflects the obligation of other states toward those
countries in which refugees have settled (Betts 2015).

The burden-sharing obligation is a clear statement that the welfare of refugees has all the
characteristics of a global public good. It is both non-rival and non-excludable: If one country
contributes to a refugee’s welfare, it does not diminish another country’s satisfaction in seeing
that refugee better off. However, precisely for this reason, as with all public goods, there is the
problem of “free-riding.” Since the benefit to the refugee (and hence to everyone else) is a
function of the sum of every one’s contribution, but the cost is borne by the individual country,
there is an incentive for each country to cut its contribution and let others pay. If every country
does this, there is no benefit to the refugee and hence no public good. This is the reason that the
international community has tried to develop cooperative agreements to ensure collectively they
contribute towards the common goal.

These cooperative agreements have incorporated other insights from the economics of global
public goods. First, since smaller states always will have an incentive to free-ride on larger states
(Olson and Zeckhauser 1966), the agreements have concentrated on the larger, richer countries.
For instance, the two largest contributors to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) are
the United States and the European Union. Second, the welfare of refugees is not a pure public
good because it combines two types of goods: (1) a purely altruistic good, whereby the donor
feels a moral obligation to help the refugee; and (2) a “security public good” (Betts 2003),
whereby the donor is concerned that the presence of refugees may be a security threat, either
in the host country or even in the donor’s country. The latter comes closer to a private good (in
that it is excludable). Inasmuch as these two goods are jointly produced (Betts 2003), it is possible
that the presence of the security good leads to less free-riding in the financing of refugees.

Supporting Livelihoods for Refugees

The impact of refugees on communities and countries will vary depending on the initial
conditions in the labor market, access to resources, demographics, the national and local labor
laws, and the policy responses of hosting governments. Globally, most refugees are concentrated
in some of the poorest, most fragile countries. The refugees’ demands on these countries’
strained economies, inadequate public services and infrastructure, and scarce jobs further distort
their markets, and often dramatically affect local populations. If not met with increased supply,
refugees’ increased demands for food and services often increase inflationary pressures that
adversely affect the livelihoods of the poor.

Studies have shown that the inflow of refugees to a nearby country adversely affects the income
per capita growth of the latter. Murdoch and Sandler (2004) argue that the negative spillovers of
conflict are anticipated to be greater in countries close to many civil wars. Easterly and Levine
(1998) show that, due to regional economic integration and regional multiplier effects, the
spillovers will push beyond close neighbors. The spillovers can cause negative economic
consequences through reduced trade, low investment, and increased capital flights.

Borjas and Monras (2016) find that refugee supply shocks can adversely affect local, low-skilled
workers, but this supply also can provide a positive complementary effect. Refugees take on low-
skilled jobs that native workers spurn, enabling locals to find better paying jobs. Foged and Peri
(2015) find positive effects on employment and wages of native workers with similar skills. The
influx of refugees prompted less educated native workers to change occupations. The less
educated native workers experienced either positive or insignificant wage and employment
effects, which persisted in the long run. Quantitatively, a 1 percentage point increase in the share
of low-skilled native workers, including refugees, increased wages for low-skilled native workers
by 1.0 percent to 1.8 percent.

Due to the lack of data and an effective monitoring system (see section on Data and Monitoring),
the net economic effect of refugee influx on the local economies is still a source of controversy.
Given the protracted nature of conflicts worldwide, particularly in MENA, and the fact that
refugees are unable to return to their countries of origin in the foreseeable future due to conflict,
the international community and policy-makers need to focus on refugees’ development
challenges.6 These include facilitating the participation of refugees in the labor market by

6
  The idea of providing targeted development assistance to support durable solutions for refugees is not new.
According to the WDR 2011, UNHCR had promoted the concept of “Refugee Aid and Development,” which was
applied in both the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa (ICARA) in 1981 and 1984; and the
International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Central America (CIREFCA) in 1989. In 1999 the issue again
was taken up through the “Brookings process,” which set out to define a new way to address relief to the
development transition of forced displacement. In 2003 the approach was revived as part of the Framework for

investing in skills through strengthening childhood7 and adult education and vocational training.
Refugees’ chances of finding jobs diminish the longer they are unemployed in their hosting
countries because they become deskilled. The economics literature has found strong links
between education and human capital, and between human capital and long-term growth and
productivity (Griliches 1996). These links could justify the international community’s and policy-
makers’ extending quality education and job skills training t o registered and unregistered
children and adult refugees, regardless of gender or nationality.


What Are the Development Challenges and How Should They Be Tackled?

Four Interlinked Crises and Four Sets of Policy Responses

I.     Education

Two MENA countries host the largest number of refugees per capita: Lebanon and Jordan with
ratios of refugees-to-host-population in the former exceeding 1:4. Most of these refugees are
children under the age of 18. In Jordan, approximately 51 percent of Syrian refugees are children;
in Lebanon, the percentage goes up to 55 percent.8 The cost of not educating refugee children is
high in loss of human capital for regional economic development; and for the long-term
processes of peace, stability, and reconstruction. Because these refugee children need education
services, significant strains are put on the education sector of the hosting countries. These
countries are forced to expand service provision to refugees while maintaining education quality
for both the hosting and refugee communities. Thus, the education systems of hosting countries
will need to be strengthened because these systems will be catering to a larger number of
students, many of whom require additional academic and psychosocial support due to forced
displacement. Financing for the sector also will need to be increased.

When enrolling in schools in hosting countries, refugee children face a pedagogic and
psychosocial challenges. On the pedagogic side, when the language of instruction is different
from the native languages of the refugees or the languages of instruction in their home countries,
the language of the hosting country can impede the academic success of refugee students. Syrian


Durable Solutions for Refugees and Persons of Concern. The framework comprised the three tools of (a) Development
Assistance for Refugees (DAR); (b) the 4Rs of Repatriation, Reintegration, Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction; and (c)
Development through Local Integration (DLI). UNHCR’s DAR initiative was driven by the necessity to address the
long-term economic and social impacts of displacement on hosting communities. The 4Rs initiative was based on
the understanding that, in post-conflict situations, the development needs of refugees and returnees have not been
incorporated systematically in transition and recovery plans by the hosting governments, the donor community, and
the UN.

refugees in Turkey and the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI) as well as Ethiopian and Somali refugees
who migrated to Yemen all face this challenge. Even in an Arabic-speaking country such as
Lebanon, schools use French or English as a language of instruction for mathematics and science
classes. Many Syrian refugees face serious challenges in understanding subjects taught in these
languages (UNHCR 2015). In many cases, the Lebanese Ministry of Education and Higher
Education (MEHE) instructed teachers to use Arabic for instruction in second-shift classrooms.
This remedy cannot be fully effective so long as the national textbooks used for instruction
remain in a language foreign to the refugee students (Shuayb and others 2014).

On the socioemotional side, schools are settings in which children affected by displacement
manifest symptoms of trauma and shock. However, schools also can provide the psychosocial
support that children need. Indeed, evidence shows that school-based psychosocial programs
improved children’s well-being in Bosnia (Layne and others 2008), Uganda (Ager and others
2011), and the United States (Han and Weiss 2005). Teacher-led interventions also have been
effective in a variety of contexts in Croatia, Kosovo, Lebanon, and Turkey.

For hosting countries that integrate refugee children in their formal education systems,
overcrowding is a common challenge. Overcrowding can impede students’ learning, particularly
when teachers have not been trained to manage large classrooms. Overcrowding is exacerbated
by the fact that refugees often migrate to some of the most vulnerable localities, which have pre-
existing challenges in delivering education services. As an example, in Lebanon, more than 50
percent of Syrian refugees live in the 50 most vulnerable localities. Furthermore, the 251 most
vulnerable localities in Lebanon host 87 percent of the country’s Syrian refugees as well as 67
percent of the extremely poor Lebanese (Figure 2.1).9 This population distribution greatly
exacerbates the difficulty of providing quality education services to both refugees and vulnerable
hosting communities.

A development response

An effective strategy to expand access to education services to refugees should address both the
demand-side barriers and the supply-side constraints to education. Different countries in
different contexts have employed various models to provide refugee education. The United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) operates the longest standing
system for providing education services in MENA. This model is external to the hosting country’s
education system and is funded by donors. Over more than 60 years, UNRWA has educated 4
million children in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank and Gaza (Cahill 2010). Today,
approximately 500,000 children are studying in 689 UNRWA schools. In Gaza, almost 90 percent
of the school-age refugee population attends UNRWA schools.

Hosting countries could decide to provide nonformal education opportunities to help raise
learning outcomes for refugee children. Nonformal education can facilitate the transition of
school children into formal education. In Lebanon, the Ministry of Education and Higher
Education (MEHE) is running an Accelerated Learning Program (ALP), which enables out-of-school
children to cover in a short period the curricula of the grades that they have missed so that they
can enroll in formal education at the most age-appropriate grades. MEHE also regulates a series
of nonformal education programs delivered by NGOs for early childhood education and for basic
literacy and numeracy.10 In Jordan, UNICEF is running nonformal education centers, which
provide learning and psychosocial support to refugee children.11 In 2015–16, these centers

hosted 66,000 children (28 percent of Jordan’s school-age refugees), many of whom were
enrolled simultaneously in the formal education system.

Expanding formal education services to refugees has had different levels of success depending
on the hosting country and the context. Early childhood education (ECE) and secondary education
tend to have the lowest enrollment rates. However, these two education stages are critical to
develop the region’s human resources. In Jordan, 125,000 Syrian refugees were enrolled in
formal education represents 54 percent of total registered refugees. In Lebanon, the public
education student population almost doubled and enrolls 51 percent of its Syrian refugee
students in public formal education.12 In 2017, in Lebanon’s first-shift schools, the number of
Syrian refugees (68,822 students) exceeds 25 percent of total students. In addition, the country
has opened 313 second-shift schools, which are operating solely for Syrian students (more than
120,000).13 This remarkable increase of refugee students was coupled with a slight decrease in
Lebanese enrollment in public schools at the onset of the crisis due to the influx of refugees and
the consequent loss of confidence in the quality of public education (Figure 2.2). However, after
three years of enrollment fee subsidies to Lebanese students, this loss was recouped.

with education opportunities. More than 80 percent of these children were reached through
formal education, and the rest through nonformal pathways.

Addressing the demand-side barriers that prevent refugee parents from sending their children to
schools is equally important. One of the main barriers is the necessity for refugee children to
work to support their families. This barrier is more common for children in Grade 7 and above.
Early marriages for girls also are common in some refugee communities. To incentivize
enrollment, associated costs of attending schools need to be reduced or eliminated. These costs
include transportation, textbooks and learning materials, and enrollment fees, which, for
example, were waived in Jordan, and covered by the Ministry of Education on behalf of parents
in Lebanon. In contrast, conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs could help the households with
the cost of children enrolled in schools. In Lebanon, in 2016 the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) piloted a cash transfer program in two governorates. The pilots had very positive
results. The agency measured an increase of 7 percent in enrollment rates in the pilot regions
and an increase of 1 month in school attendance for students who participated in the program
(WFP and others 2017).

II.   Health

Before the start of the Syrian conflict, Syria’s neighbors had enjoyed a decade of steadily
improving health outcomes. From 2000 to 2010, life expectancy in Jordan and Lebanon rose
(from 71.9 years to 73.4 years, and 74.9 years to 78.5 years, respectively) and continued to
outstrip the MENA regional average (69.2 years to 71.4 years). Other basic health indicators such
as maternal and infant mortality rates improved as well, and both countries met the UN
Millennium Development Goals for maternal and child health.

These improvements came despite quite different economic and political contexts affecting
health spending. Jordan, which enjoyed relatively steady economic growth during the 2000s,
increased public spending on health from 4.6 percent to 5.9 percent of GDP over the decade,
while reducing out-of-pocket spending from 39 percent to 28 percent of total health
expenditures. Lebanon, by contrast, had to contend with austerity measures, high debt levels,
and the 2006 Lebanese war, which limited its overall fiscal space. From 2000–10, Lebanon’s
public spending on health fell from 3.2 percent to 2.7 percent of GDP; and out-of-pocket
spending, although trending down, remained high, declining from 57 percent to 46 percent of
total health expenditures.

Despite these gains, both health systems, like many in the region, faced growing pressure to
evolve to better meet the needs of their populations and support development goals.
Noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease and stroke had replaced infectious diseases as
the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Concerted efforts to address these conditions


                                                  MENA Economic Monitor      October 2017     17
lagged. Although the numbers of hospital beds and physicians generally were considered
adequate, many of these resources were concentrated in major cities, leaving rural and remote
areas with limited access and poorer quality care. Despite progress to reduce out-of-pocket
payments, the poorest in these countries remained highly vulnerable to financial shocks from
health-related issues.

Refugees’ impacts on MENA hosting countries

The Syrian crisis and resulting refugee flows have significantly increased demand for health
services in neighboring MENA countries (Table 2.1). In 2014, Jordan recorded some 700,000 visits
by Syrian refugees to health centers or hospitals throughout the country. In Lebanon, in 2015,
the country’s Primary Health Care Center network, which provides care to vulnerable populations
at roughly 200 facilities, recorded more than 1.5 million visits––more than double the 700,000
visits recorded in 2009 before the crisis began. In 2013, nearly 35 percent of all visits to primary
health centers in Lebanon were by Syrian refugees.

Displacement has stalled, and in some cases reversed, important health gains. Although Lebanon
met the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for maternal and child health, both goals have
suffered notable reversals. From 2012 to 2017, the neonatal mortality rate in Lebanon increased
from 3.4 to 4.9 deaths per 10,000 live births, and the maternal mortality rate increased from 12.7
to 21.3 deaths per 100,000 live births. For both, rates among Syrian refugees were nearly double
the rates of the native population. In Jordan and Lebanon, previously well-controlled
communicable diseases including measles, tuberculosis, and leishmaniosis have reemerged and
are threatening both local and regional disease control efforts. In 2012, for example, the first
year of significant refugee inflows to Lebanon, reports of tuberculosis increased by 27 percent.
UNHCR data show that communicable diseases are one of the main drivers of refugees seeking
primary care in Jordan and Lebanon.

Refugee influxes have complicated efforts to provide universal health coverage and basic
financial protection. In 2013 Lebanon unveiled ambitious plans to expand insurance coverage,
particularly for vulnerable Lebanese, but the influx of 1.3 million Syrian refugees over the past 5
years and the resulting demand for health services has stalled such efforts (World Bank 2017d).
Today, UNHCR covers a part of the cost of specific hospital services, such as obstetrical care and
life-threatening emergencies, for Syrians in Lebanon, but the remainder of the bills often falls to
the patients. Other services, such as cancer treatment, dialysis, and catastrophic illnesses, are
not covered at all. A recent study found that hospitalization rates among Syrian refugees lagged
well behind their Lebanese counterparts (6 percent vs. 12 percent annually), raising serious
concerns about cost as a barrier to care.

In Jordan, a similar set of concerns has emerged. From 2012 to 2014, the Jordanian government
generously covered essentially all healthcare cost for refugees. However, as the refugee numbers

                                                   MENA Economic Monitor        October 2017     18
rose, this approach became fiscally unsustainable, forcing Jordan to implement a 20 percent
copayment by refugees for most services. In the 2 years since the copayment was implemented,
use of health services by refugees in Jordan has dropped nearly 60 percent. A recent survey found
that more than 50 percent of Syrian refugees in Jordan say that they cannot afford their
medications, and more than 50 percent of pregnant women say that they cannot afford
transportation to antenatal care appointments.

The inability to meet growing demand for health services has decreased patient satisfaction,
threatening an already tenuous relationship between citizens and the health system. Waiting
times for services have increased in both countries. In Jordan, in 2016 these delays became so
long that referrals to non-Ministry of Health hospitals increased more than 50 percent over the
previous year, costing the government $154 million. Stock-outages of some essential medicines
reportedly have become more common (World Bank 2017c). Shortages of health workers,
particularly those trained to address reproductive health, gender-based violence, mental health,
and noncommunicable diseases, have further undermined satisfaction with care. Cultural
disconnects also have dampened patient satisfaction, with some Syrian refugees reporting that
humanitarian health workers lack appropriate cultural sensitivity when providing care.

A development response

With basic health services overstretched and development goals in jeopardy, new solutions are
needed that simultaneously address the underlying problems of health systems while responding
to new demands created by refugee influxes. Even before the Syrian conflict, many MENA
countries were grappling with shortcomings in their health systems, from high reliance on out-
of-pocket payments and shortages of certain types of health workers to fragmentation of services
resulting in inefficiencies and poorer quality care. Efforts to address these pre-existing challenges
have been exacerbated by the arrival of millions of refugees, who live largely within local
communities rather than in camps and often seek access to the same services as do local
populations. Despite initial attempts by some hosting countries to fund these services for
refugees, the costs and demand have proved overwhelming, particularly amid rising debt levels
and shortfalls in humanitarian support.

Recent experiences suggest several ways that health sectors can help countries facing large
refugee inflows to meet development goals:

▪   Use innovative financing mechanisms to support basic health service while affirming the
    principle that hosting refugees is a global public good. In recent months, the Bank approved
    2 emergency health projects in the MENA region: the Jordan Emergency Health Project for
    $50 million; and the Lebanon Health Resilience Project for $120 million. Both projects were
    part of separate $150 million projects, with parallel financing crowded in by the Islamic
    Development Bank (IDB). These are the first health projects supported by the World Bank’s
    Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF), which was established recently to support
    middle-income MENA countries that are hosting large numbers of refugees.

▪   Many MENA countries’ health systems were highly fragmented well before the Syrian crisis
    began, with health services provided by an array of actors including various government
    ministries, private sector players, NGOs, and faith-based charities. Recent refugee flows often

                                                    MENA Economic Monitor       October 2017      20
       contributed to this fragmentation because humanitarian actors sometimes set up parallel
       systems that do not support––and, in some cases, drain—resources from national health
       systems. Efforts to increase the supply also should strengthen national capacity, not compete
       with it. For example, the Lebanon Health Resilience Project helps to expand the scope and
       scale of the basic service package already covered by UN organizations within the country’s
       network of primary health facilities, helping to strengthen capacity within these sites and
       streamline care.

 ▪     Enable trained refugee health workers to fill human resource gaps. UNHCR March 2017 data
       show that the Syrian refugee population in Jordan included 483 doctors, 880 nurses, 448
       pharmacists, and 335 medical assistants. Due to legal restrictions, most of these health
       workers will be unable to resume working in their fields. Some countries are exploring
       innovative pathways to employ such specialists to address refugees’ health needs. Turkey,
       for example, has opened dozens of refugee clinics employing Syrian doctors and nurses, who
       provide primary care in Arabic to the refugee populations.

 ▪     Tailor health worker training to the changing burden of disease brought by conflict and mass
       displacement. Consideration should be given to scale up such efforts to ensure that the next
       cadre of clinicians and public health officials are trained appropriately to meet the health
       needs often unique to refugee populations as well the needs of the hosting communities.

III.    Jobs

 Labor market developments before and after the influx of refugees

 More than 5 million Syrians have fled the conflict and the majority of them across borders to
 neighboring MENA countries (Table 2.1). The Syrian conflict has caused a loss of 3.2 million jobs
 in the country, inducing major structural changes in the economy and labor markets and massive
 losses of high-end skills. Since 2011, due to the massive lay-offs caused by factory and firm
 closures, jobs have been destroyed at an estimated rate of 538,000 per year. More than 50
 percent of the working age population is out of the labor force. In 2015 the national
 unemployment rate increased to 52.9 percent, and the rate for youth to 78 percent. To earn an
 income for their families, individuals increasingly are engaged in military service or the “war
 economy”. As the oil and manufacturing sectors collapse, a large and increasing share of the labor
 force now works in low-productivity sectors. The share of industrial jobs declined from 14 percent
 to only 2 percent. Twenty percent of workers are still employed in agriculture despite the loss of
 400,000 agricultural jobs. In contrast, employment has increased in low-productivity services,




                                                     MENA Economic Monitor      October 2017     21
which constitute 78 percent of workers.14 Emigration due to the lack of security, lack of job
opportunities, and steep decline in the standards of living also has created important skills
shortages in Syria (World Bank 2017a).

The impacts of refugees on the hosting country labor market and wages are difficult to ascertain.
Even before the Syrian conflict, labor regulations and active labor market programs (ALMPs) in
MENA countries had structural deficiencies. Domestic labor markets still face a large reservoir of
untapped human resources due to the high inactivity and unemployment rates, particularly
among youth. The high unemployment coupled with limited private sector formal job creation
has pushed a growing number of workers into unproductive, subsistence-level activities, often in
the informal economy (World Bank 2012). The massive influx of refugees have exacerbated the
malaise in the local labor markets because 50 percent of the refugees are in working-age groups.

In Lebanon, the influx of refugees from Syria increased the size of the labor force by close to 35
percent. Many of these refugees work in the informal sector due to lower education levels and/or
lack of work permits. Youth are much more likely to compete occupationally with Syrian refugees
in the labor market and to be concentrated in the sectors (tourism and trade) whose growth is
most impacted by the crisis.15 Syrian refugees also accept lower wages than hosting community
unskilled workers.

The Jordanian economy was grappling with high unemployment rates prior to the influx of
refugees. Unemployment rates continue to be in double digits especially among youth and
women, reaching a 10-year high of 15.8 percent in 2017 (IMF 2017). Approximately 120,000
Jordanians enter the work force every year, but only 55,000 find employment. Females and the
least educated constitute the majority of the 65 percent of the population who are
inactive. Moreover, approximately 50 percent of employment in Jordan is informal.16 The
situation is worse for Syrian refugees residing in Jordan. Of approximately 1.3 million Syrian
refugees, of whom only half are registered with UNHCR, only 40,000 hold a work permit (as of
mid-2017).17

In Iraq, the refugee crisis has impacted both the Iraqis who fled and the communities that they
left behind. The situation is even worse for Syrian refugees who have sought safety and jobs in
Iraq. In 2016 the national unemployment rate was 16 percent, and youth unemployment was 36


14
   The sectoral employment figures are estimated based on the ratio of employment to GDP elasticities so should be
interpreted carefully. This method assumes constant labor intensity of production, which might not be the case in
all sectors in a conflict situation.
15
   In 2010 more than 50 percent of employed youth worked in tourism and trade, compared with only 33 percent in
2015.

percent. The public sector provides 40 percent of all jobs,18 resulting in virtually no fiscal space.
Private job creation is hampered by a very poor business environment: insecurity, corruption,
high operating costs, depressed demand, poor access to power and to credit, and a heavy state-
owned enterprise (SOE) footprint. Most recently, the struggle against Daesh has significantly
harmed jobs prospects. Labor income has fallen by 47 percent in regions affected by Daesh. An
estimated 5 million jobs must be created by 2030 to reverse the negative impacts of decades of
sanctions and conflict, oil dependency, and heavy regulation that have severely constrained both
private and public job creation.

The ongoing conflict in Yemen is devastating its economy and has obliterated 600,000 jobs,
mostly in agriculture and services. Approximately 3 million people have been displaced, and
Yemeni refugees have fled to Djibouti, the Gulf countries, and Sudan. Most of them have fled for
security reasons to avoid forced recruitment so have lost their jobs. Yemen itself is hosting
refugees from the Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia and Somalia, who are hoping to find better
opportunities despite the ongoing conflict. Small and medium size enterprise (SMEs) have been
hit the worst by the conflict. In 2015 private sector employment declined by approximately 12
percent19 and has continued to contract. Approximately 70 percent of SMEs have laid off 50
percent of their workforce. In 2016 Yemen’s unemployment rate was only 17 percent (WDI). The
destruction of infrastructure and instability has increased business costs; the customer base and
revenues have decreased; and significant private sector capital has migrated overseas.

UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates show that approximately 50 percent of those fleeing to
Libya are looking for jobs, but they end up fleeing to Europe to escape difficult economic
conditions and instability in the labor market. The deep political strife in Libya has had significant
negative impact on the economy and hence on the labor market. The overall unemployment rate
in Libya increased from 13.5 percent in 2010 to 19.0 percent as of 2012, and has changed little
since then. Youth unemployment stands at approximately 48 percent, and female
unemployment at 25 percent. The vast majority (85 percent) of Libya's labor force is employed
in the public sector, a high rate even by regional standards. The rate for women is even higher,
at 93 percent.

A development response
Although to different degrees, all MENA countries face three common challenges: (1) to
accelerate the rate of job creation in the formal sector in higher-value-added activities; (2) to
improve the quality of existing informal jobs; and (3) to connect vulnerable population groups to
jobs or help them move to better jobs. Over the next decade, it is unlikely that enough formal

jobs will be created to absorb all new entrants to the labor market. However, it is possible, and
necessary, to gradually expand the share of formal employment to enable more fundamental
structural transformation.

Labor and migration policies are critical to support vulnerable workers, including refugees, to
access jobs or move from low to higher quality jobs. Unfortunately, labor regulations and active
labor market programs (ALMPs) in MENA countries have structural deficiencies. First, regulations
were designed for an environment in which most workers were in the formal sector. Second,
ALMPs were “supply driven” and unable to effectively respond to the needs of workers and
employers outside the formal sector.

Labor regulations need to be made more efficient to protect workers, including in the informal
sector, while internalizing the social costs of jobs destruction and reducing distortions that
constrain the creation of formal jobs. Making such regulatory transformations implies coming up
with different approaches to (1) guarantee a minimum level of income, (2) ensure a fair
distribution of value added between wages and profits, (3) protect workers from unemployment,
and (4) enforce core labor standards and adequate working conditions.

Similarly, if the social value of connecting workers to jobs or helping workers move from low to
higher quality jobs goes beyond the value to the worker (and the employer, when there is one),
there is a rationale for increasing investments in ALMPs and expanding their coverage. To achieve
these targets, delivery and financing systems must be reformulated. Delivery systems, in
particular, should better link the labor market programs to “demand” side interventions that
focus on job creation or higher labor productivity. The best way to help refugees get jobs is to
substantially improve the functioning of hosting country labor markets.

IV.   Livelihoods

Inadequate civil, social, and economic rights including freedom of movement and residence often
inversely impacts refugee livelihoods. Studies (Jacobsen 2002) show that many refugees cannot
establish or maintain their livelihoods because they cannot exercise the rights to which they are
entitled under international human rights, humanitarian law, and/or refugee law (see section on
Changing the Political Debate). A series of country examples follows. The ability of Liberian
refugees in Ghana to exercise the rights of freedom of movement as well as access to
employment and public education has contributed to their relative success in becoming self-
reliant (Dick 2002). The Uganda’s government provided refugees with agricultural land with the
objective of making them self-sufficient pending a durable solution.

The external environment and uncertainty also influences the refugee’s livelihood. Refugees not
only have to cope with the often-traumatic experience of flight and displacement but also often
end up with very limited or no resources due to loss of assets and capabilities. Uncertainty about

                                                  MENA Economic Monitor       October 2017     24
obtaining work permits due to rapidly changing policies over renewals and the sectors to which
permits apply can negatively influence refugees’ livelihoods. The uncertainty makes it harder for
refugees to make decisions and calculate the costs, benefits, and risks of various livelihood
strategies.20 In Ecuador, asylum-seekers are not permitted to work until their legal status is
resolved. The waiting period, which can last as long as one year, is full of fear and anxiety for the
refugees and is made more stressful by their inability to legally engage in formal employment,
the lack of labor opportunities, and discrimination. In Colombia, refugees must sustain illegal
livelihoods during the asylum application process. Lo (2005) argues that removing this restriction
on asylum-seekers would reduce the fear associated with working illegally.

A development response

As discussed above, livelihoods are influenced by a range of economic, social, political, and
environmental factors. For this reason, it is essential to apply a comprehensive approach to the
design and implementation of programs that support refugee livelihoods. The right mix of
policies is necessary. In this vein, consideration should be given to lifting not only legal barriers
but also other barriers, including de facto limited access to the job market due to poor economic
conditions, remoteness of refugee settlements, and restrictions imposed by local authorities.
Addressing language differences, lack of skills, lack of tools and/or start-up capital, and
xenophobia toward refugees is equally important.

Activities tend to be more successful when taking into account gender specifics. Creating and
maintaining livelihoods are done differently by men and women. Moreover, due to flight and
experiences in exile, the gender roles and socioeconomic status of refugees have changed
significantly. In establishing their livelihoods, women face different constraints and insecurities
than do men. When household livelihoods are on the brink, girls are the first to be pulled out of
school to work or are forced into early marriage. A study by No Lost Generation finds that, in
2016, rates of child marriage reached 20 percent in Lebanon and over 30 percent in Jordan.21
Girls in unprotected settings also are prone to being trafficked. Policies to address women’s
livelihoods and the assets on which they rely for their livelihoods should take into account these
differences.

According to UNHCR, when embarking on legislation or regulations to create livelihood-
supporting activities, a bottom-up approach is the preferred option. One of the most crucial
elements is ensuring and incorporating refugee voices and participation. UNHCR’s success in
Guatemala (Cheng and Chudoba 2003) can be largely contributed to the fact that the agency was
able to rely on the vast leadership ability and knowledge within the refugee population. Among

the Guatemalan refugees whom UNHCR assisted, the most successful refugee communities were
those in which refugees had been given choices: to live where they wanted with whom they
wanted, and to support themselves the ways that they wanted.

Finally, addressing pre-existing long-standing development issues in hosting communities
including improving the business climate; strengthening and expanding the delivery of education,
health, and environmental services to cope with the increased population; and providing skills
training for youth should be the key component of promoting livelihoods for refugees.
Encouraging policies that enhance freedom of movement and expanding the right to work for
refugees––both of which are in the interest of the hosting communities––are equally important.


How Can the Development Community Do Better?
Interventions and Assistance

Resources

The massive displacement witnessed by the MENA region over the last decade has significant
associated financial costs. Not surprisingly, many of these costs are borne by the refugees
themselves, who are using existing assets to support their move and provide for the subsistence
of their families. One Oxfam study finds that most Syrian refugees interviewed in Lebanon
indicated that, upon arrival, they had relied primarily on their savings (Oxfam America 2015).
These resources often get depleted rapidly before the refugee can secure work or long-term
shelter.

Another major portion of the financing comes from the countries and communities hosting the
displaced. Depending on the ratio of refugees to the native population, refugees can significantly
strain fiscal and macroeconomic indicators, stemming from, for example, their use of services
and access to subsidized goods. Various actors including the World Bank have tried to monetize
the burden posed by refugees on hosting countries. However, these studies have tended to use
a wide variety of methodologies, making the studies difficult to compare across time and
countries (see Section on Burden-Sharing).

The third major source of financing for the displacement crises in MENA is external partners,
either as humanitarian or development assistance or through private charities and donations. No
exhaustive overview or estimates of the amounts of financial assistance that the international
community spends on forced displacement crises globally yet exists.

A new World Bank study estimates that the global expenditures on forced displacement reached
approximately $20 billion in 2015 (World Bank 2017b). However, this calculation leaves out a


                                                  MENA Economic Monitor       October 2017     26
number of actors so is likely to have underestimated the actual costs.22 In 2016 approximately
$15.4 billion, or 75 percent of these monies, were spent on refugee resettlements inside OECD
donor countries. The share that is staying in donor countries has been rising since the onset of
the Syrian crisis, with a 27.5 percent increase from 2015 to 2016. Unprecedented, this amount
equated to 10.8 percent of total net ODA. When excluding the cost of refugee resettlement, each
refugee in the rest of the world benefitted from an average of $131 dollars in 2015.

Determining the actual amounts and type of financing reaching the refugees and their hosts is
similarly difficult in MENA. During 2014–15, Jordan was the ninth largest recipient of ODA,
receiving approximately $2.5 billion. Of this amount, 30 percent was provided as humanitarian
aid, most of which likely was channeled toward the Syrian refugees. In stark contrast, during the
same period, Lebanon received $975 million, with almost 60 percent being humanitarian aid
(Figure 2.3).

Forced displacement traditionally has been perceived as a temporary problem during which
those fleeing needed immediate relief until they could return to their homes. Hence, assistance
focused on taking emergency, life-preserving, and largely short-term actions; and tended to
cover only the urgent needs of the displaced. Consequently, financing for forced displacement

others. Moreover, the note does not include the expenditures that countries spent bilaterally on forced
displacement programs in non-OECD countries.

has come primarily from humanitarian budgets, relying on yearly budgeting cycles and short
planning horizons. However, as displacements grow protracted, including those that are decades
long such as the Palestinian and Afghan cases, the needs of the refugees become developmental.
At the same time, the development trajectories of hosting communities also become affected.
This “new normal” has led to an increasing amount of humanitarian assistance being directed
toward refugee situations that have lasted longer than eight years and that, in some instances,
have become parallel providers of basic services and opportunities for livelihoods, separate from
those provided by the hosting state for its own citizens.

UNHCR is the world’s primary provider of support to refugees. From an initial amount of
$300,000 in 1950, the organization’s operating budget has steadily increas ed to more than $6.5
billion. Most of its funding is channeled through the Refugee Response Plans (RRPs), which is a
UNHCR-led, interagency planning and coordination tool for large-scale or complex refugee
situations. RRPs present the interagency response strategy and the corresponding financial
requirements of all partners to ensure the coherence and complementarity of the humanitarian
response. The first Syrian RRP in March 2012 requested support in the amount of $84 million to
cover an expected 96,000 refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq (Figure 2.4).

Burden-Sharing

Due to refugees’ cross-border movements, financing them often is compared to other
phenomena considered global public goods, such as controlling climate change or pandemics.

                                                                MENA Economic Monitor   October 2017   28
Ensuring adequate burden-sharing, including raising international funding, is hampered by the
same types of challenges encountered by other global public goods to overcome free-riding (see
Section on Welfare of Refugees as a Global Public Good). The 1951 Convention on Refugees was
articulated based on the recognition that, in the future, any country could produce refugees;
hence, hosting refugees is a global responsibility. Because countries of first asylum often are the
hosting countries by default, the Convention also acknowledges that the burden could fall
disproportionately on a few countries.

Recognizing the need for a new look at the implicit burden-sharing model in the 1951 Convention,
in September 2016, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the New York
Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. The overall aim of the declaration is to improve the way
that the international community responds to large movements of refugees and protracted
refugee situations. To ease the burden on the main receiving countries, the declaration proposes,
through the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), specific collective actions
needed to (1) ease pressure on hosting countries, (2) enhance refugee self-reliance, (3) expand
access to third-country solutions, and (4) support conditions in countries of origin for refugees to
return in safety and dignity.

The declaration includes commitments to increase burden-sharing such as intentions to improve
the delivery of humanitarian and development assistance to the countries most affected,
including through innovative multilateral financial solutions. The three goals are (1) to close all
funding gaps; (2) to find new homes for all refugees identified by UNHCR as needing
resettlement; and (3) to expand the opportunities for refugees to relocate to other than their
home countries through, for example, labor mobility or education schemes (Box 2.1).

New ideas have emerged on how to increase multilateral financing for refugees. Two main factors
previously impeded systematic engagement by the international financial institutions (IFIs) to
address the challenges stemming from forced displacement. First, the traditional view that
refugees were purely a humanitarian challenge meant that they were seen as being outside the
mandate and comparative advantages of these development organizations. Second, the country-
based model whereby countries take out loans to invest in development for the benefit of their
citizenry led to further underinvestment in the development challenges stemming from hosting
refugees. As non-citizens, refugees were not part of any country’s constituency.

The “humanitarian only” lens effectively has been discarded as the large-scale influx of Syrians
into Jordan and Lebanon forced the recognition that refugee flows do have significant
development aspects, for both refugees and the hosting communities, who face their own
development challenges. This recognition has led to increased efforts to tackle the lack of
incentives for developing countries to borrow for noncitizens.



                                                   MENA Economic Monitor        October 2017     29
In 2016 a number of international organizations and bilateral donors convened to find an
innovative way to provide concessional funding for Lebanon and Jordan, the two countries with
the world’s highest concentration of refugees. The resulting MENA Global Concessional Financing
Facility (GCFF) focused on helping Jordan and Lebanon address the impact of Syrian refugees
without having to increase their debt levels (Box 2.2). This result was achieved by pooling donor
financing in a financial intermediary fund to provide concessional financing for development
projects that support refugees and hosting countries. Although the need has been most pressing
for Jordan and Lebanon, it is now realized that the same obstacles to finance noncitizens are
faced by other middle-income countries. The GCFF has since been expanded to enable other
countries to become recipients of the facility.



    Box 2.1 Resettlement of Refugees in Third Countries

    Burden-sharing also comes in the form of resettlement of refugees outside the initial country
    of asylum. Such resettlement can happen through the UNHCR, which has the mandate to
    transfer refugees from an asylum country to another State (third country) that has agreed to
    admit them and ultimately grant the specific refugees permanent settlement.

    In 2016 almost 77,000 Syrians were submitted for resettlement from MENA and Turkey,
    compared to 53,000 in 2015. The 2016 number includes 30,181 Syrians from Jordan, 23,498
    from Lebanon, and 16,682 from Turkey. From MENA and Turkey combined, since 2013, more
    than 156,000 Syrian refugees have been submitted for resettlement and humanitarian
    admission.a Other refugees make the onward journey to seek asylum status in third countries
    on their own. For example, between April 2011 and May 2017, 952,446 individual Syrians
    applied for asylum in Europe.b

   b. To the extent possible, the numbers reflect first-time applications. However, some of the statistics are likely
       to include repeated applications (for the same or a different country).

Even low-income countries have faced obstacles accessing low-cost development finance to
address the needs of hosting communities and refugees. Acknowledging developing countries’
reluctance to use their finite International Development Association (IDA) resources for
noncitizens, the World Bank’s shareholders decided to earmark $2 billion for the 18th IDA
replenishment cycle to be used for this purpose. This change enables countries with more than
25,000 refugees (or more than 0.1 percent of the population) to receive an additional allocation
to their regular IDA envelope.

      Box 2.2 Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF)

      Lebanon and Jordan have borne enormous costs from hosting millions of Syrian refugees who
      have fled their homes since war broke out in 2011. To mitigate the burden on these hosting
      countries, in April 2016, the World Bank, United Nations, and Islamic Development Bank, in
      close collaboration with the donor community and a range of international partners,
      launched the Concessional Financing Facility (CFF).

      To recognize the global public good that Lebanon and Jordan provide by opening their
      borders to Syrian refugees, the facility uses donor grants to reduce the cost of multilateral
      development bank loans to concessional levels for these two middle-income countries. These
      grants enable them to borrow more affordably for development projects that benefit both
      refugees and hosting communities. Despite the facility’s continued focus on Lebanon and
      Jordan, whose needs are greatest, at the UN General Assembly in September 2016, partners
      expanded the CFF’s scope to the global level so that it could help middle-income countries
      address refugee crises wherever they occur. As of August 2017, the renamed Global
      Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) has leveraged more than $1 billion concessional
      financing to Lebanon and Jordan for 7 projects.



Data and Monitoring

Insufficiency of data on refugees

Enhancing the availability, accuracy, and reliability of data on refugees is a critical challenge for
the international community in its pursuit of an effective response to the refugee crisis. First,
capturing accurate figures of refugee populations is always difficult. In many cases, original data
stem from a registration process organized by UNHCR. In certain cases, national institutions of
hosting countries also provide data. UNHCR data are very credible, and the organization’s data
collection process is ongoing. However, unless those who fled their countries present themselves
for registration, they will not be recorded in UNHCR data. Indeed, in some countries, a large
number of de facto refugees do not register with UNHCR. For example, the Jordanian government
estimates that the Syrian population in Jordan is close to 1.3 million, whereas in August 2017, the
number of Syrian refugees in Jordan registered with UNHCR is 660,000. Certain wealthy Syrians
in Jordan do not have incentives to register as refugees, and other Syrians come as economic
migrants. On the hosting country side, massive inflows can overwhelm intake systems, making
registration very difficult. At the other end of the process, some people may lack incentives to
deregister as refugees, even when their situation has changed. This lack of deregistering also can
add errors in the data on refugee populations.


                                                      MENA Economic Monitor         October 2017      31
Second, given the error margins resulting from variations in collection and aggregation methods
across countries and institutions, data on refugees need to be taken with a degree of caution
(World Bank 2017b). Moreover, because the variables and indicators covered in such data are
limited, they often do not project a realistic picture of the welfare or livelihoods of the refugee
population.

Third, disaggregated data on refugees in hosting communities often are difficult to find.
Conventional statistics such as a national census or World Bank poverty statistics cover only
countries’ registered nationals or the resident population, not refugees (Verme and others 2016).
It also is difficult to define which communities are affected by inflows of refugees since “being
affected” is a difficult concept. No specific threshold exists above which a flow is considered large
enough to have a socioeconomic impact on hosting communities (World Bank 2017b).

Assessing and monitoring the impacts of refugee flows

Assessing and monitoring the impacts of refugee inflows are prerequisites to conducting effective
interventions to address refugee crises. Minimizing the negative impacts and optimizing the
opportunities from refugee flows requires systematic assessment of the key areas for which
interventions are needed and the most appropriate modalities through which these
interventions should be delivered. Once interventions are underway, rigorous monitoring is
required to understand whether they are having their desired effect; and, if not, why not.
Assessment and monitoring in the context of refugee situations remains a relatively new area of
economic analysis that requires refinement.

To assess refugee flows and monitor the impacts of the interventions to address them, two
questions should be raised. One is: “Impacts on whom?” The other is: “Impacts from what?”
Regarding the first, a refugee crisis can affect many groups, but the two primary stakeholders
affected are the refugees and the hosting communities. For the second question, there are two
sources of impacts: one is from the inflow of refugees. The other impact is from interventions
intended to address the crisis, such as policy advice or a program of assistance activities.

Despite their importance, assessment and monitoring pose methodological difficulties. The main
difficulties regard the availability, accuracy, and reliability of data, as discussed above. The major
bottlenecks are the limited variables and indicators on the livelihoods of refugees and the lack of
disaggregated data in communities. Another difficulty is separating the impacts from the
displacement from the impacts of the war and violence that caused it. Assistance programs for
refugees could increase the influx of refugees so that the objective of the assessment itself ––
documenting the need for additional resources––could impact one critical variable, the number
of refugees.




                                                    MENA Economic Monitor        October 2017      32
When it comes to assessing the impact of interventions such as policy advice and assistance
programs, concerned institutions have not yet established a robust methodological framework.
In general, the impact of humanitarian assistance is not subject to rigorous assessment, whereas
the assessment of development support for refugees remains in its early stages. In addition,
depending on the projects and institutions involved, the assessment and monitoring frameworks
vary significantly.

Enhancing data and assessment processes

Given the limitations described above, the international community should conduct focused
efforts to enhance refugee data and the process of assessing needs and monitoring the impact
of designed interventions. Data collection and analysis can be expensive. However, they often
result in far lower costs and/or much higher effectiveness in the planning and implementation of
relief and development activities (World Bank 2017b). Looking ahead, efforts could center
around the following four areas.

1. Many institutions are engaged in responding to refugee crises. Concerned institutions can
   partner to enhance their joint data collection and develop a concerted methodology to
   enhance comparability. UNHCR is the leading institution in collecting refugee data. The World
   Food Program (WFP) maintains an expansive database on vulnerable people, including
   refugees, and has a strong statistical unit. National institutions and nongovernmental
   organizations (NGOs) also compile data on vulnerable populations. Some partnerships
   already exist, particularly regarding the Syrian refugee crisis, for which international
   organizations and NGOs have launched several initiatives to fill the data gap. For example,
   UNHCR has undertaken efforts beyond its registration process, including extensive home visit
   surveys and establishing a vulnerability assessment framework. Based on these data, the
   World Bank and UNHCR undertook joint research to assess the welfare of Syrian refugees.
   This research will be used to design both policies and interventions related to refugees and
   their hosts. REACH, in collaboration with international organizations, have conducted
   rigorous analyses on the circumstances of refugees in Jordan and Lebanon. These efforts are
   laudable and need to be expanded and reinforced.

2. To improve data collection and analysis, governments and international organizations should
   create an open data system by disclosing their raw data on refugee and hosting populations.
   This system should be set up to enable strong quality control by the users themselves while
   anonymizing raw data to protect the privacy and security of refugees and IDPs who have fled
   violence and persecution.

3. The data collection and analysis capacity of each participant should be enhanced. There is
   significant room to enhance the capacity of national institutions of hosting countries. Hosting

                                                  MENA Economic Monitor       October 2017     33
   countries and communities often bear significant costs from refugee inflows. Accurately
   communicating these costs to the international community could help secure the support
   needed to mitigate the burden.

4. The international community needs to establish a methodological framework to assess and
   monitor the impact of refugee inflows and the interventions designed to address them. Such
   an effort was launched through an international partnership housed at the World Bank group
   (WBG) to provide concessional financing to help Jordan and Lebanon address the influx of
   Syrian refugees. The GCFF requires agencies that implement projects supported by funding
   from the facility to measure the progress and impact of their operations under each project’s
   results framework (Box 2.1). In addition, leveraging the strengths and capacities of its diverse
   stakeholders, the facility recently inaugurated an effort to develop an aggregate-level
