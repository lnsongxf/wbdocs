This report is one of the main outputs of the World Bank’s Romania Climate Change
Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS) Program. It is a synthesis of the key findings and
recommendations of six separate sector rapid assessment reports under Component B of the
RAS program. The synthesis report was prepared by Jian Xie, with input from the following
teams based on their individual sector reports: Feng Liu, Anke Meyer, Jean Constantinescu,
and Silpa Kaza on the energy sector; Carolina Monsalve, Nick Ayland, and Otilia Nutu on
the transport sector; Stephen Hammer, Serena Adler, and Julianne Baker Gallegos on the
urban sector; Sanjay Pahuja and Ioan Bica on the water sector; Mark Redman, Lavinia
Andrei and Gabriel Ionita on the agriculture and rural development sector; Diji
Chandrasekharan Behr and Bogdan Popa on the forest sector; and Thierry Davy, Ionut
Purica, Adina Fagarasan, Lavinia Andrei, and Cesar Niculescu on country development
context and EU requirements.

The synthesis report benefited from written comments from Claus Kondrup, Jane Ebinger,
Mike Toman, and Kseniya Lvovsky. Alexandru Cosmin Buteica, Sydnella Kpundeh, and
Tamara Levine provided research assistance to the study. Demetra Aposporos provided
editorial assistance to the report. Sydnella Kpundeh, Cristina I. Zirimis, and Linh Van
Nguyen provided administrative assistance to the program. The synthesis report was
reviewed and cleared by Kulsum Ahmed and Ismail Radwan. The six sector reports were
cleared by the following Sector Managers or Acting Sector Managers of the World Bank:
Ranjit Lamech (energy), Juan Gaviria (transport), Sumila Gulyani (urban), Dina Umali-
Deininger (water and agricultural and rural development), and Kseniya Lvovsky (forestry).

The World Bank would also like to express gratitude to the Ministry of Environment and
Climate Change, the Ministry of European Funds, and many other Romanian Government
agencies and institutes for the excellent working relations established during this assignment
and especially for the assistance of the staff and members of the Project Implementing Unit
in the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, namely Mihaela Smarandache, Narcis
Jeler, Alexandra Ulmeanu, Gabriela Popescu, and Bianca Moldovean. Also appreciated are
valuable comments and suggestions received from participants of the consultation workshops
held in Bucharest in July and September 2013.

The World Bank’s Romania Climate Change program is managed by Jian Xie and Erika
Jorgensen, under the general guidance of Laszlo Lovei, Mamta Murthi, Kulsum Ahmed, Satu
Kristiina Kahkonen, and Elisabetta Capannelli from the World Bank.

                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background and Introduction

Tackling the destructive effects of global warming is a global priority. Despite ongoing
global efforts to combat global warming, it is widely accepted that the average temperature
will continue to rise globally at an accelerated speed in the coming decades. This increased
warming, largely attributed to the rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by human
activity, will have a far-reaching impact on the earth's climate patterns and will pose a serious
threat to human lives, economic development, and the planet earth itself, on which human
survival depends.

Managing global warming is a two-fold challenge for most countries: an obligation to
mitigate GHG emissions as a contribution to global welfare; and the need to continually
adapt to a changing climate. Controlling global warming will require a globally-coordinated
effort among all nations. Global mitigation polices and targeted adaptation action plans must
be put in place both nationally and internationally to effectively limit the impact of climate
change upon the environment, society, and local economies.

As a leading force in international efforts to tackle climate change, the European Union (EU)
is committed to becoming a highly energy-efficient, low-carbon economy. It has installed
some of the world’s most ambitious climate and energy targets to date, which are due to be
implemented by 2020, and the EU is the first region to have passed binding legislation to
ensure that they are achieved.

The 2013-14 timeframe is an important one for EU member states and the move to low-
carbon green growth because preparations are underway for a new EU budget cycle from
2014-2020. The programming in the next cycle of sectoral Operational Programs (OPs)
needs to reflect and integrate climate action on mitigation and adaptation. The European
Council determined in February 2013 that the Multiannual Financial Framework will
mainstream climate objectives, stating that “Climate action objectives will represent at least
20 percent of EU spending in the period 2014-2020, and therefore be reflected in the
appropriate instruments to ensure that they contribute to strengthening energy security,
building a low-carbon, resource efficient and climate resilient economy that will enhance
Europe's competitiveness, and create more and greener jobs.”

As an EU member state, Romania has made a commitment to combating global warming. It
is obligated, under EU membership, to continue to implement climate change measures. All

                                                                                                                             9
energy-intensive large installations in Romania must participate in the EU cap-and-trade
mechanism, or Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Smaller installations and those in less
energy-intensive sectors face country-specific targets which state that emissions from non-
ETS sectors cannot be more than 19 percent higher in 2020 than they were in 2005.
Furthermore, Romania has committed to achieving, by 2020, a 24 percent share of energy
from renewable sources in its gross final energy consumption (up from 18% in 2005).

To better address climate change issues, the Government of Romania (GoR) will need to put
forward a comprehensive climate change strategy and a detailed action plan capable of being
implemented, develop a strong knowledge base and analytic capacity to assess the cost-
effectiveness of both the policy and investment options, put mitigation and adaptation
activities into action and build the institutional capacity to implement and support them. It
has requested that the World Bank provide technical assistance through its Reimbursable
Advisory Service (RAS) Program.

The RAS program focuses on operationalizing its national climate change strategy and action
plan (component A), identifying and integrating climate-related actions in new operational
programs (component B), building a solid analytical base for impact assessment and climate-
related decision-making (component C), and enhancing climate-friendly practices and
monitoring systems (component D).

Component B is an urgent request for assistance in preparing the operational programming
for EU funds in 2014-2020, particularly in providing recommendations for integrating
climate actions into relevant sectoral operational programs in order to meet the EU
requirement that 20% of spending tackle climate change. In response to the request, the Bank
quickly carried out rapid assessments on climate risks and mitigation and adaptation
opportunities in six sectors: energy, transport, urban, water, agriculture, and forestry. This
report is a synthesis of component B outputs. It is based on the rapid assessments of climate
risks and actions across the six sectors. The purpose of this report is to summarize the
findings and present the final recommendations for integrating climate actions into sectoral
OPs for EU funds in 2014-2020 for consideration of the GoR.

EU-funded Operational Programming in Romania

Romania needs to prepare for the next EU funding cycle, taking the CC challenges and
opportunities to advance its economy towards a competitive, climate-resilient, and low-
carbon green economy. In the new EU budgetary cycle for 2014-2020, Romania is expected
to invest about €29 billion allocated from European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF),
which include the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund

(ESF), the Cohesion Fund (CF), European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development
(EAFRD), and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), plus national co-
financing to support the eleven Thematic Objectives of the EU 2020 and Romania's national
priorities. Of these Thematic Objectives, two directly target climate change, referring to
“supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors” (TO no. 4), and
“promoting climate change adaptation, risk prevention, and management” (TO no. 5).

The EU funds will be allocated through several large sector operational programs (OPs).
Each OP is eligible for one or more EU funds under the ESIF umbrella:
              Large infrastructure OP (ERDF and CF) which covers water, transport, energy,
               waste, etc.
              Regional OP (ERDF) with priority investments in urban and regional
               development including: local transport infrastructure; urban /local development;
               energy efficiency, etc.
              Rural Development OP, with priority investments in agriculture and rural
               development and public infrastructure in rural areas.
              European Territorial Cooperation OPs aiming to fund Territorial Cooperation
               Programs between Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, respectively.
              Human Capital OP (ESF).
              Administrative Capacity OP (ESF).
              Competitiveness OP (ERDF).
              Technical Assistance OP (ERDF).

Concerning Climate Change interventions, attention should be given to OPs on large
infrastructure, regional development, and rural development.

It is too early to know the exact allocation of the EU budget by type of fund and thematic
objective. From the indicative percentage presented in the draft Partnership Agreements for
Romania, the transport sector will take over 20% of the total ESI funds (and over 13% of the
Cohesion Fund) under the thematic objective “Promoting sustainable transport and removing
bottlenecks in key network infrastructures.” The TO of low carbon economy may use up to
10% of the total funds with the majority from ERDF. The budget for CC adaptation is mainly
from CF and EAFRD. Although the percentages are indicative and subject to revision during
the preparation of OPs, funding availability is one of the determining factors when proposing
and integrating climate actions in OPs.

Climate Change Impacts and Sectoral Contributions

Like all countries, Romania is not immune to climate change. 2007 was Romania’s warmest
year in two decades (average temperature 11.5° C), while the coldest average temperature
(8.4°C) happened in 1985. In 2005, Romania suffered historic floods which caused 76 deaths
and significant property damage, and 2007 brought the country’s most severe drought in the
last 60 years. The effects of these extreme weather events adversely affected the country
through significant economic loss in agriculture transport, energy supply, and water
management. In a scenario of increased global warming by 4°C, the situation and impacts of
climate change would certainly deteriorate in Romania. Consequently, adaptation to climate
change and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions are important priorities for Romania.

Romania is also a contributor to climate change through its GHG emissions, despite a
significant decrease in GHG emissions due to economic slowdown since 1989. The total
emissions of CO2 equivalent without LULUCF for Romania were 123 million tons in 2011,
accounting for 2.7 percent of the total EU emissions. The table below shows the sectoral
contributions to GHG emissions.

GHG emissions so far, has been increasing rapidly—up 36% since 1990. This upswing trend
remains likely in the future, and the sector, especially road transport, deserves full attention
in terms of containing GHG emission growth. The urban sector is where 56% of the
population and the majority of economic activities are located. It is a diverse and complex
area for a wide range of both mitigation and adaptation opportunities, from building energy
efficiency and urban transport, to solid waste management, water, and sanitation.

The agricultural sector remains traditional and dominant in the Romanian economy in terms
of land occupation and population. Over 15% of total GHG emission is attributable to
agriculture, and the sector is also very vulnerable to CC. It is an important sector to factor
into the potential for adaptation actions. Like the ARD sector, the water sector is vulnerable
to global warming which is likely to result in changes in precipitation, river flows, water
supply, and patterns of floods and droughts. Thus water is another key sector for introducing
adaptation measures to climate change. As a major sink of GHGs, the forest sector offers a
range of forest-based mitigation measures such as conserving existing CO2 sinks, enhancing
carbon sinks, and reducing the trade-off between the sinks and the tangible and intangible
benefits from other land uses. Romania’s rich forest sector represents major carbon sink with
an increasing role to play in CC.

Sectoral Recommendations

The following sections highlight key recommendations for climate actions by sector.

Energy

As a sector accountable for 70% of the total GHG emissions in Romania, energy is the most
important sector for GHG mitigation. While the sector has contributed about 70% of the
overall GHG emissions reduction achieved during 1989-2011, continued de-carbonization of
the energy sector, through low-carbon power and heat supply options and improved
efficiency in energy conversion, transmission, distribution and consumption, is essential to
Romania’s climate change mitigation agenda. This will require a substantial increase of
energy efficiency investments and clean energy solutions, implementation of energy sector
reforms which enable financing and sustainability, and putting an institutional framework in
place for delivering sustained energy efficiency improvements. For the 2014-2020 period,
the following priorities have been identified:

Investing in energy efficiency and clean energy solutions by both public and private sectors:
(1) scale up thermal retrofit of “blocks of flats,” in particular apartment buildings constructed
during the 1950s and 1990s; (2) modernize and commercialize economically viable district
heating systems; (3) reduce energy intensities in chemical and steel manufacturing; (4)

                                                                                                                           13
address highly disaggregate energy efficiency investments, such as high-efficiency
appliances, through energy efficiency obligations; (5) expand the balancing infrastructure for
integrating increased wind and solar generation capacity; (6) increase high-efficiency gas-
fired generation capacity; and (7) modernize the electricity distribution network.

Implementing energy sector reforms and improving sector governance: (1) Resume the
implementation of the 2003 Road Map for the Energy Field: a balanced strategy of attracting
private sector investment and developing viable public sector energy companies; (2) Improve
governance of energy SOEs in accordance with OECD best practice for transparency and
accountability; (3) Rebuild the energy regulator ANRE‘s capacity, autonomy and
accountability; (4) Improve inter-ministerial coordination of energy functions across the
Government; and (5) Improve institutional set-up and governance arrangements for business
environment functions in accordance with good international practices for regulatory
management systems.

Creating an institutional framework for delivering sustained energy efficiency improvements:
(1) plug gaps in policies and regulations, in particular, addressing price subsidies and the
enforcement of codes and standards; (2) strengthen institutions, especially the authority and
accountability of the national entity with an energy efficiency mandate; (3) establish long-
term financing and delivery platforms for thermal retrofit of residential buildings; (4)
improve access to finance, especially mechanisms which support access to EU co-financing;
(5) develop technical the capacity of key energy efficiency market participants, such as end
users, energy managers/auditors, banks, and energy service providers; and (6) increase
information, data gathering and outreach to all stakeholders.

Transport

The transport sector, although attributing only about 12% in total GHG emissions so far, has
been increasing rapidly—up 36% since 1990. While this is smaller than the EU’s average of
20.2 percent, it is rising more quickly than the EU average. This upswing trend remains
likely in the future, which makes the sector a key priority to containing GHG emission
growth. Among the different transport modes, road transport is the source of the largest
majority of GHG emissions in the transport sector, being responsible for 93 percent of
domestic transport emissions.

Transport is the priority sector in OPs since it will utilize the largest share of ESIF in the
2014-2020 budgeting cycle. It is also where many large and climate friendly investment
options, such as railways, inland waterway transport (IWT), ports, multimodal transport, and
urban public transport, exist.


Component B Synthesis Report - Summary of Sector Rapid Assessments and Recommendations for Incorporating Climate Actions in the
2014-2020 Sectoral Operational Programs
                                                                                                                           14
With regard to mitigation, the most pressing action is to develop a methodology for
measuring emission intensity per passenger-km and ton-km for different transport modes,
different technologies and under different operational conditions, in order to be able to
prioritize investments, monitor GHG emissions by mode, and assess the impact of measures
that will be undertaken to reduce the growth of GHG emissions. At present such an
information base is absent. A second urgent priority is implementing policies that ensure
improved performance of the rail infrastructure managers and public rail operators—
including allocating funding to maintain infrastructure investments—so that investments in
rail infrastructure financed under the Operational Programs translate into higher ridership and
higher ton-km of freight transported in the rail network, contributing to a modal shift. A third
priority is to launch a series of studies aimed at (a) reviewing fiscal measures to influence
private car purchase and use; (b) assessing options in using alternative fuels; and (c)
measures to encourage freight haulers to accelerate the adoption of lower-emission vehicle
technology; and (d) the potential role of ‘harder’ demand management measures to address
congestion and emissions in Romanian cities. Reducing the growth rate of emissions from
the road sector is critical for decelerating the transport sector’s emission growth. This will
require changes in pricing and other policies—but the critical step is launching studies that
will guide policy choices to be implemented over the 2014-2020 period and beyond.

Adaptation to climate change is a key requirement for Romania’s transport sector in the
future. It needs to become an integral part of all transport sector activities, and become
embedded in the day-to-day thinking of people working in the sector. The starting point for
adaptation work in the transport sector is to conduct sectoral or agency level Vulnerability
Assessments in order to identify the relative vulnerability of assets and services to the
impacts of climate change—through the development of vulnerability maps, among other
things—in order to define short-term, medium-term, and long-term adaptation actions for
implementation.

Urban

In Romania, roughly 56% of the country lives in urban areas, meaning this is where the
majority of the country’s GHG emissions are likely concentrated. Romanian cities are also
where the impacts of climate change are likely to be felt more strongly, although gaps in
knowledge make it difficult to predict with great certainty what the exact impacts will look
like or how circumstances may vary in different parts of the country. In the 2014-2020 EU
budgeting period, the Romanian government would benefit from investments aimed at
deepening local understanding about what can be done to reduce GHG emissions in cities,
and how to better prepare cities for the likely impacts of climate change. There is already a

                                                                                                                           15
base of work in both cases that can be built on from planning activities based on participation
in the EU’s Covenant of Mayors program, and local disaster planning efforts. In expanding
this work, the Government of Romania and local authorities are advised to ensure that this
work links to efforts to craft integrated urban development strategies, which have strong
influence over infrastructure investment and land use development decisions.

Obviously, the majority of urban GHG emissions come from the transport and energy
sectors, with a much smaller fraction of emissions associated with water supply and
treatment facilities and the solid waste sector. In all cases, investments can be made that
would enhance local system climate resilience and reduce local GHG emissions.
Recommended priorities for the 2014-2020 OPs include:

Urban Transport Sector: The government is currently supporting the development of
sustainable urban mobility plans which will inform future investment priorities in public
transportation and pedestrian and bicycling infrastructure. In most cases, however, these
investments will be aimed at reducing local traffic congestion, with GHG emission
reductions a co-benefit rather than a primary goal. Technical and engineering studies should
be undertaken to better assess how the existing road and public transport networks in cities
will be affected by climate change.

Urban Energy Sector: The most important urban energy system changes must occur in the
district heating sector, which has witnessed a dramatic decline in use over the past 15 years.
Investments going forward should include strategic reviews of how to reduce costs and
improve district heating system service quality; support for investment in cogeneration
facilities, and investment in building energy efficiency upgrades.

Urban Solid Waste Sector: Collectively, solid waste disposal facilities around Romania
generate roughly 2% of national GHG emissions. The majority results from the country’s
overwhelming reliance on landfilling as its primary waste management strategy, as organic
waste buried in landfills converts to methane, a potent greenhouse gas. EU accession rules
thus require the diversion of most organic waste away from landfills, requiring that Romania
invests in composting, anaerobic digestion and recycling facilities. New collection network
investments can ensure a high quality feedstock for these facilities.

Urban Water Sector: Urban water supply and treatment systems contribute little to
Romania’s overall GHG emissions picture. There is nonetheless room for improvement by
accelerating the energy efficiency of utility operations, reducing current high water loss
levels and reducing methane emissions from wastewater treatment facilities. Some system
upgrades were funded during the 2007-2013 Operating Program period as part of efforts to

help Romania address its historically poor surface and ground water quality. These should
continue to be prioritized during the new Operating Program period.

Water

With 40 billion cubic meters (BCM) per year of total utilizable water resources and a total
current water demand of 8 BCM/year for its population of 20 million, Romania has adequate
water resources in terms of average per capita availability. However there are significant
inter-annual variations in the availability of water resources, and also significant variations
between the basins, with the Jiu, Arges-Vedea, Buzau-Ialomita, Siret, Prut-Barlad, and
Dobrogea-Littoral basins facing the most serious water scarcities. Current water demands
come from industry (67%), agriculture (18%), and municipal needs (15%). Compared to the
European annual average of 4500 cubic meters per capita, Romania’s water availability stands
at 2000 cubic meters per capita per year.

Climate change is likely to result in decreases in annual mean precipitation and in annual
mean river flows, and seasonal changes in water supply. As a consequence, droughts and
water stress are expected to increase, particularly in summer. Flood events are projected to
occur more frequently in many river basins, particularly in winter and spring. These floods,
and storm-water infiltration, may impair wastewater treatment in sewer systems. Energy
supply may also be compromised by both intense floods and adversely dry summers, which
would hamper energy generation from hydropower plants. Both are common climate-change
related risks.

Priority actions are recommended for addressing the identified risks and opportunities related
to climate change from an integrated, multi-sectoral water resources perspective, despite
limitations in the quantitative estimates of climate change impacts on Romanian river basins
and a thorough economic analysis to prioritize the recommended actions. Nonetheless, some
obvious “no-regret” actions have been identified, with the recommendation that they be
initiated as soon as possible, given the strong need and their significant benefits. The
recommendations as highlighted below also include some investments (such as those in rural
water supply and flood management) which do not directly seem to be related to climate
change, but which can be validly considered to be a part of the adaptation response and thus
may be eligible for climate change-related funding from the EU programs.

Quantitative assessments of water availability and management options. These
recommendations include studies of climate change impacts on hydrology; assessments of the
specific levels and types of irrigated agriculture that can be sustained in each of the river
basins; analyses of the technical options and economic returns of converting pumped-

all of the main WSS utilities; assessment of the feasibility of desalinization for provision of
drinking water supplies in water-scarce coastal basins; and assessment of the feasibility of
using aquifers coupled with artificial recharge for inter-annual water storage in water-scarce
basins.

Regulations and policies to increase water use efficiency and protect water supplies. Specific
actions include establishing requirements that River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) are
updated with the results of quantitative climate change assessments; large industrial water
users are supplied through utility lines instead of private groundwater wells; flood risk
assessments are introduced into the regional development and general city planning processes;
encouraging wastewater reuse in irrigation, especially in water-scarce basins; and protecting
critical water supply sources (reservoirs or aquifers) through land use zoning measures in
water-scarce locations.

Pilot projects for enhanced irrigation and water resource management, including pilots that
test different models of efficient irrigation systems coupled with climate-smart agriculture
practices; and pilots on suitable co-benefit models of natural resource management in forest
catchments and wetland fisheries.

Investments in infrastructure to reduce disaster risk and safeguard supply. The investments
include infrastructure for flood management on the basis of updated flood hazard/risk
mapping and infrastructure to ensure water supplies and wastewater provisions for 263
municipalities that have more than 10,000 inhabitants by 2015 (and for 2,346 smaller
townships with 2,000 - 10,000 inhabitants by 2018).

Agriculture and Rural Development

As a diverse and complex system with much variability in socio-economic context and
institutional capacity, the ARD sector in Romania is facing a significant uncertainty and a
huge challenge in addressing climate change. But uncertainty does not mean that action
should be postponed and there is an immediate opportunity to embed climate action in the
programming of the NRDP 2014-2020 which must be acted upon fully and effectively. Two
immediate priorities for support under the NRDP 2014-2020 are: 1) education and training to
improve awareness of climate change among farmers and rural communities, and; 2) the
targeting of advisory / extension support on climate change mitigation and adaptation across
the whole of the sector.




Component B Synthesis Report - Summary of Sector Rapid Assessments and Recommendations for Incorporating Climate Actions in the
2014-2020 Sectoral Operational Programs
                                                                                                                           18
Although Romania has seen a significant reduction in GHG emissions from agriculture in
recent years, there remains the very real possibility that emissions will increase again as the
agricultural economy improves. The NRDP 2014-2020 can offer a mix of investment
support and other policy incentives that can help to balance the need to limit / cap GHG
emissions with the inevitable longer-term demands upon agriculture for increased food
production. This includes promoting: a) technologies and farm management practices which
directly contribute to reducing emissions through improvements in efficient use of energy,
and the better management of carbon and nitrogen flows in the agricultural ecosystem; b)
increased carbon sequestration (plus the reduction of soil carbon losses) through the
afforestation of low quality and unproductive land and the increased adoption of organic
farming and zero / conservation tillage techniques, and; c) the production of renewable
energy including energy crops; rural biogas production from livestock manure, and;
investment in the small- and large-scale technologies available for solar and wind power
generation.

At the same time, adaptation is a very high priority as progressive climate change is
occurring and significant impacts upon the ARD sector are developing with the expectation
that the livelihoods of many rural people will be increasingly vulnerable to the accompanying
risks: severe flooding; drought; soil erosion by wind and water; and the extreme land
degradation associated with desertification. The sector needs to start responding more
rapidly to prepare for future impacts and there is a need to build both the resilience and
adaptive capacity of the two ARD sub-sectors that exist – namely, the large commercial
farms and communities of small-scale subsistence farms.

An immediate priority that can be supported under the NRDP 2014-2020 is on-farm
investment in economically viable and environmentally-sustainable irrigation systems in the
most vulnerable regions where the occurrence of drought is predicted to be most frequent and
intense. Related to this, the NRDP 2014-2020 also supports the introduction of risk
management tools – notably the setting-up of farmers' mutual funds for stabilizing incomes -
that can underpin the confidence of farmers to continue managing and investing in their
farms in the face of the uncertainty associated with extreme weather events.

A less tangible, but equally important priority is the need to utilize a range of policy tools to
build the long-term resilience and adaptive capacity of farmers and rural communities to the
risks and uncertainties of climate change. This is a complex proposition that includes
encouraging the adoption of appropriate technologies and practices, as well as promote and
foster innovation, co-operation and other bottom-up initiatives amongst local communities,
including farmers and other businesses.

These climate-related actions present a major challenge to the ARD sector in terms of
science, policy and practice. Further work is needed to develop greater understanding of the
economic feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the various mitigation and adaptation actions
that are appropriate to the Romanian ARD sector. And ultimately a more strategic approach
is needed that reconciles and integrates the climate challenges faced by the ARD sector with
the need to also significantly reform the sector towards a more export-driven, high-value and
climate-resilient agriculture, with rural living conditions more closely aligned to urban.

Forestry

Rich in forests, Romania’s forest sector is a major sink of GHGs. The sector is responsible
for nearly 10% of reduction in total GHG emissions of the country.

The forest sector offers opportunities for actions that contribute to mitigating climate change.
Investments and technical assistance support sustainable management of production and the
protection of forests, and can enhance the forest system’s resilience to climate change. These
actions also offer climate relevant co-benefits including enhancing the resilience of other
sectors (e.g., agriculture) to climate related disasters, restoring degraded lands, and providing
a source of low carbon renewable energy for rural areas, creating employment opportunities,
and contributing to economic growth. Sustainable forest management (SFM) and
afforestation are instrumental for complying with Romania’s EU directives.

Measures for enabling SFM and afforestation reflect important areas of intervention in the
short and medium term. They include, for example, adopting new technologies, targeted
rehabilitation of forest roads, revising the regulations on forest management and harvesting,
providing technical assistance to small forest owners, improving information on forest
resources and forest land ownership, providing appropriate incentives for afforestation and
the protection of forests. Several of the measures (with the exception of the measure on
Natura 2000), however, require additional funding to bridge the gap between the current
situation and optimal potential of the measures.

The proposed measures and funding requested for the forest sector will help Romania
comply with the EU requirement that 20% of the EU funds be spent on measures that have
positive climate relevance. They also help meet the requirement that 30% of NRDP resources
be used for climate positive actions. The use of funds from the NRDP and other relevant OPs
(e.g., the environment portion of the large infrastructure OP) for investments and technical
assistance in the forest sector are “no regret” actions. The forest sector offers numerous
opportunities for adaptation-based mitigation and synergies with other sectors. Key sectors
for coordination include agriculture, energy, water and infrastructure.

Limitations and Moving Forward

Due to limited time, rapid assessments have drawn on available documents, data sets, and
discussions as well as consultations with key stakeholders in Government ministries,
institutes, and companies. They have also drawn on the information and experiences of other
countries, both within the EU and around the world. However, because there remains a lack
of cost-benefit analysis in many cases to help prioritize interventions, and virtually no
quantitative sectoral and macro-economic models for impact assessment, many
recommendations for climate actions are still qualitative and indicative and more attention
should be given to cross-sectoral issues.

The Romanian government’s process of preparing OPs has been running behind the original
schedule. At the time that the six sector rapid assessments were conducted, none of the draft
OPs were prepared and made available, neither was the National Rural Development Plan. In
the transport sector, the General Transport Master Plan (GTMP), an ex-ante conditionality of
the European Commission for transport interventions to be financed from the Operational
Programs, was not yet finalized. As a result, the World Bank team could not directly help
review the specific interventions proposed for operational programs or plans, or provide
comments and suggestions on how to integrate climate actions into them as requested. This
report remains a work in progress. The set of sectoral recommendations therefore are generic.

Nevertheless, the report, together with the six sector reports on which it is based, presents
rich information on the links between sector interventions and climate change and provides
Romania with many practical recommendations. It will be a good starting point for the
government to use as they begin to consider integrating actions that address climate change
into the operational programing for EU funds in 2014-2020.

Moving forward, the World Bank will continue to advise the government units and their
consultants on how to integrate climate-related recommendations into the OPs when the draft
OPs become available for review. As outlined in the climate change program, the World
Bank will continue the analysis through in-depth sectoral analysis and modeling across the
six sectors, further identifying and prioritizing a wide range of interventions addressing
climate change, and will further assist the Romanian government in developing an action
plan for addressing climate change and operationalizing its national climate change strategy.

The program’s next step is to carry out in-depth sectoral analysis and modeling to further
help Romania validate and prioritize these recommendations and propose strategic measures
and actions for fighting climate change.

                                               1. INTRODUCTION

1. Tackling the destructive effects of global warming is now a global priority. Despite ongoing
   global efforts to combat global warming, it is widely accepted that the average global
   temperature will continue to rise at an accelerated speed in coming decades. This increased
   warming, largely attributed to the rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by human
   activity, will have far-reaching impact on the earth's climate patterns and will pose a serious
   threat to human lives, economic development, and to the earth itself, on which human
   survival depends.

2. Controlling global warming poses a two-fold challenge for most countries: an obligation to
   mitigate GHG emissions as a contribution to global welfare; and the need to adapt to a
   changing climate. It requires a global and well-coordinated effort among all nations. Global
   mitigation polices and targeted adaptation action plans must be put in place nationally and
   internationally to effectively limit climate impacts on the environment, society, and
   economies.

3. As a leading force in international efforts to tackle climate change, the European Union is
   committed to becoming a highly energy-efficient, low-carbon economy. It has installed some
   of the world’s most ambitious climate and energy targets for 2020 and is the first region to
   have passed binding legislation to ensure that they are achieved.

4. As a member state of the European Union, Romania has also made a commitment to
   combating global warming. It is obligated to continue to implement climate change
   obligations due to EU membership. All energy-intensive large installations in Romania must
   participate in the EU cap-and-trade mechanism, or Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).
   Smaller installations and those in less energy-intensive sectors face country-specific targets
   that emissions from non-ETS sectors cannot be more than 19 percent higher in 2020 than in
   2005. Furthermore, Romania has committed to achieving, by 2020, a share of 24 percent of
   energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption (up from 18% in 2005).

5. The period of 2013-14 is an important one for EU member states and the move to low-carbon
   green growth because of the preparation of a new EU budget cycle in 2014-2020. The
   programming of the next cycle of sectoral Operational Programs (OPs) will need to reflect
   and integrate climate action on mitigation and adaptation. The European Council determined
   in February 2013 that the Multiannual Financial Framework will mainstream climate
   objectives, stating that “Climate action objectives will represent at least 20 percent of EU
   spending in the period 2014-2020 and therefore be reflected in the appropriate instruments to

                                                                                                                              22
   ensure that they contribute to strengthening energy security, building a low-carbon, resource
   efficient and climate resilient economy that they will enhance Europe's competitiveness and
   create more and greener jobs.”1

6. Romania needs to prepare for the next EU funding cycle, taking the CC challenges and
   opportunities to advance its economy towards a competitive, climate resilient, and low-
   carbon green economy. To do this, the Government of Romania (GoR) will need to put
   forward a comprehensive climate change strategy and an action plan with enough details to
   implement it, develop a strong knowledge base and analytic capacity to assess the cost-
   effectiveness of both policy and investment options, put mitigation and adaptation activities
   into action, and build institutional capacity to implement and support it.

7. To complement the efforts of the EU and other multilateral agencies, and in response to a
   request of the GoR for analytical and advisory assistance, the World Bank has developed, in
   conjunction with the Romanian Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, a
   Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS) Program. The RAS program focuses on
   operationalizing its national climate change strategy and action plan, identifying and
   integrating climate-related actions in new operational programs, building a solid analytical
   base for impact assessment and climate-related decision making, and enhancing climate-
   friendly practices and monitoring systems via the following four components:
            Component A: Develop and operationalize a climate change strategy and action plan;
            Component B: Identify and integrate climate actions into the 2014-2020 sectoral
             Operational Programs;
            Component C: Build a strong and sustainable analytic capacity and suitable
             knowledge base for in-depth sectoral and macroeconomic analysis of climate change
             mitigation and adaptation measures; and
            Component D: Support Government institutions in implementing, monitoring, and
             evaluating climate actions including carbon trading.

8. This report is a synthesis of component B outputs. It is based on the rapid assessments of
   climate risks and actions in six sectors—energy, transport, urban, water, agriculture and
   forestry—conducted under component B. The purpose of this report is to summarize the
   findings and present the final recommendations for integrating climate actions into sectoral
   OPs for EU funds in 2014-2020 for consideration of GoR.

        2. CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON ROMANIA

   Global Trend

10. Despite some arguments to the contrary, the preponderance of evidence says humans are the
    main cause of global warming. According to a recent assessment of the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013), “each of the last three decades has been successively
    warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850.”2 The World Bank
    Report, “Turning down the Heat” (World Bank 2012), explains that there is a 20%
    probability of increased global warming by 4°C by 2060, and an 80% chance of it by 2100.
    In spite of the international community’s efforts to hold warming below 2°C, it is expected
    that a greater than 3°C warming will occur. This is significantly above the preindustrial level
    of 0.8°C.3 Tackling the destructive effects of global warming has become a global priority.

11. This increased warming, largely attributed to the rise in Green House Gas (GHG) emissions
    caused by human activity, will have a far-reaching impact on the earth's climate patterns and
    pose a serious threat to human lives, economic development and to the earth itself, on which
    human survival depends. Although it is imagined that “most aspects of climate change will
    persist for many centuries even if emissions of CO2 are stopped,”4 global mitigation polices
    and targeted adaptation action plans must be put in place to effectively limit the impact of
    climate on the environment, society and economies.

12. Changes in climate patterns—including an increase in temperature, changes in precipitation,
    and decreases in ice and snow—have led to a wide range of observable effects such as (i)
    biodiversity loss: the survival of certain species will be threatened or become extinct because
    of disappearing habitat, changing ecosystems, and acidifying oceans; (ii) rising seas:
    resulting from melting glaciers and the thermal expansion of oceans, both of which increases
    the risk of flooding; (iii) extreme weather: more frequent extreme weather events causing
    heat waves, surges in wildfires, increased flooding and drought, more severe hurricanes; and
    (iv) human health threats: the spread of disease and decrease in air quality as well as possible
    death arising from devastating heat waves5.

13. This situation poses a two-fold global challenge: an obligation to mitigate GHG emissions as
    a contribution to global welfare, and the need to adapt to a changing climate.

14. The impact of climate change varies from one region to another, a fact that is driven, among
    other things, by the geological characteristics of the regions, the uneven distribution of solar
    heating, and the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface. Some
    regions will warm much more than others and some will receive more rainfall, while other
    regions will be exposed to more frequent droughts. Due to these regional variations, it is
    necessary to implement a targeted approach to addressing climate impact.

15. Like other regions of the world, Europe is experiencing the effects of climate change. Over
    the last decade, the average temperature over land in Europe was 1.3°C above pre-industrial
    levels, making it the warmest decade on record6. Observed effects across Europe include: an
    overall rise in sea levels in most coastal areas; changes to freshwater systems such as a
    decrease in river flows in the south and east; increase in reported flood events and in the
    frequency and intensity of droughts, especially in southern Europe; changes to terrestrial
    biodiversity and ecosystems; reduction in forest growth due to storms, pests and diseases, a
    reduced demand for heating and an increased demand for cooling due to the rise in
    temperature, and effects on human health.

   Implications on Romania

16. Like all other countries, Romania is not immune to change. 2007 was Romania’s warmest
    year in two decades (average temperature 11.5° C), while the coldest average temperature
    (8.4°C)7 happened in 1985. In 2005, Romania suffered historic floods which caused 76
    deaths and significant property damage, and 2007 brought the country’s most severe drought
    in the last 60 years8. The effects of these extreme weather events adversely affected the
    country through significant economic loss in agriculture, transport, energy supply, and water
    management. In a scenario of increased global warming by 4°C, the challenges and impacts
    of climate change would be certainly deteriorated in Romania. Consequently, adaptation to
    climate change and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is an important priority for
    Romania.

17. Romania is also a contributor to climate change through its GHG emissions, despite a
    significant decrease in GHG emissions due to economic slowdown since 1989. Total

18. It is evident that the energy sector contributes about 70% of GHG emissions and should be
    the priority sector for mitigation. The transport sector, although attributing only 12% in total
    GHG emissions so far, has been increasing rapidly—up 36% since 1990. This trend towards
    upswing remains likely in the future and the sector should have our full attention for
    containing GHG emission growth moving forward. The urban sector is where 56% of the
    population and the majority of economic activities are located. It is a diverse and complex
    area for both mitigation and adaptation. The agricultural sector remains traditional and
    dominant in the Romanian economy in terms of land occupation and population. Over 15%
    of total GHG emission is attributable to agriculture, and the sector is also very vulnerable to
    CC. It is an important sector to factor into the potential for climate actions. Romania’s forest
    sector, rich in forestry resources, represents major carbon sink with an increasing role to play
    in CC.

19. Romania has the lowest energy consumption per capita in the EU, but one of the highest
    energy intensities.9 The low rate of energy consumption stems from a slowdown period in the
    GDP and also from the shutting down of many large, inefficient energy- intensive industries

   which were the main contributor to the nation’s economy during the country’s period of
   centralized economy. Despite the low energy consumption, Romania continues to lag behind
   in energy conservation and efficiency, which has resulted in the country having one of the
   highest energy intensities in Europe.

20. The Government of Romania, together with the European Union and other multilateral
    agencies, is working collaboratively to help develop and integrate mitigation and adaptation
    measures into Romania’s national policies, plans, programs, and strategies which would
    thereby shift its development path towards a climate resilient, low-carbon green economy.

                   3. EU REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

21. The EU has taken a leading role in terms of adaptation, and the Commission is providing
    guidelines for formulating adaptation strategies designed to help EU countries develop,
    implement and review their adaptation policies.10 In addition, by 2014 the Commission will
    develop an adaptation preparedness scoreboard, identifying key indicators for measuring
    Member States' level of readiness. EU LIFE funding is provided to support capacity building
    and to step up adaptation action in Europe. (2013-2020). It is actively engaged internationally
    in climate change negotiations and in supporting partner countries in implementing
    adaptation and mitigation strategies through active programs such as the EU’s Global
    Climate Change Alliance.11 12

   EU Climate-related Targets

22. The targets and policies related to these climate change obligations are primarily articulated
    in three major EU policy documents: (i) The Energy Package, (ii) Europe 2020 and (iii) The
    Roadmap for 2050. A range of EU policy and regulations further supports the
    implementation of both adaptation and mitigation measures.

23. Europe 2020. Europe 2020 is the major policy framework for EU policy from 2014-2020. It
    promotes smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth, and establishes measurable EU targets in
    five key areas including specific targets related to climate change and energy (target area 3).
    The strategy and associated targets address two dimensions of climate change 1) building a
    competitive low-carbon economy that makes efficient use of resources and is resilient to
    climate risk, and 2) protecting the environment and preventing biodiversity loss. It also
    outlines seven flagship initiatives the European Commission supports to catalyze progress in
    these areas. The flagship initiative on "Resource efficient Europe" aims to help decouple
    economic growth from the use of resources, support the shift towards a low-carbon economy,
    increase the use of renewable energy sources, modernize the transport sector and promote
    energy efficiency. In addition, the EU has set itself a “green growth roadmap” for building a
    competitive green/low-carbon Europe by 2050 which involves reduction of emissions of
    greenhouse gases to 80-95% below 1990 levels.13

24. The 20-20-20 Target. The EU’s climate and energy package outlines the "20-20-20 targets.”
    It is binding legislation approved in December 2008 to ensure that the EU achieves a 20
    percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels; raises the share of EU
    energy consumption produced from renewable resources to 20 percent; and improves energy
    efficiency by 20 percent. The EU has also offered to increase its emissions’ reduction to
    30% by 2020 if other major emitting countries in the developed and developing world
    commit to tackle their fair share of a global emissions reduction effort. 14 In Romania, these
    targets translate into a power generation mix aiming to achieve a 38% renewable energy
    generation share by 2020, with gross final energy consumption containing 24 percent of
    energy from renewable resources (up from 18% in 2005), and targeted energy intensity
    improvements of 1.5 % p.a.15

25. The 2050 Roadmap. In a longer term perspective, the European Commission’s “Roadmap
    for Moving to a Competitive Low-Carbon Economy in 2050” is a long-term policy plan
    suggesting that the EU cut its emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, with
    interim milestones of 40 percent cuts by 2030 and 60 percent cuts by 2040. It proposes how
    the main sectors responsible for Europe's emissions--power generation, industry, transport,
    buildings and construction, and also agriculture--can cost-effectively make the transition to a
    low-carbon economy. The Roadmap argues that the transition to a low-carbon society can
    boost Europe's economy thanks to increased innovation and investment in clean technologies
    and low- or zero-carbon energy. Energy efficiency will be a key driver of the transition and
    allow significant savings in fuel costs (reducing imports and supporting energy security). The
    Roadmap aims to give direction to member states’ sectoral policies, low-carbon strategies,
    and long-term investment plans.

26. The European Commission also recently proposed scenarios for 2030 targets as an
    intermediate step between the 20-20-20 goal of 2020 targets and the ambitious 80 to 95%
    reduction objectives of the 2050 Roadmap. These targets were first proposed in a green paper
    of the Commission published for consultation in March 2013. This proposal includes specific
    targets of 40% reduction in GHG emissions, and higher shares of renewable energy (around
    30%), energy efficiency improvements and better and smarter energy infrastructure in

   investments by 2030. While there are no country specific targets proposed so far, some EU
   countries, e.g., the EU “Green Growth” group, have called for an ambitious EU emissions
   reduction offer to be put on the table. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change (UNFCCC), many Parties have put forth both emissions reductions targets
   and actions for negotiation in the year 2020. The 2030 targets proposed by the EU could be
   viewed as ambitious.

   Other Related Regulations and Policies

27. Beyond the above-listed policies there are a range of EU related policies and
    recommendations relevant to climate change. For example, improved diversion of materials
    from landfills may assist urban centers in Romania with GHG reductions. Diversion rates are
    currently quite low. There is, however, an EU regulation mandating diversion of 65% of
    organics and 50% of recyclables by 2020.

28. Broadly speaking, EU policies and regulations related to climate change can be divided into
    7 main categories: (1) greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting; (2) EU emissions trading
    systems; (3) effort-sharing decisions; (4) carbon capture and storage; (5) transport/fuels; (6)
    ozone layer protection; and (7) fluorinated gases.

   Climate Related Financing

29. In the forthcoming 2014-2020 financial perspective, Romania is expected to receive an
    allocation of about €29 billion from the European Structure and Investment Funds (ESIF)
    plus national co‐financing in line with the Thematic Objectives of the EU 2020 and
    Romania's national priorities. Improved access to funding will be a critical factor in building
    a climate-resilient economy. The 2014-2020 Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF)
    adopted by the European Council in February 2013 requires increasing climate-related
    expenditures to at least 20% of the EU spending as a political objective.

30. The EC Implementing Regulations with the methodology for tracking climate related
    expenditure (and other implementing regulations) for the five ESI funds are under
    preparation and will be published in the spring of 2014. A target of 20% climate related
    expenditures will be integrated into detailed annual budgets. Romania and other less-
    developed Member States have the legal target of a minimum of 12% of ERDF for low-
    carbon thematic objective (TO), i.e., TO 4, but are expected to reach 20% on climate related
    expenditures for the five ESI funds either by spending more on TO4 or by including TO5
    (adaptation) and through the mainstreaming of climate action across the remaining eleven
    thematic objectives. The mainstreaming of climate action is being emphasized by the

31. While there is no internationally agreed definition of climate-related financing to date, two
    approaches coexist and efforts are made towards greater harmonization. The Rio Markers
    for Climate Change were established by the OECD Development Assistance Committee
    (DAC) to track aid flows targeted at climate action, There is one marker for mitigation (data
    available from 1998 onwards) and one for adaptation (data available from 2010 onwards).
    The Rio Markers for Climate Change allow an approximate quantification of climate-related
    aid flows based on aid activity objectives. Activities (and related funding) are tagged
    following a three-tiered scoring system:
            “Principal objective”: promoting mitigation or adaptation is one of the principal
             reasons for undertaking the activity;
            “Significant objective: activity has other prime objectives, but has been
             formulated or adjusted to help meet climate concerns;
            “Not targeted”: activity found not targeted to the policy objective (adaptation or
             mitigation).
   Data on funding for principal and significant objectives should be shown separately and
   the sum referred to as the “estimate” or “upper bound” of climate-change-related aid.

32. The Multilateral Development Banks’ (MDBs) Joint Approach on Climate Finance
    Reporting builds on Rio Markers for Climate Change, using similar definitions and
    eligibility criteria for adaptation and mitigation. Yet the approaches diverge as the Rio
    Markers are based on the objectives of a project while the MDB approach is based on the
    activities the project promotes. It thus adds granularity to the Rio Markers, as it goes beyond
    the project objective and examines activities the project supports, at the most detailed level of
    financing information available.

33. To assist Member States to calculate the 2014-2020 budgetary spending on climate actions,
    the EC has prepared a draft methodology for tracking climate change-related expenditures in
    its Guidance Fiche No. 2 “Implementing Act on the Nomenclature of Categories of
    Intervention and the Methodology for Tracking of Climate Related Expenditure Under
    Cohesion Policy.” The document is currently in a provisional phase with on-going
    consultation with Member States and should be finalized in 2014. It provides information on
    the support for climate change objectives using methodologies based on the categories of
    intervention or measures adopted by the EC. More information on the categories of
    interventions by sector and their coefficients for the calculation of support to the climate
    change objectives can be found in this report’s Annex.

34. Despite the methodology and co-efficiencies the EC is proposing its’ member states use to
    calculate the percentage of climate-related expenditures, it is essential for a country to fully
    understand the climate risks it is facing and the links between its proposed EU-funded
    investments and GHG mitigation and/or in-country adaptation to climate change. Also, the
    contributing share of a particular intervention category on mitigation and adaptation varies
    from region to region and country to country. Therefore, the rapid assessments carried out
    under Component B are necessary to help the Romanian government understand the climate
    change impacts of its proposed investments for EU-funds in 2014-2020 and to better
    prioritize them in the OPs.

             FRAMEWORK, AND ORGANIZATIONAL SETUP FOR
               ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE IN ROMANIA

35. Romania has been actively participating in global efforts to address climate change. In
    February 2001, the country ratified the Kyoto Protocol (KP) (Law 3/2001) becoming the first
    country listed in Annex 1 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
    (UNFCC) to do so. Through early ratification of the KP, Romania committed to reducing
    GHG emissions and also showed global leadership in responding to climate change. Since
    then, the Government has been working to develop and implement coherent policies on
    climate change with yearly reporting of GHG emissions and also to translate EU-specific
    legislation into a national context.

36. European integration has been an important political objective of all Romanian governments
    and political parties since the country formally submitted the application for accession to the
    European Union on June 22, 1995. In the year 2000, a significant effort was made to draft the
    country’s accession strategy into the EU. Romania signed the EU Treaty of Accession on
    April 25, 2005 and became a member state in 2007. Since joining the EU, it has implemented
    a series of climate change policies including the development of the National Strategy and
    Action Plan on Climate Change, the implementation of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme,
    and the successive energy and climate change packages.

   National Targets and Strategies

37. As an EU member state, Romania has committed to taking climate action. The following
    table summarizes the EU-20-20 targets and Romania’s 2020 agreed targets as well as its
    current status.

                                                                                                                              34
38. The first national strategy and action plan for climate change was completed in 2005,
    covering the period 2005-2008. The strategy focused on several KP and UNFCCC
    requirements as well as EU legislation. The strategy had five main objectives: (i) establishing
    the legal framework and improving the national system for the estimation of anthropogenic
    emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all GHGs not controlled by the Montreal
    Protocol, and establishing the National GHG Inventory; (ii) creating the legal, institutional,
    and procedural framework and implementing the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS);
    developing the National Allocation Plan for 2007 and 2008 -2012; (iii) setting up the legal
    and procedural framework for the National GHG Registry; operationalizing the Registry and
    connecting it to the Community International Transaction Log and the International
    Transaction Log; (iv) setting up national procedures for promoting JI projects under Track I
    and Track II, allowing project developers greater flexibility in preparing project
    documentation and providing a shorter approval process; and (v) establishing the national
    Guidelines on Adaptation to Climate Change, designed to address the challenges of adapting
    to the impacts of climate change.

39. EU directives associated with the implementation of the EU-ETS mechanism (2003/87/CE
    and 2004/104/CE) have been transposed and implemented in the national Romanian context.
    A national allocation plan was completed for 2007 as well as for the second period of the
    EU-ETS (2008-2012). Furthermore, the EUA (EU emission allowances) market was created
    on a platform of energy market trading (OPCOM) This market remains operational. A
    number of Joint Implementation (JI) Projects were undertaken in parallel (about 24) leading
    to a sizeable quantity of Emission Reduction Units (ERU’s). Romania is currently
    implementing the 3rd energy and climate change package of the EU and is in the process of
    enhancing its capabilities for emission evaluation and prediction as well as the associated
    institutional framework.

40. In July 2013, the Romanian Government approved a 2013-2020 National Climate Change
    Strategy with both adaptation and mitigation components. Mitigation actions are elaborated
    for the following economic sectors: energy; transport; industrial processes; solvents and the
    use of other products; agriculture; the use of lands, the change of land use, forestry; and
    waste management. The Strategy’s adaptation component lists 13 priority sectors for
    monitoring the impacts of climate change: industry; agriculture and fisheries; tourism; public
    health; infrastructure, construction and urban planning; transport; water resources; forests;
    energy; biodiversity; insurance; recreational activities; and education. It also identifies
    adaptation measures to guide the development of policies for the above-noted sectors. They
    include (i) integration of measures for adjustment to the effects of climate change at the time
    of implementation, and the amendment of current and future legislation and policies; (ii)

   revision of all national strategies and programs to include a requirement for the adjustment of
   sector policies; (iii) public awareness and development of communication that will help
   implement adaptation measures at a local level.

   Legislative and Policy Framework

41. As a signatory country of UN treaties and an EU Member State, the regulatory and policy
    framework for environment and climate change in Romania has been developed to be in
    compliance with UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol requirements as well as with EU legislation.
    National legislation can be divided into the following categories:

          a)     legislation on emissions inventory: aimed at covering the types of emissions and
                 evaluation methods as well as the institutional entities involved, the information
                 (data, terms, etc.) to be reported, and the assembly of the reporting documents.
          b)     legislative framework to coordinate and support activities related to participation
                 in the mechanisms under Articles 6, 12 and 17 of the Kyoto Protocol: including the
                 JI project cycle and founding of the National Commission on Climate Change as
                 well as the conditions needed to trade assigned amount units and associated
                 institutional responsibilities.
          c)     EU-ETS related legislation: covering the transposed specific EU directives and the
                 setup of the Register of Emissions as well as the norms for trading commercial
                 operators for the power market in Romania and other market platforms.
          d)     monitoring and verification: including primary and secondary legislation that
                 ensures compliance with the requirements of UNFCCC and EU.

   Organizational Setup

42. The Government of Romania’s organizational setup for tackling climate change has been
    constantly evolving. At present, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MECC)
    is the authority responsible for coordinating climate change policies and programs at the
    national level. MECC was reorganized by GD No.48/2013, an act that restructured the
    organization and operation of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, and
    modified some legal acts related to environment protection and climate change. MECC is
    also the coordinator of the National Commission on Climate Change (NCCC). Established
    under GD No. 658/2006, the NCCC was given a role in coordinating across various
    government ministries and agencies. Established in 2006 NCCC has been operating only on
    an ad-hoc basis, mainly for the approval of Joint Implementation Projects. Beyond that,
    NCCC has been inactive. MECC is now proposing to restructure NCCC and improve its
    functionality. A new draft GD foresees two levels of operation, technical and political. It

                                                                                                                              36
   clarifies and enlarges the responsibilities of the NCCC, and targets broader participation (35
   institutions) in issues related to climate change. However, strengthening the inter-institutional
   cooperation and enforcing the coordination role of MECC in the area of climate change
   remains a real challenge that demands a longer dynamic and iterative process.

43. There are also other line ministries and agencies dealing with CC tasks including, but not
    limited to, the Ministry of Economy (MoE) responsible for industry, energy and economic
    policy; the National Authority for Energy Regulation (NAER) which plays an important role
    in the energy market, energy efficiency, and renewable energy policy; the Ministry of
    Transport responsible for all transportation sectors (air, sea, road, rail), as well as
    infrastructure (roads, railways, air infrastructure, shipping, etc.), except for urban transport,
    which is covered by local authorities; the Ministry of Regional Development and Public
    Administration (MRDPA) responsible for climate-change-related issues in the areas of
    infrastructure, construction and urban planning; the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
    Development (MARD) responsible for the climate-change-related issues in the areas of
    agriculture and rural development.

   Area for Improvement

44. While Romania is making progress in addressing climate change institutionally, there is
    much room for improvement. As mentioned above, coordination among government
    agencies over climate change is weak and urgently needs to be strengthened. One solution as
    already proposed is to restructure and strengthen the NCCC. The awareness of climate
    impacts and action by line ministries and the general public is low. Basically, there is lack of
    adequate sector strategies and policies requiring integration of climate change into sectoral
    programs and investment. The capacity for implementing climate action at the national and
    local level barely exists, neither does research capacity, monitoring systems, and public
    education programs on climate change. The following sections will try to assess the need for
    climate action within and across sectors and propose interventions to address some of the
    areas in the OPs.

      5. INTRODUCTION TO ROMANIA’S PROGRAMMING FOR EU
                       FUNDS IN 2014-2020

45. In the new EU budgetary cycle for 2014-2020, Romania is expected to invest about €29
    billion allocated from European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), which include the
    European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the
    Cohesion Fund (CF), European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and the
    European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), plus national co‐financing to support the
    eleven Thematic Objectives of the EU 2020 and Romania's national priorities. Of these
    Thematic Objectives, two directly target climate change, referring to “supporting the shift
    towards a low‐carbon economy in all sectors” (TO no. 4), and “promoting climate change
    adaptation, risk prevention, and management” (TO no. 5).

46. The urgent need for CC-related actions is clearly reflected in the Europe 2020 Strategy and
    the EU’s ambitious 20/20/20 targets for climate change mitigation— i.e., to cut greenhouse
    gas emissions by 20%; reduce energy consumption by 20% through increased energy
    efficiency; and meet 20% of energy needs from renewable sources.

47. In light of the new EU budget cycle, the period from 2014-2020 is an important one for EU
    member states and the move to low-carbon green growth. The programming of the next
    cycle of sector Operational Programs will need to reflect and integrate climate action on
    mitigation and adaptation. As a member state of the EU, the Government of Romania is
    committed to fighting climate change and pursuing low-carbon development.

48. The Government is preparing the Romanian Partnership Agreement (PA) for the 2014-2020
    Programming Period (draft version, October 2013) and the Operational Programmes (OPs)
    (currently under preparation), which will be the main documents providing the framework
    for Romania’s management of the 2014-20 ESIF.

   The Structure of 2014-2020 Operational Programs

49. In preparation for the forthcoming programming period, an Inter-Institutional Committee for
    the Partnership Agreement (CIAP) was set up. CIAP is a consultative forum at the national
    level that works under direct coordination of the Ministry of European Funds (MEF) and has
    prepared sectoral operational programs for the next budgetary exercise of EU funds in 2014 –
    2020. It is made up of 12 sections/consultative committees, out of which 10 are technical and
    2 are representative of regional development and territorial dimensions. Each includes

   representatives from public authorities (national, regional, local), socio-economic sectors,
   academia, and civil society.

50. According to the draft PA, the 2014-2020 programs comprise thematic OPs, covering the
    following areas: large infrastructure, human capital, competitiveness, administrative capacity,
    rural development, fisheries, regional development, European Territorial Cooperation with
    Hungary and Bulgaria respectively, TA and direct payments for agriculture. The first four
    OPs are administrated by MEF and implemented by a number of intermediary bodies. Figure
    1 below shows the proposed institutional structure for preparing and managing OPs.

51. To achieve the EU goal that at least 20% of the Union budget must go to climate-change-
    related interventions in the 2014-2020 ESIF programs, ESIF-proposed programs should be
    distinguished according to their climate relevance. The following can be identified as directly
    related to climate change mitigation and/or adaptation.

52. Large Infrastructure OP. The OP will be administrated by the MEF and implemented by 4
    Intermediary Bodies (IBs): Department of Infrastructure Projects and Foreign Investments,
    Ministry of Transport (MT), Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MECC),
    Ministry of Economy (ME). Proposed priority investments mostly from energy, transport,
    and urban sectors include:
                a) road infrastructure Trans-European Transport Network (TEN‐T).
                b) railway TEN ‐T; harbors TEN –T.
                c) public utilities services (water and used water, waste management).
                d) risk prevention & management and adaptation to CC (increase the resilience
         of infrastructure and services; combat drought through non‐structural measures to
         mitigate the effects of climate change ; strengthen national disaster management systems
         to all risks).
                e) energy efficiency in industry (production, transport and distribution for
         renewable energy, cogeneration thermo, and systems).

53. Regional Operation Programs. Administrated by the Ministry of Regional Development and
    Public Administration, its proposed priority investments are from urban and regional
    development, including:
       - local road, railway and harbor infrastructure
       - urban /local development (including public transportation and related infrastructure
           cultural heritage, sport facilities, multifunctional facilities)
       - energy efficiency (including rehabilitation of networks as needed)
       - education and social infrastructure
       - health infrastructure
       - competitiveness and business environment for SMEs, including financial instruments.

54. European Territorial Cooperation OPs, again administrated and implemented by the
    MRDPA, aims to fund Territorial Cooperation Programs between Romania, Hungary, and
    Bulgaria, respectively.

55. Rural Development OP, administrated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
    (MARD) and implemented by 2 IBs (MARD and MRDPA), with priority investments in
    agriculture and rural development, forestry, and public infrastructure in rural areas (roads,
    water, used waste-water community center).

56. The Competitiveness OP and Technical Assistance OP should also provide interventions
    related to climate change.

   Coordination, Implementation Arrangements and Budget Allocation

57. The institutional framework for the 2014-2020 ESIF programming period currently continues
    to be revised. The main players are MEF, MARD and MRDPA. Beyond its coordination role,
    MEF will act in the new institutional set-up as MA for four OPs (Large Infrastructure,
    Human Capital, Competitiveness and TA OPs). MARD will act as Managing Authority for
    Rural development and Fisheries OPs, whereas MRDPA will act as MA for Administrative
    Capacity, Regional and ETC OPs.

58. The institutional structure for managing 2014-2020 ESIF (according to draft PA, version
    October 2013) is shown in Figure 2 on the next page.

59. It is too early to know the exact allocation of the EU budget by type of fund and thematic
    objective. From the indicative percentage presented in the draft PA, the transport sector will
    take over 20% of the total ESI funds (and over 13% of the Cohesion Fund) under the
    thematic objective “Promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key
    network infrastructures. The TO of low carbon economy may use up to 10% of the total
    funds with the majority from ERDF. The budget for CC adaptation is mainly from CF and
    EAFRD. Although the percentages are indicative and subject to revision during the
    preparation of OPs, funding availability is one of determining factors when proposing and
    integrating climate actions in OPs.

            6. SUMMARY OF RAPID ASSESSMENTS AND THEIR
                   RECOMMENDATIONS BY SECTOR

60. For Romania to become a climate resilient society that has mainstreamed climate policies
    and actions into its sustainable economic growth strategy, all sectors need to reorient their
    policies towards achieving these goals. An immediate task is to identify and integrate climate
    actions into upcoming sectoral Operational Programs (OPs) for EU funds in 2014-2020.
    Rapid assessments of sectoral risks and actions were conducted in each of six study sectors:
    energy, transport, urban (planning, solid waste and water systems), water, agriculture, and
    forestry. They identified and assessed key climate risks in each sector, discussed the
    challenges and opportunities, and recommended actions to be considered in the OPs or
    NRDP for better incorporating climate change mitigation and/or adaptation concerns.

61. While in-depth analysis and economic modeling work couldn’t be done during the short
    period of rapid assessments, the selection of and recommendation for climate interventions
    was based on use of the following standard criteria:
         Potential for cost-effective GHG reduction or adaptation to a changed climate – this
           was based on reported experiences and studies from other countries.
         Appropriateness to the Romanian environment – proposed measures needed to be
           able to fit within the developing cultural, administrative, and social framework of
           Romania.
         Appropriate measures for OPs – in general, the focus was on investment projects, or
           on technical assistance (TA) actions that could guide further investment from both
           EU and national funds.
         Implementation barriers / risks to benefit delivery – Priority should be given to
           interventions such as TA that would address barriers and risks prior to significant
           investment.

62. The summary of findings and recommendations by sector is presented below.
                                                 6.1. Energy Sector

   Sector Characteristics and Trends

63. The energy sector is the largest emitter of GHG, accounting for 70% of total greenhouse gas
    (GHG) emissions (excluding LULUCF) in Romania. It has also contributed 70% of the
    overall GHG emissions reduction since 1989. The sector naturally has the full attention for
    mitigation. Three quarters of the energy sector’s GHG emissions are from power and heat
    generation and non-transport fuel consumption. Continued de-carbonization of the energy
    sector, through low-carbon power and heat supply options and by improving efficiency in
    energy conversion, transmission, distribution and consumption, is essential to Romania’s
    climate change mitigation agenda.

64. Economic growth and energy consumption in Romania has been decoupled since 1998, and
    the energy intensity of the economy, measured by primary energy consumption per unit of
    gross domestic product, has been decreasing. After the large contractions of the economy
    and energy consumption in the early to late 1990s, Romania’s GDP rose by 53 percent from
    2000 to 2011 while energy demand remained flat. In large part this is due to the structural
    adjustments of the economy toward higher-value-added manufacturing and services and
    significant improvements of industrial energy efficiency.

65. Romania has substantially lower per-capita energy consumption compared to high-income
    EU countries. A significant increase in energy demand is expected if the economy continues
    to grow. Per capita fuel and electricity consumptions in 2011 were 51 and 47 percent of the
    EU27 average, respectively. Even with continued improvement in energy efficiency, energy
    demand is likely to grow significantly as Romania catches up with high-income countries.

66. Primary energy consumption in Romania is characterized by a relatively high and increasing
    share of low-carbon energy sources but a worrisome trend of declining natural gas
    consumption. From 2000 to 2011, the share of primary energy sourced from nuclear, hydro
    and wind power, and biomass increased from 15 to 22 percent, while that of natural gas
    declined from 37 to 30 percent. The share of coal crept up from 20 to 22 percent. Overall, the
    carbon footprint of the energy sector shrank by 7 percent, from 92.89 to 86.32 million tons of
    CO2 equivalent.

67. Final energy consumption patterns in Romania are expected to converge toward those of the
    largest EU economies in the long-term, indicating significant increases in quantity and share

   of energy for the transportation and services sectors. Energy demand of the services sector
   surged by 2.6 times from 2000 to 2011, albeit from a relatively small basis. Transport energy
   demand also grew by 25 percent during the same period, while residential and industrial
   energy demand, the largest and second largest among all sectors, declined by 6 and 21
   percent, respectively.

68. Energy for selected industrial customers and all residential customers is subsidized. Energy-
    intensive state-owned enterprises (SOEs) benefit from low, preferential electricity and gas
    prices. State and local subsidies for residential district heating cover about 50 percent of
    residential customer costs. Under legislation passed in 2012 and 2013, regulated electricity
    and gas prices for non-households will be fully liberalized by January 2014 and January
    2015, respectively, and regulated electricity and gas prices for households will be liberalized
    by January 2018 and January 2019, respectively. No definite timeline has been given to
    removing district heat subsidies.

69. The broad energy sector reforms advocated by the 2003 Road Map for the Energy Field
    remain largely unimplemented, hindering private sector investments and the development of
    viable public sector energy companies, both are crucial to Romania’s energy security and
    cleaner energy future. While some progress in sector reforms has been made, the key
    findings and recommendations on sector governance in the 2011 Functional Review of the
    Ministry of Economy by the World Bank remain relevant and valid.

   Potentials for Improvement and Climate Actions

70. Continued reduction of the carbon footprint of power and heat generation in Romania
    requires a significant increase of investments in wind and solar power and supporting
    infrastructure, and in high-efficiency gas-fired generation in the medium term (up to 2020).
    In the long term (beyond 2020), while these supply options will remain important, Romania’s
    mitigation efforts will also benefit from increased nuclear power generation and potential
    opportunities offered by carbon capture and storage (CCS).

71. The power and heat supply sectors have a large amount of obsolete physical assets which
    will need to be scrapped or selectively modernized. For example, about 80 percent of the
    fossil fuel-fired generation capacity is deemed inefficient and obsolete and about 60 percent
    of the power distribution networks need to be modernized. Investments in retrofitting fossil
    fuel-fired power plants in the last 20 years have yielded little return, since many of these
    plants remain too expensive to operate.

                                                                                                                              45
72. The continued deterioration and decline of the district heating systems is particularly
    distressing and undermines the quality of life in Romanian cities. The number of operating
    district heating systems stood at about 100 in 2011, compared with over 300 in 1995. Many
    of the remaining operations are no longer economically viable because a substantial number
    of dissatisfied customers have disconnected themselves from the systems and chosen
    alternative heating options. The inefficiencies and high losses in the district heating systems
    also make them among the most costly to operate in the EU. A multi-year comprehensive
    program is needed to both modernize the economically viable district heating systems and
    improve their efficiency and service quality, and also implement sector reforms to restore
    financial sustainability to district heating companies.

73. Despite good progress, Romania still lags significantly behind most EU countries in the
    broadest measure of energy efficiency and in key end-user sectors. Its energy intensity
    denominated by GDP in purchasing power parity was about 18 percent higher than the EU
    average in 2011. The efficiency gap is most pronounced in residential space heating: specific
    heat consumption (kgoe/m2) is 32 percent higher than comparable best EU practices; and in
    two dominating manufacturing energy users, chemicals manufacturing, where value-added
    energy intensity is over 4 times higher than the EU average (indicating structural issues), and
    steel making where energy intensity per ton of steel is 70 percent higher than the EU average.
    These three end-use areas combined account for roughly 40 percent of Romania’s final
    energy consumption.

74. Thermal retrofit of residential buildings is a huge challenge both financially, and
    implementation-wise. Only about 1 percent of the 150 million m2 or so apartment buildings
    determined in need of thermal retrofit had been retrofitted as of 2012. Despite very high
    capital subsidies (up to 80 percent) provided by the national and local governments, many
    low income households remain reluctant to participate. At about €80/m2, the total
    investments for retrofitting the entire stock amounts to €12 billion. Turning this big cost into
    a big economic opportunity is perhaps the most challenging energy efficiency agenda in
    Romania.

75. Many of the legal and regulatory requirements to enable improved energy efficiency are
    dealt with on paper with uneven implementation. The major exception is energy price reform,
    with an unfinished agenda in removing the large subsidies for natural gas and district heat.
    These general subsidies are major disincentives for energy consumers to engage in energy
    efficiency actions and divert public funds from more productive uses.

76. Over €2 billion financing were available for energy efficiency investments during 2007-2013,
    including about €800 million in EU funds. While this is has been far from sufficient to

                                                                                                                              46
   address the large energy efficiency financing needs in Romania, the institutional support and
   technical capacity to implement and deliver energy efficiency investments does not appear to
   be adequate at either the national or the local levels. This is caused by a lack of incentives
   and information, and necessary skill upgrades and administrative improvements, such as
   strategic planning, prioritization, systematic evaluations, and coordination between the
   different levels of government. Implementation and delivery challenges will continue to grow
   in the next seven years.

   Estimated Investment Needs

77. The overall investment costs of the government’s power sector development plan during
    2014-2020 is estimated to be about €14 billion with an estimated public funding of €3.6
    billion. About half of the total investment cost will be devoted to the construction of two
    new nuclear reactors and retrofitting existing coal-fired power plants which will be primarily
    used as back-up units for the nuclear capacity. Since the financing of the nuclear units
    remains in limbo due to a lack of investor interest, it is unlikely that they will be completed
    by 2020, leading to a substantial increase in the use of inefficient fossil fuel-fired units in the
    outer years of the 2014-2020 period assuming a robust growth in power demand .

78. About €2 billion capital savings could be achieved with reduced overall cost of electricity in
    an alternative power generation scenario from 2014 to 2020, if the Government chooses to
    source additional generation capacity primarily from high-efficiency gas-fired units, wind
    and solar PV. The reduced need for public funding amounts to EUR 636 million. The rapid
    assessment compared an alternative power generation scenario with the existing government
    plan drafted in 2011 and concluded that the alternative is cheaper and more likely attainable
    by postponing the construction of the nuclear units and scrapping the old coal fired units
    instead of retrofitting them.

79. The estimated subsidies for wind, solar PV and biomass (steam) through the existing green
    certificate scheme is expected to reach €220 million by 2020 to support the alternative
    scenario’s significantly higher installed capacity of wind and solar PV. The current green
    certificate scheme (already scaled back since July 2013) is evaluated and deemed sufficient
    to support the additional expansion of wind and solar PV power with a very small impact on
    end-user electricity bills (about €3/MWh additional cost).

80. The estimated investment in end-use energy efficiency improvements—implementable during
    2014-2020, and based on a few selected large-scale interventions such as building thermal
    retrofits, refrigerator upgrades and industrial energy efficiency—amounts to over €6 billion,

   of which about 28 percent, or about 1.7 billion is expected to be financed by public funds,
   including EU and government funds.

   Recommended Actions

81. Combined efforts in investments, sector reforms and implementation and delivery are
    required to secure reliable energy supply for economic growth and improving the quality of
    life on the one hand while increasing the share of clean energy sources, including energy
    efficiency, on the other. These efforts should be guided by an overarching national energy
    and climate strategy jointly prepared by the concerned ministries. For the 2014-2020 period
    this rapid assessment has identified three thematic priorities for climate change mitigation in
    the energy sector: expanding cleaner power generation, restructuring the district heating
    sector and scaling up energy efficiency in manufacturing and buildings.

82. Supporting the expansion of cleaner power generation:

         a) Review and adjust the long-term power sector development plan with a view to
         reducing the implementation risks and costs of the proposed investments for the period
         of 2014-2020. The initial analysis of this rapid assessment suggests that a shift of
         investment priority over the next seven years towards additional wind and solar PV
         power and associated T&D infrastructure and major additions of high-efficiency gas-
         fired capacity could reduce the overall costs of electricity, increase private sector
         participation, and cut GHG emissions.

         alternative scenario to the government’s current plan for 2014-2020.

         c) Accelerate sector reforms to create a stable and predictable business environment for
         expanding private sector investments in cleaner power generation. A recent World
         Bank functional review of the Ministry of Economy provided suggestions for key
         actions to improve the energy sector business environment. Among the most important
         are the following:

                 Cancel the plan to create the two national champions and the restart of the
                  implementation of the 2003 Road Map: a balanced strategy of attracting private
                  sector investment and developing viable public sector energy companies;
                 Enforce and implement sound commercial practices by the Government, energy
                  regulator ANRE and public sector energy companies;
                 Continue energy market liberalization and remove regulated prices for electric
                  and gas supply for non-residential consumers;
                 Strengthen energy regulator ANRE’s capacity, autonomy and accountability;
                 Prepare an energy and climate change strategy
                 Provide policy and legislative stability to increase investor confidence and lower
                  the perception of investment risks.

83. Supporting the restructuring of the district heating sector:

         a) Develop and begin to implement a comprehensive investment and sector reform
           program to address the multitude of issues and constraints of the district heating
           sector, and to a greater extent, the long-term urban heating strategy. Some of the
           reforms that must be implemented to stem further deterioration of district heating
           (DH) in Romania include:
            - Strategic reviews of local DH systems to establish the most efficient and cost-
                effective heat supply options strategy, taking into account economic levels of fuel
                prices and the environmental costs of burning fuels, as well as modern heat and
                cogeneration technologies, and efficient and cost-effective distributed systems;
            - Acceleration of electricity and natural gas price liberalization, maximizing the

                     role of the market in resources allocation;
              -      Abolishing all price subsidies; only low-income families would receive targeted
                     subsidies in the form of cash payments within the social protection system;
              -      Investment support for truly high-efficiency cogeneration;
              -      Unification of DH regulation under one regulator;
              -      Introduction of a two-part heat tariff system;
              -      Consumption-based billing at the dwelling level for heat and hot water;
              -      Consideration of additional policies to “protect” district heating in areas where it
                     is already supplied and cost-effective.

         b) Focus initial investment efforts on a few select cities where district heating is deemed
           economically viable and competitive compared with distributed alternatives, and
           where local governments are committed to sector reforms. Thorough analyses need to
           be carried out to determine whether a district heating system can be modernized to the
           point of efficiency and be competitive compared to distributed alternatives based on
           economic costs and benefits before a funding decision is made. Under certain
           conditions, modernization of district heating systems should be eligible for EU
           funding in the 2014-2020 period.

84. Scaling-up energy efficiency investments:

         a) Prioritize policy support towards scalable energy efficiency interventions where
           market barriers and a weak implementation capacity have held back investments.
           There does not appear to be a general lack of financing for energy efficiency
           investment in Romania, although large financing gaps do exist in select market
           segments, such as residential thermal retrofits. Public support is particularly important
           for scalable energy efficiency interventions which have a relatively high cost of saved
           energy due to low market uptake as illustrated in the table below.

      b) Match financing and delivery mechanism with specific sector needs and constraints.
        Of particular interest over the long term is the use of financial instruments to increase
        the leverage of public funds in energy efficiency investments in public and residential
        sectors, for thermal retrofit of buildings in particular. Increasing the role of energy
        service companies (ESCOs) in the delivery of energy efficiency projects has the added
        benefit of bringing in third-party commercial financing, especially in public -sector
        energy efficiency investments. More specifically:
            i.   Manufacturing sector energy efficiency investments should in general be
          financed through commercial means. Nevertheless, public funding in supporting
          information dissemination, awareness raising, and capacity building among key
          stakeholders (enterprises, ESCOs and banks) have proven to be of catalytic value.
           ii.   A dedicated energy efficiency revolving fund for the public sector could be an
          effective way of addressing some of the critical financing and implementation
          constraints faced by municipal public entities, while also helping nurture and
          develop Romania’s nascent ESCO market. Such a fund may be seeded by a
          combination of EU funds and government grants and could potentially attract private
          financing if proven successful.
          iii.   A financing mechanism/platform that matches the needs for long-term (up to
          20 years) and low-interest-rate loans in residential thermal retrofits while also
          providing streamlined processing and necessary assistance to home owners
          associations will help mitigate the challenges facing thermal retrofit programs in
          Romania. There have been some successful operations of housing renovation loan

    environment, for a sustainable development of Romania within the EU. One of its strategic
    pillars is to support the development of an integrated and environmentally friendly transport
    system through the encouragement of a transport system that protects the environment and
    supports integrated social and economic development without harm to human health or to
    environment for the benefit of today’s and future generations.

86. These goals are in line with the nation’s Climate Change Strategy and sector strategies such
    as the draft Transport Strategy of Romania’s Ministry of Transport, which are expected to be
    adopted soon. Climate friendly policies and investments are needed to achieve the strategic
    goals and generate both global and local benefits.

87. Local co-benefits of climate-friendly policies include, but are not limited to reduced traffic
    congestion and road accidents, improved air quality—a recent study found that poor quality
    in Bucharest reduces life expectancy by two years and is a leading cause of respiratory
    diseases among city inhabitants, with road congestion being one of the main drivers of air
    quality—and these can become important drivers of transport policies and investments.

   Sector Characteristics

88. The transport sector is a significant emitter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while at the
    same time transport infrastructure is expected to be heavily impacted by changes in climate,
    particularly extreme weather events. In EU countries, transport is responsible for around a
    quarter of greenhouse gas emissions making this the second largest greenhouse gas emitting
    sector after energy. While emissions from other sectors are generally falling, those from
    transport have increased 36 percent since 1990. Most transport-related greenhouse gas
    emissions result from road transport. However, there are also significant emissions from the
    aviation and maritime sectors and these sectors are experiencing the fastest growth in
    emissions, meaning that policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are required for a range
    of transport modes.

89. In Romania, as a percentage of total GHG emissions across all sectors, the transport sector
    accounts for 11.8 percent (2011 figures). While this is smaller than the EU’s average of 20.2

   percent, it is rising more quickly than the EU average. The steady upward trend since the turn
   of the century is particularly noteworthy. The figures below show the increases over time as
   well as how these compare to the EU-27. Among the different transport modes, road
   transport is the source of the great majority of GHG emissions in the transport sector,
   responsible for 93 percent of domestic transport emissions. This is a similar proportion to the
   EU-27 average of 94 percent.

90. Transport statistics show a marked rise in mode share of private cars and a significant decline
    in rail mode share of passenger transport (with 2011 rail mode share being approximately one
    third of the 2000 figure). Bus and coach travel mode shares have grown slightly between
    2000 and 2011. Private car mode share now approaches the EU average, having been
    considerably lower at the turn of the millennium. Rail mode share is lower than the EU
    average, having been above average in 2000. Although car mode share in Romania is close to
    the EU average level, the motorization (or car ownership) rate in Romania was the lowest in
    the EU at 201 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2010,16 but has grown significantly in recent years,
    up from 150 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2004.17 Experience across world data suggests that
    as the Romanian economy grows, this rate will continue to grow in the future. Without
    intervention to provide better transport alternatives and encourage their use, as car ownership
    grows, car use is also likely to grow. Reasons for the decline in rail passengers are linked to
    the decaying state of the Romanian railway system. Domestic air passenger transport activity
    (internal within Romania) forms a small part (7 percent) of total passenger movements
    through Romanian airports. This level is relatively low compared to other EU countries (the
    EU-27 average is 18 percent), although it has increased in recent years

91. The modal split for freight movements in Romania (in terms of ton-km) has also changed in
    recent years. This shows a marked fall in rail freight mode share in recent years, together
    with a marked rise in road freight mode share. Also notable is the much larger waterborne
    freight mode share since 2009. The reasons for the decline in rail freight and transfer to road
    and inland waterways are likely to be similar to outlined above for passenger transport. Rail
    freight mode share is higher than the EU average, in spite of its decline. Inland waterborne
    freight also has a much higher mode share than the EU average, while road freight is still
    below the EU average, despite recent growth.

92. Urban transport forms a major part of overall transport movements in Romania. Some 54
    percent of the country’s population lives in towns and cities, according to the 2011 national
    census18. Transport within urban areas forms a vital part of their functioning as economic
    and social entities. There are nine cities in Romania with populations in excess of 200,000.
    However, readily available quantitative information on the urban transport situation across
    Romania is limited. Traffic congestion is reported to be an increasing problem in a number of
    cities, as vehicle ownership grows. Although data is hard to obtain, it is understood that
    public transport patronage in many Romanian towns and cities is in decline, with a
    corresponding increase in private traffic levels. For example, in Ploiesti, public transport
    patronage fell from 7 million trips per month in 2011 to 6.7 million in 2012. Some cities are
    making concerted efforts to reverse this trend through modernization of infrastructure and
    services, although lack of funding remains a serious constraint. In terms of cycling, good
    cycling infrastructure exists in some cities but it is generally patchy, does not form a coherent
    network, and is often poorly maintained.

   Climate Change and Transport

93. Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on transportation, affecting the way
    transportation professionals plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain transportation
    systems. According to the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
    synthesis report of impacts, adaptation and vulnerability of potential transportation-related
    impacts and sensitivities, “Transport infrastructure is vulnerable to extremes in temperature,
    precipitation/river floods, and storm surges, which can lead to damage in road, rail, airports,
    and ports”.19

                                                                                                                              57
94. Extreme weather events, which may be linked to climate change, have been experienced in
    some parts of Romania in recent years. These include severe floods in 2005, 2006 and 2007,
    and an expansion of drought-affected areas in the south and south-east of Romania.
    According to the draft Romanian Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, the expectation is that
    in the future, Romania can expect to have: a rise in average temperature overall; more
    frequent summer droughts, especially in the south and south-east; more frequent heat waves;
    and more intense rainfall across short periods of time, leading to more frequent flash floods.

95. Some major Climate Change risks in the transport sector have been identified by the
    Assessment. Higher temperatures and more frequent heat waves (particularly in the south
    and south-east) are likely to cause problems with road and rail infrastructure. Asphalt roads
    may become soft and deform under the weight of vehicles, causing traffic restrictions to be
    put in place (particularly for heavy vehicles). This issue is already recognized by the
    Romanian national roads company, with use of adjusted material standards and design norms
    in vulnerable areas to cope with higher temperatures and minimize deformations. Similar
    issues may also arise with asphalt surfaces (e.g., runways) at Romanian airports. Railway
    lines also can buckle under high temperatures, which can again lead to speed and usage
    restrictions.

96. Rail, road and waterborne transport infrastructures are potentially vulnerable to the effects of
    more intense rainfall and the increased frequency of flash floods. Bridge abutments, piers,
    road and rail embankments, and riverbanks are all potentially vulnerable to such flash floods
    unless measures are taken to protect them. Some roads and railways may also be more prone
    to flooding, unless drainage and flood protection measures are implemented. Intense rainfall
    can also have adverse impacts on road safety, although in some areas a reduction in icy and
    snowy days may counterbalance this.

97.     Reduced precipitation, droughts and the associated reduced runoff may affect river
      navigation on the major waterways such as the Danube. This is something already being
      seen, according to the Lower Danube River Administration, with reduced water depths,
      meaning that the number of days requiring implementation of navigation restrictions is
      increasing. On the other hand, the navigability of several shipping channels and inland
      waterways are likely to be affected due to expected lower water levels. Some channels may
      be more accessible to shipping farther inland because of the rise in sea level. The navigability
      of shipping channels is likely to change and needs to be properly reassessed (Romania’s
      Danube-Black Sea Canal).

      Recommended Actions

      2014-2020 Sectoral Operational Programs
                                                                                                                                 58
98.     Recognition of climate implications in transport, unlike other sectors, has had a slow start.
      One reason is that the transition to a low-carbon context appears to be more costly than in
      other sectors representing a real challenge for authorities worldwide. But broadening the
      policy agenda to shift behaviors changes the cost picture completely, especially measures to
      reduce congestion, local air pollution, safety risks, and energy imports. Policies to guide
      demand towards low-emission modes and technologies must be part of investment programs
      and projects. Such policies can reduce transport demand in the long run by changing the
      economic geography of cities and countries. But that will take close coordination of
      transport, urban, environmental, and health policies.

99.     The Transport Rapid Assessment has drawn on published documents and discussions with
      key stakeholders in Government ministries and transport infrastructure and operating
      companies. It has also drawn on information and experiences from other countries, both
      within the EU and around the world. Based on these activities, the overall conclusion is that
      there is significant potential for climate change mitigation through the reduction of transport
      sector GHG emissions growth in Romania. The World Bank has recommended mitigation
      actions for further consideration and investigation prior to their integration within Romania’s
      2014-2020 Operational Programs. Some of these involve Technical Assistance while others
      are Investment actions. The recommended actions complement and reinforce transport
      measures that may be proposed for the OPs for other reasons, such as economic
      development, connectivity, safety and security.

100. Within the recommended actions the World Bank has highlighted that, while certain
   infrastructure investment measures are potentially positive from a climate change mitigation
   perspective, the climate change benefits—and indeed economic and other benefits—will only
   be realized if all aspects of transport service provision are addressed holistically to ensure
   that the transport mode is able to attract new users. This is particularly relevant to the rail
   sector, where rail travel is in decline, but also applies to urban public transport services and
   to Inland Waterway Transport. In all of these areas, maintenance, vehicles or rolling stock,
   customer service, operational efficiency and service prices need to be considered as part of
   an attractive package ‘offer’ to customers. The impact of investments financed through the
   sectoral OPs for rail and public transport could be monitored through changes in occupancy
   rates — low occupancy, low emission rail transport or public transport is not only failed
   investment but can be more emission intensive per passenger-km or ton-km than the use of
   cars and trucks.

101. A summary of the specific recommended mitigation actions in each transport sub-sector is
   provided in the following summary table.

102. Adaptation to climate change is a key requirement for the transport sector in Romania in
   the future. It needs to become an integral part of all transport sector activities, and become
   embedded in the day-to-day thinking of people working in the sector. In addition the use of
   new design norms (for example, increased drainage provision or heat-resilient materials) that

   take account of climate change, consideration of climate change adaptation need to be built
   into tendering procedures across all parts of the transport sector, and into infrastructure asset
   management systems, emergency preparedness planning, and revised planning and project
   development cycles. The starting point for the adaptation work in the transport sector is to
   conduct sectoral or agency level Vulnerability Assessments in order to identify the relative
   vulnerability of assets and services to the impacts of climate change—through the
   development of vulnerability maps, among other things—in order to define short-term,
   medium-term, and long-term actions for implementation. Within this Report the World Bank
   has recommended adaptation actions for further consideration and investigation prior to their
   integration within Romania’s 2014-2020 Operational Programs. Again, some of these
   involve Technical Assistance while others are Investment actions.

   provided below—with illustrations on the kind of factors that need to be considered for each
   mode—with the top part of the table describing measures that apply to all modes and that are
   required in order to have the information basis to make investments that factor into climate

104. Given all the proposed measures an important question is their sequencing or prioritization
   in terms of implementing the proposed Action Plan. The measures proposed are aimed at
   being implemented in the 2014-2020 period, in line with the time line of the Operational
   Programs. With regard to adaptation the key immediate priority is to develop, mode by
   mode, national vulnerability studies which would form the basis of an adaptation plan and
   which would include a mapping of risks. This information base which identifies key risks
   and vulnerabilities of transport infrastructure and transport services must be carried out
   before implementing other proposed measures, such as modifying planning and project
   preparation documentation, reviewing design standards, or implementing resilient
   infrastructure and rolling stock measures.

105. With regards to mitigation, the most pressing action is to develop a methodology for
   measuring emission intensity per passenger-km and ton-km for different transport modes,
   different technologies, and under different operational conditions, in order to be able to
   monitor GHG emissions by mode, assessing the impact of measures that will be undertaken
   to reduce the growth of GHG emissions. Such an information base is at present absent. A

                                                                                                                              65
   second urgent priority is implementing policies to ensure improvement in the performance of
   the rail infrastructure manager and public rail operators—including allocating funding to
   maintain infrastructure investments—so that investments in rail infrastructure financed under
   the Operational Program translate into higher ridership and higher ton-km of freight
   transported in the rail network, contributing to a modal shift. A third priority is to launch a
   series of studies aimed at (a) reviewing fiscal measures to influence private car purchase and
   use; (b) assessing options in using alternative fuels; and (c) measures to encourage freight
   haulers to accelerate take-up of lower emission vehicle technology; and (d) the potential role
   of ‘harder’ demand management measures to address congestion and emissions in Romanian
   cities. Reducing the growth rate of emissions from the road sector is critical for decelerating
   transport sector emission growth. This will require changes in pricing and other policies—but
   the critical step is launching the studies that will guide policy choices to be implemented over
   the 2014-2020 period and beyond.

106. In order to meet the target of spending 20 percent of ESIF funds on climate change—or
   whatever percentage decided by the Romanian government—it will be essential to make
   large investments in railways, IWT, ports, multimodal transport, and urban transport. At the
   moment the coefficients for the calculation of activities supporting climate change activities
   for the sub-sectors listed above are 40 percent. This means that the modal composition of the
   investment program will need to allocate significant resources to non-road infrastructure
   projects. Road investments could be counted as supporting climate change activities if they
   are made climate resilient—this is why undertaking a vulnerability study for the road sector
   early in the 2014-2020 period will be important, not only for helping to meet the spending
   target on climate actions, but also to make the infrastructure resilient to projected climate
   change impacts.

107. Going forward, the key next step is finalization of the General Transport Master Plan
   (GTMP), as this is an ex-ante conditionality of the European Commission for transport
   interventions financed from the OPs. It is also critical in terms of determining a list of
   prioritized projects and policies able to be financed by the Technical Assistance and
   Investment Action window available through the Operational Programs. It is understood by
   the World Bank that there is considerable work required in order to finalize the GTMP, and
   that this will be a critical measure for prioritizing investments to be financed out of EU
   funds. This provides a window of opportunity to incorporate the recommendations of this
   Report into the finalization of the GTMP, thus ensuring adequate consideration of climate
   change interventions.

108. A second critical step is for Romania to decide on how it will implement the requirement
   that 20 percent of European Structural and Investment Funds be used for climate action. This

   is important, as it is currently not clear for the Large Infrastructure Operational Program—
   which includes transport, energy and environment—what percentage of climate expenditure
   the transport sector will need to meet. This could have an impact on the modal composition
   of the transport program. Likewise, the same applies for the Regional Operational Program,
   which includes county roads and urban transport (excluding the metro of Bucharest).

109. Lastly, it will be important to coordinate the preparation of transport related aspects in the
   Large Infrastructure Operational Program and the Regional Development Operational
   Program, particularly with regard to roads. Motorways and national road projects will be
   financed through the Large Infrastructure Operational Program while county roads will be
   financed through the Regional Development Operational Program, and these need to be
   coordinated to ensure that when a motorway section is built, access roads and roads in the
   surrounding area are also upgraded in order for the investments to maximize benefits. While
   this is not a climate related issue, it is nevertheless important in order to develop an
   integrated and optimized transport system. The General Transport Master Plan, which is
   based on a National Transport Model, could serve as the basis for the selection of road
   projects in both Operational Programs.

   Sector Background

110. Cities have long held a central place of importance in society as hubs of commerce, culture,
   and political power. Globally, cities are where 53 percent of the world’s population live and
   they are estimated to be responsible for 70% of global GHG emissions (2011 figures). In
   Romania, the urbanization rate is roughly 55%, but little is known about the contribution of
   urban areas to Romania’s current emissions picture.

111. Because of climate change, the clustering together of large numbers of people and high
   levels of economic activity also creates vulnerabilities. Some will be found directly within a
   city: people living and working in coastal areas or in river floodplains may be subject to the
   impacts of sea level rise or extreme rainfall events that put their lives or businesses at peril.
   Urban climate change can also take other forms, however, including situations where impacts
   occurring far outside of a city can affect essential systems (e.g. water or energy supply)
   essential to life within the city.

112. In some parts of the world, central governments are taking action, requiring cities to take
   measures to ensure that the economic engine of their country is not harmed. With
   international and national technical support, many local authorities are also taking action,
   concerned about long-term impacts facing their city or cognizant of the fact that some
   climate mitigation actions can actually result in cost savings, making the city more
   economically competitive. The urban sector assessment reviews the current state of urban
   climate planning in Romania (and opportunities for improvement); what is known about how
   cities in Romania contribute to climate change, and how cities in Romania will be affected by
   climate change.

113. Because the urban sector is a spatially (rather than topically) bounded sector, the complete
   examination of climate change mitigation and adaptation/resilience measures must
   necessarily cover a wide range of issues from urban planning to policies and financing
   mechanisms for four key urban infrastructure-focused sectors: energy, transport, water, and
   waste. This section focuses on urban planning, municipal solid waste management, and
   urban water systems only, since urban energy and transport topics have been covered in
   previous sections of the report. High priority action items are discussed in each sub-sector
   summary, but are spelled out with greater specificity at the end of the write-up, along with
   action items that can be implemented over a more extended time scale.

   2014-2020 Sectoral Operational Programs
                                                                                                                              68
   The Current State of Urban Climate Knowledge and Planning in Romania

114. National level climate studies project that Romania will get warmer and that both drought
   and extreme rainfall events will become increasingly commonplace in the coming century,
   although strong regional differences will remain. There is, however, a dearth of knowledge
   about how Romanian cities will be affected by climate change, as there has been very little
   research undertaken to statistically ‘downscale’ global climate models to provide a more
   granular, local picture of how circumstances will change in the coming decades. Therefore,
   such information does little to help a local authority assess what specific actions they should
   take going forward.

115. Fortunately, some baseline analysis is available to support local climate planning work, on
   both the mitigation and adaptation/resilience sides of the equation.

116. For example, as of September 2013, there were 60 communities (representing roughly 5
   million people) from around Romania that have signed on to the ‘Covenant of Mayors,’ a
   European Commission-supported initiative aimed at promoting sustainable energy use in
   cities. Each community is required to develop an action plan within a year of signing up for
   the Covenant program. The 30 Romanian communities submitting plans thus far have
   heavily emphasized actions focused on improving energy efficiency in buildings and
   addressing local transport problems. Other climate-related planning work is taking place in
   seven Romanian cities where the World Bank has supported local energy efficiency planning
   efforts. These analyses similarly place a large emphasis on addressing local building energy
   use and transport issues.

117. In terms of climate adaptation/resilience, planning activity has largely taken the form of
   disaster planning which is required under national law, although the quality or breadth of
   these plans is quite unclear. In other words, there is much work to be done in Romania
   around urban climate matters. Strategies the Government of Romania should prioritize
   include requiring local authorities to prepare emission inventories, climate risk/vulnerability
   assessments, and climate action plans as a pre-condition for the receipt of other climate-
   related investment monies. The Government should also provide a range of technical and
   financial assistance to help local authorities obtain the information necessary to prepare such
   plans.

   Urban Solid Waste Sector

118. Collectively, the GHG emissions associated with Municipal Solid Waste disposal in
   Romania total approximately 2% of the country’s overall emissions. The majority result
   from the country’s overwhelming reliance on landfilling as its primary wast e management
   strategy. Organic waste entombed in a landfill decays anaerobically, produces methane, a
   GHG with 25 times the heat trapping potential of carbon dioxide. Unless the landfill is
   designed to capture the methane via a series of pipes embedded in the garbage, the gas will
   slowly leak out of a landfill for many years, including long after a landfill is formally closed.


   Component B Synthesis Report - Summary of Sector Rapid Assessments and Recommendations for Incorporating Climate Actions in the
   2014-2020 Sectoral Operational Programs
                                                                                                                              70
   Very few landfills in Romania have the ability to capture or flare this gas, meaning most
   methane is released directly into the atmosphere.

119. Thanks to extensive Operating Program support during the 2007-2013 period, Romania’s
   EU-mandated efforts to close and replace poorly managed solid waste dumpsites with
   sanitary landfills are well underway, but efforts to address existing methane leakage are
   unclear. The Romanian Government can keep this situation from becoming even more
   problematic going forward, ramping up efforts to divert organic waste material discarded in
   cities into alternative waste processing methods such as composting or anaerobic digestors.
   Both techniques prevent the release of methane into the atmosphere, while simultaneously
   creating either a useful soil nutrient amendment and/or energy that can replace fossil fuels.

120. The EU accession agreement has already established a timetable for this to be achieved,
   requiring that 65% of all biodegradable waste generated in Romania be diverted from
   landfills by 2020. Romania’s performance thus far is relatively weak, but achieving this
   target and other recycling requirements could cut solid waste GHG emission levels by 50%
   or more. To succeed, cities around Romania will likely have to engage in some type of
   separate collection of waste materials or otherwise support the development of facilities
   focused on organic waste processing and markets ready to consume the resulting high quality
   soil amendment. There are several city-based programs around the world that can serve as
   models for these efforts.

121. The impact that climate change will have on solid waste facilities and programs around
   Romania is unknown; more work must be undertaken to analyze this issue.

122. Priority actions the governments should consider for the waste sector include continuing to
   promote the development of new composting facilities to provide an alternative to the
   disposal of organic waste in landfills. The government should also provide localized climate
   impact data and require local authorities and relevant waste system facility operators to
   prepare climate action plans reflecting local climate risks and vulnerabilities.

   Urban Water Sector

123. Compared to sectors like buildings and transport, urban water systems tend to receive
   comparatively little attention in most city or national level climate mitigation plans. This
   lack of attention to the link between water systems and climate change is proportional to the
   relatively small extent to which water supply and treatment systems contribute to overall
   urban GHG emissions. In Romania, this was estimated to total 2.34% of overall GHG
   emissions in 2009.

   Component B Synthesis Report - Summary of Sector Rapid Assessments and Recommendations for Incorporating Climate Actions in the
   2014-2020 Sectoral Operational Programs
                                                                                                                              71
124. There is nonetheless room for improvement in terms of the efficiency of utility operations,
   reducing current high water loss levels and reducing methane emissions from wastewater
   treatment facilities. Some system upgrades have occurred during the 2007-2013 Operating
   Program period, when a sizable amount of funds were allocated to help Romania address its
   historically poor surface and ground water quality. Significant gains have been made at these
   new facilities, but much work remains to be done, meaning water system upgrades should
   continue as a high investment priority in the next Operating Program. At the same time these
   investments are being pursued for environmental quality and cost efficiency reasons, these
   system upgrades deliver climate change mitigation benefits at little or no additional cost.
   The Romanian Government can position these projects as climate-related investments,
   helping satisfy Romania’s obligation to spend no less than 20% of its operating program
   funds on climate-related investments.

125. More significant concerns arise in terms of protecting Romania’s urban water supply and
   treatment network from the impacts of climate change. Romania’s water supply picture is
   already relatively poor compared to most other countries in Europe, with some parts of the
   country enduring supply constraints during the summer. This situation is likely to get worse
   going forward. Climate impact studies looking at future hydrological conditions in three of
   the country’s 11 river basins project that the demand-supply gap in these regions is expected
   to be manageable for the next 15-20 years, but after that significant demand reduction
   measures or new supply capacity will be needed. Research detailing the climate impacts on
   other water basins should be prioritized, to provide a comprehensive picture of the challenges
   certain cities might face in decades to come.

                                                  6.4. Water Sector

126. The water section is presented from an integrated water resources perspective, thereby
   including all pertinent water-related sectors, viz. municipal water supply and sanitation,
   industrial water supply, agriculture, energy generation, environment, and disaster
   management. It is based on available information on the current status of the water resources
   sector in Romania, along with existing knowledge on the anticipated impacts of climate
   change in this sector.

   Water Resources Availability and Demands

127. The total surface water potential of Romania amounts to 127 Billion Cubic Meters
   (BCM)/year, with internal river basins contributing 40 BCM and 87 BCM available from the
   Danube basin. The groundwater potential is estimated at 10 BCM/year. The utilizable
   fraction of the total (surface and ground) water resources, as defined by the existing capacity
   to extract and use water, is 40 BCM/year. In contrast the total water demand stands at 8
   BCM/year.

128. With a current population of 20 million, the average water availability in Romania amounts
   to 2000 cubic meters per capita per year. While this value is above the threshold generally
   defined for water stress (1700 cubic meter per capita per year), it is lower than the average
   value for Europe (approx. 4500 cubic meters per capita per year), and underscores the need
   for good management to ensure resource conservation and sustainability.

129. A significant inter-annual variation exists in water resources availability. In the driest years
   the water availability has fallen to 20 BCM. There is also a significant variation within
   Romania, with the basins of Jiu, Arges-Vedea, Buzua-Ialomita, Siret, Prut-Barlad, and
   Dobrogea-Littoral facing the most serious scarcities of water.

130. Currently, water demand is based on industry (67%), agriculture (18%), and municipal
   (15%) use. Demand for water has steadily decreased since the 1990s, because of structural
   changes in the economy, including reduction in industrial activity, the shut-down of
   economically unviable irrigation schemes, introduction of metering and tariffs in domestic
   water supply, and reducing system losses. The total demand, as measured by the volume of
   water made available to users, has decreased from approx. 20 BCM/year in the early 1990s to
   8 BCM/year now. The actual consumption is still lower (approx. 6.5 BCM in 2012). As a
   result the system currently has a degree of over-capacity at the national level.


   Component B Synthesis Report - Summary of Sector Rapid Assessments and Recommendations for Incorporating Climate Actions in the
   2014-2020 Sectoral Operational Programs
                                                                                                                              76
131. Irrigated area in Romania has decreased from 2 million ha in the late 1908s/early 1990s to
   approx. 0.8 million ha (considered irrigable with functional infrastructure), as economically
   unviable schemes were closed down. In fact, the land under irrigation has remained below
   300,000 ha for the past 5 years. The corresponding water demand has been reduced from
   about 8 BCM to 1 BCM per year. While the overall situation appears good because of over-
   capacity, there are areas of water scarcity in many basins where summer droughts are a
   significant concern.

132. About 70% of the water supply for domestic use is sourced from surface waters, compared
   to 95% dependence on surface waters for industrial supply. From a quantitative perspective,
   a majority of the basins have no serious problems in ensuring sufficient volume for water for
   meeting the domestic and industrial demands. However, the basins with lower endowment of
   water (Jiu, Arges-Vedea, Buzau-Ialomita, Siret, Prut-Barlad, and Dobrogea-Litoral) face
   supply reliability challenges during the summer months, especially in dry years. The
   Dobrogea-Litoral basin is the most severely affected in this regard.

133. Romania’s hydropower potential is estimated at 36 TWh/year, and currently the total
   installed hydropower capacity amounts to 6,400MW. Hydropower generation accounts for
   32% of Romania’s total electricity generation, and 16% of the total energy use. The
   Government intends to decommission/modernize some of the high-emission and obsolete
   thermal power plants, and therefore plans on a modest increase in hydropower generation
   capacity. While hydropower is not a consumptive user of water, operation rules for
   hydropower facilities constrain and are constrained by water uses in other sectors. Therefore
   the proposed new hydropower facilities would need to be planned taking into account the
   existing and anticipated future water uses in all sectors. In the basins where scarcity already
   arises in the summers of dry years, hydropower production will be adversely affected for a
   short duration, as it was in the dry year of 1990. These constraints can be alleviated to a large
   extent by careful systems planning and operations optimization, and by accounting for
   anticipated climate change impacts in the operations planning in both new and existing
   facilities.

134. Almost 60% of the water bodies in Romania meet the EU Framework Directive’s water
   quality designation of good ecological status/potential, which is based on multiple quality
   elements (biological, physic-chemical, and specific pollutants).

   Projected Impacts of Climate Change

                                                                                                                              77
135. Precipitation has decreased at a rate of about 30 mm per decade in Romania between 1961
   and 2006. Continental-scale studies for Europe project that the annual mean precipitation is
   likely to decrease by 5-20% in southern Europe and the Mediterranean between the years
   2071-2100, compared to numbers documented from 1961-1990. In line with the precipitation
   changes, annual river flows are increasing in the north and decreasing in the south, and this
   trend is projected to increase in the future. Large changes in seasonality are also projected,
   with Romania anticipating lower flows in summer and higher flows in winter. As a
   consequence, droughts and water stress are expected to increase, particularly in summer.
   Flood events are projected to occur more frequently in many river basins, particularly in
   winter and spring, although estimates of changes in flood frequency and magnitude remain
   uncertain. In general, the range of climate change impacts across Romania includes a likely
   increase in cold spells, heat waves, heavy floods, landslides, the formation of ice-dams on
   watercourses, damaging frost, and avalanches.

136. Four river basins of Romania- Buzau, Ialomita, Arges, and Mures—have been studied with
   the objective of quantifying the impact of climate change. The results for Buzau and Ialomita
   basins indicate a likely reduction of mean annual flow, of 15-20 % for the period 2021-2050,
   and of 30-40 % for the period 2070-2100. Also predicted are earlier occurrences of floods
   produced by snow-melt, and amplification of extreme phenomena. An analysis of changes in
   demands shows that the demand-supply gap will be manageable for the next 15-20 years, but
   that significant measures will be needed to address vulnerabilities in the time period that
   follows. The results for Arges and Mures basins indicate a reduction of mean annual flow in
   these basins of 10-15 % for the period 2021-2050. More frequent winter floods are expected,
   and while torrential flood events will occur more often, the frequency of floods with a long
   duration and large volume is expected to decrease.

137. The following are some of the key vulnerabilities to climate change that are identified in
   various water-related sectors:
        Water supply will be adversely affected because the warmer and shorter winters will
          lead to a decrease of seasonal snow volume and to the snow melting early and fast,
          leading to shortages in summer months.
        Hotter and drier summers will also cause a qualitative deterioration of water
          resources, thereby effectively reducing the supply.
        Supply will also suffer from a lowering of the groundwater table in summer months,
          due to reductions in the surface flow regime.
        Higher summer temperatures will lead to increased evapo-transpiration and therefore
          higher water demands in agriculture during the same timeframe when supplies will
          suffer a shortfall. The domestic water demands and supply will experience the same
          (but less pronounced) effect.

            Wastewater treatment will be more frequently impaired by floods due to storm-water
             infiltration in sewer systems, and also to the direct inundation of treatment facilities.
            The flora and fauna in the aquatic ecosystems (rivers and lakes), as well as in those
             dependent on precipitation and river flows (such as wetlands), will suffer from a
             quantitative reduction in summer water flows, and from the increased frequency of
             floods and droughts.
            Higher summer temperatures leading to water quality degradation (through decreases
             in dissolved oxygen, eutrophication and algal blooms) will also adversely affect the
             environment.
            Changes in aquifer levels will also adversely affect the water balance in wetlands,
             which are sustained by groundwater in the low flow season.
            The summer generation from hydropower plants will be adversely affected in dry
             years. Hydropower facilities will also face the increasing threat of intensive floods,
             and operations will need to provide sufficient flood cushion in storage reservoirs.

                        6.5. Agriculture and Rural Development Sector

139. Climate change is a huge challenge for the ARD sector in Romania. On the one hand,
   agriculture is a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and must therefore be expected to
   contribute towards the climate change mitigation goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy. On the
   other hand, the ARD sector is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change since the
   capacity of the “rural space” to provide adequate food supply, deliver ecosystem services,
   support economic growth, and provide a safe living environment for rural communities is
   directly dependent upon favorable climatic conditions.

140. However, there are opportunities in the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for helping
   to address these challenges during the next programing period of 2014-2020 – in particular,
   the new rural development policy (Pillar II of the CAP) which has been significantly
   strengthened regarding actions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This rapid
   sectoral assessment aims to contribute to the successful mainstreaming of climate action into
   Romania’s post-2013 rural development policy – namely the National Rural Development
   Program (NRDP) for Romania 2014-2020 that will be co-financed by the European
   Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).

   Sector Characteristics

141. The total area of agricultural land in Romania is 15.9 million hectares, of which around
   13.3 million ha (approximately 56% of total territory) is currently being used. Around 1.5
   million ha of utilized agricultural area is covered by economically viable / marginally viable
   irrigation systems, although only about 800 000 ha is currently functional. Compared to other
   EU Member States, the ARD sector in Romania is extensive, occupying 59.8% of total
   territory and providing a home to 44.9% of the total population. A relatively high proportion
   of national Gross Added Value (32.4%) and employment (41.5%) is also generated in rural
   areas.

142. The ARD sector in Romania is also diverse and complex with much variability in socio-
   economic context and human / institutional capacity. Rural areas in Romania are
   characterized by low quality infrastructure and relatively undeveloped basic services (health
   and education systems, finance and credit facilities etc.) compared to the urban areas. The
   ARD sector is comprised of two distinct and clearly defined sub-sectors with i) around one
   half of the agricultural land managed by a small number of very large-scale, capital intensive
   and technologically advanced farms, and; ii) the other half of agricultural land occupied by

                                                                                                                              83
   communities of very small-scale farmers practicing more traditional farming methods and
   producing goods largely for their own consumption.

143. There are a total of 3.86 million agricultural holdings in Romania, of which 96.6% fall into
   this “small-scale, subsistence farm” sub-sector. These small farms provide an important
   socio-economic buffer and basic livelihood for a significant proportion of the rural
   population. They also have an important role to play in maintaining the vitality of rural
   communities and providing important social, cultural and environmental services to the wider
   Romanian society. In the short-term context of 2014-2020 it is reasonable to assume
   that this small-scale farm sector will continue to persist, but in the longer-term there is
   a clear governmental commitment to structural reform of the highly polarized
   agricultural sector, and a decline in the number of small farms is likely.

144. Romania has a diverse rural environment and an abundance of natural resources. There is
   no shortage of water resources, but the availability of water is characterized by high
   variability in space and time. While the overall situation appears good because of over-
   capacity, there are areas of water scarcity in many basins where summer droughts are a
   significant concern. In particular the basins of Jiu, Arges-Vedea, Buzau-Ialomita, Siret, Prut-
   Barlad, and Dobrogea-Litoral face significant scarcity, with the last one being the most
   water-scarce basin in Romania. This situation will become more serious as the impacts of
   climate change become more pronounced. A large amount of water available annually in
   Romania is not utilized, either because much of it flows during flood periods or because there
   is insufficient storage capacity to allow for an efficient multi-annual management of water
   stock.

145. Pollution of groundwater with nitrates continues to be a serious problem and is largely
   associated with the poor management of livestock manure and human waste in rural areas,
   despite the rapid and continuous decline of livestock production (except for poultry) in
   Romania following the collapse of the socialist regime.

   Vulnerabilities and Risks from Climate Change in the ARD Sector

146. Romania’s temperate continental climate is changing, and is predicted to be significantly
   different in the next 50-100 years. The average annual air temperature is increasing, and
   Romania should expect a continued steady increase in annual average temperature similar to
   that projected for the whole of Europe. The projections have some variations depending on
   the models used, but compared to the period 1980-1990 further rises in annual average
   temperature should be expected of between: 0.5°C – 1.5°C by 2029, and 2.0°C – 5.0°C by
   2099 (depending upon global scenario).

   Component B Synthesis Report - Summary of Sector Rapid Assessments and Recommendations for Incorporating Climate Actions in the
   2014-2020 Sectoral Operational Programs
                                                                                                                              84
147. The total amount of annual precipitation is decreasing and a continued reduction in mean
   annual precipitation of 10-20% should be expected by the end of the century, although this is
   likely to vary greatly between the north and south of the country and between the mountains
   and lowland areas. The pattern of precipitation is also expected to continue to change with a
   greater frequency of shorter, more intense and localized rainfall events. Rainfall patterns
   may also become more chaotic and difficult to predict.

148. Romania is already increasingly encountering the negative impacts of climate change
   (including extreme events) and the modeling of future climate trends suggests that these
   negative impacts will continue to become more severe. These impacts include: (i) the
   increased incidence of severe flooding with the associated social and economic disruption
   and costs; (ii) the increased frequency and intensity of drought; (iii) increased risk of soil
   erosion by wind and water; (iv) the risk of desertification and associated land degradation,
   notably in southern and eastern Romania; and (v) reduced agricultural productivity.

149. Overall the ARD sector appears highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and it is
   expected that the livelihoods of many rural people will be increasingly affected by the
   changing climatic conditions that are predicted. The risk of impact is not equally distributed.
   There are regional differences in the likelihood of negative impacts such as drought and
   extreme rainfall events, as well differences in the vulnerability, resilience and adaptive
   capacity of rural actors and communities to climate change. Differences which are further
   accentuated by the huge polarity in farm size and structure that is characteristic of the ARD
   sector in Romania. Probably one of the most affected groups of producers will be
   subsistence farmers in the lowlands, especially in southern and south-eastern Romania.

150. Key vulnerabilities are:
       reduced agricultural productivity;
       water supply for rural consumers;
       other social (e.g. human health) and economic hazards for rural communities and
          households, and;
       environment and the 'health' of natural ecosystems.

151. Although there has been a significant reduction in GHG emissions from agriculture in
   Romania in recent years, there remains the very real possibility that GHG emissions will
   increase again as the agricultural economy improves – especially if livestock numbers

152. Mitigation measures therefore need to be put in place in the ARD sector that limit / cap
   GHG emissions. The big question remains whether the necessary mitigation can be balanced
   with the inevitable longer-term demands upon agriculture for increased food production. An
   appropriate mix of actions is therefore needed to manage, offset and avoid emissions across
   the whole ARD sector.

153. Adaptation is clearly also a high priority – progressive climate change is occurring and
   significant impacts upon the ARD sector are developing. The ARD sector needs to start
   responding more rapidly to prepare for future impacts and there is a need to build both the
   resilience and adaptive capacity of the two ARD sub-sectors (the large commercial farms
   and the communities of small-scale subsistence farms).

   Existing National Strategies, Policies and Initiatives of Relevance to the ARD Sector

154. The National Climate Change Strategy for Romania 2013-2020 (recently approved by
   Government Decision No. 529/2013 in July 2013) provides clear guidance on appropriate
   climate action in the ARD sector in both mitigation and adaptation components and identifies
   the EU budget (Multi-annual Financial Framework) for 2014-2020 as playing an important
   role in “catalysing the specific investments that will be needed to meet climate targets and to
   ensure climate resilience.” There are also various other existing strategies of specific
   relevance to climate action in the ARD sector, including the National Strategy on Drought
   Effects Mitigation and on the Prevention and Combating the Land Degradation and
   Desertification (elaborated on in 2008, but not yet approved).

155. In June 2006, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development drafted a National
   Strategic Plan (NSP) for Rural Development in preparation for EU accession in 2007 and the
   launch of the National Rural Development Program (NRDP) for Romania 2007-2013 that
   was co-financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). The
   fight against climate change was mentioned in the NSP as an important priority for Romania
   and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions was set as a key priority for the NRDP 2007-
   2013. A total of 8 measures were programmed in the NRDP 2007-2013 that are targeted at,
   or directly relevant to, climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as the transition to a
   low carbon economy.

156. The total financial allocation to these 8 measures was €6 399.1 million, of which 46.2% (€2
   958.9 million) had been committed to beneficiaries (i.e. absorbed) by the end of 2012. While
   this only gives a very general indication of the success to-date of targeting NRDP measures /
   funding on climate action, good experience has been generated with the implementation of

                 example by expanding irrigation in catchments already
                 suffering from water stress and where climate change

                            with the uncertainties of climate change, and; ii) to
                            promote and foster innovation, co-operation and other
                            bottom-up initiatives among local communities,
                            including farmers and other businesses, which build their
                            resilience / adaptive capacity to deal with the
                            uncertainties of climate change

158. These climate-related actions present a major challenge to the ARD sector in terms of
   science, policy and practice – a challenge that is complicated by the variability in socio-
   economic context of rural areas and the highly polarized structure of agriculture. For
   example, very different approaches are required to address contrasting vulnerabilities in the
   sector, such as large-scale crop production in the lowland areas of south and south-east
   Romania, compared to small farmers in geographically remote and economically
   disadvantaged communities in the mountains where access to relevant information and
   advice is currently very limited.

   Opportunities for Mainstreaming Climate Actions in the NRDP 2014-2020

159. There is a comprehensive suite of mitigation and adaptation measures eligible for EAFRD
   co-financing under the National Rural Development Program (NRDP) for Romania 2014-
   2020. In broad terms the menu of actions supported by the EAFRD Regulation (EC
   Regulation No. 1305/2013) include "knowledge transfer and innovation" under Priority 1;
   "investments" in farm modernization and competitiveness under Priorities 2 and 3, and; the
   encouragement of sustainable land management via "area-based compensatory payments"
   under Priorities 4 and 5. Of course the measures selected for inclusion in the NRDP 2014-
   2020 will not be able to address all climate-related challenges faced by farmers and other
   rural stakeholders. Prioritization and careful targeting of the NRDP measures will therefore
   be needed.

160. The main entry point for climate actions in the NRDP 2014-2020 is under priority 5 of the
   new EC rural development proposals, namely: “promoting resource efficiency and
   supporting the shift towards a low carbon and climate resilient economy in the agriculture,
   food and forestry sectors.” But since climate change mitigation and adaptation are also
   cross-cutting objectives for the EAFRD, climate actions should also be introduced under
   other priorities.

161. A basic intervention logic for the mainstreaming of climate actions in the NRDP 2014-2020
   is included in the report. Some examples of climate-related measures that can be financed in

162. It must be kept in mind that the ARD sector in Romania is a complex sector and the
   successful mainstreaming of climate action into the NRDP 2014-2020 will require the careful
   tailoring of measures. A “one-size fits all” approach to mainstreaming climate action in the
   NRDP 2014-2020 will not be appropriate – a flexible and localized approach should be
   encouraged as much as possible and the potential of bottom-up, community-based initiatives
   should not be under-estimated (for example, utilizing the LEADER-approach).

   Broad-based Actions in the Face of Uncertainty

163. Significant uncertainty exists in the ARD sector regarding a) the direction and magnitude
   of climate change; b) its impacts upon agriculture and the wider rural community, and; c) the
   effectiveness and economics of different actions and strategies for mitigation and adaptation.

164. This uncertainty is inevitably reflected in this rapid sectoral assessment and some very
   broad-based actions have been recommended that reflect a generic understanding of the most
   appropriate actions for supporting farmers, including small-holder farmers, to maintain viable
   and productive systems in the face of climate change. But uncertainty does not mean that
   action should be postponed and the immediate opportunity to embed climate action in the
   programming of the NRDP 2014-2020 must be fully and effectively acted upon for the short-
   to medium-term benefit of the ARD sector.

165. But in parallel further work does need to be done sharpen the generic recommendations in
   this rapid sectoral analysis. In particular:
    A robust evidence base needs to be built-up, one that ensures all future policy decisions
       relating to mitigation and adaptation in the ARD sector are cost effective. For example,
       impact studies are needed that integrate climate, land use and macroeconomic policies,
       while financial and socioeconomic analyses are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness
       of deploying these various technologies. This will require the Romanian government and
       research institutions to work more closely together to develop evidence and inform
       policy;
    A more strategic approach is needed that reconciles and integrates the climate challenges
       faced by the ARD sector with the need to also significantly reform the sector towards “a
       more export-driven, high-value and climate-resilient agriculture, with rural living
       conditions more closely aligned to urban”;
    A macro-economic model for the impacts of climate change upon the ARD sector would
       be useful, but there is an inevitable trade-off that needs to be resolved between a single
       complex model that allows exploration of multiple policy questions and a suite of simple
       models that seek to answer the same questions individually.

166. The forest sector assessment reviews the measures the government has proposed for the
   forest sector to determine whether they are climate positive. Based on available information
   in published literature and limited data on costs and benefits of different forest management
   approaches, the assessment provides a basis for refining the proposed measures in order to
   respond to the climate change requirement. Due to limited data, prioritization was not
   feasible. The assessment also presents information that can assist in monitoring the impacts
   of the measures.

   Sector Characteristics

167. Romania’s forests are roughly 27 % of the country land surface (MECC, 2012). Most of
   Romania’s forests are secondary forests and are distributed across the mountains, hills, and
   plains of the country. Romania is relatively rich in biodiversity and has the largest remaining
   tract of contiguous natural and naturally regenerated forest because of their current
   management practices. Romanian forests are used for protection and production purposes.

168. National regulations and technical requirements, and five major management principles
   structure forest management in Romania. Forest management plans (FMPs) are valid for 10
   years and must include management prescriptions for each forest stand, be prepared by
   specialized forest management planning companies, be approved by the national forest
   authority and must be implemented in practice. The prescriptive regulatory and technical
   requirements and restrictions on uses limit flexibility and innovation (which are increasing
   elements of best forest practice worldwide) and result in costs that can reduce the
   profitability of sustainable forest management for some private forest owners, especially
   smallholders.

169. In 2010, the forest sector and wood industry contributed 3.5% of GDP (INS CON 105D).
   Furniture exports were 3.45% of national exports, and the forest sector was 7% of national
   exports. The forest sector is also an important employer in rural areas, formally employing
   approximately 143,000 people in 2011.

170. Implementation of the land restitution legislation resulted in 66% of the wooded land areas
   were in the public domain while 34% were privately owned in 2009. There are an estimated
   850,000 forest owners in Romania, including individuals, indivisible communes, and
   churches, owning small and large tracts of forests. Approximately 40% of the area under
   private ownership is managed by smallholders. Restitution has had implications for forest

   on private lands. While the total area under smallholder is less than 20% of the total wooded
   land area, the parcels are scattered around the country. Motivating private landowners to
   comply with sustainable management requirements is important to maintain the health of
   forests. Furthermore, inclusion of small private landowners is also important for meeting the
   objectives of the SCF.

   Forests and Climate Change

171. Forests are important for sequestering greenhouse gases (GHGs) and reducing emissions,
   thus mitigating climate change. Romania’s GHG Inventory (National Inventory Report) from
   1989 to 2011 stated that “[i]n 2011, the GHG emissions without [land use, land use change,
   and forests (LULUCF)] have decreased [by] 54.86% comparing with the base year level.”
   When factoring in LULUCF, “the net GHG emissions/removals (taking into account the
   carbon dioxide (CO2) removals) decreased [by] 61.05 %.” (MECC, 2013). To maintain
   forests’ contribution to GHG emission removal, it is necessary to maintain the health of
   forests.

172. Forests, like other natural systems, are affected by climate change. Projected decrease in
   precipitation and increases in temperature are anticipated to reduce the health of forest
   systems, and increase their vulnerability to pests and other biotic factors. This is turn could
   degrade forests reducing their ability to sequester carbon and increasing the likelihood that
   forests become a source of CO2 emissions. Less suitable climatic conditions and associated
   biotic pressures are also expected to decrease tree growth by approximately 30%. Decreased
   growth will reduce the ability of forests to sequester carbon and will have economic
   ramifications20.

   Using Forests to Adapt to and Mitigate Climate Change

173. Forests provide supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural services. These ecosystem
   services support human wellbeing at the local, national, regional and global level, including
   through the sequestration of GHGs and mitigation of climate change. Forests structures,
   species, and species distribution, however, are being modified by climate change.
   Responding to this requires the adaptation of forests themselves in order to prevent the
   degradation of forest resources and to protect the ecosystem services that society relies on for
   its wellbeing.
   20
        There is inadequate data to assess the potential economic impacts, and a 30% decrease in growth cannot assumed to
           be a decrease in contribution to GDP by a third (i.e., roughly 1.3% of GDP) as value addition is not accounted
           for.

   Opportunities Identified

174. Sustainable management of production forests could contribute to mitigating climate
   change through naturally regenerated stands sequestering carbon and reducing the occurrence
   of pests or other biotic factors that degrade forests. To foster sustainable management of
   production forests under private ownership, the government should consider: (i) offering
   guidance for sustainable forest management rather than prescriptive legal and technical
   requirements, fostering innovation, (ii) simplifying rules for administering forests, (iii)
   providing technical support for innovating in forest management, harvesting and value
   addition, (iv) offering incentives and opportunities for smallholders to associate and benefit
   from economies of scale, and (v) improving and extending road access in production forest
   areas. Well planned and maintained road access can make a positive contribution to
   mitigating climate change as it enables forest management, continuous monitoring of forest
   health, and assists in preventing and putting out fires and pest infestations (both of which can
   release CO2).

175. Maintaining protection forests that promote sustainable use of resources can enhance the
   resilience of forest systems, help preserve biodiversity, and reduce carbon emissions.
   Romania has an obligation to meet the directives associated with Natura 2000. Facilitating
   management of existing protected areas and Natura 2000 sites with forests can help reduce
   carbon emissions from degradation of these sites. The extent of carbon sequestration,
   however, will be lower in those sites where the trees are of an older age class. Achieving the
   objective of protected forests requires providing the necessary human and financial resources
   to develop management plans and review, approve and implement management plans for
   protected natural areas. It will also require determining how to most effectively ensure
   compliance with Natura 2000 – with incentives, regulations, technical support, purchasing
   privately owned Natura 2000 sites or a combination of these.

176. Afforestation can increase carbon sequestration, especially during the early stage of tree
   growth (after the initial years). There are approximately 115,129 ha as suitable for
   improvement through afforestation and agricultural areas that are not suitable for cultivation
   are scattered throughout the country. The national forest authorities are considering
   afforestation in largely abandoned agricultural areas in the southern belt of Romania. Due to
   the cost of afforestation, financial resources to support such activities are important. This can
   be provided as compensation for lands being included within a national afforestation program
   that aims to plant contiguous parcels of land (referred to as forest belt in Romania). Financial
   support can also be provided to individual interested in afforestation through appropriate
   credit opportunities. In addition, the ‘infrastructure’ (i.e., capacity for seedling production,

   technical support, accessible data and information on species suitability) for afforestation
   must be in place.

   Proposed Measures for 2013-2020 Programming

177. The Government of Romania has initially identified the following measures from the forest
   sector for the upcoming operational programming cycle (2013-2020):
        Improving forest accessibility by maintaining and building forest roads and other
           accessibility facilities (article 18 in the EU Regulation for programming 2014-2020
           CSF).
        Investments in new technology, processing and marketing forestry: products (article
           22).
        Implementation of Natura 2000, afforestation, and establishment of forest belts
           (article 31, 35).
        First afforestation of agricultural lands (article 22).
        Training and consultancy (article 15 and 16).
        Support for organizing the supply chain in forestry.
        Insurance and mutual funds in forestry.
        Support for innovation and collaboration.

178. The contribution of forests to GHG emission reduction requires that the sector manage the
   resource in a sustainable manner (keeping the system healthy and trees growing). In Romania
   this requires addressing many of the policy and regulatory challenges and technical and
   access constraints in the sector. Many of the aforementioned measures are important to
   address constraints to sustainable forest management in the current context of Romania.
   Therefore, these measures, if properly implemented, would help contribute to GHG emission
   reduction, adapting forests, and using forests for adaptation to climate change during the
   programming period.

179. The Delegate Ministry on Forests has proposed funding amounts for each measure, with a
   total value of €3.93 billion. This amount is well in excess of the total funding anticipated for
   the overall NRDP. As a consequence several of the measures may not receive the desired
   amount. Using available qualitative and quantitative data, the rapid forest sector assessment
   makes recommendations for refining the measures and enhancing their positive impact on
   mitigating climate change.

   Recommendations and Conclusions

180. The measure on improving road access will be fundamental for ensuring that forests help
   mitigate climate change because of the net benefits for SFM. To effectively deliver positive
   climate outcomes with this measure it will be important to:
        Ensure that the roads that are rehabilitated, and that new roads constructed, improve
          the contribution of forests to carbon sequestration, by ensuring that the eligibility
          criteria are inclusive of all the entities managing forests and requiring a clear
          indication of the potential reduction in GHGs as a result of the project;
        Base financing provided for forest roads on the economic rationale and direct and
          indirect contribution to climate change mitigation (including based on rough
          estimates of carbon sequestration or accumulation in the medium term) - the
          investments made through this measure should result in benefits that would not have
          arisen without the measure;
        Consider the current distribution of markets and capacity for timber harvesting and
          processing; and
        Raise awareness about the opportunity for financial support for road rehabilitation,
          maintenance and construction, including using the networks available to the forest
          associations.

181. The current funding request of €700million, while seemingly significant, would (using data
   from the previous programming period) allow for rehabilitation of roughly 7500 km of road.
   This would augment the rehabilitated roads by 2.5m/ha of production forest or 1.15m/ha
   overall. This addition still leaves Romania well below accessibility levels found in other
   comparable EU28 member countries. A more detailed analysis is needed to determine how
   much of the total available funds for the sector should be reallocated to this measure while
   ensuring that it remains feasible to implement.

182. The measure on investing in new technology, marketing and processing is well justified
   because it helps forest companies that have not upgraded their technology, improving SFM
   and having positive impact on soil and efficiency of management. It will also increase
   efficiency and improve value-addition and revenue from these products. To ensure this
   measure delivers positive benefits, the agency should:
        Give priority to co-financing environmentally friendly technologies;
        Ensure that if technologies are being “imported”, support is provided to adapt them to
           the conditions under which SMEs are operating in Romania;
        Encourage the development of new technologies within Romania; and

            Provide information regarding what “environmentally friendly” entails;

183. The extent of private ownership of forests requires adequate policy measures and
   incentives for small and large private forest landholders to comply with the national
   objectives for forest resource management. This is especially the case for areas for protection
   that are designated Natura 2000 sites, of which 36% are on private landholdings. Prior to
   finalizing the measure on Natura 2000, it is necessary to assess the suitability of using
   compensation to improve compliance with Natura 2000 requirements. Use of compensation
   should be compared with the use of forest legislation to achieve Natura 2000 objectives (as is
   done elsewhere in Europe), and the possibility of using the funds to purchase private lands
   that are designated Natura 2000. Furthermore, the feasibility of compensation should be
   examined as EU regulations require a clear articulation of additionality to complying with
   Natura 2000 requirements to justify provision of compensation. If a compensation measure is
   put in place, it should involve a simple and straightforward mechanism for providing
   payouts. The funds should be accessible to all stakeholders groups, and the selection process
   must be inclusive.

184. Given the increased awareness of Natura 2000, the sector will be able to deliver on this
   measure more effectively during this programming cycle. Additional awareness raising,
   however, needs to be done among small landowners who would be eligible for the
   compensation payments. Furthermore, there is the need to address the institutional issues that
   constrained effective administration of the measure on Natura 2000 during the last
   programming cycle.

185. There is limited data to assess appropriateness of the requested funding allocation (€2.5
   billion) for this measure. Based on 2009 data, an allocation of €150 million would provide all
   private landholders with Natura 2000 sites with compensation at 2009 levels. Determination
   of the appropriate funding level for this measure requires updated estimates of the cost of
   administering and monitoring Natura 2000 activities, cost for afforestation of degraded lands,
   establishment of forest belts, and provision of compensation payments.

186. The measure for Natura 2000, afforestation, forest belts, should be disaggregated and the
   afforestation, forest belt activities should be merged with the first afforestation of agricultural
   lands. Use of funds for afforestation projects should prioritize geographic areas where the
   activity can generate multiple benefits such as combatting desertification and improving
   degraded lands. For example, some areas in south-east Romania are more suitable for
   afforestation and would significantly benefit from such investments. Another approach
   would determine where to support investments in afforestation based on their potential
   benefit to adapting agriculture to climate variability.

                                                                                                                              97
187. The measure on first afforestation of agricultural lands can also help mitigate and adapt to
   climate change by enabling CO2 sequestration and contributing to resilience to climate
   change. The funding requested for this measure (€250 million) could enable the afforestation
   of somewhere between 38,000ha and 100,000 ha (depending on where the projects are
   implemented). This is an ambitious target, and will require establishing and effectively using
   existing supporting services (from private or public sector) such as availability of good
   quality seedlings and extension support. In addition, there is need to:
            Prioritize afforestation projects based on areas with high potential and notable co-
             benefits;
            Keep the application and eligibility requirements clear and simple;
            Adopt inclusive criteria for eligibility;
            Ensure a significant portion of the upfront costs are covered with this measure;
            Improve the implementation arrangements for this measure, drawing on lessons from
             previous attempts to implement afforestation; and
            Raise awareness.

188. The impact of forestry measures requires time. Steps should be taken to put the necessary
   supporting systems in place to avoid any further delays (e.g., afforestation measures will
   initially require increased capacity for seedling production). This reality underscores the
   importance of initiating the measure early in the programming cycle to achieve the desired
   outcomes and envisaged impact on GHG emissions.

189. The sector should also consider integrating measures for forests in other SOPs, where
   appropriate. For example the conditions necessary for research could potentially be delivered
   as part of other SOPs that have a focus on research. Additional examples include
   opportunities to integrate elements of the measures on afforestation into the NRDP measures
   for agricultural land; building climate resilience of infrastructure would include measures to
   maintain forests on slopes to mitigate landslides and reduce soil erosion; diversifying the
   energy mix (especially in rural areas) to include biomass based energy, helping shift to a low
   carbon energy portfolio.

190. In summary, the General Directorate of Forestry proposed measures comply with the EU
   requirement that 30% of the allocated funding have positive climate relevance. The measures
   with the larger funding request enable sustainable forest management. Several of the
   measures require additional funding to bridge the gap between the current situation and
   optimal potential. The proposed funding levels, however, are more realistic given the targets

                                                                                                                              98
   that will need to be met (with the exception of the proposed funding for Natura 2000,
   afforestation, and forest belts).

191. An advantage of investing in the forest sector for mitigation is the co-benefits from SFM of
   production and protection forests. Improved forest management practices that internalize the
   potential impact of climate change can build the resilience of forests to climate variability,
   enhance the resilience of other sectors (e.g., agriculture), restore degraded lands, and provide
   a source of renewable energy for rural areas that has a low carbon footprint. Sustainable
   management of forests is instrumental for achieving Romania’s international obligations and
   EU directives.

192. Providing support for the forest sector through the NRDP and SOPs can be a “no regrets”
   investment. Many of the measures in the forest sector can jointly address mitigation and
   adaptation issues (e.g., afforestation of degraded lands). It, however, is important to ensure
   they do not have unintended consequences (e.g., decrease in CO2 removal). Monitoring
   change in carbon sequestration and monitoring harvesting and planting using some of the
   recently available technology and low cost system would assist in preventing negative
   outcomes.

193. The table below summarizes the specific recommended mitigation and adaptation actions
   in the forest sector. The recommendations are presented based on forest classification –
   protection, production – and also for afforestation. Cross-cutting recommendations are
   presented at the end of the table. It should be noted that for these actions to have the intended
   impact will require enabling institutional, policy, and planning conditions in the sector. Some
   of these are briefly described under specific measures and in more detail in the rapid sector

Component B Synthesis Report - Summary of Sector Rapid Assessments and Recommendations for Incorporating Climate Actions in the

                                                                                                                          104
                                                  7. CONCLUSION

194. Based on the results of rapid assessments on climate risks and actions in six key sectors—
   energy, transport, urban, water, agriculture, and forestry—this report recommends climate
   actions the Romanian government should consider in order to meet the EU’s requirement for
   devoting 20% of spending to tackling climate change in the operational programming of EU
   funds for 2014-2020. These actions address both mitigation and adaptation, covering a wide
   range of approaches from policy reform schemes to physical investments, from urban energy
   efficiency to multimodal transport, from irrigation to sustainable forestry management.

195. The six sector rapid assessments were carried out over just 2 to 4 months in the fall of
   2013. Due to time limitations on the rapid assessments, and unavailability during the period
   of the government’s drafting of OPs and other sector plans which serve as their basis, these
   assessments have not yet evaluated and prioritized specific investment proposals based on
   cost-effective analysis. The climate actions recommended in this report are therefore generic.

196. Nevertheless, the report, together with the six sector reports on which it is based, presents
   rich information on the links between sector interventions and climate change and provides
   many practical recommendations to Romania. It will be a good starting point for the
   government as they begin to consider integrating actions that address climate change into
   their sectoral operational programs for 2014-2020.

197. Moving forward, as the draft OPs become available for review the World Bank will
   continue to advise the government units and their consultants on how to integrate climate-
   related recommendations into them. As outlined in the climate change program, the World
   Bank will continue analysis through in-depth sectoral overview and modeling across the six
   sectors, further identifying and prioritizing a wide range of interventions addressing climate
   change, and further assisting the Romanian government in developing an action plan for
   addressing climate change and operationalizing its national climate change strategy.

           EC Methodology for Tracking Climate Change Related Expenditure

The EC has prepared a draft methodology for tracking climate change related
expenditure.21 This annex provides a brief summary for the convenient reference of the
governments.

Where operations supported from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund involve several
intervention field codes, the managing authority has two options:
     To use the most prominent part of the operation to choose the intervention field
       code.
     To use several codes, allocated based on the approximate pro rate divisions of
       expected costs across different intervention fields.

The Commission recommends managing authorities the use of multiple codes for major
projects. The approach involves two phases; (a) attaching weights to the codes under the
intervention category; (b) in the case of intervention fields with a zero weighting, the
information could be filtered through Thematic Objective No.4 “supporting the shift to
the low carbon economy in all sectors” and Thematic Objective No.5 “promoting climate
change adaptation, risk prevention, and management.” The financial data reported (in
connection with codes which generally having a weighting of 0 percent) under these two
climate related thematic objectives would be counted as contributing to the climate
objective with a 40 percent weight.

The draft nomenclature of categories of interventions for transport has the following
coefficients for the calculation of support to the climate change objectives:
    Railways: 40%
    Roads: 0%
    Multimodal transport: 40 %
    Airports: 0%
    Seaports: 40%
    Inland waterways and ports: 40%
    Urban transport infrastructure: 40%
    Intelligent transport systems for urban transport: 40%

framework, the categories of intervention for the IGJ Goal and for the ETC Goal, Based on fiches no 2 and 24A, Version 1 – 29

Component B Synthesis Report - Summary of Sector Rapid Assessments and Recommendations for Incorporating Climate Actions in the
2014-2020 Sectoral Operational Programs
                                                                                                                          109
What this means is that roads and airports have a weight of zero, and do not contribute to
reaching the 20 percent target, unless the case can be made that they address Thematic
Objective No.4 or Objective No.5. Thus a new motorway that is built with revised design
standards that has made the infrastructure resilient to expected climate patterns (increased
heat or flooding) could contribute to the climate objective.

The decision on how the 20 percent of climate change expenditure for all Operational
Programs will be applied is a decision left to each member state. It remains to be defined
how this target will be applied, and whether transport will need to make a contribution
larger than 20 percent or not. It will potentially affect the final modal composition of the
proposed infrastructure investments.

The same logic applies to other sector-related actions identified within the different
categories of interventions.

The draft nomenclature of categories of interventions for energy has the following
coefficients for the calculation of support to the climate change objectives:
         Electricity (storage and transmission): 0%
         Natural gas: 0%
         Renewable energy: wind 100%
         Renewable energy: solar 100%
         Renewable energy: biomass 100%
         Other renewable energy: (including hydroelectric, geothermal, marine energy and
          other) and renewable energy integration (including storage, power to gas,
          renewable hydrogen infrastructure) 100%
         Energy efficiency renovation of public infrastructure, demonstration projects and
          supporting measures: 100%
         Energy efficiency renovation of existing housing stock, demonstration projects
          and supporting measures: 100%
         Intelligent Energy Distribution Systems at medium and low voltage levels
          (including smart grids, ICT systems): 100%
         High efficiency co-generation and district heating: 100%

The draft nomenclature of categories of interventions that link to urban, waste and
water related actions can be found under the environmental infrastructure and
environment fields of the fiche 2. It has the following coefficients for the calculation of
support to the climate change objectives:
