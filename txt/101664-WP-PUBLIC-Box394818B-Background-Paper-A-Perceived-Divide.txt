                                       The Gini coefficient in Indonesia has increased sharply
                                       over the past 15 years, increasing from 30 in 2000 to
                                       41 in 2013. In a 2014 survey on public perceptions of
                                       inequality, most Indonesians consider income distribution
                                       in Indonesia to be “very unequal” or “not equal at all.” In
                                       addition, half of all respondents feel that Indonesia has
                                       become “more unequal” or “much more unequal” over
                                       the past five years.

                                       r e a l i z e . Respondents believe that the ideal income
                                       distribution is one where the top 20 percent of the
                                       population earn as much as the bottom 40 percent. Not
                                       with standing this ideal, respondents estimate that the
                                       actual income distribution has the top 20 percent earning
                                       as much as the bottom 60 percent. However, the 2014
                                       National Socio-economic Survey (Susenas 2014) suggests
                                       that the richest 20 percent actually earn as much as the
                                       rest of the population combined. Furthermore, because
                                       household surveys typically do not capture the incomes
                                       of the richest Indonesians, the real level of inequality in
                                       Indonesia is probably even higher.

          work hard enough, with another 41 percent saying that
          while this is difficult it is still doable. Thus, 48 percent of

           WHY DO PUBLIC
           PERCEPTIONS
           OF INEQUALITY
           MATTER?
          Although inequality has risen in Indonesia over the past decade, public concern towards
          the issue of inequality has been low historically. But with the current government setting
          targets to reduce inequality, and the media and politicians paying more attention to
          the issue, public perceptions may be shifting. This study examines public perceptions
          towards inequality using recent data to help us understand how the public perceives
          the issue and if there is general support for a public policy response.

            The survey asked respondents to create an income distribution by dividing 50 coins among ﬁve income quintiles. See Annex A, Questions
          V_10 and V_11 for the full survey question.

             Susenas only asks about household consumption, not income. In fact, income inequality is always higher than consumption
          inequality because richer households do not spend all of their income, but save some instead. Previous estimates put Indonesia’s
          income Gini 6.4 points higher than its consumption Gini (World Bank, 2015). So, a consumption Gini of 41 implies an income Gini
          of around 47. Moreover, it is believed that many richer households are not measured by Susenas, suggesting that actual inequality
          may be even higher. Current World Bank research is using credit data to estimate a more accurate number of wealthier Indonesians
          (World Bank; forthcoming).

             Most respondents believe that poverty is caused by one’s circumstances at birth. But the
             survey also emphasizes the strong belief in hard work: almost half of respondents believe
             that people become rich through hard work and one third thinks that it is possible for the
             poor to escape poverty through hard work.

          WHICH INEQUALITY-
          REDUCING
          POLICIES ARE
          MOST SUPPORTED?
          Overall, Indonesians believe that inequality reduction is an urgent priority. Consistent
          with beliefs on the drivers of inequality, policy support is strongest for: programs that
          provide assistance to households that are poor or vulnerable to poverty and protect them
          from shocks; policies and programs that provide better work opportunities; and e orts to
          eradicate corruption.

          When asked about whether it is urgent for the Government          research by Dabla-Norris, et al. (2015) suggests that

          it either “urgent” or “very urgent” (Figure 11). This attitude    accelerate economic growth. When confronted with this
          towards inequality suggests that inequality reduction is          hypothetical trade-o and asked to choose between
          one of the key lenses through which the public assesses           “incomes of poor people grow quickly, but inequality

 Deﬁnition of household and income


 HOU SE HO LD is a group of people who usually live together under the same roof and eat from the same kitchen.


 • One household may consist of only one member of the household.
 • HOUSE HO LD members are all the people who U SUA L LY L I VE A N D E AT I N T H E S A M E H O US E H O L D , whether adults, children,
 infants, or those who are travelling (less than 6 months) but do not intend to move, or anyone else who may not be members of the family but
 ordinarily stay in this household, such as house maids or people who temporarily stay or friends.


 IN CO ME O F A HO USE HO L D is money earned by the household members which increases the total household income.
 A housemaid who lives in a household, for example, is not considered earning income. For farmers producing crops for their own household needs,
 the income CAN B E E ST IMAT E D from the agricultural products consumed when assessed with money.

 Now I will ask about the people of Indonesia. Suppose the Indonesian population is divided into fi ve c o m m un i ty g ro up s. Each group has
 the sa me number of popu l ati on , i . e . , e ach has e q u a l l y o n e - fi f t h o f t h e t ot a l p o p ul a t i o n . I f t h e I n d o n e si a n p o p ulation is
 now 250 million people, then each group equally consists of 50 million people. However, the group has ﬁve di erent incomes.


 The ﬁve community groups are depicted with staircases like this (SHOW STAIRCASE IMAGE):


 1 . The top of the stairs is one ﬁfth of the population whose income is the highest, or t h e ri c h e st group
 2 . The second step from the top is one ﬁfth of the population whose income is much, or t h e ri c h group
 3 . The third stair from the top is one ﬁfth of the population whose income is moderate, or the m i d d l e group
 4 . The fourth stair from the top is one ﬁfth of the population whose income is less, or t h e p o o r group
 5 . The bottom of the stairs is one ﬁfth of the population whose income is very little, or t h e p o o re st group.




 Interviewer Guidelines
                                           •	    Ask if respondent has understood the explanation of the staircase image.
                                                 If not, please explain once again from the beginning.
                                           •	    If respondent has understood, then please show 50 pieces of coins in 500 (ﬁve hundred) rupiah denomina-
                                                 tions. No need to mention the number of coins shown, unless respondent asks.




 Here are some coins. Suppose the whole coins are the entire income of Indonesia.

 In your opinion, how much income of each community group in
 Indonesia IN FACT today?

 To answer this question, try to divide the coins into the ﬁve steps.


 You do not need to worry that you have a wrong answer. It is your e st i m a t i o n only. Please just be reminded, that the number of coins for the lower
 step should not be more than the higher step, because the higher step is the richer group.


 For example only, if you consider the whole income NOW I N FA CT belongs to the highest income or the richest group only, put all coins on the
 top step. If you assume that NOW I N FA CT all groups have the same income, put all the coins equally on each of the steps.

 Now let’s look back the Staircase Image. And suppose that the whole of the coins is the entire income of Indonesia.

 In your opinion, what SHOULD BE the income of each
 community group in Indonesia?
 To answer this question, try to divide back the coins in to the ﬁve steps.


 You do not need to worry that you have a wrong answer. It is according to your consi derati on only. Please just be reminded, that the number of
 coins for the lower step should not be more than the higher step, because the higher step is the richer group.


 For example only, if in your opinion the whole income S HO ULD belong to the highest income group or the richest group only, then put all the coins
 on the top step. Or if you consider that all groups S HO UL D have the same income, put all the coins equally on each of the steps.

Age Grouping In Analysis
The age groups below were chosen for two reasons:
1. No a priori assumptions about particular age thresholds that a ect perceptions about inequality;
2. Maintaining roughly equal group sizes.

Education Groups
Education groups were constructed based on the response to survey question V_6.Due to the small sizes of “in-between” groups, i.e. respondents
that started the next level of education but did not complete them, the analysis groups those groups downwards, e.g. “did not complete SMP” is
included in “Completed SD”, etc. The ﬁnal ﬁve groups used are:

                                      1. No education completed                              4. Completed SMA (senior high school)
                                      2. Completed SD (primary school)                       5. Completed tertiary education
                                      3. Completed SMP ( junior high school)

Income groups
Household income approximations were constructed based on responses to questions V_62 to V_70 (see Annex A), which capture up to ﬁve main
income sources for the household. The questions were structured as follows:

                                      1. Below 200 thousand                                  7. 1.2-1.399 million
                                      2. 200-399 thousand                                    8. 1.4-1.599 million
                                      3. 400-599 thousand                                    9. 1.6-1.799 million
                                      4. 600-799 thousand                                    10. 1.8-1.999 million
                                      5. 800-999 thousand                                    11. 2 million – 4 million
                                      6. 1 million -1.199 million                            12. Above 4 million


The total household monthly income is obtained by using the maximum of the answer range (199 thousand, 399 thousand, 599 thousand, etc.)
and summing up all ﬁve income sources. This number is then divided by the reported number of household members, resulting in a per capita
household monthly income.


The per capita household monthly income is then compared to the three di erent dividers: the poverty line, 1.5 times the poverty line, and 3.5 times
the poverty line. This results in four income class groups: the Poor (below the poverty line), the Vulnerable (between the poverty line and 1.5 times
the poverty line), the Emerging Consumer Class (between 1.5 and 3.5 times the poverty line), and the Consumer Class (above 3.5 times the poverty
line). This methodology is discussed further in The World Bank’s Report on the Indonesian Middle Class. The poverty lines used are based on the
September 2013 National Socio-Economic Survey (Survei Sosio-Ekonomi National, Susenas), and are di erent for urban and rural respondents in
each province.
