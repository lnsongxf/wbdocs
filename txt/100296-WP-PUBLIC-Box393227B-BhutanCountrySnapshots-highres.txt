    majority of the arable land and produce most of the      Environment

    the agriculture sector provides livelihood to 56.6
    percent of the total population, contributing to 13.8
    percent of the total GDP.

    While the contribution of the agriculture sec-
    tor to GDP has been declining, it continues to be
    an important sector. It is particularly important
    as a source of employment and a force in reducing
    poverty. However, the sector’s growth remained
    insufficient to adequately address poverty and at-
    tain food security. Immigration from rural to urban
    areas, particularly by youth and men looking for a
    more modern life style, has resulted in the femini-
    zation of the agriculture sector particularly in the
    lagging areas.

A particularly important element is the need
for integrated water management. Despite the
positive outlook for water availability, incipient
challenges relate to the sustainability of urban wa-
ter supply systems and functionality of existing ru-
ral water supply schemes. Ongoing soil erosion and
deforestation threaten watershed conditions and
their functional integrity. Concerns about water
quality stem from the rise in domestic and indus-
trial waste generation, along with improper dis-
posal and runoff from agricultural fields and urban
centers.

The government has taken several important
steps to preserve the environment. Bhutan’s
environment policies include: (i) mandating in the
Constitution a minimum forest cover of 60 percent
of the country’s total land area; and (ii) increasing
the proportion of land under protected area status
to around 50 percent at present from 26 percent
in 2000. The Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmen-           Bhutan has taken important steps to preserve

unique challenges in urban development – the rap-

of serviced land.

PROJECT BACKGROUND:
The Kingdom of Bhutan has experienced rapid social and economic development over the past two decades, and this socio-economic transition is fueling rapid
urbanization. Meeting the challenges of urban development, management, and finance is now a key developmental agenda of the government of and its international
development partners. The World Bank started its support with the Bhutan Urban Development Project (1999-2006), which helped develop urban infrastructure
systems in 10 secondary towns. The government showed strong interest and appreciation of the Bank’s policy advice through the project and technical assistance
to prepare the National Urbanization Strategy (2008) and the Thimphu City Development Strategy. On the government side, the Local Government Act of 2009 and
Municipal Finance Policy (2012) provide the framework for the roles and responsibilities of urban local governments. In that context, the ongoing BUDP2 focuses on
supporting urban/municipal development in Thimphu (the capital and Bhutan’s largest city) and Phuentsholing (second largest city and a commercial hub), as well as
technical assistance for the urban local governments and the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement.

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:
The project development objectives are to (i) support Bhutan’s municipal reform program by strengthening municipal finance and management services in Thimphu
and Phuentsholing; and (ii) improve infrastructure services in northern Thimphu where no formal services are currently available.
The BUDP2 consist of three components: (i) municipal finance and management; (ii) Thimphu Northern Area Development; and (iii) capacity building. Component 1
($1.5 million) aims at strengthening the institutional systems of Thimphu and Phuentsholing Thromdes, or city corporations. The support for the city-specific reforms
is being done broadly through strengthening both the local revenue administration systems and processes, and the expenditure management systems and financial
management systems and processes of the two city corporations. This component also supports government policy reforms aimed at setting up a policy framework for
municipal financing. Component 2 ($9.3 million) supports the development of basic infrastructure systems in two “local area plans” in northern Thimphu, including
roads, storm-water drainage, water supply, sewerage, and street lighting, as well as support for increasing low-income housing units in these areas. Under Component
3 ($1.2 million), resources are being provided for training programs, equipment, technical assistance, and studies based on the needs of Thimphu and Phuentsholing
Thromdes. This component aims to significantly upgrade each city corporation’s capacities in various aspects of their internal work processes and service delivery to
citizens through training of operational staff and provision of relevant equipment.

RESULTS: [TARGET VALUES AT END OF PROJECT]
■■     Increase in local revenue collection: 50 percent by Thimphu and 40 percent by Phuentsoling.
■■     New building permits issued for serviced plots: 175 (in two Thimphu “local area plans” being developed).
■■     Number of households with new piped water and sewerage connections: 600 (in two Thimphu “local area plans”).
■■     Number of municipal staff trained: 250 (with 150 in Thimphu and 100 in Phuentsholing)

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:
     The Remote Rural Communities Development Project (RRCDP) project area covers 26 geogs, or village administrative units, and six dzongkhags or districts, in
     southwestern and south central Bhutan. The RRCDP is designed to improve living conditions and incomes in the country’s poorer and more remote rural areas. The
     populations in these areas currently rely on subsistence agriculture, and lack roads, irrigation, technologies, and community and social infrastructure that would allow
     them to improve their incomes and social integration.

     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:
     The main objective of the project is to increase agriculture productivity in remote rural areas by improving access to markets, irrigation, agricultural technologies, and
     community infrastructure. Improvement in market access would be achieved by investments in farm roads and marketing infrastructure. Agricultural productivity
     and rural incomes would increase through promotion of improved irrigation and agronomic practices, and rehabilitation of productive assets for key commodities.
     Community-led investments will improve the access of the poorest people to the critical and missing infrastructure in the selected area. The RRCDP consists of three
     components:

     Rural Infrastructure: Connects the communities to larger roads and regional markets and to improve production potential through improved availability of irrigation.

     Community, Marketing and Productive Infrastructure: Covers investments in marketing and post-harvest infrastructure, critical community-level infrastructure,
     and investments identified by producers to increase agricultural productivity.

     Project Management and Institutional Strengthening: Supports project management, including the monitoring and evaluation functions. It covers: (i) technical
     and financial management; (ii) procurement; and (iii) supervision of compliance with environmental and social safeguards.

     RESULTS/KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Twenty three irrigation schemes have been initiated so far, which is about 50 percent of the target. Of these, six schemes (about 14km) have been completed; an
            additional seven schemes are under construction.
     ■■     Seven cardamom propagation houses and one citrus propagation house were constructed.
     ■■     Forty seven community subprojects in 27 chiwogs in the pre-identified nine geogs (two in Chukha and seven in Samtse) have been completed or are ongoing,
            benefitting 2,509 households (15,981 people) in total.
     ■■     Construction on one of the five farm roads has started.

     *As of September 2015


PROJECT BACKGROUND:
The core issue to be addressed by the project is the mitigation of illegal wildlife trade across borders as the supply of wildlife “goods” are sourced from across South
Asia (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal) and South East Asia (Laos and Vietnam). The threat of illegal wildlife trade is highest in border-straddling areas. With an
initial focus on border habitats, the proposed second phase of the project to be implemented in and by Bhutan would lead to harmonized enforcement standards,
develop best practice applications, share successful schemes and conduct knowledge/research across the “supply” region. They represent the only viable measures for
substantially and comprehensively reducing illegal wildlife trade.

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:
To assist the participating governments of Bhutan and others to build or enhance shared capacity, institutions, knowledge, and incentives to collaborate in tackling
illegal wildlife trade and other selected regional conservation threats to habitats in border areas.

Components
Capacity building for addressing the illegal trans-boundary wildlife trade		 $800,000
Promoting wildlife conservation in Asia					                                 $2.01 million
Project coordination and communication					$40,000

RESULTS/KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     Development of one protocol each on a common research agenda, knowledge sharing, collaboration, and division of labor.
■■     Implementation of one regional pilot or initiative in wildlife enforcement and conservation.
■■     Improvement of Bhutan’s capacity to fight wildlife crime through the development of information/intelligence networks and to boost conservation through better
       park management and training to staff in the relevant agency.

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:
     Bhutan faces a set of challenges typical of countries seeking to make a rapid transition from a mostly rural, agrarian society to one characterized by increasing levels of
     education, a large number of young people looking for more opportunities and, with increased globalization, shifting expectations and aspirations on the part of its
     population. Strengthening of the banking sector is a key prerequisite for fostering private sector-led growth and poverty alleviation. The IFC’s landmark $28.5 million
     investment for a 20 percent stake in BNB was its first equity investment in the country. It also was the largest foreign investment in Bhutan to date.

     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:
     The project brings together IFC’s two pillars of investment and advisory services. IFC’s funding will help expand the bank’s outreach into the underserved population
     of Bhutan. By capitalizing on BNB’s strong platform to reach underserved small and medium enterprises, the expected improved access to finance will help address a
     key impediment to private-sector competitiveness.

     EXPECTED RESULTS:
     The project will initiate and generate increased access to finance in Bhutan, a frontier market, with a sizeable underserved and rural population. It also will provide
     BNB with access to international best practices in the areas of information technology, risk management, social and environmental management, and corporate
     governance.

PROJECT BACKGROUND:
Zhiwa Ling Hotel has been operational since 2005. It is a locally owned and operated 45-room five-star property located in Paro.. The investment of $3.5 million in the
expansion of the Zhiwa Ling Hotel is the first external commercial borrowing availed by a private-sector entity in Bhutan and has involved significant legal work and
very close government engagement.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
The project will contribute to the development of the tourism sector in Bhutan. More specifically it will: create a demonstration and catalytic effect with regard to
attracting private investment into Bhutan in general and to high-end hotels in particular; contribute to job creation; support the government’s ”high value - low
impact” approach to expanding the tourism sector in Bhutan by attracting high spending, environmentally conscious and culturally interested visitors to the country;
transfer international best practices in hotel management – including service and quality standards, occupational health and safety, and environmental management
– from an experienced sponsor to the emerging Bhutanese tourism industry; encourage utilization of a significant proportion of goods and services required by the
resort guests from local sources, which will help develop the local supply base and encourage the growth of SMEs;
