         Key Water and Sanitation Sector Challenges
         XXReducing    pollution of water resources used for drinking purposes. Groundwater resources,
            which are the drinking water resources, face elevated levels of nitrate and pesticides in some
            regions. The protection of resources against pollution due to the agricultural sector and the
            industry is an ongoing challenge.
         XXAdapting   to climate change. Adaption of the sewer systems to manage heavier rainfalls due to
            climate change will be an important challenge to meet in the near future.
         XXImproving    asset management. During the last decades huge amounts of money have been
            invested into the water supply and wastewater sectors. It is important to maintain these assets to
            stay on a stable good practice level of service. Rehabilitation of existing infrastructure has been
            identified as a priority, and a strategy has been planned for 2012–2021.

Economy. Austria, a country with a high standard of living, has been a member of the EU since 1995. Austria
has close to 8.5 million inhabitants, according to the 2014 census. Sixty-six percent of the population lives in urban
settings, and the country is densely populated, with 102 inhabitants/km2 (World Bank 2015). GDP per capita is
$44,149 (in current international dollars), making Austria a high-income country (World Bank 2015). The overall
economic situation is good, with unemployment around 6%, but the Gini coefficient is 27.0, which means that a
significant share of wealth belongs to only a small percentage of the population. The lowest 50% of households own
only 4% of the property.

Governance. Austria has three administrative levels (national, regional, local). The central government consists of
13 ministries (BKA 2015), which are responsible for national legislation. Regional ministers administrate the regional
money for their specific departments, and supervise the adjoined authorities. The country is divided into 9 regional
state administrations, which enforce and implement national laws, and which are legislatively responsible for, for
example, land use, construction legislation, and environmental protection. There are 95 administrative districts
throughout the country that are integrated into the regional administration within district authorities (Statistics Austria
2015). On the third level, 2,354 self-administrated Austrian municipalities are responsible for local compliance with
regional laws. Regions oversee municipal fulfilment of their duties, among which are provision of water supply and
wastewater treatment.

Water resources. Austria is rich in high-quality drinking water resources. Austria has both a very good
hydrogeological situation, with the Alps and the alpine headwaters of the Danube, and a long history of water resource
protection of both groundwater and surface water. Large areas of the country can be supplied with native drinking
water from springs and wells that are available in great quantity and quality for the resident municipalities. Some
flat parts of Austria are affected by lower precipitation, which led to the establishment of water boards owned by
the connected municipalities to solve quantity problems and partial overuse of local aquifers. In these areas, there
is the need for some coordination among other stakeholders, like agriculture or the mineral raw material industry,
with respect to groundwater quality. Water associations have been established over the last 100 years to balance the
interests among those stakeholders and to prevent exhausting the resource. All climate scenarios until 2050 show
only a small change in precipitation over the year. However, differences between areas have been spotted, and areas

with lower yearly precipitation are expected to have even less precipitation in the future. Based on this knowledge, and
due to general (technical) secure supply issues, the water supply systems became more and more interconnected
through pipes and through cooperatives. Because of the high general availability of water in Austria, no water
shortage is expected. Water supply for households and industry is seen as secure.

Water supply sources. Austria meets its drinking water demand with spring water and groundwater. Surface
water is not used. Overall water availability is approximately 77.7 Bm³ per year (FAO Aquastat 2015). Austrian water
suppliers extract about 800 Mm³ per year for Austrian drinking water.

Ongoing or planned reforms. There is currently no ongoing reform in the water and sanitation sector in Austria.
However, issues that will need to be addressed have been identified in strategic planning documents, such as the
National Water Management Plan 2009. Issues include water resource protection from micropollutants, rehabilitation
of existing infrastructure (planning strategy for 2013–2021), and climate change adaptation targeted at karst areas
and flood risk management.

Service coverage. The Austrian population has full access to drinking water and sanitation services. Access to
piped water is universal; 90% of the population is connected to a public water supply, and 10% rely on self-provision
from their own wells and springs (Figure 3). Ninety-nine percent of the population has access to a flush toilet, and 94%
have connections to public sewers (Figure 3). Up to 95% of the population is connected to a centralized wastewater
treatment plant, and 100% of the wastewater volume collected is treated. (Authors’ elaboration)

Equity of access to services. Poor households and minorities have full access to water and sanitation. One hundred
percent of the Austrian population, including the lowest 40% and the poorest share of the population (those living on
$2.50/day PPP), have access to piped water. Ninety-eight percent of the lowest 40% of the population and 100% of
the poorest population have access to flush toilets. According to official Austrian statistics, minorities represent less
than 1% of the total population. They are well integrated and not marginalized in terms of access to water supply and
sanitation.

Service infrastructure. Austria’s water sector infrastructure has benefited from significant amounts of
investments. Around 76,700 km of water pipes supply more than 90% of the Austrian population (Figure 3). There
are 1.4 million connections and about 2,600 tapped springs. The Austrian population is mainly supplied with non-
treated drinking water (93%). In the wastewater sector, there are around 96,200 km of sewage pipes and 1,842
treatment plants (BMLFUW 2014a). In recent decades, significant amounts of money have been invested in the
water supply and wastewater infrastructure. The current and future priority is to implement a long-term asset
management policy.

Quality of service. The quality of water utilities in Austria is high, as is the quality of drinking water. Drinking
water quality compliance is 99.8% for microbiological and 100% for chemical parameters (BMG 2015a). Water is
provided 24/7. Due to higher efficiency levels of household machines and changes in consumer behavior, average
water consumption per capita has been decreasing for the last six years, from 147 liters per day to 140 liters per
day (Expert estimate). According to the “Austrian Drinking Water Report” (BMG 2015a), in 2010 a relatively high
number of utilities serving less than 5,000 inhabitants asked for 118 exceptional derogations due to high values
of nitrate or pesticides. The same year, utilities serving more than 5,000 inhabitants asked for 5 exceptional
derogations. Around 28,000 inhabitants were affected by these exceptional permissions, 22,000 of whom were
served by 3 several utilities (BMG 2015a).

Customer satisfaction. The Austrian population is highly satisfied with the quality of service. According to a Gallup
international survey, 95% of the population is highly satisfied with drinking water quality and service quality (Gallup
2013), a rate among the highest recorded in the survey. Eighty-six percent of Austrians think the price of water is
acceptable or even low (AQA & ÖVGW 2014).

Overall efficiency. Austrian water utilities are generally efficient. In all data surveys performed over the decades,
more meters than connections were recorded, indicating that most utilities have a metering level of 100%. Additional
meters are installed on transport pipes to monitor losses and zone input values. Only in rural areas do some single,
very small water cooperatives (up to 10 connections) not use water meters. The nonrevenue water level is relatively
low, at 16% and 7m3/km/day in 2012. Staff productivity corresponds to international best practices, with 2 employees
per 1,000 connections. However, staff productivity varies significantly among rural and urban utilities, long-distance
suppliers, and water cooperatives. Staff in many small Water cooperatives often works voluntarily (ÖVGW 2015).

Recent trends. The efficiency of utilities has been stable over time. From 2007 to 2012, the billing collection
rate for a sample of utilities representing at least 50% of the population served was below 100%, showing
some difficulties collecting billed volumes of water (Figure 4). However, in 2013, the collection rate was 105%,
indicating a capacity to recover unpaid bills (ÖVGW 2015). Nonrevenue water remained stable during the same
period.

Overall sector financing. The sector is financed mainly by revenues from tariffs, which entirely cover operations and
maintenance costs, as well as a significant share of investment costs. Some subsidies are granted by national local
budgets to complement funding for investments, which represent 40% of sector spending (Figure 5).

Investment needs. Financing necessary investments is a challenge for the water sector. Austria has developed
a planning strategy for 2013–2021, to implement renovation and new investments for both water and sanitation
infrastructure. This total plan amounts to €6.95 billion, with €2.96 billion dedicated to water and €3.99 billion to
wastewater, representing an average annual per capita investment of €91 (KPC 2014).

Investments. Investment rates are high but declining. Utilities operate with a budget based on revenues from tariffs.
For investments such as rehabilitation of pipes or rehabilitation of drinking water tanks, subsidies are granted from
national and regional budgets. From 1993 to 2013, €13.29 billion was invested in the sanitation sector, and €3.1 billion
was invested in the water supply sector (BMLFUW 2014b). See Figure 7 for a comparison of investment sources and
uses. Overall, the annual investment rate per capita was €73 (Authors’ elaboration), not very far from the necessary
level; however, recent trends indicate decreases in overall investment levels

Cost recovery. Revenues from tariffs represent 87% of sector funding (Authors’ elaboration). As a result, the subsidy
level is low (5%) (Authors’ elaboration). Operating cost coverage (collected revenues over operating costs) reaches
a high level at 1.44 (Authors’elaboration) based on KPC 2008 and Vienna MA 5 2014, and the water and wastewater
tariff represents on average €3.25/m3 (Figure 8).

Tariffs. During the last 12 years, water and wastewater tariffs have increased by 28% (Expert estimate), while the
annual average inflation rate was 2.1% (Statistics Austria 2015). With an average price at €3.25/m3, water represent
58% of the tariff and sanitation 42% (Expert estimate). But prices differ from one utility to another, and a large
variability is observed.

Affordability. In 2012, water and sanitation services remained affordable at only 1.0% of average household
income. For the bottom 40% of the population, a potential water and sanitation invoice amounts to 1.6% of the
household income. As a result, tariffs are generally considered affordable (Figure 8).

Water Sector Sustainability
and Main Challenges
To evaluate and reflect the sustainability of services in the region, an overall sector maturity assessment was done
taking into account four main dimensions: access to services, quality of services, efficiency of services, and financing
of services. Each of these dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators. For each indicator,
best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the region, and countries closest to those
best performers are deemed to have a more mature sector. A more complete description of the methodology to
assess the sector maturity is included in the Annex of the State of the Sector Regional Report from the Danube Water
Program. The outcomes of this assessment for the Austrian water sector are presented in Figure 9, which also shows
average and best practices in the Danube region. The Austrian sector maturity score is 96, which is significantly higher
than the Danube average maturity of 64, and the highest score in the region. The assessment shows that, on average,
the country performs very well in terms of access to piped water and flush toilet, wastewater treatment coverage,
customer satisfaction, continuity of service, wastewater compliance, collection ratio, and nonrevenue water (Figure 9).

The main sector challenges are:

XXReducing    pollution of water resources used for drinking purposes. Groundwater resources, which are the drinking
  water resources, face elevated levels of nitrate and pesticides in some regions. The protection of resources against
  pollution due to the agriculture sector and the industry is an ongoing challenge, since high levels of nitrate and
  pesticides have been recorded in some regions of the country.
XXAdapting to climate change. Adaption of the sewer systems to manage heavier rainfalls due to climate change

  will be an important challenge in the near future. In addition questions of energy recovery and sludge treatment are
  currently being discussed.
XXImproving asset management. During the last decades huge amounts of money have been invested into the

  water supply and wastewater sectors. It is important to maintain these assets to stay on a stable good practice
  level of service. Rehabilitation of existing infrastructure has been identified as a priority, and a strategy has been
  planned for 2013–2021 with a total investment plan of €6.55 billion (2.8 billion for water and 3.75 billion for
  wastewater).
