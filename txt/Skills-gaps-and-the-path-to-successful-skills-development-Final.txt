This report was prepared by a World Bank team led by Johannes Koettl (task team leader), Sara Johansson
de Silva, Olga Kupets, Anna Olefir, and Abla Safir. The report draws on, but also complements, work done
by a large team that was closely involved in the implementation and analysis of the World Bank’s STEP
skills measurement surveys in Armenia, Georgia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
(Macedonia), and Ukraine: Dandan Chen (Armenia and Georgia), Ximena Del Carpio (Ukraine), Katia
Herrera (Armenia and Georgia), Lily Mulatu (Armenia and Georgia), Noel Muller (Ukraine), Bojana Naceva
(Macedonia), Jan Rutkowski (Armenia and Georgia), Indhira Santos (Ukraine), and Alexandria Valerio
(Armenia and Georgia). The methodology on firm survey analysis largely draws from previous work done
by Jan Rutkowski. Finally, the team was greatly assisted by Anna Goodman, Isadora Nouel, and Sreypov
Tep.

The report has greatly benefited from comments and suggestions by the peer reviewers, Lars Sondergaard
and Alexandria Valerio, as well as from inputs from Omar Arias and Andy Mason and participants at a
conference on “Investing in Skills” held in Vienna, June 15-16, 2015.

The report is the result of a collaboration between the World Bank and the Austrian Federal Ministry of
Finance, which has generously supported the implementation of the STEP skills measurement surveys in
the South Caucasus and the Western Balkan though an Externally Financed Output (EFO 436 “Promoting
Employment through Skills Development”). The team would like to express its gratitude to the Austrian
Federal Ministry of Finance, in particular to Seena Garcia, Elisabeth Gruber, Daniel Pajank and Guenther
Schoenleitner.

Additional financing for the Macedonia STEP household survey was provided by United States Agency for
International Development (USAID).

                                   Executive Summary
Relevant skills for the job market—the ability to do well a job that is also in demand—are becoming an
important bottleneck to private sector growth in many countries in the former Eastern Europe and
Central Asia (ECA) region. Economic reforms together with structural and technological change are
bringing about new business opportunities and with them demand for new skills. A new take on skills
development is needed to help increase productivity, job creation, and wages. The different
stakeholders—policy makers that coordinate the strategy around skills and education, workers, the
jobless, students and their families who make decisions to invest in training, and firms—need to
coordinate around the skills agenda.

To make informed decisions, timely and relevant input on the supply and demand for skills is needed.
Are there skills gaps in the sense there are skills in demand that are not available in the population? If
so, what do they look like? What are the consequences of such skills gaps—for workers, for students, for
the economy, for firms? What could be done to narrow the gaps? In addressing these questions, this
report brings together evidence on the availability of skills from STEP (Skills Towards employment and
Productivity) surveys: household level surveys that measure generic skills of the working age population
and track the evolution of skills over cohorts for Armenia, Georgia, Macedonia and Ukraine; and firm
level surveys that identify demand for skills, for Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine. The framework
underlying these surveys adopts a broad view to skills sets, incorporating both general cognitive skills,
including foundational skills like literacy and numeracy, as well as general problem solving skills; socio-
emotional skills, such as the ability to work independently, focus on results, or communicate and
collaborate with co-workers and business contacts; and technical skills, pertaining to specific
occupations. The objective of the report is to use these questions to stimulate discussion as to how to
measure and track skills gaps and subsequently identify a policy agenda to narrow the gaps.

The main messages of the report are:

There is strong evidence of a skills gap, both viewed from the employer and from the workers’ side.

Is there a skills gap? Yes: a significant share of firms report that they do want to hire, but have
difficulties in finding workers with the adequate level of skills. The skills constraint is evident both for
professional, managerial and technical positions (“white collar” occupations), and occupations within
clerical support, sales and services, crafts and trades, plant and machine operators, and elementary
workers (“blue collar” occupations).

Workers also perceive an important but different kind of mismatch. Many of those employed (some 30
percent of workers in Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine, and some 20 percent of those in Macedonia)
consider that the level of education necessary for doing their job is lower than the level of education
they hold. Perceived over-education relative to job requirements is a much more significant problem
than under-education in these four countries compared to most OECD countries.

Employers look for a mix of job-specific and generic cognitive and socio-emotional skills, but the young
and educated generation does not have enough of these skills.

                                                                                                               vi
Employers identify, quite consistently across countries, a set of job relevant skills they need from their
workers. For white collar occupations, employers value technical skills as well as foundational skills like
literacy and numeracy (in Armenia and Georgia), but also the ability to work in teams as well as
independently, the ability to communicate, and general problem solving skills. But these highly
appreciated skills make up a skills gap only if they are also in short supply. Matching what employers say
they want, and what they say they cannot find among young graduates from secondary and tertiary
education, shows that the most significant gaps relate to job specific skills, together with general
problem solving skills, and socio-emotional skills like team work, communication, and openness to new
experience.

Skills gaps carry costs for workers, firms, and the overall economy: workers with lower skills earn less;
and more dynamic firms with a higher potential to create productive jobs are more constrained by
skills gaps than traditional firms; therefore, these skills gaps risk the future economic development of
countries.

The skills gaps are affecting workers, firms, and the economy. First, not having skills worsens labor
market prospects. Skills—in particular information processing skills like reading, writing, numeracy
computer use but also socio-emotional skills such as problem solving, team work, ability to work
independently—are positively correlated with individual worker earnings. Second, many important skills
are still lacking. On the one end of the skills spectrum, foundational skills like literacy still show a
significant gap to OECD countries. On the other end, “new economy skills” are particularly absent,
suggesting that if economies advance on their structural reforms, skills constraints will become even
more significant. And third, the potentially more dynamic firms—those that innovate, have international
contacts, or have grown more rapidly in recent years—tend to experience more significant problems in
hiring skilled workers. As a result, skills gap could affect future economic growth, job creation and
productivity.

Education systems are not equipping graduates with the skills needed to make a successful transition
from school to jobs, and firms are not providing training to continue skills development throughout
adult life.

The education sector, together with families, is primarily responsible for skills formation during early
childhood all the way to early adulthood; employers provide continuous training, both on the job and in
class rooms, during adulthood. But both sides are underperforming. Both employer and household
survey data show that neither firms nor workers are satisfied with the quality of either general
education and vocational training systems. But these problems are also compounded by low incidence
of training among firms, and the fact that education systems and the enterprise sectors appear to have
little interaction, especially on strategic issues such as curriculum development and quality assurance.
These bottlenecks hold back the development of a skilled, flexible work force.

The path to successful skills development goes through reforms that facilitate collaboration around a
strategic vision for skills development, involving employers, education systems, individuals, and labor
markets institutions.


                                                                                                         vii
Given the skills gaps, and the need for more productive jobs, what can be done? Figure A below shows a
list of reform areas and actions for each of the different actors and institutions that are affected by and
can contribute to improving skills. The figure indicates reforms that help (i) employers provide more
training to their staff and coordinate between themselves, and with other stakeholders, around skills
development; (ii) education systems become more responsive to changing needs of labor markets; (iii)
workers, students, and their families make informed decisions around careers and jobs; and (iv) labor
markets reward skills adequately and facilitate the intermediation of skilled workers to firms.

                                                                        Fair firing




Underlying these reforms is a continued need for more and better information on the availability of
skills, the skills needed in labor markets, and the reward to skills. More efforts to measure skills in
consistent and comparable ways to facilitate benchmarking and provide timely input to labor market
and skills policies are needed.

                                        1. Introduction
Countries in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) need to create more and better job opportunities: jobs that
offer working conditions and earnings that can help reduce poverty and inequality and more broadly
ensure the wellbeing of populations in the region. Adults in the ECA region are presently less likely to be
in a job than those living in Latin America, East Asia, or OECD countries (Arias, et al., 2014). Poor job
outcomes reflect a combination of slow recovery after the global financial crisis and weaknesses in the
overall investment climate, which hold back business opportunities in more productive sectors and with
them demand for more workers in productive jobs. Rapidly aging populations also imply that the share
of older people who need to be provided for by working age adults is increasing. More productive jobs
are clearly needed in order even to maintain living standards over time.

In this context, job-market relevant skills—the ability to do well a job that is also in demand by firms—
are becoming an important bottleneck to private sector growth in ECA countries, especially those who
have advanced more on economic reforms and where basic business conditions therefore are in place
(Arias, et al., 2014). Once political and economic stability, functional financial systems, rule of law and
other fundamental conditions are in place, there are openings for new business opportunities. Workers
need to be able to benefit from these openings, foremost by ensuring that they have the skills necessary
to take up the jobs that modern, competitive firms could offer (World Bank, 2012).

Globally, the types of skills in demand are changing and nowhere is this more relevant than in ECA
countries, which are transitioning from one set of production, job, and education and training
opportunities to another. At the same time, changes in technology and organization are transforming
jobs and the skills needed to do them. Globally, significant structural change has led to a decline in
routine, manual skills and an increased use in “new economy skills” (Autor, Levy, & Murnane, 2003). The
process is also seen in ECA countries, especially among younger cohorts, and among countries more
advanced on the reform agenda (Arias, et al., 2014). Emphasis is increasing on tasks that require
abstract thought processes, decision making, team work, leadership; and on manual tasks requiring the
ability to adapt and react to changing circumstances using tools and manual dexterity, but also social
interaction. Structured and repetitive tasks, on the other hand, which can be more easily automated
tend to lose in importance (Arias, et al., 2014). As a consequence, workers need to be prepared with
multiple generic skills that form the basis for acquiring job specific skills and that help them adapt to
changes in tasks over time.

It takes time to transform the composition and level of skills, however, especially when reforms are
needed from early childhood development and up throughout tertiary levels and beyond. The time lag
involved in building skills means that even countries less advanced on the reform agenda should
consider addressing skills inadequacies long before they become the only or most important constraint.
Policymakers, workers, the jobless, students, schools, and firms, need to work together to further the
development of this broad skills set. To inform policy, more information is needed on where the most
urgent skills gap arise and what the nature of the skills gap is, what, what children and adults are most in
need of increasing skills.

The purpose of this report is to close some of the information gaps on skills development and propose a
policy agenda. The report is intended to encourage discussion around how to measure and track skills
gaps and proposes a framework to identify policy proprieties based on the analytical findings. The report
is directed at those interested in the analytical underpinnings for skills development policies, including
those working at a technical level in ministries of education and labor, researchers, and development
specialists supporting different policy initiatives.

First, the report introduces a framework that should aid policymakers and academics to help think
through the key ingredients that are necessary to arrive at successful skills development—and the
potential barriers that are in the way of achieving this. Second, the report tries to answer some key
questions for skills development in ECA: Is there a skills gap, and if so, what is its nature? What are the
consequences of skills gaps? And what are some of the ways to overcome the skills gap? In doing so, the
report draws from skills measurement surveys implemented in Armenia, Georgia, the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (Macedonia), and Ukraine. Third, the report closes by laying out an agenda for
further research that should help policy makers and academics to open some of the emerging “black
boxes” on how to successfully overcome skills gaps in ECA countries.

            1.1     A framework for successful skills development
Skills formation begins in early childhood and is ideally nurtured throughout education systems that
provide a basis for the development of foundational skills, such as literacy and numeracy, general
problem solving and analytical skills, socio-emotional skills, including those valued highly in the job
market such as discipline, tenacity, and team work skills, and specific technical skills pertaining to
different occupations. Workers’ skills are then honed during the working life to allow for adaptation and
development of skills profiles to changing demands in the work place (Heckman et al., 2006; World
Bank, 2010).

A well-functioning skills development system requires timely coordination and collaboration across the
key stakeholders. Figure 1.1firms that train their workers and are able to articulate to the education
system which skills they need; workers, in particular youth and their parents, who choose vocations and
education paths that are rewarded in the labor market; education systems that listen to employers and
students and provide education and training that is relevant to both as well as leadership in reforming
skills development; and labor markets that reward skills and allow employers to find and hire the best
talent, try them out, reward those who do well but also fire those who do not well. Each of these sets of
players faces incentives and constraints that shape their choices and hence overall skills outcomes in the
economy (Almeida, Behrman, & Robalino, 2012; Rodrik, 1996).

On the employer side, successful skills development requires employers who train their own workers,
but who can also articulate to the education system what types of skills they need and actively
participate in the development of educational and occupational standards and curricula. In doing so,
employers face two challenges. First, employers have to weigh the costs of investing in training of
workers against the risk of losing them to other firms. To the extent that firms do not internalize the
benefits of training they provide, externalities related to “poaching” are created, leading to under-
provisioning of training. Second, employers need to weigh the benefits of organizing themselves against
the significant costs of doing so. Employer organizations are needed to build capacity for skills
development, coordinate with stakeholders and provide timely input to the education sector on what
skills are needed, jointly develop training and education curricula, qualification frameworks, and
occupational standards. All of these tasks require considerable time and resources and a high level of
coordination among employers. To the extent that firms fail to effectively coordinate on these issues,
employers will be unable to develop industry-specific training systems and education systems will be
unable to properly respond to skills needs of employers (“coordination failure”).1

On the worker side, successful skills development requires young people and their parents, but also
adult workers, to make well informed choices regarding their investments in human capital. Workers
invest in career paths, in education and in training based on (i) financial constraints; (ii) the information
available on labor market outcomes and job satisfaction (Fryer, 2013; Jensen, 2011; Nguyen, 2008); and
(iii) aspirations (Bernard et al., 2014) and values inherently given to different skills and diplomas for

                                                                                                            3
different vocations. However, this information may be incomplete or biased, if monitoring and
evaluation of workforce development systems and their impact on labor market outcomes is lacking or
limited (”information failure” that increases search costs and may lead to lower investment in skills by
workers and firms).2 Moreover, if incentives are skewed such that labor market outcomes do not
necessarily depend on skills and merit, but depend on other factors—like, for example, personal
connections, access to networks, corruption, and diplomas, whether they reflect skills or not—the
benefits of these investments to the individual are not likely to be high.

On the education system side, successful skills development requires teaching to be dispensed with high
quality standards as well as responsiveness to the needs of employers and students and flexibility to
adjust to new requirements. Often, education systems face a number of constraints related to capacity
to set strategy, organize skills development systems, develop educational and occupational standards
and curricula, engage with employers and labor market institutions, and so on. Yet, not all is to blame on
the education system: in order to be successful, the full cooperation from all stakeholders is necessary,
in particular employers. If employers are not able to organize themselves and provide input on what
skills are needed and how to develop standards and curricula, the education system cannot respond
properly; if students chose fields of study that are not relevant for today’s labor markets (partially
because the information provided by labor market institutions are insufficient), education systems
cannot be blamed for producing students who are not fit for work; and if labor markets do not reward
the best students—possessing the most up-to-date skills—with the best jobs and the highest pay, then
education systems cannot be blamed for not achieving higher education outcomes. Nevertheless, the
educational sector place a key role in bringing together employers and students and leading the reform
dialogue for better skills development. To the extent that the education sector resists these reforms—
often because of political economy challenges related to closing schools and firing teachers in some
sectors that have lost relevance—it cannot play this role of leading the change process (“political
economy failure”). For example, Kingdon et al. (2014) find that in developing countries, teachers have
great political power because of their ability to influence electoral outcomes. This in combination with
rent-seeking behavior often results in reforms that focus on expanding capacities and infrastructure
rather than addressing existing inefficiencies.

On labor markets, finally, successful skills development requires institutions and regulations that ensure
that skills are rewarded in the labor market. A variety of mechanisms need to work well in the labor
market so that skills are rewarded. For example, hiring practices need to be based on transparency, not
on personal networks and corruption. New technologies that allow skills testing at hiring can help in this
regard. Labor regulations and collective bargaining agreements should allow to pay better-performing
workers a higher wage and allow for quicker promotions—and not prescribe pay and promotions based
on seniority, tenure, or educational attainment. And last but not last, regulations should also allow to
fire those workers who do not meet the skills requirements of their employers. To the extent that
regulations, institutions, and practices in the labor market do not reflect this, skills will not be the driving
force of labor market outcomes and not be rewarded (“labor market failure”).

             1.2      Measuring skills
These stakeholders need reliable and timely information to make important decisions regarding policy
(governments coordinating strategic decisions regarding education and training policy), career choices
(students choosing level and direction of study), and training and hiring decisions (firms identifying and
establishing training needs and policies to deal with gaps). Since labor market relevant skills contribute
to raising productivity as well as improving labor market opportunities, understanding skills from the
demand side (skills required by firms, presently and in the future) and supply side (potential work force)
is important. However, lack of systematic information on the relevance and performance of education
and training systems is a significant problem for setting an effective policy framework (Sondergaard &
Murthi, 2012). Traditionally, levels of education and years of schooling have been used to approximate
for skills. However, there is persuasive evidence—at least in developed countries—that these are an
imperfect approximation, and that what matters for individual earnings, income distribution and
economic growth are the quality of skills that are formed from early childhood, through education and
training systems, and on and off the job in adult life, rather than merely education levels in the
population. For these reasons, actual skills gaps between developing countries and more developed
economies are actually much larger than the (already significant) gaps in education levels would suggest
(Hanushek & Woessmann, 2008). Fresh evidence from the Programme for the International Assessment
of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) survey in OECD countries shows that higher cognitive skills—measured
across numeracy, literacy, and problem-solving domains—are related to significantly higher wages, and
the effects exceed those of additional schooling (Hanushek, Schwerdt, Wiederhold, & Woessmann,
2015). ECA’s education systems, while varied in quality, tend to perform worse in international student
competency tests than high income OECD countries, especially in terms of higher order skills such as
problem solving (Sondergaard & Murthi, 2012). For all of the above reasons, measuring access to
education in order to evaluate the availability of skills, or the effect of skills on labor market outcomes, is
clearly not sufficient.

It was in the context of better understanding actual skills and their role in labor markets that the STEP
surveys were launched. The purpose of these surveys is to measure generic skills of the working age
population and track the evolution of skills over cohorts, as well as the demand for skills among
different types of firms, through surveys directed at households as well as firms (Box 1.1). The STEP
surveys, unique in their kind and scale, provide extensive information on a set of skills that have been
shown to matter for labor market outcomes as well as productivity. This report brings together evidence
on the availability of skills from four STEP household surveys (Armenia, Georgia, Macedonia and
Ukraine) and three STEP firm level surveys (Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine).3 The report purports to
highlight key policy relevant findings from these surveys and is not intended to replace or repeat
analysis from country level reports or compare countries for benchmarking purposes.4

                  Box 1.1: Skills towards Employment and Productivity—the STEP Surveys
The STEP Skills Measurement Program, launched in October 2010 by the World Bank, is the first
systematic attempt to fill knowledge gaps related to skills that enhance productivity and earnings. The
program is designed to provide policy relevant information on skills, much beyond basic information on
education levels and literacy. Among large-scale surveys, the program is unique in measuring a broad set
of skills, including not only cognitive ability, but also socio-emotional skills, and in providing firm level
views on skills needs through a stand-alone employer survey.

The household survey (focusing on individuals and the supply of skills) measures:
(i) Cognitive skills, that is, analytical, logical, intuitive and creative thinking and problem solving skills are
assessed directly, through a reading literacy assessment, and indirectly, through self-reported
information of use of skills in daily life and work.
(ii) Socio-emotional skills and personality traits (behavioral skills soft skills, life skills, personality traits),
include behavioral aspects, including openness to new experiences, conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness, hostile bias (the tendency to interpret others’ behaviors as hostile), perseverance and
focus on long term goals (grit), and attitudes and preferences with respect to decision making, time and
risk.
(iii) Job-relevant skills are task related and include technical skills directly related to the specific
occupation (like, for example, accounting for an accountant) and computer use, repair/maintenance of
machinery, operation of machinery, but also soft skills like client contact, problem solving, learning,
supervision, and so on.

Main characteristics:
(i) Target population is the urban population aged 15 to 64 years.
(ii) Year of survey is 2012 in Ukraine, and 2013 in Armenia, Georgia, FYR Macedonia.
(iii) Sample sizes were determined based on the scope of the survey and literacy rates to ensure that a
sufficient number of reading literacy booklets would be completed.
(iv) Response rates ranged from 50 percent in Armenia to 67 percent in FYR Macedonia.
(v) Sample size in the final datasets is 2,992 in Armenia, 2,996 in Georgia, 4,009 in FYR Macedonia, and
2,389 in Ukraine.
(vi) The data weighting was undertaken by the STEP survey methodologist to ensure consistency across
sampling strategies. Whenever recent population counts were available, the weights were adjusted
against benchmark variables (such as gender and age).
(vii) Main components of the survey are strictly comparable across countries.

Country-specific information:
(i) In Ukraine, the STEP has been conducted as a module of the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring
Survey (ULMS). Although it complied with all STEP technical requirements, there are some important
differences, for example in the occupational codes (at 2-digit ISCO-1988 in Ukraine compared to 3-digit
ISCO-2008 in the other countries), classification of economic activities and the field of studies.
(ii) Macedonia conducted only the “partial literacy assessment,” in which only the General Booklet
(Reading Components and Core Literacy) was administered, while the other three countries
administered the full literacy assessment including the Exercise Booklet.

Limitations




                                                                                                                   6
(i) In Armenia, Georgia, FYR Macedonia and Ukraine STEP samples are significantly more biased to
female older population,. In FYR Macedonia and Ukraine samples are also biased to more educated
people. And these discrepancies are eliminated with sample weights only partially.
(ii) As a result, key labor market indicators calculated on the basis of STEP household surveys differ from
those based on the standard LFS data.
(iii) Rather small samples in general, and of the employed population in particular, limit the analysis of
indicators at the disaggregated level, e.g. by 3-digit ISCO group or by 2-digit ISCO and 3 age groups.
(iv) A mapping of the national educational system and country-specific education levels used in the
questionnaires to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 1997) for the purpose of
international comparisons was not always accurately done by the survey team, so the use of original
variables on educational attainment is important.

The employer survey (focusing on firms) provides information on the demand from skills as expressed
by potential employers. It includes questions about the skills in use by the current work force, how skills
are valued when hiring new workers, and existing constraints in terms of skills. The survey mirrors the
household survey in its focus on a broad set of skills, including both cognitive, socio-emotional, and job
relevant technical skills. The survey asks questions separately for professional, managerial and technical
support (loosely referred to as “white collar” occupations for lack of a better term) and for clerical
support, sales and service workers, skilled agricultural workers, crafts and trades workers, plants and
machine operators and assemblers, and elementary occupations (“blue collar”).

Characteristics
(i) The target unit of observation is the workplace so that the information gathered on workers’ actual
skills and potential mismatches or gaps could be as precise as possible.
(ii) Year of survey is 2013 in Armenia and Georgia, and 2014 in Ukraine.
(iii) Countries were offered some flexibility regarding the scope of the survey. In some countries, specific
economic sectors were selected (like, for example,. in Ukraine only four sectors are covered -
agribusiness growers, agribusiness producers, renewable energy and IT), whereas others sampled a
wider range of sectors but biased to some sectors (e.g. in Georgia two thirds of firms were in
construction).
(iv) The STEP employer surveys use a sampling design based on firm register data.
(v) Sample size in the final datasets is 384 in Armenia, 354 in Georgia, and 702 in Ukraine.
(vi) The data weighting was undertaken either by the STEP survey methodologist (in Armenia and
Georgia) or by the survey firm (in Ukraine, GfK Ukraine).

Country-specific information
(i) The procedure for choosing workers of Type A (white-collar) and Type B (blue-collar) in Georgia and
Armenia used a random sticker approach. Therefore, information about skills of a typical worker of Type
A or Type B depends on the detailed occupation chosen to represent a typical worker of Type A or B
(like, for example, a clerk or some laborer within Type B). In Ukraine information about skills and other
characteristics of Type A and Type B workers is aggregated from information about three occupations
(or worker types) with major skill gaps.
(ii) Employer surveys in Armenia and Georgia used a module on the skills of young workers, whereas the
survey in Ukraine asked employers about their satisfaction with the skills of the current workforce
instead.
(iii) The survey in Ukraine used an extended list of job-relevant skills with two types of skills, namely
“green skills” (environmental awareness) and professional behavior.


                                                                                                           7
Limitations
(i) Rather small samples covering only preselected sectors make results not representative of the whole
economy and make impossible the analysis at some more disaggregated level.
(ii) Different sample frames and different approaches in choosing typical workers/ occupations limit
within country and cross-country comparability.
(iii) Pre-defined list of skills (often skill groups) in the questionnaire does not bring much-needed
information about job-specific technical skills within occupation and sector.

              1.3       Objectives and organization of the report
This report aims to show that skills will be important, and increasingly so, in raising labor productivity
and with it labor related income in Eastern Europe and Central Asia; that in order to address labor
market relevant skills gaps, it is important to understand what those gaps look like and what firms and
workers are mostly affected by them; and that the STEP surveys were undertaken to address some of
the knowledge gaps in relation to skills and productivity, in particular with respect to employers’ views
on the importance and availability of different skills, and the extent to which these skills are represented
in the population. It provides a framework to think thought the challenges of successful skills
development, identifying the key actors and the potential failures that can prevent successful skills
development. Taking these failures into account could indeed lead to skills outcomes that are poor
because of decisions that are rational from the perspective of the individual person, firm, or institution,
but where outcomes could be improved if actions are simultaneously taken by all stakeholders.

The analysis in the report essentially relies on descriptive statistics, but also uses multivariate
regressions and policy analysis of the countries’ systems of workforce development. The descriptive
statistics cover many questions asking employers and individuals whether they perceive a skills
mismatch. The report examines in more detail the skills that are reported as missing and for which types
of workers they are missing: blue-collar or white collar. The report does not, however, rely exclusively
on respondents’ perceptions: it also examines the allocation of workers in the economy. In particular,
given that the countries examined are in an economic transition moving away from large public sector,
the report examines the distribution of skills across the public and private sectors, also comparing
younger and older cohorts, as there may be more inertia among older cohorts. In addition, to
understand the consequences of the skills gap, the report shows multivariate regressions, examining
returns to education and skills. Lastly, to shed light on the current systems in place for workforce
development, the report uses the reports presenting the Systems Approach for Better Education Results
on Workforce Development (SABER WfD), a tool developed by the World Bank to benchmark workforce
development against international best practice.

The remainder of the report addresses the main questions as outlined above. The next chapter gives a
short overview on the economic development of the four countries under consideration, with an
emphasis on the educational sector. The subsequent two chapters use information provided in STEP
surveys to focus on the skills gap, and in particular the following questions: (i) is there a skills gap, and
how does it manifest itself (Chapter 3); and (ii) what is the nature of the skills gap (Chapter 4). Chapter 5

productivity. Chapter 6 looks at the role of the education sector, and the final chapter suggests a policy
agenda and future research questions.

                                     2. Country context
Economies in Armenia, Georgia and Macedonia experienced a rapid recovery after downturns in the
early 1990s and in 2009, while the Ukrainian economic recovery is slow and highly volatile. After a
dramatic decline in economic growth in the early 1990s, growth rebounded in 1994-1996 in Armenia,
Georgia, and Macedonia and in 2000 in Ukraine (Figure 2.1). All countries experienced positive, albeit
volatile, economic growth since then and until 2009, when the global economic and financial crisis hit
the region. Then GDP growth rebounded, with an average growth rate from 0.6 percent in Ukraine to
5.5 percent in Georgia during 2010-2014. While, on average, GDP growth rate has been positive in
Ukraine over the last five years, Ukraine experienced a sharp output fall in 2014, driven by a deep
decline in the conflict-affected Donbass region and a more moderate recession in the rest of the
country.

While average labor productivity in the four countries is much lower than in developed European
economies of the Euro area, it has grown significantly between 2000 and 2012 (Figure 2.1). The level
and growth of productivity in Armenia has been higher than those in Poland, Czech Republic, Croatia,
Bulgaria, Russian Federation and many other countries in the region. Ukraine and Macedonia
significantly lag behind the comparator countries shown in Figure 2.1: Ukraine had the lowest GDP per
worker in 2012 (10,552 constant US 1990$ at PPP), whereas Macedonia experienced the lowest growth
in labor productivity between 2000 to 2012 (15.6 percent). The average annual productivity growth
during 2000-2012 was 8.9 percent in Armenia, 6.3 percent in Georgia, 1.5 percent in Macedonia, and 4.9
percent in Ukraine. Pronounced productivity growth, particularly before the crisis in 2009, was mainly
due to increased foreign investment, technological spillovers and modernization of the economy,
resource reallocation from less to more productive sectors, and more efficient use of available resources
(capital and workforce). Hence, the model of growth has been capital-intensive and almost jobless.

The capital-intensive growth did not result in major income-generating opportunities to improve the
labor market situation significantly. Despite robust economic growth and improving labor market
conditions in Macedonia, key labor market indicators still lag behind, as the labor force participation
rate at 55.5 percent is much lower than in Georgia, Armenia, Ukraine and many other ECA countries,
and unemployment rates—29 percent for the total population and 52.2 percent for youth—are, on the
contrary, very high (Table 2.1). High and long-term unemployment among young people, especially
those with tertiary education, carries considerable individual and social cost, implying a loss of human
capital investment and underutilization of skills.

Job quality is another serious concern for the effective use of skills. Informality and subsistence
agriculture among many other forms of vulnerable employment are high and widespread in all
countries. Besides, specific adjustment mechanisms of labor markets to shocks such as wage arrears,
under-declared income (so called envelope wages), reduced working hours and administrative unpaid
leaves are widely used, particularly in Ukraine.

Unlike Asian countries, Armenia, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine do not have demographic dividends
and they will not be able to replace all older workers whose skills might be outdated by an equal
number of youth equipped with better skills. Populations in Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine are shrinking
and aging, having a negative impact on the number and composition of the labor force (Figure 2.3).
According to our estimations under the base scenario, assuming contact gender- and age-specific labor
force participations rates from 2030 onwards, the labor force is projected to decline between 2012 to
2060 by 16.4 percent in Armenia, 23.5 percent in Georgia, 29.2 percent in Macedonia, and 37.9 percent
in Ukraine. Significant temporary labor migration along with emigration of young professionals is also
likely to adversely affect the stock of human capital.

Despite the economic downturn and limited public investment in education in the 1990’s, these countries
experienced an impressive improvement of educational attainment levels of population throughout the
economic transition period.5 For example, according to the Barro and Lee dataset, the share of population
aged 25 years and over with completed secondary or tertiary education increased between 1990 and 2010
from 69 to 77.8 percent in Armenia and from 53.7 to 68 percent in Ukraine, compared with the average
shares of 35 percent in 1990 and 52.5 percent in 2010 in advanced economies (Table 2.2).

Georgia also has a large supply of highly educated workers, with 31 percent of the labor force having
completed tertiary education and only 9 percent without completed secondary education (Rutkowski,
2013b). In Macedonia, the percentage of the total working age population (15 to 79 years) and its
economically active part achieving tertiary education (14.7 and 20.4 percent, respectively, in 2013) is
fairly low compared to the other countries, but it has also significantly increased since 2001 (from 9.5
percent of total population and 13.5 percent of the labor force in 2001).6 According to Mojsoska-
Blazevski and Ristovska (2012), the relatively poor educational achievements of the Macedonian
population can be mainly attributed to a long period of input-based educational policy and
underinvestment in education in the past.

The improvement of educational attainment levels in all countries has been primarily due to the
increased participation of young people in tertiary education, particularly in Ukraine, where gross
enrollment ratio to tertiary education grew from 46.8 percent in 1991 to 79.7 percent in 2012 (Figure
2.4).

                                              education, both sexes”.
  Notes: Gross enrollment ratio is defined as the number of students enrolled at a certain level of education as a
percentage of the population of the age group that officially corresponds to that level. It can be above 100 percent
   if some enrolled students are older or younger than the age group that officially corresponds to that level of
                                                     education.

Finally, regarding the quality of education, Georgia is the only country that recently—in 2009—
participated in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).7 The results show
that Georgian students achieved a mean score of 374 in reading, 379 in mathematics and 473 on the
scientific literacy scale, significantly lower than the average of OECD countries, but also other ECA
countries (Figure 2.5).8 The performance gap in reading in relation to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the
Russian Federation is large, with the latest about 85 points, equivalent to more than two years of
schooling. Overall, 62 percent of 15-year-olds in Georgia lack basic levels of proficiency in reading
needed to participate effectively and productively in labor markets and society (Figure 2.6). These
students may not be failing according to the national curriculum and tests for the competencies that a
15-year-old is expected to acquire, but their low scores t indicate serious deficiencies in their ability to
use reading as a tool to acquire knowledge and skills in other areas—an important competency needed
in today’s global economy. Indeed, PISA Level 3 or higher is the level of proficiency frequently required
in the labor market. In 2000, in Macedonia, more than half of the students have not reached Level 2;
and only 13.6 percent of students reached reading proficiency level 3 or higher.

  Macedonia participated more than 10 years ago, in 2000. Both countries, Georgia and Macedonia, are
participating in the PISA 2015 round, but its results will be released only in December 2016.
8
  The PISA scoring system has been scaled so that the average mean score among OECD countries is 500 points, with
an average standard deviation of 100 points. A difference of 40 points is roughly equivalent to what can be learnt in
an additional year of schooling.

                                  3. Is there a skills gap?
Are there skills gaps in Armenia, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine—and if so, what do they look like?
This section provides persuasive evidence of skills gaps, from two perspectives. Employer survey data,
on the one hand, shows that firms identify lack of adequate skills as the most important obstacle to
hiring workers. Household survey data, on the other hand, show that many workers also perceive a skills
mismatch, in considering that their level of education is higher—or lower—than the requirement of the
jobs would suggest.

To what extent are the levels and nature of skills a problem? Viewed from the employer side, the STEP
surveys bring to light a significant skills gap. In fact, firms report that they experience significant
problems in hiring because of low or inadequate levels of skills. The skills constraint is evident both for
professional, managerial and technical positions (in what follows, loosely referred to as “white collar”
occupations), and occupations within clerical support, sales and services, crafts and trades, plant and
machine operators, and elementary workers (“blue collar” occupations). In the year preceding the
employer survey, some 44 percent of Armenian firms had tried to hire new workers for white collar
positions (Figure 3.1, left) and a majority had tried to find workers for blue collar positions. Moreover, a
significant share of hiring firms—in Ukraine, as many as 3 out of 4 firms in the case of white collar
workers and 1 out of 2 in the case of blue collar workers—had difficulties in hiring workers for both blue
and white collar positions (Figure 3.1, right). The exception is Georgia, where there were few problems
in finding blue-collar workers. Given the concentration in construction industry in the Georgian sample,
this may reflect the ready availability of an unskilled work force that is hired on a daily basis. Overall, low
demand for skills is thus not the only problem to hiring.

Most importantly, firms also report that the main problem in finding workers is the lack of skills among
existing applicants, rather than lack of applicants per se. This holds both for more and less skilled
occupations, but most critically for white collar workers for whom between 65 percent (Ukraine) and 90
percent (Armenia) of firms considered skills to be a key obstacle for hiring (Figure 3.2, a). Workers’
expectations (reservation wages, and conditions at work) are everywhere rated secondary to the skills
constraint, except for blue collar workers in Ukraine. When asked to rank the importance of skills in the
context of other labor related issues, firms list labor taxes first, but lack of workers with adequate
experience, as well as the general quality of education and vocational training systems, are also seen as
significant obstacles to growth (Figure 3.2, b).

The skills problem relates both to levels and quality of education. As would be expected, holding higher
levels of education increases the probability of being employed (although the payoff to vocational
training, whether at secondary or tertiary levels, differs across countries). At the same time, in absolute
terms, employment ratios are relatively low, and unemployment rates high, even for those with tertiary
education (Figure 3.3, a and b). In Armenia and Georgia in particular, vocational/professional training at
post-secondary level pays off poorly in the labor market, with unemployment rates at above forty
percent, suggesting problems related to labor market information (students do not know what
vocation/specialization pays off) and/or quality of skills (employers do not find the necessary skills

are high compared to the OECD average (5.3 percent).

Source: Authors, based on STEP household surveys. Note: STEP surveys’ unemployment rates differ from those registered in the
     LFS. For Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine, they are significantly higher than in the LFS, while for Macedonia, they are

Moreover, workers also perceive an important mismatch, as many of those employed feel overqualified
or underqualified for their jobs. Some 30 percent of workers in Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine, and some
20 percent of those in Macedonia, feel that the level of education necessary for doing their job is lower

than the level of education they hold (Figure 3.4, a).9 This is a particularly important phenomenon for
those with a vocational education at tertiary level, among whom a majority consider their jobs requiring
lower levels of qualification than they hold, consistent with the poor labor market outcomes above
(Figure 3.4, b). Perceived over-qualification is also a more significant problem in particular sectors,
notably those where unskilled jobs are more prevalent: trade and tourism compared to other economic
sectors, non-wage compared to wage work, informal compared to formal employment, and private
compared to public sector (Figure 3.4, c). Conversely, many of those with lower levels of education
consider themselves undereducated compared to the requirements of their work (Figure 3.4, d).

Perceived over-education relative to job requirements is a much more significant problem than under-
education in Armenia, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine than in most OECD countries, where, although
the share of mismatch is as high, both over- and under-education are a problem (Figure 3.5, a). Thus,
while Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy have overall levels of mismatch similar to Ukraine, the
relative importance of over- versus under-education differs significantly. In fact, a comparison of the
structure of employed by actual education, versus self-reported required education suggests that there
is a relative oversupply of workers with a university degree in most countries, but that it is particularly
significant in Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine (Figure 3.5, b). At the same time, the share of jobs reported
to be requiring tertiary levels of education in these countries is in fact higher than in most OECD
countries. This suggests that employers requiring a university degree from their new employees are not
only motivated by the actual task complexity of jobs, but also by credential inflation (declining signaling
power of a certificate or diploma at a given level) and negative grade drift (a deterioration of
educational standards and the skills imparted for a given level of education ).

Finally, a skills gap can also be discerned from the allocation of educated workers in the economy. The
private business sector also appears to be deprived of educated workers, as workers with tertiary
education are less likely to be in the private than public sector. Most tertiary educated work in the
public sector (Figure 3.6, a), and the share of tertiary educated is higher in public than in private wage
employment (Figure 2.6, b). At the same time, the private sector complains of problems of hiring white
collar workers with skills—raising the question as to whether there is crowding out, whereby the public
sector can offer more attractive working conditions than the private sector, resulting in skills shortage in
the latter. Partly reflecting a socialist legacy, younger cohorts are more likely to be in the private sector
than older ones—but for the group aged 30 to 44, which includes some relatively recent university
graduates but also more experienced workers, at least 50 percent of employed tertiary educated are
working in the public sector. Whether the apparent public sector bias reflects a real shortage of
educated workers for the private sector, or a dominance of less qualified jobs in private activity
compared to public activity, is not given from these numbers.

While there is clear evidence of a skills gap, both the STEP surveys and broader enterprise surveys show
that skills are not necessarily the most binding constraints that existing firms or potential entrepreneurs
and investors face in doing business. In Armenia, 60 percent of firms consider corporate taxation—both
the level of taxes and the indirect cost of burdensome administration—to be a more significant problem
than any labor related issues. In Georgia and Ukraine, several areas, including electricity (Georgia) and
an unstable investment climate (Ukraine) are ranked more important than any labor issues by firms
(Figure 3.7). In fact, the percentage of firms considering skills a problem in the World Bank Enterprise
Surveys fell between 2008 and 2013. However, this trend is less likely to reflect an absolute
improvement in skills and more the effects of the global financial crisis, including both a reduced
demand for skilled workers and more availability of skilled workers because of other firms’ layoffs.
Indeed, low ranking among obstacles does not mean that skills is not an issue: it means it is not the most
pressing issue, compared to overall policy predictability, tax rates, access to finance, or other investment

mentioned above skills in middle reformer countries.

In sum, the evidence from the STEP surveys point strongly to the existence of a skills gap that is affecting
firms’ growth and employment expansion as well as the economy’s transition to modern sectors. While
poor business conditions in general hold back firm expansion, the STEP employer surveys show that
firms have troubles hiring both white collar and blue collar workers, and they point mostly to lack of
skills among applicants as the main cause of difficulties, rather than a lack of interest or gaps in wage
and work conditions. At the same time, workers feel over-educated (in particular) for the type of jobs
they are undertaking and there appears to be a relative over-supply of workers with tertiary levels of
education. They feel particularly over-educated in the private sector and in fact, there is a higher
proportion of tertiary educated in the public sector. The next section examines this mismatch in more
detail.

                   4. What is the nature of the mismatch?
There is evidence of skills gaps—but what kind of skills are lacking? This section uses employer survey
data to identify gaps as skills that are at once considered important by employers, and simultaneously
seen by employers to be in short supply among new labor market entrants with relevant levels of
education. Specific job technical skills emerge as a key skills constraint, but also generic problem solving
abilities, as well as specific socio-emotional skills, in particular team work, and openness to new
experience. While foundational skills are important to employers, they are generally not seen as
lacking—and therefore not defined as a gap below. Evidence from the household survey also shows that
the use of skills differs significantly across workers. In particular, not all workers use higher order skills at
work—the younger generation, as well as those with more education, are likely to use more advanced
skills.

             4.1     What employers say they want
If skills are such a significant problem when firms want to hire, then what particular skills are lacking, in
fact? Skills gap exist if two conditions hold: first, that there are particular skills and personality traits and
characteristics that employers value among their employees, and second, that those skills, traits or
characteristics are not available in the potential work force. The STEP employer surveys provide
information on both of these (Box 4.1).

                          Box 4.1: STEP employer survey: what matters for hiring?
The employer survey specifically asks employers to rank personal characteristics, personality traits, and
different skills in importance for retaining a new hire. Employers were asked to compare between these
three groups as well as rate the skills and traits between then.

Firms that had experience from hiring young workers (under 30 years of age) were also asked to relate
to what extent young tertiary level graduates and secondary level graduates possessed these different
skills, in their estimation. For Armenia and Georgia, the survey also asked those firms which had hiring
experience of young workers (below 30), to what extent they considered that the current education
system provided these specific skills.

Personal characteristics include age, appearance, gender, and family relations or personal ties.

Personality traits include the so called Big Five:
       Conscientiousness: Organized, self-disciplined, focused on achievements
       Emotional stability: Impulse control, ability to avoid anger, anxiety, and vulnerability.
       Agreeableness: Compassionate, cooperative, good tempered, trusting.
       Extraversion: Positive emotions, assertiveness, sociability
       Openness to experience: Intellectual curiosity, creativity, preference for novelty and variety.

Job related skills include job-specific technical skills (like, for example, driving for a driver, accounting for
an accountant), cognitive skills like literacy, numeracy, problem solving, creative and critical thinking,
mastery of English and other foreign languages, and a set of soft skills including communication,


                                                                                                               27
leadership, teamwork, ability to work independently, and time management. For Ukraine, firms were
also asked regarding environmental (“green”) skills, and professional behavior.

When asked to rank the importance of job related skills versus personality traits, or characteristics like
age, gender and ethnicity, employers quite uniformly value job related skills above all. Personality traits
are ranked second. Characteristics like age and gender are least important when deciding about whom
to hire, according to employers. This holds for both white collar workers and blue collar workers.

Within the group of job related skills, employers value a mix of technical (specific to one occupation) and
socio-emotional skills at work (Figure 4.2). For white collar occupations, employers value technical skills
very highly, and in Armenia and Georgia, also foundational skills like literacy and numeracy. The
different outcome in Ukraine may result from the fact that the questions only pertain to hires in
occupations with major skills gaps. However, in addition to these skills that are basic to the capacity to
carry out the job, employers also attach importance to soft skills: The ability to work in teams as well as
independently, communication skills, and general problem solving skills, are important. For blue collar
workers, employers also value job-specific technical skills as well as literacy most. Beyond the basic
functional requirements, similar skills as for white collars are appreciated. However, there is a stronger
emphasis on time management and the ability to work independently, as is consistent with more
routine type of tasks.

               Job-specific technical skills and foundational skills are essential, but soft skills also matter.

Apart from the job related skills, a person who is careful and strives to do things right at work is highly
appreciated by employers in all three countries (Figure 4.3). Conscientiousness is considered by far more
important than whether that person is generally agreeable or extraverted, or open to new experiences.
For less qualified jobs, emotional stability is also rated highly by firms.

            4.2         What employers say they get
Employers thus identify, quite consistently across countries, a set of job relevant skills. But these skills
make up a skills gap and as such a constraint to improving labor market outcomes only to the extent
that they are not readily available among young people leaving school and seeking to enter the world of
work. Conversely, even if skills are lacking among such youth, they do not constitute an important skills
gap unless they are also valued by employers. Key skill gaps, as defined here, as thus highly appreciated
skills that are also in short supply.



                                                                                                                                                                      31
Figure 4.4 combines the five most valued skills (ranked in order) and the two most valued personality
traits by employer with employers’ views on whether these skills are lacking among youth (tertiary
graduates under 30 years for the typical “white collar” job and secondary graduates under 30 years for
the typical “blue collar” job), for Armenia and Georgia. As seen, while literacy and numeracy are
important skills, they are not areas of tension—graduates generally are numerate and literate. Instead
job specific skills make up the most significant gaps: it is highly ranked as an asset for new hires, and
between 23 (13) percent of firms in Armenia (Georgia) consider this skill to be lacking often among new
graduates. Similarly, although conscientiousness is highly valued, it is not a problem among graduates.
In fact, the most important characteristic actually lacking among new potential white collar workers is
openness to experience, according to employers. For blue collar workers, tensions arise for soft skills—in
particular the ability to work independently- together with job specific skills.

           In Armenia and Georgia, job-specific skills and problem solving together with a lack of openness to

             4.3       Skewed allocation of skills across sectors
The lack of specific skills in the private sector is also reflected in a concentration of use of skills in the
public compared to private sector—even when focusing on the urban population, as is the case for STEP
surveys, and when informal private sector is excluded. As shown in Figure 4.6, jobs in the private sector
are less likely to involve reading and writing, reflecting the wide range of skilled and elementary
occupations. However, at least for Armenia and Macedonia, the jobs are also less likely to involve some
of the skills which were highlighted as important gaps by employers, notably interpersonal skills (team
work, communication), and analytical skills such as solving more complex problems.

The use of skills also differs significantly between different types of workers.10 Results from the
household survey indicate, as expected, that white collar workers are more likely to use higher order
skills and less likely to use manual skills like driving or operating machinery, or that those with more
years of education use more advanced skills on the job. However, there is also evidence of generational
gaps: younger workers are much more likely to be using computers on the job, reflecting a slower re-
skilling process of the older cohorts (results not shown).

There is also a significant and large positive difference in the use of most higher-order skills on the job
between those who have completed a tertiary general education and those with a tertiary
professional/vocational education, comparable to the difference between tertiary general education
and secondary general education. The poor skills content of jobs for people with up to 14 years of
education raises questions as to the relevance and pay-off of these vocational programs.

In conclusion, there is a gap between what employers want from new hires and what they find.
Employers value highly new hires that have the specific technical skills required for the job, together
with general analytical skills and soft skills that facilitate work place productivity. However, they do not
find all of these skills among young graduates. For white collar workers, foundational skills are not a
problem, but employers find that job specific skills are lacking among graduates from a tertiary level
education, together with analytical and team work skills. For blue collar workers, job specific skills also
constitute the largest skills gap, but the ability to work independently, communicate and collaborate
with others, also matter. The household survey shows that not all workers use higher order skills at
work—differences arise for younger versus older age cohorts, and for those with tertiary general

public sector compared to the private sector, even when focusing on the urban formal sector.

affect workers, firms, and the economy.

                       5. Consequences of the skills gap
The skills gaps are affecting workers, firms, and the economy. First, not having skills lowers labor market
prospects. Using the household survey, a decomposition of the contribution of different factors to
explaining variation in earnings shows that skills—in particular information processing skills like reading,
writing, numeracy computer use but also generic work place hard and soft skills such as problem solving,
team work, ability to work independently—are positively correlated with earnings. Second, the
employer surveys show that what could be identified as “new economy skills”—non-routine problem
solving, foreign languages, soft skills, that are more important to sustain productivity and
competitiveness in modern economies—are lacking, even in the young generation. Moreover,
potentially more dynamic firms—those that innovate, have international contacts, or have grown more
rapidly in recent years—tend to experience more significant problems in hiring skilled workers,
underscoring the fact that skills gaps are likely to affect economic growth and job creation in the
aggregate.

            5.1      Skills impact wages—to some extent
Workers with low skills are disadvantaged, because skills matters for wages. Skills are an important
correlate of workers’ earnings capacity. However, they are not the most important determinant of
wages—other factors, in particular job characteristics, but also demographic factors and education, are
also, if not more important. This suggests that skills, despite being thought-after by employers, are
maybe not properly rewarded in the labor market.

A decomposition of the contribution of different groups of factors, including both demographic
characteristics, skills, and years of education, show that skills are positively associated with earnings.
Figure 5.1 groups skills into socio-emotional skills/traits (openness to new experience,
conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability, grit, hostile aversion and decision
making), information processing skills (reading, writing, numeracy and computer use), and generic job
skills (interpersonal skills, problem solving, learning, and working independently), showing that in
particular information processing skills, but also generic job skills and soft skills are positively associated
with earnings. Importantly, for both youth and prime age workers the use of skills is more important
than education, except in Macedonia. In terms of earnings, the signaling or sorting power of education,
compared to the actual skills used, is thus less significant. Nevertheless, by far the most important factor
is jobs characteristics, and together with education, demographic characteristics, and/or experience
explain most of wage variation. It is worth emphasizing that although personal characteristics (age,
gender) are not considered to matter to employers when hiring workers, they do in fact appear to play a
role in determining labor market outcomes as reflected in earnings, even when skills and education are
accounted for.

For the younger generation, aged 15 to 26, soft and generic skills at work are more important than
information processing skills, partly reflecting that youth active on the labor market have lower levels of
education (many of their peers are still in school) and work in occupations with lower qualifications. For
prime age workers, the role of soft and generic skills loses importance in favor of information processing

skills. Compared with a similar exercise undertaken for OECD countries (OECD, 2014), and with many
caveats on comparability, experience is much less important for explaining wages of youth in ECA
countries, except in Ukraine. Overall, however, the characteristics of the job itself (occupation, sector,
private/public, permanent versus temporary, and location in the capital or not) take precedence over all
other factors.

                       5.2             Skills gaps affect more dynamic firms more severely
On the side of employers, as would be expected, the skills gap is not affecting the business sector
uniformly. A comparison of skills ratings shows that potentially more dynamic firms are not necessarily
rating the importance of skills differently from less dynamic firms, but they are more severely affected
by the gaps. For example, innovative firms—here defined as firms that introduced a new technology,
process, products or services in the past 3 years—are more skills constrained than more traditional
firms. Firms requiring interaction with entities in other countries and firms that are foreign owned are
more affected than domestically based and oriented firms. For firms creating many new jobs
(“gazelles”), the patterns are less clear, but this may be reflecting the fact that they can expand because
they are not skill constrained. Overall, firms that are exposed to international competition and those in
more dynamic sectors tend to require higher and more flexible skills and as a result are more seriously
affected by skills gaps than others.

The skills gaps clearly carry important implications. From the perspective of workers, lack of skills lowers
the potential for better labor market outcomes, in the form of lower wages. From the firm side,
expansion and productivity are held back. From an aggregate economy perspective, the most dynamic

of the economy towards more productive employment in more dynamic firms.

                5.3         Today’s skills gaps could affect future economic development
The skills gaps also manifest themselves in lower levels of skills than can be optimal. First, even for
foundational skills such as literacy there are issues. Basic literacy is high in ECA countries, including the
STEP survey countries,11 except in very vulnerable groups. And as seen above, employers are in general
not dissatisfied with basic literacy (or numeracy) of recent graduates. However, the ability to read and
write at a level which is necessary to succeed in a modern and technology intense environment, is not at
par with OECD countries. Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine are performing less well on reading scores than
OECD countries in general; the mean score for a white collar worker in Georgia is 80 percent of that of
Finland. This suggests that while, nominally, education levels are relatively high in these countries, the
quality of education is insufficient even at basic levels, which could have important implications for the
future economic development of these countries.

In particular, skills that are likely to become more important in a modern economy appear also to be
lacking. While employers are not identifying all of these capacities as key constraints, skills shortages
may arise as economies modernize. More dynamic firms are likely to feel these shortages more keenly
than more traditional types of firms.

The skills reportedly lacking in graduates are surprisingly consistent across countries (Georgia and
Armenia) and education levels. Young graduates, whether with tertiary or secondary education lack,

most often: English and foreign language skills in general; leadership skills, and the ability for creative
and critical thinking; they also lack openness to experience (Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5). None of these are
valued particularly highly by employers today compared to the skills listed in Figure 4.4 above. However,
these skills are likely to become much more important when economies move from more traditional
production of goods and services to “new economy” tasks, requiring non-routine cognitive and soft
skills. Not developing these skills now could jeopardize a successful transition to the “new economy” in
these countries.

In conclusion, more innovative and dynamic firms and those with global connections are more affected
by the skills gap than more traditional firms. Yet, it is exactly these firms who are expected to hire most
new workers and drive the transition of these countries to the all-important “new economy” sectors.
Nevertheless, wages are only to a limited driven by skills, suggesting that these much thought-after skills
are not fully rewarded in the labor market. As a consequence, many graduates lack these crucial “new
economy” skills.

       6. The role of the education sector and employers
The two key actors who provide education and training—and therefore, play the most important role in
developing skills—are arguably the education sector and employers: the education sector as the prime
provider of skills during early childhood all the way to early adulthood; and employers as the provider of
training, both on the job and in class rooms, during adulthood. The latter also has a responsibility in
developing training institutions on a sectoral and economy-wide level, together with other employers,
but also responsibility to cooperate with the education sector to articulate needed skills, update
curricula, develop new vocations and field of studies, qualification frameworks, occupational standards,
and so on.

This section has a closer look how these two key players perform in Armenia, Georgia, Macedonia, and
Ukraine. Both employer and household survey data show that firms as well as workers, respectively, are
dissatisfied with the quality of both general education and vocational training systems. But these
problems are also compounded by low incidence of training among firms, and the fact that education
systems and the enterprise sectors appear to have little interaction, especially on strategic issues such
as curriculum development and quality assurance.

            6.1     Dissatisfaction with the education sector
Low skills are a consequence of too little education and training (including early childhood development,
ECD), of the poor quality and adequacy of education and training, or both. Following the framework
presented in Chapter 1, this outcome is the result from coordination and information failures among
firms, potential workers and educational institutes in bringing about an effective system for life-long
learning. Underperforming education and training systems, lack of coordination between business and
training institutes, low incentives for firms to provide training, lack of information regarding prospective
career paths and the value of skills, together with labor markets that do not sufficiently reward
investment in skills, all contribute to holding back skills development.

Currently, in the view of employers, education systems are underperforming in their role in setting the
basis for further skills development. From the STEP surveys, there is evidence that a majority of firms do
not consider the general education system or technical and vocational education and training (TVET)
system to be meeting the skills needs of employers (Figure 6.1). The problem is widespread, according
to employers—neither the kinds, nor the level of skills necessary is deemed sufficient, and there is a lack
of updated knowledge coming out of training systems. In Georgia, firms (in the construction sector) are
generally more content with education and training systems but between thirty and forty percent of
firms still find the general education system failing in many different aspects.

The unfavorable views of education and training systems are largely shared by workers, inasmuch as
they consider the impact and use of education for their job to be relatively limited (Figure 6.2). Only for
tertiary general education do more than half of workers consider education very useful for their jobs. In
particular, technical and vocational education and training at tertiary level is considered decidedly less
useful than general tertiary education, in all countries. It is a witness to problems in the vocational
sector that higher levels of training explicitly focused on providing the basis for some
profession/vocation, should be considered less useful than general education in the labor market. In all

Besides, there are important differences between young and mature workers in their assessment of the
relevance of education for their work, particularly in the case of tertiary general education. In all four
countries, there are significantly higher shares of young workers (15-29 years) who find their education
not useful and significantly lower shares of those who consider education being very useful for their
jobs, as compared to prime-age and older workers (Figure 6.3). In Ukraine and Macedonia, the share of
dissatisfied young workers is over 50 percent. This may be due to the irrelevant content of education
and ensuing skills mismatch—that is, a mismatch between the skills learned in universities and those
required in the labor market. Yet, it can also be associated with a qualification mismatch—that is, a
discrepancy between a worker’s education level and/or field of studies and the education requirement
in his or her occupation. As we have seen before (Figure 3.4), over 20 percent of workers with tertiary

    Overall, the existence of a skills gap from the employers’ point of view and the dissatisfaction with
    education systems among both firms and workers, emphasize that the problem is one of poor quality of
    education rather than over-education of workers. In other words, the key problem is not that skill levels
    are too high for a relatively less sophisticated production structure (in which case there would not be a
    skills gap for non-manual, non-routine jobs), but rather that higher levels of education do not translate
    into higher levels of skills.

    Moreover, continued learning and skills upgrading is hampered by the fact that firms are not providing
    training to any great extent. Firms are not well equipped to replace basic education systems in helping
    workers improve foundational skills—those that need to be in place to facilitate further learning—but
    can provide job specific training and skills upgrading to meet changing demands. In Armenia, Georgia
    and Ukraine respectively 22, 7 and 20 percent of firms provided training to their white collar workers,
    with much lower shares for blue collar workers, showing that a vast majority of firms did not, in fact,

provide any training opportunities beyond on-the-job training. The propensity to offer training differs,
with more modern and skill constrained firms generally much more likely to train their own staff: firms
that experienced difficulties in hiring workers due to lack of skills, innovative firms, and internationally
oriented firms train more than other types of firms (Figure 6.4). Firm based training should not be
interpreted as compensation for inadequate education and vocational training, but is more likely to
reflect the fact that these firms are more skills intensive and as such depend on continuously developing
skills of workers.

Household survey data show that firm based training is limited and concentrated to a set of workers,
emphasizing that training during working life is complementary to education. Regular training
opportunities outside the formal education and training system are in general lacking, implying that life-
long learning opportunities are limited for the population at large, and training is concentrated in those
who already hold a certain level of skills. Among white collar employees, around one in four employees
in Armenia, Georgia and Macedonia, and one in twenty in Ukraine, received some form of training
(internal or external) in the past year. The share of workers receiving training is lower than the share of
firms providing training (even though larger firms also are more likely than smaller firms to provide
training, and even though public wage employees are included), implying that access to training is very

                                                                                                                                                                                              47
uneven. Education is hence cumulative: basic education is needed to get access to further levels of
education; those that are trained are also more likely to be able to benefit from further training. A result
of the concentration of training is skills path dependence from early on—those that are not able to
secure a sufficient level of education, get a job in a firm that provides training, and ensure that they are
the ones invested in that particular firm, will not be continuously developing skills.

From this perspective, public sector employees are at an advantage compared to those working in the
private sector. The incidence of training among public sector employees is everywhere higher than in
the private wage sector. The self-employed have the lowest incidence of training of all. A possible
explanation is that self-employment is more concentrated in low skill activities and that in addition, time
and credit constraints together with lack of adequate courses and information failures on training needs
as well as the benefits of training, reduces incentives to seek further skills development.

The path dependence of skills development is further cemented for those who are unemployed or
inactive. With the exception of Macedonia, the unemployed have virtually no access to training. The
implication is that once employed, there are some chances of on-the-job training and other forms of
skills development. For the unemployed, opportunities for training provided by the state or through
their own means, are very limited.

            6.3       Employers and education systems not collaborating
Finally, to achieve successful skills development it is essential that employers cooperate with the
education sector, to articulate what kind of skills they need and to give feedback on the quality of
education. Yet, as data from Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine shows, only few firms have contacts with
the education sector. Figure 6.6 shows that as few as 4 to 6 percent of firms in Georgia have regular
contact, with as much as 20 percent in Armenia (for white collar jobs) and Ukraine. Most of these

contacts, though, are about recruitment or further training of their own employees as well as
internships (Figure 6.7)—which is of course laudable, but only very few firms seem to actually give
feedback on the quality of education or to contribute to curriculum development. Hence, the education
sector might to some extent lack the crucial information to respond to changing needs in the labor
market—for which the cooperation of employers is essential.

Unsurprisingly, innovative firms are more likely to have contacted training institutes than traditional
ones, and the same holds for foreign owned, internationally oriented firms, and fast growing firms (in
terms of net recruitment).

In conclusion, the evidence suggest that both employers and workers are fairly dissatisfied with the
education sector in terms of the skills that employers see in young graduates and the quality of
education that workers received. Yet, it might not be a fair to entirely blame the education sector for
this: Also, employer are not providing training to their workers. Importantly, only few employers are
actually cooperating with the education sector to give feedback on the quality of education and to
develop new curricula or update existing curricula. The final section will elaborate on these findings and
map out a policy agenda to overcome skills gaps and identify areas where more knowledge is needed to
arrive at successful skills development.

                          7.      Overcoming the skills gap
In spite of comparatively high levels of education, workers with the right skills are difficult to find in ECA
countries. Education and training systems do not appear to deliver the right skills, at least not to the
general work force, as evidenced in the insufficient levels of foundational skills and lack of confidence in
the vocational and general education systems with respect to job relevant knowledge. While some firms
provide training—notably more modern, productive and internationally competitive firms—relatively
few workers seem to benefit and training is not, and could not be, compensating for poor education
quality. At the same time, across ECA countries, demand is increasing for generic skills, including socio-
emotional skills that allow for flexibility and constant adaptation to new and changing tasks. In a rapidly
changing economic environment, predicting future demands for specific occupations is likely to be
difficult and risky. Instead, providing future workers with the general problem solving and socio-
emotional skills that can be tailored to new needs is likely to be much more important.

The final question is then how policy can improve skills development. Which path can policy makers take
to arrive at successful skills development? Whereas the report cannot provide a complete answer to this
question, it offers an organizing framework on how to approach this important question, identify some
preliminary priorities, and most importantly, set an agenda on where further knowledge is necessary. In
doing so, it will be useful to return to the framework for successful skills development presented at the
beginning of the report (Figure 1.1).

The framework outlined in the introduction lists four key ingredients to arrive at successful skills
development: (i) employers who train and cooperate; (ii) an education system that is responsive to
changing demands; (iii) workers who invest in skills; and (iv) labor markets that reward skills. Currently,
however, Armenia, Georgia, Macedonia and Ukraine are stuck in a low-value equilibrium, where actions
is simultaneously needed from government, public and private education systems, firms, workers, and
prospective students to improve the situation for all involved. Coordination failures on the employers’
side, information failures on the workers’ side, political economy failures in the education sector, and
labor market failures together foster underperforming education and training systems, leave workers
and prospective students with a lack of direction, and keep the private sector—prospective employers—
outside the purview of strategic direction and decision making. At the same time, firms lack incentives
to provide a coordinated response, to organize among themselves around skills development, and
champion the need for relevance and flexibility in skills development systems.

To improve outcomes, then, actions are needed simultaneously: education systems need to take
leadership and respond to the needs of firms and students, including making difficult decisions to
reduce or close certain fields of studies and schools while investing in new ones; students and their
parents will need to find the right information about which vocations and fields of studies pay off in the
labor market and which skills are sought after by employers; employers need to come together and
jointly develop sector and economy-wide training institutions and effectively articulate their needs to
the education system; and labor market institutions and regulations need to adapt to ensure that skills
that are sought-after by employers are also rewarded by higher wages. Governments have to play a role
in all of these areas, from reforming education systems to supporting employer associations, subsidizing
training, improved labor market information systems and matching.

Figure 7.1 offers a tentative—and by no means complete—list of reform areas and actions to give some
general guidance to policy makers on how to improve skills development. In most of these areas more
research and knowledge is necessary to arrive at firm policy conclusions, especially on how to achieve
change.

In the following, the report will elaborate reform areas for each of the four target groups or institutions.
In doing so, the report tries to identify further policy actions for each reform area and also potential
tools on how to implement those policy actions. The latter, though, are largely “black boxes” that need
to be unraveled through further research to find best practice examples.

            7.1          Employers who train their workers and collaborate around
                         training
The low incidence of training among firms, whether internal or external, has several potential causes
including limited knowledge among firms for identifying training needs and/or deliver training to their
staff (appropriate training content and methods), fear of lost investments due to poaching and worker

                                                                                                                                         53
turnover more generally—a specific problem when knowledge is not firm specific and thus portable
across industries—and the cost of providing training and of coordination among firms that may be
competitors. Several policy interventions can address the risks and costs associated with training.
However, where the key reason is low overall skills level in production techniques, or low skill levels of
workers such that training is not likely to increase productivity, public interventions to increase firm
training are not going to be helpful.

To address risks of poaching and to internalize the social benefits for training, one approach would be to
subsidize employers for the training they provide, for example through the tax system. Also,
apprenticeships systems are frequently employed in developed and developing countries. Through
these, firms and workers share the investment cost in training as (young) workers are hired by a firm,
usually for wages below-market rate (with the expectation that they will rise later) and workers receive
training in combination with working (Almeida, Behrman, & Robalino, 2012).

The advantages of apprenticeship systems are their flexibility around curriculum and financing modes
and the opportunity they offer for young workers to make the transition from school to work. Their
challenge lies largely in building and overseeing a harmonized system with transferrable skills through
standardized curricula and certification/accreditation. Subsidies for training can also be employed to
increase the social benefits of training when they increase those of the individual firms. Industry-specific
training funds are a common form of collecting revenue from firms in order to build national training
systems and/or finance incentives based schemes where firms that provide training get compensated
for costs incurred in relation to training. Such programs require careful design as publicly subsidized
training runs a risk of replacing investments that would have taken place anyway, because of the
potential deadweight losses associated with tax-based financing, and because their efficiency needs to
be assured by involvement of employers in their design (Almeida, Behrman, & Robalino, 2012).

Where collaboration among firms, within industries, in value-chains, or geographical clusters, would be
profitable but does not take place, policy interventions can help build and strengthen coordination
mechanisms, such as employer associations and chambers of commerce. These associations can help
firms identify training needs, coordinate advocacy vis-à-vis government, coordinate industry-specific
training initiatives, and provide monitoring and evaluation of various programs and initiatives. They can
take the lead role in identifying industry-specific occupational standards, as well as play the role of
counterpart in the dialogue and collaboration with private and public education providers and policy
makers. Figure 7.2 summarizes the reform areas and policy actions for employers and hints at possible
tools on how to implement those policy actions.

                  7.2   An education system that responds to changing demands
How can education systems become better at responding to changing skills needs over time, and in
ensuring broad-based participation and several alternative modes of building skills? Workforce
development reforms in the education system require (i) a strong strategic framework that sets
priorities based on wide consultations (ii) a system for financing and delivering services that is governed
to ensure relevance and financial sustainability, and (iii) incentives that ensure that service delivery is
driven to aim for the highest efficiency and standard possible (Box 7.1). Of course, a precondition for
successful reform is strong political will to adapt existing education structures. The political economy
challenges around closing, for example, TVET schools and firing teachers in one occupations branch
while expanding in another one are significant and not easy to overcome.

          Box 7.1: Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER): Diagnostics to improve
                                       workforce development (WfD)
    Workforce development systems can be evaluated using the SABER diagnostics tool, which assesses
    the degree to which current education and training systems have a strategic framework in place, the
    extent to which the system is diversified, efficient and equitable, as well as accountable to a certain
    level of standards, and whether service delivery is effective and relevant.




                                                                                                                    55
    The SABER Workforce Development Diagnostics focuses on assessing system strengths and
    weaknesses relative to international best practice, along three key dimensions: strategy, system,
    and service delivery, each with three sub-goals.

    Strategic framework. Do countries have a strategic direction for workforce development? Is there a
    strong demand led approach? Is there broad coordination among stakeholders—education systems,
    policy makers, firms, and so on—around diagnostics, priorities, incentives?

    System oversight. Are investments in workforce development efficient and equitable, notably with
    respect to broad partnerships for funding, and sufficient funding for vocational systems, and is the
    system financially sustainable over the long term? Are there mechanisms in place to ensure relevant
    and reliable standards for quality in service provision and skills acquisition? Are there different
    opportunities for skills acquisition through different pathways, such as permitting those with
    diplomas from TVET systems to enter further studies?

    Service delivery. Is the system open to a diverse set of skills providers, and are these provided with
    incentives to excel? Are (public) training programs relevant to the demand for skills on labor
    markets, based on information from the enterprise sector, experienced teachers, and the materials
    and equipment needed to provide relevant training? Are systems monitored and evaluated?

    These are rated compared to best practice countries along a scale of 1-4, where a rating of 4 is the
    level corresponding to advanced economies where systemic good practice meets global standards.

Diagnostics of the policy framework for workforce development (WfD) undertaken for the STEP
countries show that these countries face significant needs to reform their systems to increase strategic
focus, governance, and excellence in delivering results . In most areas, STEP countries are characterized


                                                                                                        56
as emerging countries in terms of policy framework—showing some instances of good practice, but far
from being established good practice systems that correspond to globally recognized best standards.

As a legacy of times of a planned economy, the diagnostic exercise reveals particular weaknesses in
involving the demand side in setting the strategic framework (like, for example, assessing the
implications of economic structure and prospects for skills or engaging employers as partners), and in
efficiency and equity of funding (Figure 7.3).

While challenges of aligning skills development systems to the needs of the economy are recognized and
addressed in the countries’ strategic documents, policy documents are rarely accompanied by robust
assessments of the economic prospects and their implications on skills demanded on the labor market.
The lack of broad, regular and relevant data on skills gaps continues to hinder the design and
implementation of policy interventions with high potential to improve the WfD framework. The policy
dialogue is sporadic, and deals more with sector-specific and technical issues, rather than with strategic
priorities. In Armenia, efforts have gone into engaging employers at various levels including with career
centers, boards of educational institutions, and so on, but overall the influence of businesses and
industries in shaping and implementing WfD priorities remains modest (and ad hoc). Government
funding for education is overall modest, not supplemented by other sources, and not related to
performance.

Ministries of Education will need to be responsible for leading the reform dialogue, reform institutions
and the size and composition of staff to increase accountability towards results, and adapt to changing
demands. They have convening power to bring together the different stakeholders and are ultimately
tasked to set strategic priorities as well as put in place financial mechanisms that ensure flexible training
provision, high and certifiable standards of training, and sustainability. They set standards for teacher
training, and should take the lead in establishing monitoring and evaluation frameworks by enhancing
evidence-based accountability including the practice of routinely sponsoring skills-related surveys and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    57
impact evaluations of existing programs (for graduates labor market outcomes, for all modes of delivery
of training services—IVET, CVET, ALMPs) as well as due diligence reporting on enrolments, budgets and
budget execution. Together with employer representatives, ministries should identify new fields of
study, and continuously monitor and update curricula. Importantly, ministries are responsible for
overseeing the elimination of corruption that distorts the investments in, and rewards to, skills
acquisition.

In increasing flexibility of training systems, public policy is likely to face significant political economy
challenges that need to be acknowledged upfront in the policy agenda. These include notably the
resistance to changes or reductions in teaching and other staff, the opening up to dialogue and joint
decision making with employers, private providers of training, and other stakeholders, and the
broadening of stakeholders to the firms with a growth potential which may or may not be part of the set
of large firms that usually are brought to the table. Figure 7.4 summarizes the reform areas and policy
actions for the education sector and hints at possible tools on how to implement those policy actions or
institutions responsible for implementation.

            7.3        Workers who invest in skills
For workers to be able to invest in relevant skills, they need the basic foundations acquired early in life
to be able to continue to build up their skills. Throughout basic education and beyond, they need to be
exposed to generic and technical skills and offered the opportunity to hone entrepreneurial skills, as
well as soft skills. Stimulating these broader skills sets should be an integral part of school curricula, but
will also need to be included in adult training and employment services.

Students also need help to make informed choices: to understand what skills pay off in the labor market,
what and how their own aptitudes and interest can best be matched to these opportunities, and what
schools provide the best sources of skills development.

In fact students are changing their preferences in STEP countries, as evidenced in a clear change in fields
of study. The younger generation in Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine are more likely to be in humanities
and social sciences than in engineering or natural sciences (Figure 7.5). In Macedonia, engineering has
given way to natural sciences and social sciences. The extent to which these changes are relevant for
labor market outcomes requires tracing past students through their transition to working life. A much
quoted example from the Netherlands shows how tracer surveys of graduates can shed light on
different aspects of labor market outcomes including the duration of job search, access to employment,
overall working conditions including contract type and earnings, and the satisfaction with use of skills
and the job overall (Sondergaard & Murthi, 2012).

In this context, labor market observatories, when well-managed, have the potential to improve the
quality and scope of labor market information, available to students and job seekers, employers,
authorities, private and public education providers, employment offices, and others. Experience from
Poland’s regional labor market observatories suggests that while observatories can be helpful, several

factors are needed to increase their positive impact (Box 7.2). These include clear strategic vision, in-
house analytical capacity and clear communication and dissemination strategies, and high accountability
vis-à-vis results performance.

                        Box 7.2: Success factors for Labor Market Observatories
Labor market observatories provide information to guide policy makers, students, job-seekers, firms,
educational institutes and others in providing or choosing timely and relevant skills development.
Successful observatories produce information tailored to the needs of these users. Critical success
factors to provide relevant and useful information include:

(i) Governance structures that ensures accountability of the owner (and main user) of information, like,
for example, Ministry of Labor or Ministry of Education
(ii) Clear objective: to monitor and interpret changes in labor supply and labor demand, and any arising
mismatches because of labor or skills shortages
(iii) Statistical infrastructure is available and information is shared among different producers and
consumers of statistics
(iv) Analytical capacity in-house is sufficient to identify important issues, provide analysis, and outsource
special surveys or research questions to adequate external parties
(v) The end users of information and their needs are clearly identified and products tailored to their
different requirements
(vi) Communication and dissemination capacity exists to ensure information can be used.

Equipped with information on labor market situations and returns to skills, individuals may also need
specific career guidance to improve their chances of making good choices for their working future.
Although information on what constitutes the most effective forms of career guidance is scarce—it
would require tracing outcomes over many years—international best practice for career orientation has
been established as independent (external to school), impartial (not favoring one specific orientation)
and complete (including all options) guidance for students in lower and higher secondary education,
specifically tailored to each age group. A range of career guidance options can be envisaged: at a group
level (seminar, visits, and lectures), or at an individual level (teachers, former students, mentors,
internships visits to firms). Career guidance services may also be tailored to groups and individuals
requiring special assistance, including children and youth from remote areas. Figure 7.6 summarizes the
reform areas and policy actions for students and workers and hints at possible tools on how to
implement those policy actions.

             7.4              Labor markets that reward skills
Closing information gaps will not be sufficient to close skills gaps, unless labor markets in fact reward
skills—otherwise, youth may be making perfectly rational choices in acquiring or even buying diplomas
that offer not much skills content or choosing schools that provide connections for “insiders”. The
evidence from STEP countries is not irrefutable on the role of skills versus other factors—the most
important contribution to earnings is given by the type of occupation, rather than the skills used in that
occupation, hinting at the possibility of segmented labor markets. The fact that so many with tertiary
education and with more intense skills levels end up in the public sector while the private sector is skills
constrained, is also one indication of skewed incentives in terms of skills acquisition: if it consistently
pays off better to work in the public rather than the private sector, youth will acquire the education and
contacts that ensure public employment rather than for private sector activity.

Labor markets that reward good performance—presumably the outcome of possessing labor market
relevant skills—are also likely to signal to youth the advantages of investment in adequate skills. Labor
codes and collective bargaining agreements that encourage promotion and pay raise based on merit,
rather than seniority, education levels, or age, contribute to fostering incentives. Similarly, with overly


                                                                                                                         61
rigid labor market regulations, making mistakes in the hiring process can be extremely costly, if it is not
possible—or very expensive—to let workers go if they prove not to have the skills necessary for the job.

Such distortions aside, skills based hiring may also be hampered by lack of means of signaling available
or needed skills—which is why diplomas remain a key factor in discerning available skills. Private and
public employment services can be helpful in developing effective labor mediation that identifies skills
available and skills in need. New technology is also being introduced by firms, like, for example, in the
Unites States, to directly and more efficiently test skills as well as personality traits in the hiring process
in order to achieve better matching results. Evidence seems to suggest that this increased testing for
skills by employers has, on the one hand, increased the duration it takes to fill a vacancy, but on the
other hand it has improved the quality of job matches and therefore reduced turnover rates. In other
words, employers are getting smarter about the hiring process, apply better skills testing, and as a result
hire better people and do not need to fire (and re-hire) as many people. Developing these kind of new
skills tests also in the transition countries of ECA could, in fact, increase the reward for skills and
ultimately foster better skills development.
