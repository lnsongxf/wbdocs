GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED
Hazard, risk, vulnerability and resilience are terms commonly used among practitioners in
the disaster risk management and climate change communities; however, they are often
subject to different interpretations. When applicable, this report uses definitions provided
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Office
for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). The definitions of the terms “loss” and “damage”
are those used by the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) methodology adopted
jointly by the World Bank, the United Nations and the European Commission.

Adaptation: The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects.
In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial
opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to
expected climate change and its effects (IPCC, 2014).

Adaptive Capacity: The ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms to
adjust to potential damage, take advantage of opportunities or respond to consequences
(IPCC, 2014).

Climate Change: The state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical
tests) by changes in the mean and/or variability of its properties, and that persists for an
extended period, typically decades or longer (IPCC, 2014).

Mitigation (of Climate Change): A human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance
the sinks of greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2014).

Climate and Disaster Resilient Development (or Climate and Disaster Resilience):
A set of institutional arrangements, processes and instruments that help identify the risks
from disasters, climate extremes, gradual and long-term climatic changes, and their
associated impacts, and the design of measures to reduce, transfer and prepare for such
risks. Climate and disaster resilient development combines development benefits with
reductions in vulnerability over the short and longer term, using a development planning,
multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach (World Bank, 2013).

Damage: The total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area.
Damages are measured in physical units (such as numbers or square metres of housing
destroyed, or kilometres of roads), and in monetary terms, expressed as replacement
costs according to prices prevailing just before the event (GFDRR, 2010b).

Disaster: A serious disruption in the functioning of a community or society involving
widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which
exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.
Disaster impacts may include loss of life, injury, disease and other negative effects
on human physical, mental and social wellbeing, together with damage to property,
destruction of assets, loss of services, social and economic disruption, and environmental
degradation (UNISDR, 2009a).

Disaster Risk Management: Processes for designing, implementing and evaluating
strategies, policies and measures to improve the understanding of disaster risk, foster risk
reduction and transfer, and promote continuous improvement in disaster preparedness,
response and recovery practices, with the explicit purpose of increasing human security,
wellbeing, quality of life and sustainable development (IPCC, 2014).

Glossary of Terms Used




                         Disaster Risk Reduction: The policy objective of anticipating future disaster risk, reducing
                         existing exposure, vulnerability or hazard, and strengthening resilience (UNISDR, 2015).

                         Disaster Management: The cluster of measures, including preparedness and contingency
                         planning, business continuity planning, early warning, response and immediate recovery, to
                         deal with disasters once they are imminent or have occurred (UNISDR, 2015).

                         Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental
                         services and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social or cultural assets in places and
                         settings that could be adversely affected (IPCC, 2014).

                         Hazard: The potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend
                         or physical impact that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, as well as
                         damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and
                         environmental resources (IPCC, 2014). For the purposes of this report, the term hazard refers
                         to natural disaster-related physical events or trends or their physical impacts.

                         Loss: Changes in economic flows arising from a disaster that continue until the achievement
                         of full economic recovery (GFDRR, 2010; ECLAC, 2003). (The UNFCCC defines loss and
                         damage as the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow
                         onset events that people have not been able to cope with or adapt to.)

                         Resilience: The capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a
                         hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their
                         essential function, identity and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation,
                         learning and transformation (IPCC, 2014).

                         Risk: The potential for consequences where something of value is at stake and where the
                         outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values. Risk is often represented as the
                         probability of the occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these
                         events or trends occur. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure and hazard
                         (IPCC, 2014). In this report, the term risk is used primarily to refer to the risks of natural disaster
                         and climate change impacts.

                         Risk Transfer: An approach to risk management that involves the transfer of financial
                         responsibility for some or all of the risk and any costs associated with the materialisation of
                         that risk (OECD, 2016, forthcoming). Examples include insurance and reinsurance contracts,
                         catastrophe bonds, contingent credit facilities and reserve funds as part of risk transfer from
                         governments to financial markets (UNISDR, 2009a).

                         Small Island Developing States (SIDS): No universally agreed list of SIDS currently exists.
                         Main lists include: the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) list, comprised of 39 member
                         states; the list of the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed
                         Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and SIDS (UNOHRLLS), comprised of the
                         38 AOSIS members who are also members of the United Nations; and the list of official
                         development assistance (ODA)-eligible SIDS kept by the Organization for Economic Co-
                         operation and Development (OECD), which includes 35 countries and territories. This report
                         focuses on the 35 ODA-eligible SIDS, which are listed in Table 1 and Annex 3.

                         Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability
                         encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to
                         harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (IPCC, 2014).

FOREWORD

Our Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face unique and increasing challenges from
climate change and natural disasters due to our geographic characteristics, small size
of our economies, and isolation. It is also clear that climate-related events are affecting
us more intensely than in the past and causing relatively higher losses than for other
developing nations. Climate change is limiting opportunities for growth, undermining
our sustainable development and threatening the existence of some of our islands.

Concessional finance is essential for addressing additional challenges climate change
poses to the development of SIDS. While financial resources are increasingly being
made available to address such challenges, accessing and managing the multiple
sources of these funds remains a major difficulty to many of us with our limited – albeit
capable – human resources.

I am pleased to see that this report, Climate and Disaster Resilience Financing in Small
Island Developing States, clarifies the current landscape of such finance. The report
spells out the latest trends in concessional financing available for climate and disaster
resilient development in SIDS. It highlights the complexity of the global financing
architecture from bilateral and multilateral agencies and the intricate web of eligibilities
that SIDS face when trying to access this funding. It is also an important contribution
to understanding what resources are already being made available to SIDS, as well as
what actions remain to be taken so that the international community can best support
our countries in building climate and disaster resilience.

This report is not just about challenges. It also illustrates the positive steps that
SIDS are taking – and in many cases leading – to ensure that climate and disaster
resilience is addressed as an integral part of their development. In addition, it shows
how concessional financing can positively support resilience actions, for example
by helping to establish adequate intitutional and budgetary arrangements. The
report points to some financing mechanisms and modalities that providers could
make greater use of, particularly by pooling resources in support of programmatic
approaches and strengthening country systems. Personally, I am pleased to see the
inclusion of the innovative approach that we have used in Seychelles – a debt-for-
adaptation swap – to reduce immediate debt burdens from climate-related disasters
and increase resources targeted to climate resilient development.

The report calls for the international community to consider financing for climate
and disaster resilience that is appropriate for the challenges that SIDS face, less
fragmented, easier to access, predictable and long-term. It essentially calls for a
more consistent, comprehensive and coordinated financing architecture that is better
tailored to the needs of SIDS. It also calls on SIDS to create enabling policies and
institutions to ensure more effective use of funds, and for the sustained effort needed
to ensure their development is climate and disaster resilient.

Armed with this information, we – the leaders of SIDS – can move forward to
take urgent action for ensuring that climate and disaster risks do not erode our
development gains, that our people do not lose their lives and assets and that we pave
the way for a more resilient future.

                                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

                                         Relevance of climate and disaster resilience to Small Island Developing States (SIDS)

                                         Natural disasters and climate change severely affect the growth trajectory of
                                         SIDS1 and their ability to achieve sustainable development. SIDS are located in
                                         some of the most disaster-prone regions in the world and comprise two-thirds of
                                         countries with the highest relative annual losses due to disasters. With the effects
                                         of climate change compounding the intensity of these disasters, this trend is set
                                         to continue, creating new developmental challenges for SIDS. Natural disasters
                                         and climate variability severely impact major economic sectors in SIDS, hinder
                                         economic growth and affect the most vulnerable populations. Lacking relatively
                                         stable and strong fiscal revenues and domestic savings, SIDS governments
                                         often need to divert scarce public resources from essential social and economic
                                         development investments to address disaster-related needs, compromising the
                                         pace and scope of future growth. Development in SIDS, therefore, is subject
                                         to a range of interconnected and mutually reinforcing economic, social and
                                         environmental challenges.

                                         Building resilience at individual, institutional, and private sector levels is
                                         essential to achieve sustainable development in SIDS, but available financing
                                         for this purpose is limited and difficult to access. The responsibility, expertise
                                         and funding for climate and disaster resilient development is scattered across
                                         a large number of actors, creating a complex global architecture of funds and
                                         providers. While several market-based financing mechanisms have become
                                         available globally, they are not equally and easily accessible to all SIDS, and
                                         concessional finance from the international community remains a key source of
                                         financing to foster climate and disaster resilient development. Understanding how
                                         much SIDS are actually receiving and in what ways becomes, therefore, pivotal to
                                         help the international community more effectively support SIDS in building climate
                                         and disaster resilience.

                                         Quantifying concessional finance trends for climate and disaster resilience in SIDS

                                         Resources for resilience have grown significantly, but they still represent a
                                         small share of concessional finance. Between 2011 and 2014 (the timeframe
                                         used for this report), the volume of concessional finance in support of climate
                                         and disaster resilience to SIDS nearly doubled, reaching USD 1.01 billion in 2014.
                                         However, this represented only 14% of the total concessional finance directed to
                                         SIDS during this period. Bilateral providers gave the bulk of concessional finance for
                                         climate and disaster resilience - 71% for the 2011-14 period - with annual funding
                                         levels remaining fairly stable. Although multilateral organisations provided a much
                                         smaller share of this financing (29% of the total), multilateral commitments to SIDS
                                         increased rapidly, nearly doubling from 2011 (USD 226 million) to 2014 (USD 443
                                         million). In addition to these direct contributions, multilaterals channelled close to
                                         a fifth of bilateral contributions, in effect serving as a conduit to 44% of the total

Executive Summary




                    Climate and disaster resilience financing was mostly provided as grants (73%
                    during the period 2011-14), but recent growth was largely due to increases
                    in concessional loans to Upper Middle-Income Countries. Concessional loans
                    increased substantially from USD 69 million in 2011 (11%) to USD 415 million
                    in 2014 (41%), largely because of greater concessional lending from multilateral
                    development banks to a limited number of SIDS. While Upper Middle-Income SIDS
                    were able to access more concessional loans – bringing their share of concessional
                    financing to 51% in 2014 (up from 33% in 2011) – funding for Least Developed
                    Countries (LDCs) remained fairly constant, bringing the share of concessional
                    financing to LDCs to 24% of the total in 2014, down from 37% in 2011.

                    In terms of access to finance, striking differences across individual SIDS are
                    prevalent. The smallest nations tend to receive the highest per capita annual
                    financing allocations, largely because of the high fixed administrative costs involved.
                    Geographic and income patterns mask the disproportionate weight of a few
                    countries and a few large and isolated commitments.

                    Resilience finance is dominated by investments in resilient infrastructure in a
                    few countries. Investments in resilient public infrastructure accounted for USD 335
                    million on average per year from 2011-2014, or 43% of total climate and disaster
                    resilience financing for this period in part due to the higher cost of these investments.
                    Large one-off commitments also skewed geographic and income patterns.

                    Access to greater and more effective financing is constrained by a number
                    of challenges

                    SIDS are taking positive steps to address some of the challenges of
                    mainstreaming climate and disaster resilience into development. This includes
                    setting up coordination units within key ministries and developing strategic policy
                    documents. However, challenges remain in identifying the risks and impacts of
                    natural disasters, securing adequate resources in national budgets, and reducing
                    inefficiencies and institutional fragmentation caused, in part, by some international
                    processes and funding sources.

                    Many SIDS depend on a single provider for the bulk of resilience financing,
                    exacerbating financial vulnerability. For 14 of the 35 SIDS considered in this
                    report, across all regions, the top provider accounted for over half of the climate and
                    disaster resilience financing during 2011-14, with this percentage increasing over
                    time. This trend is concerning as SIDS could become overly reliant on the shifting
                    priorities of the dominant donor(s).

                    The remaining resilience financing is fragmented across a large number of
                    projects, which leads to high transaction costs and places additional stress on
                    the capacity of SIDS. While a few large projects accounted for the bulk of resilience
                    funding to SIDS – mostly directed to Upper-Middle Income SIDS – the vast majority
                    of commitments were provided through smaller sized projects. During the 2011-
                    14 period, more than half of all resilience projects were below USD 200,000 and
80% were below USD 1.5 million, yet together, these small projects accounted
for only 2% and 10% of the total resilience financing to SIDS. This proliferation of
small projects was widespread across all SIDS, with climate and disaster resilience
financed through a total of 1,715 projects in 2011-14. Most countries were receiving
an average of 10 individual projects per year with commitments of less than USD
1.5 million each. SIDS with the largest number of projects were receiving more than
30 resilience projects in a given year.

Sector-wide approaches and budget support remain limited, as does the
implementation of resilience funds by recipient countries. Only 8% (USD 239
million) of the concessional finance for climate and disaster resilient development
was provided as sectoral budget support from 2011-14, and financing executed
by SIDS governments represented less than 35% of total funding for 20 out of the
35 SIDS examined in this report. The relatively low use of national systems and
government budget execution can create an unfortunate cycle, whereby the limited
use of these financing modalities by itself contributes to perpetuating low capacity,
with implications for the effectiveness and sustainability of investments.

Resilience funding tends to follow large disasters, but predictable, long-
term financing is still scarce. Larger disasters are prone to receive larger
funding streams than smaller, more recurrent ones. Greater concessional
resources for climate and disaster resilience tend to be provided in the wake of
major disasters and then progressively fade away, while countries that have not
recently experienced large disasters may struggle to receive resilience funding.
This low predictability of funding can constrain the ability of SIDS to take more
comprehensive and forward-looking steps to reduce vulnerabilities and
increase resilience over the long term.

Country access to global climate funds is constrained by complex – and
variable – requirements. A multiplicity of special climate funds has been
established over the past decade to increase developing countries’ access to
financing. For SIDS, however, tapping into these funds remains a challenge due to
the complex processes and procedures to access the funds, which, for the most
part, exceed the limited administrative and technical capacities of SIDS.

The international community could do more to help SIDS enhance climate and
disaster resilient development by:

•	   Supporting SIDS to create an enabling policy environment for climate
     and disaster resilience. This includes public policies and regulations, which
     can promote climate resilience by influencing the choices of private actors in
     various sectors.

•	   Enhancing information on resilience and information management
     systems. This can be done through multi-country and regional partnerships
     and the innovative use of technology, which could prove cost-effective and
     increase impact.
Executive Summary




                    •	   Supporting SIDS to integrate climate and disaster risk into national
                         planning and budgeting. This will require supporting collaboration across a
                         large set of ministries and departments to identify and integrate priorities, and
                         highlight linkages and synergies across sector-level policy objectives. It may
                         also require the adoption of contingency funds or financing buffers to allow for
                         better preparedness and immediate response following disasters.

                    •	   Supporting public administration systems and institutions responsible
                         for managing natural disasters, climate finance and risk. This includes
                         supporting SIDS to further develop their public financial management systems
                         and capacities to access and manage concessional funds – for example, by
                         reinforcing central units as a one-stop shop for all incoming funding proposals
                         – thus enabling investments to be prioritized and channelled more efficiently.

                    •	   Increasing the use of financing mechanisms that enhance capacity and
                         coordination. Donors should consider further ways to pool resources to
                         reduce SIDS reliance on a single source of concessional funds, while avoiding
                         the high level of project fragmentation currently experienced.

                    •	   Providing predictable and more programmatic funding. Investing in pre-
                         emptive measures to build resilience requires access to more reliable financing.
                         Funding that is more programmatic and long term (typically 10-15 years) could
                         also help foster the policy, institutional and behavioural change needed to help
                         build resilience to climate and disaster impacts.

                    •	   Facilitating access to funding from global climate funds through simplified
                         application and management procedures for SIDS. Development partners
                         should use their influence to support adoption, by the global climate funds, of
                         proportionate and streamlined approaches to encourage greater direct access
                         and project implementation and greater national ownership.

                    •	   Facilitating access to innovative financing and risk transfer mechanisms.
                         Development partners can, for example, support SIDS access to insurance and
                         other forms of risk transfer and risk sharing mechanisms, as well as encourage
                         the use of contingency funds or contingent credit lines.

                    •	   Using financing instruments that can help SIDS at risk of debt distress
                         improve their debt situation and avoid using financing mechanisms that
                         can undermine debt sustainability. In recent years, a number of instruments
                         to deal with the debt situation of SIDS have emerged, which could be further
                         scaled up and replicated. While some can provide temporary relief, the
                         international community should also help SIDS address the drivers of debt
                         accumulation. Furthermore, while greater concessional lending to Upper
                         Middle-Income SIDS in recent years has increased the financing available for
                         resilience, care should be taken to avoid endangering their debt sustainability.
•	   Facilitating an international dialogue on the eligibility criteria for
     concessional finance with the aim of ensuring that SIDS are able to
     access the finance they need at terms and conditions most suited
     to their specific circumstances. Currently, SIDS face a complex web of
     eligibility requirements that must be met in order to access different sources
     of concessional financing for resilience. With eligibility to several multilateral
     and bilateral funding sources relying heavily on per capita classification, SIDS
     have called for a coordinated effort by development partners to review the rules
     governing access to concessional finance. Acknowledging the multi-faceted
     nature of vulnerability along with increasing adverse climate-related impacts
     on SIDS, it may be timely to explore if and how vulnerability to climate change
     could be included in concessional finance eligibility criteria and allocations.
     This effort will require multi-partner research and consideration of all aspects of
     vulnerability – socio-economic and biophysical.

•	   Investing to build national capacities and expertise. The sustainability and
     ownership of resilience programmes depends on striking the right balance
     between temporary solutions to fill human resource gaps and longer-term
     investments in national capacities across the full spectrum of institutional
     needs. Innovative approaches and the use of new technologies could help
     tailor capacity-building approaches to the specific context of SIDS.

                                        The international community has widely recognised the importance of fostering
                                        development that is resilient to the impacts of both climate change and natural
                                        disasters,2 most recently through the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action
                                        (SAMOA) Pathway, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Addis
                                        Ababa Action Agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris
                                        Agreement. Some Small Island Developing States (SIDS), particularly in the
                                        Pacific, have also been at the forefront of global efforts to combine climate change
                                        adaptation (CCA) with disaster risk management (DRM), and mainstream them
                                        into development planning.3 In general, however, progress to integrate climate
                                        and disaster resilience into development planning has been slow (Box 1). Growing
                                        global experience continues to demonstrate that climate and disaster resilient
                                        development makes sense from both a poverty-alleviation, as well as from an
                                        economic, perspective.4 For example, investing in early warning systems, better
                                        preparedness and improved safety codes can be cost effective, save human lives,
                                        and protect public and private investments.

                                        SIDS are a heterogeneous group of countries that share a number of common
                                        structural and geophysical constraints, which result in disproportionately large
                                        economic, social and environmental challenges and hinder development. For low-
                                        lying atoll states, such as Maldives, Kiribati and Tuvalu, climate-induced sea-level
                                        rise poses an existential threat, since populations in some atolls may be forced
                                        to move or protect the atolls at very high costs. However, even in higher elevation
                                        islands, the impacts of natural disasters and climate change are disproportionally
                                        high, with 19 SIDS suffering losses of 1 to 9% of their gross domestic product
                                        (GDP) in an average year (see Chapter 2). Recurrent disasters, therefore, act as a
                                        “leaking bucket” for many SIDS, affecting development growth in significant and

                                            This report is the first attempt at quantifying the flow and patterns of concessional
                                            finance in support of climate and disaster resilience in SIDS.6 By clarifying the
                                            nature, scope and volume of concessional funding for climate and disaster
                                            resilience, it aims to inform policy and decision makers, in both SIDS recipient
                                            governments as well as among funding providers, and promote a more effective
                                            provision and use of financing for resilience. Unlike climate mitigation, CCA
                                            and DRM are largely dependent on public resources due to the nature of
                                            the investments and the policies they address.7 Amongst public resources,
                                            concessional finance is particularly important for SIDS due to the general

Box 1: CLIMATE RESILIENT DEVELOPMENT: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO
CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT

Climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk management (DRM) have
developed over time as separate disciplines and communities, often with distinct
institutions and policy frameworks, and, in some cases, with conflicting objectives.
And yet, an integrated approach would have political, practical and financial
advantages in the long run. For example, speed and low costs are important factors
for carrying out reconstruction efforts in the wake of a disaster, but the consideration
of risks from climate change could require different standards and/or changes in
planning processes to deliver cost-effective, long-term development outcomes.

The international community has placed increasing importance on the integration
of CCA and DRM and their mainstreaming into development, most recently through
the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage under the UNFCCC,
the SAMOA Pathway, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the
Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. The Sendai
Framework is focused on reducing the impacts of disasters (including those
related to climate change) through improved understanding and governance, and
increased investment and response. The SDGs include goals directly related to
resilience (under Goals 1111 and 1312)13 and are, more broadly, articulated around
the understanding that climate resilience cuts across all development objectives
and are interlinked. Achieving the SDGs will strengthen resilience, which, in turn, will
help achieve the Goals.14

Integrating CCA and DRM into development involves thinking holistically about
preparedness for extreme events, as well as adapting to the “new normal” of a
world with a changing climate. Risk management and better preparedness to
deal with climate and disaster impacts can substantially decrease the cost of
future disasters. Response, recovery and reconstruction after disasters can be
used to reduce vulnerabilities and promote CCA, through risk-resilient investment,
infrastructure upgrades and urban revitalization (“building back better”), land-use
management systems and ecosystem-based approaches. Resilience can be built
through a variety of strategies: enhancing preparedness; relocating critical facilities
and assets to safer areas; better use of data to inform planning and development
strategies; integrating disaster risk reduction measures into infrastructure
improvements; and strengthening governance structures that allow the integration
of climate and disaster risks.

All this has implications for financing structures. Short-term funding for disaster
response from humanitarian donors must be linked with long-term financial support
for resilience building and, in turn, must be mainstreamed into development
planning and financing. The integration of CCA and DRM is particularly critical to
prevent locking in future development and creating new vulnerabilities.

                                     II. THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING RESILIENCE TO NATURAL
                                     DISASTERS AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN SIDS


                                     This chapter discusses the intertwined set of economic, social and environmental
                                     vulnerabilities that constrain the development of SIDS. It shows that development
                                     challenges faced by SIDS are becoming more acute, as the impacts of natural
                                     disasters are increasing and are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. It also
                                     discusses the costs of coping with and recovering from natural disasters, and their
                                     impact on the development and growth trajectory of SIDS.

                                     SIDS are a heterogeneous group of countries and territories, with diverse
                                     characteristics. They exhibit large variations in terms of population size and
                                     densities, geographical spread and relative development progress, and include
                                     some of the world’s smallest, most remote and geographically-dispersed countries
                                     in the world: Kiribati, for example, consists of 33 coral atolls spread over 3.5 million
                                     square kilometres of ocean – an area larger than India. The Solomon Islands is
                                     also geographically splintered with 1,000 small islands and a population of half
                                     a million people dispersed across 90 inhabited islands. By contrast, countries
                                     in the Caribbean are closer to international markets and tend to have larger and
                                     more concentrated populations, with Haiti’s population exceeding 10 million. And
                                     while some SIDS are experiencing rapid population growth, others are facing large
                                     emigration. SIDS also present different economic structures: some are largely
                                     service-based, such as Cabo Verde, the Seychelles and the Maldives; others are
                                     natural resource-based, such as Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Timor-Leste; and still
                                     others, such as Comoros, Kiribati, Micronesia and Tuvalu, are relatively undiversified,
                                     with a high reliance on agriculture and fishing.

                                     At the same time, SIDS share unique economic, social and environmental
                                     challenges that severely constrain their development prospects. As a group,
                                     SIDS face a number of inter-connected and mutually-reinforcing economic,
                                     institutional and environmental vulnerabilities, making SIDS one of the most
                                     vulnerable group of countries and territories in the world. Economic vulnerabilities
                                     arise from their small domestic markets and narrow natural resource base, which
                                     results in undiversified economies, limited economies of scale and reduced
                                     scope for private sector development. These factors, along with their geographic
                                     isolation, can lead to a significant perceived investment risk, which greatly limits the
                                     attractiveness of SIDS for private investors and their access to private international
                                     finance. Remoteness from markets and shipping lanes is particularly severe amongst
                                     geographically isolated SIDS (mainly in the Pacific and along the West African coast),
                                     entailing high trade costs and reduced opportunities for penetrating global markets.
                                     With limited domestic revenues and borrowing opportunities, SIDS tend to have
                                     constrained fiscal space. They are also highly exposed to global economic shocks as
                                     well as to changes in global trade and financial markets, which often have amplified

                              Geographic dispersion and a limited number of skilled staff in SIDS create
                              unusual institutional vulnerabilities. The limited job markets in some SIDS and
                              challenges in retaining skilled staff translate into a relatively low number of qualified
                              staff working in key capacities, particularly procurement, financial management
                              and project management. This further constrains the ability of SIDS to manage
                              multiple funding sources. In addition, the extensive spatial dispersion of some island
                              groupings translates into high service provision costs, challenging the ability of
                              government to provide essential services and job opportunities to their populations
                              and creating unique institutional and social vulnerabilities.

that “the accumulated impacts of small
and medium disasters may be equivalent
to or exceed those of large disasters. Data
on many lesser events is not collected
systematically in Pacific Island countries
and is sometimes not collected at all”
and “In general, the occurrences of small
disease outbreaks, local flash floods and
land degradation are usually invisible
to the media and often to policymakers
as well. Increases in the frequency of
these lower intensity hazards have a large
impact on poverty.” UNISDR, UNDP

                                                             disproportionately large in SIDS. As illustrated in Figure 5, although across income
                                                             groups SIDS reported the lowest number of people affected by natural disasters in
                                                             absolute terms between 2000 and 2015, SIDS, along with low-income countries21,
                                                             had the largest share of their populations affected (42% for SIDS and 43% for
                                                             low-income countries). Similarly, while the monetary value of damage from natural
                                                             disasters is much larger in advanced economies due to the accumulation of valuable
                                                             assets, the relative damage in SIDS is much greater as a percentage of national
                                                             output. SIDS account for two-thirds of the countries in the world that suffer the
                                                             highest relative losses due to natural disasters on an annual basis – between 1 to 9%

                                            Current development trends are increasing SIDS vulnerability to natural
                                            disasters. As in other developing countries, rapid urbanization, population
                                            growth and climate change are increasing the exposure of SIDS to disaster risk.22
                                            Pollution and ecosystem degradation, and the extraction of coastal aggregates for
                                            construction, are also compromising natural buffers, leaving the population and
                                            assets increasingly exposed. Without integrating resilience into development policies
                                            and environmental conservation, these trends will continue to increase the exposure
                                            and vulnerability of SIDS to natural disasters and climate change.

                                            Increased environmental risks due to the impacts of climate change pose
                                            additional challenges to the economic growth and sustainable development
                                            of SIDS. While natural disasters – storms, hurricanes, cyclones, etc. – have been
                                            a feature of life on islands in the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Indian Oceans for
                                            centuries, the effects of climate change are exacerbating their intensity. In addition,
                                            climate change is creating a host of new developmental challenges for SIDS. Rising

The costs of recovering from increased natural disasters take a toll on the
growth trajectory of SIDS. Natural disasters and climate variability severely affect
key economic sectors in SIDS – including agriculture, fisheries and tourism – leading
to lower economic growth and affecting the most vulnerable populations. The costs
of coping with, and recovering from, natural disasters are comparatively higher
in SIDS given their reliance on imported materials and the challenging logistics of
reaching remote and spatially dispersed populations. Financing urgent humanitarian
responses to frequent disasters often implies high recovery and reconstruction costs
and can pre-empt investments that lessen the toll of future disasters. With limited
domestic revenue sources, SIDS governments often need to divert scarce public
resources from essential social and economic development investments to address
disaster-related needs, compromising the pace and scope of future growth and
development, and knowing that shortfalls financed through debt may ultimately “tax”
future generations. Often, funds for disaster response are diverted at the expense of
the operation and maintenance of public infrastructure (an item typically not covered
by donor contributions), creating a vicious cycle of higher vulnerability to future
disasters, which is compounded by the high levels of indebtedness in many SIDS.

The next chapter explores how financing is provided to address these challenges.

                                            III. THE COMPLEX LANDSCAPE OF CLIMATE AND DISASTER
                                            RESILIENCE FINANCING


                                            This chapter discusses the vast array of sources and mechanisms available to finance
                                            climate and disaster resilience, with a focus on concessional resources. It examines
                                            the complex web of eligibility requirements and terms that SIDS must meet to access
                                            these resources, and highlights that while different mechanisms have evolved to meet
                                            different needs, greater clarity on their scope, benefits and limitations is necessary for
                                            their effective use.

                                            There is no “one stop shop” for climate and disaster resilience, but rather a
                                            complex global architecture of funds and providers. The responsibility, expertise
                                            and funding for climate and disaster resilience are scattered across a large number
                                            of actors.25 In terms of financing, a complex set of sources and windows dedicated
                                            to specific issues has emerged. Different sources can be identified specifically for
                                            climate and for DRM, with overlaps as well as gaps.

                                            Concessional finance sources include bilateral donors, various multilateral organisations
                                            and global funds established specifically to finance climate and/or disaster resilience,
                                            such as the Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF), the Adaptation Fund (AF), the
                                            Climate Investment Funds (CIF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF), among others.
                                            Each of these sources has its own priorities and approaches to allocating resources
                                            and a number of financing instruments to support resilience. With concessional
                                            finance to SIDS as a whole shrinking and many SIDS at risk of losing access to it as
                                            they graduate to a higher-income status, enhancing the effectiveness of the provision
                                            and use of concessional finance from this multiplicity of sources becomes a priority.

                                            Many bilateral donors extend ODA for climate and disaster resilience finance to SIDS
                                            in the form of concessional grants and loans, which are often provided on the basis
                                            of geographic proximity, historical and cultural ties, economic and trade linkages, and

                                            geopolitical interests. ODA eligibility,26 which is mainly based on income criteria, can
                                            play a role in determining donors’ allocations to SIDS, but is not binding and some

III. The Complex Landscape of Climate and Disaster Resilience Financing




                                            In addition, some adjustments in MDB allocation models have benefitted SIDS,
                                            for example: i) increasing minimum base allocations in favour of countries with
                                            small populations (IDA, African Development Fund and the International Fund for
                                            Agricultural Development); and ii) including an assessment of economic vulnerability
                                            (Caribbean Development Bank).

                                            Overall, with eligibility to several multilateral and bilateral sources of financing relying
                                            critically on per capita classification, SIDS have expressed the need for a coordinated
                                            effort by development partners to review the rules governing access to concessional
                                            finance and to include vulnerability aspects in funding eligibility criteria.29 A key
                                            difficulty is that vulnerability of people and countries is determined by multiple factors
                                            (location, income, assets, access to resources, and institutional and legal systems,
                                            among others), yielding different country classifications and rankings depending
                                            on the sub-set used.30 While some of the past solutions – such as the small island
                                            economies exception – help to address these concerns, they remain largely arbitrary.
                                            Given the extent and increasing climate-related impacts as well as the development
                                            deficit in many SIDS, the international community should make greater efforts to
                                            discuss how to ensure that SIDS are able to access the finance they need at the
                                            terms and conditions most suited to their specific circumstances.

                                            Increasingly, bilateral and multilateral partners are exploring the use of innovative
                                            instruments to deploy concessional finance more effectively, leverage additional
                                            resources, and reduce risks and vulnerabilities. In 2015, the Government of the
                                            Seychelles and its Paris Club creditors – with support from the Nature Conservancy

                                         related triggers, deferred repayment loans, etc.), the ability of individual countries
                                         to access them is limited by their high-risk profile – which often makes the cost of
                                         such mechanisms prohibitive – and, in some cases, by weak technical capacities
                                         to access and manage them. InsuResilience35, established under the German G7
                                         presidency in 2015, represents a promising initiative to overcome limitations to more
                                         broadly deploy climate risk insurances.

                                         Different mechanisms are designed to meet different ex ante and ex post
                                         financing needs. Multilateral organisations offer various financing mechanisms that
                                         serve different needs at different times, from ex post Balance of Payments support
                                         from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and fast-disbursing liquidity (from the
                                         CCRIF or PCRAFI) to investment in longer-term resilience (IDA and global climate and
                                         disaster funds).

                                         The table below illustrates the plethora of financing windows using the example of
                                         the Bretton Woods institutions and some of the larger global climate and disaster
                                         funds for which the World Bank Group (WBG) currently acts as a trustee. In addition,
                                         the WBG36 and the IMF offer several modalities for ex ante and ex post concessional
                                         and non-concessional financing for natural disaster resilience, several of which have
                                         been specifically designed or adapted for use by SIDS.

                                         Ex ante, core development finance vehicles, such as IDA, can finance technical
                                         assistance, investment projects, budget support operations, results-based financing
                                         and guarantees, including in support of climate and disaster resilience objectives.
                                         Under the current IDA cycle, all operations are required to screen for climate and
                                         disaster risk and include resilience measures if such risk is identified. The climate-
                                         screening requirement will also apply to all International Bank for Reconstruction and
                                         Development (IBRD) operations as of January 1, 2017.

                                         Global climate and disaster funds that also target ex ante resilience include the
                                         Adaptation Fund (AF), the LDCF, the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), the

                                            triggered for up to 15 years upon declaration of emergency, subject to maintenance
                                            of a satisfactory national DRM programme. These instruments have yet to be widely
                                            used by SIDS, but the Seychelles approved a first CAT-DDO in 2014.

                                            The IMF can play a critical role in supporting countries’ Balance of Payments in the
                                            immediate aftermath of a natural disaster. Some mechanisms are designed to be in
                                            place ex post, while others can involve an augmentation of existing arrangements.
                                            In addition to standard IMF windows, Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT)
                                            windows are available to an approved list of developing member countries (including
                                            some non-low-income SIDS, while the new Catastrophe Containment and Relief
                                            Trust can provide debt relief to a more restricted group of countries.

                                            Overall, clarity on the coverage and scope of these mechanisms is critical. For
                                            example, risk pooling insurance mechanisms, such as PCRAFI and CCRIF, have
                                            enabled some Pacific and Caribbean SIDS to cover a portion of their financial
                                            exposure to high-impact natural disasters. These parametric mechanisms emphasise
                                            speed, as payouts are linked to pre-agreed disaster indicators rather than actual
                                            assessed losses. In planning their overall financial preparedness for disasters,
                                            member and partner countries must consider that this represents a useful risk
                                            management component, rather than complete risk transfer to private markets.

                                            The broader work streams around these mechanisms have produced valuable
                                            public goods in the form of better data and models on asset exposures and
                                            hazards. In the Pacific, these technical tools have included hazard models, an asset
                                            exposure database and probabilistic catastrophe models. In the Caribbean, country
                                            disaster risk profiles have recently been completed for Belize, Grenada, Jamaica
                                            and Saint Lucia.37 In many countries, this was the first time such technical work
                                            was implemented.

Box 2: THE COMPLEXITY OF CLIMATE AND DISASTER RESILIENCE:
THE EXAMPLE OF SAINT LUCIA

The complexity and potential complementarities of climate and disaster financing
can be illustrated through the example of Saint Lucia and the response to the
devastating 2010 hurricane. Saint Lucia received zero interest loans from the
IMF under the Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance (a precursor to today’s
Rapid Financing Instrument) and Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). While Saint Lucia
substantially exceeded the RCF’s income eligibility threshold, it was able to
access the Facility due to the microstates exception. These concessional loans
complemented grant financing from bilateral donors, including Australia, Japan
and the United Kingdom (UK). Saint Lucia also received a payout from the CCRIF,
providing liquidity for urgent rebuilding needs. While IMF assistance was not large
in absolute terms, the IMF’s involvement was viewed as instrumental in satisfying
bilateral donors and other international financial institutions regarding Saint
Lucia’s ability to take on additional loans. In 2014, larger financing commitments
were made to Saint Lucia by multilateral organisations for climate and disaster
resilience: concessional loans from IDA/World Bank (USD 40 million); grants and
concessional loans from the PPCR (USD 27 million); and a smaller grant from the
GEF (USD 0.13 million).

III. The Complex Landscape of Climate and Disaster Resilience Financing




                                            The eligibility and terms of these funds are, however, complex and evolving.
                                            The diversity of eligibility criteria can be seen in Table 2 below. Different funding
                                            instruments and windows present a complex web of eligibilities, with SIDS capacity
                                            constraints presenting challenges to access windows and to design and implement
                                            coherent financing approaches.38

                                            WBG members’ eligibility to access IDA resources is determined using income
                                            thresholds and a combination of poverty measures and assessments of
                                            creditworthiness and risk of debt distress. Of the 35 ODA-eligible SIDS considered in
                                            this report, 21 are IDA-eligible,39 of which 14 receive financing under the IDA’s small
                                            island economy exception.40 This exception – given to small islands (with populations
                                            of less than 1.5 million) facing significant vulnerabilities due to size and geography,
                                            and with limited credit-worthiness and financing options – allows beneficiary SIDS
                                            to access IDA resources even though some have exceeded the per capita IDA
                                            operational cut-off more than five-fold.

                                            IMF access to concessional terms is determined by the WB income threshold,
                                            as well as the (in)ability to access international financial markets on a durable
                                            and substantial basis. The IMF applies both a small states41 and a microstates
                                            exception to accessing PRGT windows, along with a five-year graduation process
                                            and additional exceptions based on serious short-term vulnerabilities and/or
                                            countries’ inability to access financial markets. In contrast, only the small states
                                            exception is applied to the IMF’s new Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust,
                                            and those countries already on the path to graduation from PRGT are ineligible.

                                            The global climate and disaster funds, meanwhile, present their own complex
                                            eligibility requirements, ranging from eligibility for nearly all SIDS (AF, GEF Trust

applies to small states with a population
below 1.5 million and a per capita
income below twice the IDA cut-off.

  The Cook Islands, Cuba, Monserrat and Niue are ineligible for most windows
since they are not World Bank or IMF members. However, the Cook Islands and
Niue may, nevertheless, be able to access some activities through New Zealand, while
Montserrat may do so through the United Kingdom. For example, the Cook Islands
accessed (on a fully reimbursable basis) PCRAFI activities through New Zealand’s
WBG membership.
43
  Of the 21 SIDS accessing IDA funds, 14 benefit from the small island economy
exception, allowing them to access IDA resources even though they exceed the
normal cut-off for IDA eligibility (based on gross national income per capita below
an established threshold and updated annually to USD 1,215 in fiscal year 2016),
because they lack the creditworthiness needed to borrow from the IBRD.

                                           RESILIENCE TO SIDS


                                           This chapter focuses on quantifying the nature and scope of concessional financing
                                           committed to SIDS in support of climate and disaster resilience. In line with OECD/
                                           DAC statistics, concessional finance is defined as grants and concessional loans
                                           – from both bilateral providers and multilateral providers – that meet the ODA
                                           definition.49 The chapter first analyses the aggregate trends in concessional finance
                                           for climate and disaster resilience to SIDS, and then focuses on the main trends and
                                           features of this assistance from the perspective of donors and SIDS recipients.

                                           The statistical analysis in this section and in the remainder of the report represents
                                           a pioneering attempt to provide a comprehensive and accurate quantification of
                                           concessional flows in support of climate and disaster resilience to SIDS. With no

                                           considered in this report builds on climate finance data (e.g., as measured through
                                           climate markers50 and the 2014 Joint Report on MDBs’ Climate Finance51) and
                                           disaster preparedness data52 to develop an ad hoc dataset, covering the period

                                             Bilateral partners provide the bulk of concessional finance for climate and
                                             disaster resilience, but funding from the multilateral system is accelerating
                                             rapidly. Bilateral partners provided about 71% (USD 2.2 billion out of USD 3.13
                                             million) of concessional financing for climate and disaster resilience between 2011
                                             and 2014, an average of USD 556 million per year. Despite a decline in 2014 (-9%),
                                             bilateral partners still provided larger volumes than multilateral organisations in each
                                             of the three regions, particularly to SIDS in the Africa, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean
                                             and South China (AIMS)54 region (89%). Multilateral organisations, however, have
                                             significantly increased their support for climate and disaster resilience to SIDS by
                                             nearly 96% between 2011 and 2014, from USD 226 million to USD 443 million
                                             per year. This increase was partly due to significant growth in funding from global
                                             climate funds, including the GEF, the CIF and the AF, which more than doubled
                                             their financing to SIDS between 2011 and 2014, reaching 28 out of the 35 SIDS
                                             considered in this study. However, the bulk of this increase stemmed from larger
                                             concessional loans extended by MDBs to a select number of countries, mainly in

                          Climate and disaster resilience financing was mostly provided in the form of
                          grants, but recent growth was largely due to increases in concessional loans.
                          Grants made up a considerable portion of the concessional finance for resilience
                          during the period 2011-14 (73%), constituting the bulk of financing from bilateral
                          providers (76%) and nearly all of the funding from global climate funds (the GEF,
                          AF and CIF) (91%). However, an increase in the number of grants from these funds
                          during the same period was offset by a decline in grants from large bilateral providers,
                          such as Australia, the UK and the US. At the same time, concessional loans increased
                          substantially from USD 69 million in 2011 (11%) to USD 415 million in 2014 (41%).
                          While over the whole period loans were predominantly provided by France (USD
                          330 million) and Japan (USD 207 million), recent growth is partly due to an increased
                          allocation of concessional loans by MDBs, particularly IDA/World Bank (USD 171
                          million) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (USD 109 million).

                                             Funding to LDCs remained stable, while concessional finance rose significantly
                                             in Upper Middle-Income SIDS. The combination of stagnating grant levels and
                                             growth in concessional lending has shifted overall financing volumes across SIDS
                                             towards UMICs. While SIDS that are also LDCs received similar volumes in 2011
                                             (USD 233 million) when compared to 2014 (USD 245 million), mostly as grants, their
                                             share of overall concessional financing for resilience declined from 37% in 2011 to
                                             24% in 2014. At the same time, Upper Middle-Income SIDS were able to access
                                             new funding sources, mostly as concessional loans, and their share of concessional
                                             financing reached 51% in 2014, up from 33% in 2011. However, not all Upper Middle-
                                             Income SIDS benefitted from increases in concessional loans in 2013 and 2014; the
                                             Dominican Republic and Saint Lucia accounted for nearly 75% of this increase due
                                             to large investments in climate and disaster resilience, combining IDA/World Bank
                                             and PPCR resources, while the remaining 25% was split between five other Upper
                                             Middle-Income SIDS.

                                               While concessional finance for resilience covers a range of sectors, it
                                               is dominated by investments in resilient infrastructure. Fostering resilient
                                               development requires action in almost all sectors, including agriculture, water,

                                              climate and disaster resilience in the long run – accounted for only 2% of climate and
                                              disaster resilience finance to SIDS in 2011-14 (USD 51 million).56 The GEF and the AF
                                              provided the bulk of this funding (together accounting for 73%), while Germany was
                                              the largest bilateral provider, accounting for 23% of these investments.

                                              Non-concessional lending for climate and disaster resilience to SIDS increased,
                                              particularly for UMICs. Three MDBs, namely the ADB, the Inter-American
                                              Development Bank and the World Bank, increased their non-concessional lending to
                                              SIDS, which rose from an annual average of USD 37.1 million in 2011-12 to more than
                                              three times as much in 2013-14 at USD 123.3 million. However, these resources were
                                              targeted to a limited number of countries: three in 2011-12 and five in 2013-14, or six
                                              different countries over the entire 2011-14 period. With the exception of Timor-Leste
                                              and PNG, all other recipients of non-concessional finance are classified as UMICs. Fiji
                                              was the top recipient (USD 99.4 million, or USD 24.8 on average per year), while the
                                              Seychelles received the least amount (USD 7.0 million, or USD 1.8 million on average
                                              per year), and average annual funding ranged between USD 16.6 million and USD 8.3
                                              million for the others.



                                              B. Bilateral providers of climate and disaster resilience finance

                                              A few providers accounted for the bulk of bilateral financing. While 26 bilateral
                                              providers extended financing to SIDS for climate and disaster resilience in the 2011-
                                              14 period, the top ten providers accounted for 95% of financing and the top five
                                              for 77%, or USD 1.7 billion. Australia was the largest provider, followed by the EU,
                                              France, Japan, the US, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Norway and Spain
                                              (see Figure 12).

                                              Climate and disaster resilience received relatively low prioritisation in the
                                              ODA portfolios of some of the largest providers. Although development partners
                                              recognise the need for climate and disaster-resilient ODA investments,57 on average
                                              only 13% of their ODA commitments supported these objectives. In the case of some

helping farmers access forecasts and early warnings to inform their decision making,
as well as smaller infrastructure projects like the construction of water reservoirs and
lagoons to help farmers cope with drought. Among the providers offering support on a
programmatic basis, the EU focused on disaster prevention and preparedness policy
initiatives, budget support for national planning and projects, and investments in the
water and energy sectors. Australia’s climate and disaster resilience activities were
concentrated mostly on meteorological and climate forecasting capacity, adaptation
planning, awareness raising, and water, sanitation and transport projects in the Pacific.

Financing through multilateral institutions and regional initiatives represents an
important channel for bilateral donors. Of total resilience financing, 21% of bilateral
flows (USD 467 million, or USD 117 million per year on average) was channelled
through multilateral organisations, which has enabled bilateral partners to enhance
these organisations’ support in regions of interest, for example for Australia and New

                                             as Norway, Denmark, Canada and Sweden – channelled funding primarily through
                                             multilateral organisations (96%, 100%, 96% and 76%, respectively). Without a
                                             significant field presence in the Caribbean and AIMS regions, Australia channelled
                                             support to those regions mainly through earmarked funds. Even where bilateral
                                             providers have a field presence, funding through multilateral organisations was seen
                                             as a way to build strong partnerships. In Vanuatu (Australia’s fourth largest recipient
                                             of climate and disaster financing for the period 2011-2014), 73% of Australia’s
                                             funding was channelled through the IBRD, the UN Development Programme (UNDP)
                                             and other multilateral partners. In Guyana, the EU’s largest recipient of climate
                                             and disaster financing among SIDS, 67% of EU financing was earmarked through
                                             multilateral organisations. In addition, bilateral providers finance regional institutions
                                             and initiatives, and channelled USD 274 million through regional approaches in the
                                             Pacific region alone for the period 2011-14.61 These institutions and initiatives are
                                             perceived by some donors as more cost-effective in reaching SIDS and fostering an
                                             exchange of experiences and technology transfer (See Box 3).

                                             Engaging with the private sector to leverage resilience financing is an
                                             increasing priority for providers, but remains a challenge in practice. Over the
                                             past two decades, instruments and mechanisms that support climate and disaster

Box 3: RELEVANCE OF REGIONAL APPROACHES FOR SUPPORTING CLIMATE AND
DISASTER RESILIENCE IN SIDS

For bilateral and multilateral providers, maintaining an individual field presence and
country programmes in SIDS can prove expensive, given the high costs of doing business
and the relatively small programme size. In addition, many of SIDS vulnerabilities are
common to several of these countries rather than strictly national in character. Therefore,
some donors view regional approaches as effective, particularly in terms of achieving
economies of scale and for sharing knowledge and technology.

In light of this, several providers did mention the importance of addressing challenges
at the regional level.63 This is borne out by the figures: over the period 2011-14, bilateral
providers committed USD 273 million through regional approaches in the Pacific region
alone64 (equivalent to 12% of bilateral concessional finance in support of climate and
disaster risk)

In the Caribbean and the Pacific, well-developed regional institutions have received
sustained support from donors. In the Pacific, these include the Pacific Islands Forum
Secretariat (PIFS), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), the Secretariat of the
Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and the Melanesian Spearhead Group.
These regional organisations work on improving SIDS advisory services and training
opportunities on climate change, and advise governments on policies and strategies
that integrate risk and disaster preparedness. In the Caribbean, providers support the
Caribbean Community and Common Market and the Caribbean Community Climate
Change Centre in the management of coastal resources and in adapting farmland and
forest management to the impacts of climate change. Some providers are also supporting
regional risk pooling schemes, for example the CCRIF and the PCRAFI, which allow SIDS
to build a viable offering to private insurers by pooling and, thus, diversifying risk.

However, regional initiatives have not always been the answer. Striking a balance between
country-level and regional approaches and ensuring that regional initiatives are responsive
to the priorities and specific circumstances of each country are important. Some bilateral
providers reported65 that, in areas where resources or issues are primarily national,
regional initiatives can underplay national differences and may complicate local-level
processes. For such areas, multi-country initiatives that give greater attention to national
context and direction in design and delivery can be more appropriate, while still allowing
economies of scale, delivery efficiency, and sharing of lessons and expertise. These
concerns seem to be shared by multilateral providers. Since 2010, for example, the World
Bank has developed country-specific strategic plans in a number of SIDS, including
the Federated States of Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands,
Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Fiji, with other Pacific Island countries to follow.66 The World
Bank has also assisted Eastern Caribbean countries to implement national-level disaster
vulnerability programmes, while encouraging regional sharing of experiences. Recently,
the World Bank established the SISRI67 at the global level, to maximise intra-country
learning and to help SIDS access scaled-up financing. In order to achieve a greater field
presence in individual SIDS, the ADB and the World Bank also created joint liaison officer
roles in Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu.

Given the different comparative advantages of national and regional activities, greater
efforts should be taken to identify and differentiate between activities that can be
effectively carried out at the regional level, those that need to be financed at the national
level and those that require complementary action at both levels.

                                                    C. Multilateral providers of climate and disaster resilience finance

                                                    While a small number of multilateral institutions have provided concessional
                                                    support for resilience to SIDS, their support increased over the 2011-2014
                                                    period. During this timeframe, eight multilateral institutions were responsible for USD
                                                    910 million in concessional support to SIDS for climate and disaster resilience, or 29%
                                                    of total support (an average of USD 228 million per year). The bulk of this funding
                                                    (39%) came from the World Bank (USD 88 million per year), the GEF (USD 46 million
                                                    per year), the ADB (USD 36 million per year) and the CIF (USD 29 million per year).

                                                    In practice, multilateral institutions channel considerably more funds to SIDS
                                                    than their original contributions might indicate, since they combine their own
                                                    funds with bilateral contributions. Thus, while multilateral institutions contributed
                                                    29% of total resilience funding, they in actuality channelled close to 44% (USD 1.38
                                                    billion) of total resilience funding in SIDS during the 2011-2014 period, with the World
                                                    Bank representing the largest single channel (a total of USD 413 million).

MDBs prioritised large investments in fewer countries, with a focus on
infrastructure development and national initiatives. MDB concessional financing
showed large average commitments and significant variation year to year, perhaps
reflecting the resources needed to support these operations and their inherently
“lumpy” commitment profile. The ADB allocated more than 76% of its total resilience
financing (USD 111 million) to transportation infrastructure, while the World Bank
prioritised infrastructure (43%) and strengthened both national and regional resilience
strategies (36%).

Global climate funds play an increasingly important role in support of climate
and disaster resilience. Although they comprise about 12% of all concessional
support provided to SIDS (a total of USD 374 million, or an annual average of USD
93.5 million) during the period 2011-2014, global climate funds played a significant
and consistent role, with finance varying minimally year to year. The GEF provided
nearly USD 46.2 million, the CIF USD 29.3 million and the AF USD 18 million. In
addition to extending concessional support, these funds and partners provided
extensive technical knowledge and experience in project design and implementation.
For example, the PPCR under the CIF was developed specifically to pilot resilience
activities and includes a knowledge and learning component.

Other multilateral organisations provided additional resources for resilience to SIDS,
with nearly USD 100 million a year provided by EU institutions, followed by UNDP
(USD 1.4 million per year), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO),
the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (all under
USD 250,000 per year).



D. Recipients of climate and disaster resilience finance

Geographically, Pacific SIDS received the largest volume of resilience financing
in the 2011-14 period, but funding to SIDS in the Caribbean increased sharply
from USD 177 million in 2011 to more than USD 644 million. Pacific SIDS
received almost half of all funding for climate and disaster resilience provided
by development partners in 2011-2014 (an average of USD 370 per year), while
Caribbean SIDS received 37% (USD 291 per year) and AIMS SIDS 16% (USD 122
per year). While both bilateral and multilateral providers focused roughly half of their

                                             climate and disaster resilience financing on SIDS in the Pacific region (45% and 52%,
                                             respectively), bilateral providers allocated relatively more to SIDS in the AIMS region
                                             (20%, compared to 6% for multilateral providers). Funding to SIDS in the Caribbean
                                             region increased significantly in 2014, largely because of significant allocations to the
                                             Dominican Republic, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

                                             Striking differences in access to concessional finance for climate and disaster
                                             resilience exist across individual SIDS. Of the 35 SIDS included in this study, Haiti
                                             was consistently the top recipient for the period 2011-14, receiving a total of USD 282
                                             million for climate and disaster resilience, or an average of USD 70.5 million per year.
                                             Since 2011, Haiti alone has accounted for 10% of all country-specific financing to
                                             SIDS for climate and disaster resilience. While the 2010 earthquake in Haiti produced

                                          large reconstruction financing needs, it also heightened awareness across the
                                          international community of the importance of strengthening Haiti’s national capacity
                                          to prevent and manage the risk of similar natural disasters in the future. An additional
                                          three SIDS (Cabo Verde, the Dominican Republic and Timor-Leste) each received
                                          comparable amounts of financing for climate and disaster resilience to that provided
                                          to Haiti: between USD 65.5 million and USD 55.5 million on average per year. Half of
                                          the SIDS considered in this study received considerably less, below USD 12.5 million
                                          annually over the 2011-14 period.

                                          The smallest nations tend to receive the highest per capita annual financing
                                          allocations. Per capita figures are a more accurate comparator amongst vastly
                                          different population sizes (Haiti and the Dominican Republic have more than 10
                                          million inhabitants, whereas microstates, such as Niue, Tuvalu, Cook Islands and
                                          Nauru, have less than 15,000 inhabitants each68). In some SIDS, however, per
                                          capita figures are largely affected by the high unit costs of providing development
                                          assistance to small, remote and dispersed populations of microstates69 (the so-called
                                          ‘small country bias’), resulting into greater relative funding to most microstates.70 In
                                          per capita terms, Niue, the SIDS with the smallest population (with around 1,190
                                          inhabitants), received the largest relative amounts of funding (USD 4,909 per capita
                                          per year, on average, during the 2011-14 period). Other microstates, such as Tuvalu
                                          and Cook Islands, received USD 1,300 and USD 345 per capita per year compared
                                          to an average of USD 13.6 per capita per year for all SIDS for the same period (Figure
                                          16). Niue and Montserrat are not fully independent nations as they retain a special
                                          constitutional relationship with advanced economies (New Zealand and the UK,
                                          respectively), which may also influence these allocations.

                                          Overall, geographic and income patterns mask the disproportionate weight of
                                          a few countries and a few large ad hoc and isolated commitments. While most
                                          SIDS with LDC status received fairly consistent funding over time, several Upper
                                          and Lower Middle-Income SIDS received funding mainly through large one-off
                                          commitments. For example, more than 30% of all concessional funding to Lower
                                          Middle-Income SIDS was directed to a single country – Cabo Verde – and mainly
                                          to a single Japanese-supported project for improving the resilience of the water
                                          supply system.

                                          Some countries received financing for their climate and disaster resilience
                                          almost exclusively from bilateral providers. Eleven SIDS received 90% or more of
                                          their concessional financing from bilateral providers (see Figure 17), including both

                                           V. CHALLENGES IN ACCESSING EFFECTIVE FINANCING FOR
                                           CLIMATE AND DISASTER RESILIENCE


                                           The previous chapter showed that, while increasing, the proportion of development
                                           financing that integrates climate and disaster resilience remains relatively small. This
                                           chapter discusses the challenges that constrain SIDS in accessing more effective
                                           funding for climate and disaster resilient development, and highlights that climate
                                           and disaster resilience financing is largely fragmented and provided in ways not well
                                           tailored to the needs of SIDS. While some SIDS are taking steps to develop policies
                                           and institutional structures to guide resilience financing where it is most needed, much
                                           can be done to overcome the institutional constraints and inefficiencies caused in
                                           part by fragmented and sub-optimal international processes and funding sources.
                                           Development partners should also reflect on how they could apply, adapt and update
                                           international standards for development effectiveness to the context of SIDS.71

                                              Forum Leaders endorsed the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific:
                                              An Integrated Approach to Address Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management,
                                              2017-2030, the world’s first integrated regional framework to build resilience to
                                              climate change and disasters.78 This followed the recommendations of multiple past
                                              policy reviews, as well as numerous drafts of the Strategy for Resilient Development

                                              determined contributions (INDCs), national plans for contributing to the achievement
                                              of the global climate change goals.81 Several SIDS have capitalised on these plans
                                              to articulate the need to integrate disaster risk management and climate change

                                             Overall, synergies between CCA and DRM (and their mainstreaming into development
                                             planning) have not yet been sufficiently realised. Pressing needs in other areas (e.g.,
                                             infrastructure, education, health, etc.) and limited human and financial resources
                                             represent major obstacles in this respect. The estimated relatively high net social
                                             returns on capital across the Pacific SIDS (ranging between 3.2% of Palau to
                                             12.4% of Solomon Islands) over the prevailing interest rate83 points to the continued
                                             importance of core investments in economic and social development and a high
                                             opportunity cost for fiscal buffers to respond to shocks, such as natural disasters.84
                                             However, investments in resilience and in core development are not necessarily
                                             mutually exclusive, competing expenditures. Integrating CCA and DRM more
                                             comprehensively into development planning and policies can help guide future
                                             development in ways that do not exacerbate vulnerability. In this regard, countries,
                                             such as Belize and Samoa, have been at the forefront of risk-informed development
                                             planning, with other countries (Jamaica, São Tomé and Príncipe, the Seychelles and
                                             Saint Lucia) also making progress.85

                                             Identifying the risks and probability of natural disasters is constrained by limited
                                             national capacities. Developing sound climate and disaster resilience strategies
                                             crucially hinges on the availability of data on the risks of natural disasters and

                                              activities in budgetary allocations. Establishing a better climate and disaster resilience
                                              budget monitoring system could, therefore, promote coordination among ministries
                                              and lead to better assessments concerning the actual resources deployed for
                                              resilience and closing the funding gaps. For example, although the Cook Islands lacks
                                              a thorough mechanism for tracking resilience spending, introducing a climate change
                                              marker for infrastructure projects has proved helpful in improving its ability to monitor
                                              government and donor spending.91 Samoa has also introduced a single coordination
                                              unit under the Ministry of Finance to review new funding proposals and ensure they
                                              are integrated into the budget. The Ministry of Planning and Territorial Development
                                              of São Tomé and Príncipe, although further behind, is also developing a system to
                                              match incoming donor financing with national priorities and needs.

                                              Fragmented institutional settings – at both global and national levels – also
                                              constrain the ability of SIDS to access and channel resources more efficiently.
                                              International processes and arrangements are not yet conducive to a financing flow
                                              that promotes climate and disaster risk-informed development in SIDS. Historical
                                              processes under the UNFCCC and UNISDR have largely operated through separate
                                              country focal points and funding flows, a challenge further exacerbated by the
                                              existence of multiple focal points amongst the various global climate funds.

Box 4: FIJI’S LEADERSHIP ROLE IN GEARING NATIONAL SYSTEMS TOWARD
FOSTERING CLIMATE AND DISASTER RESILIENCE

Among SIDS, Fiji provides a positive example of proactively creating and refining
policies, institutions and budgetary systems with a view to mobilise resources
toward climate change and DRM activities. In 2014, Fiji convened the National
Platform for Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change, which was the first
occasion when the DRM and CCA communities came together under the same
platform. This meeting was the starting point for the development, in Fiji, of a
National Strategic Plan for integrating DRM and climate change, which will include
actions, such as investing in improving early warning systems, dredging river
mouths, constructing inland retention dams and building cyclone-proof homes
in the most affected areas. It will also include rehabilitation plans focused on the
principle of “building back better” especially for rural housing and infrastructure
related to roads, water and energy.92

                                              of donors and often depend on a single donor. However, they also receive relatively
                                              small amounts of funding from various other sources. This combination makes SIDS
                                              extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in external finance, while also burdening their
                                              limited administrative capacity, as highlighted below.

                                              Reliance on a handful of donors exacerbates SIDS financial fragility. Many
                                              SIDS rely on a few providers for the external flows in support of climate and disaster
                                              resilience. In the 2011-14 period, five providers accounted for 61% of these flows:
                                              Australia (16%), EU institutions (13%), the World Bank and the ADB (11% each), and
                                              France (10%). The AIMS region is the most reliant on a limited number of providers,
                                              with the top five providers accounting for 83% of total funding during the 2011-2014
                                              period (Japan, France, the US, the GEF and the AF).

                                              Dependence on a single provider for the bulk of financing is widespread. Many
                                              individual SIDS depend on just one provider for most of the concessional financing
                                              they receive for resilience. For 14 of the 35 SIDS considered in this study, the top
                                              provider accounted for over 50% of climate and disaster resilience financing from
                                              2011-14. Furthermore, reliance on the top provider has been increasing over time,
                                              with countries showing greater reliance in 2013-14 than in 2011-12. While this trend
                                              applies to all regions, dependence on the top provider is slightly higher in the AIMS
                                              and Caribbean regions. In general, UMICs in the Caribbean region are the most reliant
                                              on a single donor for resilience funding, most likely due to their limited access to
                                              concessional resources (primarily relying on funding from France, IDA, Norway and
                                              the GEF). The Pacific SIDS rely heavily on Australia, IDA/World Bank and the ADB.
                                              This situation can make them overly reliant on the shifting priorities of the dominant
                                              donor(s) and could give the donor(s) undue influence over their development agendas.

                                              The remaining climate and disaster resilience funding is highly fragmented.
                                              Despite the fact that the bulk of concessional finance for resilience is provided by
                                              one or a few development partners, and sometimes accounted for by just one or a
                                              few projects, the remaining small amounts of funding are splintered across a myriad
                                              of small projects financed by multiple sources. This is a major issue for most SIDS,
                                              burdening already stretched capacities. From 2011-14, 26 bilateral providers, four
                                              development banks and about four multilateral organizations provided concessional
                                              resources for resilience to SIDS. However, many development partners only provided
                                              small amounts: in 2011-14, nearly 70% of donors collectively provided less than 10%
                                              of all aid received by SIDS for resilience; and more than half of providers collectively
                                              extended less than 2% of aid.

                                            The allocation choices of development partners actively contribute to
                                            fragmentation of climate financing in SIDS. Several development partners
                                            concentrate the majority of their resilience funding in one or two countries, but the
                                            remaining resources are spread across a large number of SIDS. For example, one
                                            single project in Cabo Verde represented nearly 50% (USD 158 million) of all resilience
                                            funding provided to SIDS by Japan between 2011-14, with the remaining USD 166
                                            million was spread across 30 SIDS. Of these 30 SIDS, 17 received less than USD
                                            800,000 each over this period, collectively accounting for less than 1% of Japan’s
                                            climate and disaster resilience financing to SIDS.93

                                            Multilateral organisations generally spread their climate financing less thinly
                                            than bilateral providers. Most MDBs allocated funding for resilience through
                                            a smaller number of larger projects, which is partly due to the priority many
                                            development banks place on infrastructure development and regional initiatives.
                                            However, a number of multilateral institutions contributed to the high fragmentation in
                                            SIDS – namely UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, and FAO – which together provided less than
                                            USD 7 million in aid to more than 27 SIDS.

                                            Climate financing is spread across a multitude of projects that are difficult to
                                            manage given SIDS’ limited resource base and significant capacity constraints.
                                            During the period 2011-14, climate and disaster resilience in SIDS was financed
                                            through 1,715 projects. SIDS with the largest number of projects were managing
                                            more than 34 resilience projects in a given year. Even microstates, countries with a
                                            population of less than 200,000, had to manage large numbers of projects: Samoa,
                                            75 projects; Tonga, 52; and Kiribati, 48.

                                            The proliferation of operations supporting resilience also means high
                                            transaction costs of climate support. During the period 2011-14, SIDS managed
                                            2,305 transactions for financing climate and disaster resilience alone, an average of
                                            66 transactions per country in a four-year time frame. This figure is particularly high
                                            if considering that climate and disaster resilience covers 14% of all the concessional
                                            finance that SIDS access and that overall transactions per country are, therefore,
                                            likely to entail a much larger number. This also raises concerns given that emerging
                                            evidence suggests that transaction costs for development activities could be 4.7
                                            times higher in SIDS than in other developing countries.94




93
  Even when contributions to
multilateral projects are deducted (i.e.,
earmarked funding), the EU, Germany,
Japan, France and the US all extend
small amounts of climate and disaster
funding to a large number of SIDS,
with 60% of their recipients receiving
between 2% and 7% of their financing.

Over half of resilience projects in SIDS amount to less than USD 200,000 each;
yet, collectively they make up 2% of total resources. A few large projects, mostly
directed to UMICs, account for the bulk of resilience funding to SIDS. However, for
the most part, resilience projects are small: below USD 200,000 (55% of projects)
and below USD 1.5 million (80% of projects). The proliferation of small projects
is widespread across all SIDS, with most countries managing an average of 10
individual projects a year worth less than USD 1.5 million each. Even those that
received resilience support mainly through large projects must still deal with many
small projects. For example, about 81% (USD 203 million) of all the funding received
by the Dominican Republic for resilience between 2011-14 was for one French-
funded project, with the remaining USD 47 million in funding split among 127 other
resilience projects, 90% of which averaged USD 98,000 each. Similarly, almost 60%
of all climate and disaster financing to Cabo Verde was for one Japanese-funded
project, while the remaining climate financing was spread across 59 other projects,
90% of which had an average size of USD 200,000.

C. The cycle of limited capacities and low use of country systems

Public sector capacity in SIDS is often limited and most development financing for
resilience is not channelled through mechanisms that would help to build capacity.
While this may increase the speed of delivery and results in the short term, it limits the
long-term effectiveness and sustainability of development financing for resilience.

V. Challenges in Accessing Effective Financing for Climate and Disaster Resilience




                                              Budgetary and sector-wide support and other coordinated funding practices
                                              remain limited. Projects accounted for 80% of concessional finance for climate
                                              and disaster resilience SIDS received over the 2011-14 period. Multilateral partners
                                              provided support almost exclusively through projects (97%), while the share for
                                              bilateral partners was 73%. Ascertaining the extent to which projects were designed
                                              through a coordinated approach is difficult, as is whether they responded to the
                                              needs identified in comprehensive and nationally-owned frameworks.

                                              Overall, 8% of funding (USD 239 million) was provided as sectoral budget
                                              support in 11 of the 35 SIDS, including Cabo Verde, Cook Islands, the Dominican
                                              Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste,
                                              Tonga and Vanuatu.

                                              Five providers extended sectoral budget support for climate and disaster resilience
                                              to more than one SIDS, with the largest being the EU (USD 130 million, or 54% of the
                                              total sector budget support in 2011-14) and Australia (USD 54 million, or 23%), while
                                              IDA/World Bank, New Zealand and Spain provided much smaller shares (USD 23
                                              million or 10%, USD 16 million or 7%, and USD 16 million or 6%, respectively). For
                                              the EU and Spain, sectoral budget support represented an important part of financing
                                              for climate and disaster resilience to SIDS (33% and 26%, respectively).

                                              In SIDS, like in many other developing countries, while donors engaged in a
                                              large number of sector-level programmes in the 2000s (often with pooled funding
                                              mechanisms as part of the arrangement), resource pooling seems to be less of a
                                              direct focus now for most providers. This seems to be, in part, a consequence of
                                              a transformed international aid environment. It could also be partly determined by
                                              the challenges that providers highlighted in connection to implementing pooled
                                              arrangements, including significant transaction costs derived from differing donor
                                              requirements and systems, challenges in implementation speed and complexity
                                              of programming.95

                                              However, promoting pooled arrangements and other mechanisms to coordinate
                                              funding streams remains crucial in SIDS. This is because absorption and
                                              implementation capacity are serious challenges, and uncoordinated funding streams
                                              and donors often overwhelm SIDS, further reinforcing that better coordination is a key
                                              priority. In addition, as highlighted by several providers,96 such arrangements promote
                                              country ownership and elevate the engagement between donors and recipients from
                                              a technical discussion on individual donor projects to more systemic and strategic
                                              policy discussions.

V. Challenges in Accessing Effective Financing for Climate and Disaster Resilience




                                              D. Resilience funding tends to follow large disasters and is likely to fall short
                                              of needs

                                              Larger disasters that capture media attention are prone to receive larger funding
                                              streams than smaller, more recurrent ones. Concessional resources for climate
                                              and disaster resilience tend to be provided in the wake of major disasters and then
                                              progressively fade away. Countries that have not recently experienced large disasters
                                              may struggle to receive resilience funding, such as Guinea-Bissau, which has received
                                              one of the smallest per capita allocations. Conversely, the volume of resilience funding
                                              to Haiti, which has been affected by a number of disasters in recent years, largely
                                              exceeded funding to any other SIDS.

                                              More predictable and long-term funding is needed. Although resilience funding
                                              increased in aggregated terms in 2011-14, individual countries experienced significant
                                              variations from one year to the next. SIDS are faced with low predictability of
                                              resilience funding, which can constrain their ability to take more comprehensive and
                                              forward-looking steps to build resilience, as well as limit their space for addressing
                                              less urgent and yet fundamental aspects of resilience. Although resilience funding
                                              increased in aggregated terms in 2011-14, individual countries experienced significant
                                              variations from one year to the next.

                                              For many SIDS, resilience funding largely falls short of needs. A comparison
                                              between self-assessed resilience/adaptation funding needs and resilience funding
                                              currently available suggests this shortfall. For the 11 SIDS that quantified their
                                              adaptation needs in their INDCs, per capita resilience funding received per year during
                                              2011-14 was only about half of their stated needs.97 Overall, financing falls short of
                                              the self-assessed needs stated by those 11 SIDS by about USD 1.6 billion a year.
                                              Few countries received higher contributions, while the majority received significantly
                                              less. UMICs, like Suriname, Mauritius, and Antigua and Barbuda, and fragile states,
                                              like Comoros, showed the largest gaps between stated needs and funding received
                                              (Figure 21). While this is a rough estimate,98 it does shed light on the scale of financing
                                              needs potentially left unmet.

for the estimates of financial needs          for SIDS. Their limited administrative and technical capacities at the national level,
and financing received are different.
Estimates compare past commitments            compounded by the array of complex accreditation and project proposal procedures,
with future needs, as well as financing
                                              are the primary factors constraining the ability of SIDS to directly access these funds
for climate and disaster resilience with
stated needs to finance adaptation.           and making them dependent on intermediary accredited agencies.

                                          Capacity constraints hinder the development of national strategies that
                                          incorporate climate and disaster resilience, and their translation into concrete
                                          investment proposals. Capacity constraints limit, for example, countries’ integration
                                          of climate change into national policies and investment plans.99 NDCs, national
                                          communications, national adaptation plans (NAPs) and national adaptation
                                          programmes of action (NAPAs) are four of the principle vehicles that SIDS can

                                          implementation of policies under the Convention. While most SIDS have completed
                                          some national communications and all LDCs, as of 2008, have completed a NAPA

V. Challenges in Accessing Effective Financing for Climate and Disaster Resilience




                                              Challenges exist in accessing financing through multilateral intermediaries.101
                                              A number of financial intermediaries, such as the World Bank, UN agencies and
                                              other MDBs, act as central channels through which financing from vertical funds can
                                              reach developing countries. Multilateral and regional implementing agencies can
                                              provide crucial technical and coordination support to implement larger projects and
                                              often have lighter fiduciary requirements, allowing for more timely access to funds.
                                              However, the smaller scale of SIDS project proposals can weaken prioritisation by
                                              multilateral intermediaries and limit access to funding. Intermediation also reduces
                                              resources available for implementation (due to implementation fees) and can limit
                                              the ability of national institutions to have a greater say over the allocation of funding.
                                              Finally, this intermediation can increase fragmentation and the administrative
                                              and monitoring burdens on SIDS, as when multiple intermediary agencies are
101
    In order to directly access funding,      simultaneously operating in the same country (as is common with the LDCF).
GCF countries are required to designate
the following national implementing
agencies: i) National implementing            Many SIDS struggle to comply with the fiduciary, economic and social
entities (NIEs) are responsible for           standards required to directly access global climate funds. To enhance the ability
overseeing implementation of funded
initiatives and are responsible for           of national institutions to directly access and exert greater control over funding and
ensuring that finance received follows        increase national ownership, several funds have taken action by introducing the
the fund’s objectives and meets
its fiduciary standards and social            “direct access modality.” This modality (as opposed to funding channelled through
safeguards; ii) National designated           an intermediary multilateral or regional implementing agency) is used by the AF, the
authorities (NDAs) (or “designated
authority” at the AF) are responsible         GEF and the GCF, and is intended to expedite funding allocation in line with national
for overseeing all resources coming into
                                              priorities. However, only five SIDS are currently accredited to access the AF, and no
the country from the Fund. The NDA
is the point of communication with the        national SIDS agency has yet received direct accreditation from the other global funds
GCF and undertakes a wide range of
functions, including aligning activities      (Table 4). As a result, during the period 2011-14, direct funding to SIDS totalled USD
with national sustainable development         10 million, representing 5% of total resources provided to them by the global climate

   The GCF has set aside an initial
USD 30 million to help developing
countries achieve readiness (GCF,
2014). Enhanced direct access would
allow national funding entities to
become accredited under the GCF and
decide on the allocation of funding for
projects at the country level, whereas
traditional direct access allows countries
to accredit national implementing
agencies to carry out only GCF-
approved projects.

VI. CONCLUSION AND EMERGING RECOMMENDATIONS


SIDS are highly exposed to climate change and natural disasters, which bear long-
lasting consequences on their development prospects. Lacking high domestic
savings, stable and strong fiscal revenues, and access to market financing, SIDS
governments often must divert scarce public resources from essential social and
economic development investments to address disaster-related needs, compromising
the pace and scope of future development. Shortfalls financed through debt may
endanger already precarious debt positions of some SIDS and, ultimately, “tax” future
generations. Competing development needs may also hinder investments in reducing
vulnerability ex ante. Thus, SIDS are caught in a slow growth, high vulnerability spiral.

Development partners can do much to help break this spiral by contributing to
resilience building through integrated approaches that take advantage of the synergies
and complementarities of disaster risk management and CCA. This means investing in
preventive measures, which are often less costly than disaster relief and response; and
using response, recovery and reconstruction after disasters to reduce vulnerabilities
and promote climate and disaster resilience through risk-resilient investments, resilient
land-use planning, upgrades in infrastructure safety codes (“build-back better”) and
ecosystem-based management.

To support SIDS in building climate and disaster resilience, development partners
should consider undertaking a range of actions as outlined below.

Supporting SIDS to create an enabling policy environment for climate and
disaster resilience. This means supporting the adoption of public policies and
regulations that can promote climate resilience by influencing the choices of private
actors in various sectors, such as building codes and regulations, incentives for
efficient water use and early warning systems, and prevention of new assets in
exposed areas.

Enhancing information on resilience and information management systems.
Few countries account for disaster losses, collect data and assess risks systematically,
which is indispensable for informed decision making at all levels (national, household,
firm, etc.). While domestic capacity is inherently limited, enhancing regional and
national information systems through multi-country and triangular partnerships could
prove cost effective and increase the reach of efforts. In addition, these partnerships
should make such information accessible to the different national agencies.

Supporting SIDS in integrating climate and disaster risk into national planning
and budgeting. While SIDS face many compelling development needs, and debt
situations remain a concern for many, a case can be made for allowing additional
marginal costs that will help build resilience and, therefore, prove less costly in the
long run. Development partners have a role to play in supporting SIDS planning

VI. Conclusion and Emerging Recommendations




                                         and budgeting of the actions needed to integrate climate and disaster resilience
                                         considerations into development plans. This will require supporting collaboration
                                         across a large set of ministries and departments to identify and integrate priorities, and
                                         highlighting linkages and synergies across sector-level policy objectives.

                                         Supporting public administration systems and institutions responsible for
                                         managing natural disaster and climate finance and risk. Priority should be given
                                         to further develop SIDS core public financial management systems and capacities for
                                         managing the spectrum of financial issues that natural disasters present, and increase
                                         capacities to access and manage concessional funds through, for example, reinforcing
                                         central units as a one-stop shop for all incoming funding proposals. This also includes
                                         building capacities to identify the most cost-effective way to manage disaster and
                                         climate risks, assessing to what extent to invest in prevention and to what extent to use
                                         risk transfer mechanisms, and helping countries prioritise investments.

                                         Increasing the use of financing mechanisms that enhance coordination.
                                         While at present individual projects dominate concessional flows, donors should
                                         consider increasing sector-wide approaches and budgetary support to promote the
                                         implementation of more resilient core budget expenditures, and further explore ways to
                                         pool resources to reduce SIDS reliance on a single concessional funding source – while
                                         avoiding the high level of project fragmentation currently seen.

                                         Providing predictable and more programmatic funding. The bulk of concessional
                                         finance for climate and disaster resilience tends to be allocated through large one-off
                                         projects, which in part determines the significant variation in annual commitments by
                                         individual providers. More programmatic and long-term funding (typically 10-15 years)
                                         could help build resilience for smaller and more frequent disasters, which can lead to
                                         larger cumulative damage over time. Examples of such approaches include a series of
                                         projects supporting a country’s long-term programme (such as the Kiribati Adaptation
                                         Program), where each project phase builds upon the experience of the precedent
                                         phase. Even though, due to donor cycles, financial commitments may be restricted to
                                         individual phases, an implicit institutional commitment would be made to invest over
                                         the long term. Various financial instruments could also be combined programmatically
                                         to support a given country’s policy and institutional reforms (through sectoral budget
                                         support), investment needs (through investment projects) and capacity building
                                         (through technical assistance) as was done recently in Samoa.

                                         Facilitating access to funding from vertical funds through simplified application
                                         and management procedures for SIDS. Fiduciary standards remain critical and
                                         development partners should consider how to better support SIDS in meeting these
                                         standards. At the same time, development partners should use their influence to
                                         support the adoption, by the global climate funds, of proportionate and streamlined
                                         approaches to encourage greater direct access, project implementation and
                                         national ownership.

                                          Facilitating access to innovative financing and risk transfer mechanisms. With
                                          limited and volatile fiscal revenues and access to concessional finance constrained by
                                          eligibility requirements and/or complexities linked to obtaining funds, enhancing access
                                          by SIDS to innovative financing mechanisms will be key.111 For example, development
                                          partners can support access to insurance and other forms of risk transfer and risk
                                          sharing mechanisms, as well as encourage the use of contingency funds or contingent
                                          credit lines. In this respect, the World Bank’s efforts to reduce the premia of disaster risk
                                          pooling mechanisms constitute positive steps.

                                          Investing to build national capacities and expertise. Small population size and high
                                          geographic dispersion of SIDS constitute structural constraints that largely challenge
                                          specialisation and overall availability of institutional capacities in SIDS. More than in
                                          other contexts, providers of concessional finance may be inclined to fill gaps in human
                                          resources through secondment of their staff or flown-in consultants. The sustainability
                                          and ownership of resilience programmes, however, will depend on striking the right
                                          balance between these short-term solutions and longer-term investments in national
                                          capacities. Innovative approaches and the use of new technologies could help tailor
                                          more sustainable capacity-building approaches to the specific context of SIDS.

                                          Using financing instruments that can help SIDS at risk of debt distress improve
                                          their debt situation and avoid using financing mechanisms that can undermine
                                          debt sustainability. In recent years, a number of instruments to deal with the debt
                                          situation of SIDS have emerged that can be further scaled up and replicated. While
                                          some can provide temporary relief, the international community should also support
                                          SIDS in addressing the drivers of debt accumulation. Furthermore, while greater
                                          concessional lending to Upper Middle-Income SIDS in recent years has increased
                                          the financing available for resilience, care should be taken to ensure that increased
                                          concessional lending does not endanger debt sustainability.

                                          concessional finance with the aim of ensuring that SIDS are able to access
                                          the finance they need at terms and conditions most suited to their specific
                                          circumstances. Currently, SIDS face a complex web of eligibility requirements
                                          that must be met in order to access different sources of concessional financing for
                                          resilience. With eligibility to several multilateral and bilateral funding sources relying
                                          critically on per capita classification, SIDS have expressed the need for a coordinated
                                          effort by development partners to review the rules governing access to concessional
                                          finance. Acknowledging the multi-faceted nature of vulnerability along with increasing

                              AND MITIGATION IN SIDS


                              While this report focuses on concessional financing in support of climate and disaster
                              resilience, Annex 1 presents the key features and trends of concessional finance
                              to SIDS in support of both climate adaptation and mitigation. It also discusses the
                              relevance of breaking the dependence of SIDS on fossil fuels, which weighs heavily on
                              national budgets, limiting fiscal space for climate resilience actions.

                              CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION FINANCING

                              Climate change adaptation and mitigation financing to SIDS has increased
                              and comes mainly from bilateral providers. Concessional climate financing to
                              SIDS has risen steadily between 2011-14, reaching USD 1.26 billion in 2014. Although
                              many vertical climate funds have emerged over the past two decades, in the period
                              considered, the bulk of climate finance to SIDS has come from bilateral providers
                              (73%, or nearly USD 3 billion). Smaller shares were provided by MDBs (13%), climate
                              funds (10%) and other multilaterals (3%). The three largest bilateral providers –
                              France (USD 700 million), Japan (USD 498 million) and Australia (USD 472 million) –
                              together made up more than 40% of all climate finance provided to SIDS. Multilateral
                              commitments averaged less than USD 131 million per donor.

Annex 1: Concessional Finance for Adaptation and Mitigation in SIDS




                                           Most climate finance in SIDS was oriented towards adaptation measures.
                                           While globally nearly 80% of concessional climate finance is targeted toward mitigation,
                                           SIDS are among the countries receiving the most concessional climate financing for
                                           adaptation, which made up more than two thirds of climate finance between 2011 and
                                           2014. The high prioritisation of adaptation in SIDS reflects their low impact on emissions
                                           relative to other countries and their need to minimize the adverse effects of climate
                                           change. The balance of climate finance to SIDS across donors differs, however, with
                                           bilateral providers typically placing equal priority on mitigation and adaptation, and
                                           multilateral providers extending larger shares of funding for adaption.

                                           SIDS are promoting climate change mitigation and good environmental
                                           stewardship globally. They are vocal in promoting a global strategy on climate
                                           change, which they perceive as a profound threat to their future. Over one third of the
                                           first 15 countries to sign the Paris Agreement were Pacific SIDS.

                                           BREAKING THE DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS

                                           SIDS are heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels for domestic energy,
                                           including electricity production, household needs and transport systems. With
                                           electricity generation in SIDS extremely reliant on high carbon-emitting energy sources,
                                           energy production costs are particularly high in SIDS. For example, the Federated States
                                           of Micronesia’s electricity rates for residential customers exceed USD 0.48 per kilowatt-
                                           hour (kWh), nearly four times the average US residential rate of USD 0.13 per kWh. Total
                                           electricity generated by Pacific Island States is composed, on average, of 80% imported
                                           diesel, with this share totalling 100% for several countries (the Cook Islands, Guam,




69
                                     Nauru, Niue, Saipan and Tuvalu). Furthermore, an assessment carried out by the UN
                                     Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) found that most SIDS allocate more
                                     than 30% of their foreign exchange reserves each year to cover the cost of importing
                                     fossil fuels.112

                                     The implementation of low carbon, sustainable energy solutions requires front-
                                     loading projects that have low perceived risks and high financial viability. SIDS are
                                     often unable to manage the high upfront investment costs of projects to reduce carbon
                                     emissions, in part due to inefficient domestic regulations, which have limited the willingness
                                     of development cooperation providers to implement projects where the perceived risks
                                     are high and domestic project financing capacity is low. The relatively small size of SIDS,
                                     coupled with outdated institutional and regulatory frameworks, discourages large initial
                                     investments, which are required for renewable energy sources, such as wind power or
                                     geothermal energy, despite the fact that operational costs are cheaper for such sources
                                     in the long run. Furthermore, capacity is often lacking to design and implement renewable
                                     energy and energy efficiency projects to make them bankable through proper financial and
                                     technical feasibility and project development processes.

                                     Due to high debt burdens in some SIDS, borrowing capacity is limited, hampering
                                     investment in innovative sustainable energy technologies. According to the Inter-
                                     American Development Bank, limited borrowing capacity among Eastern Caribbean
                                     countries (with average debt/GDP ratio of 86%) constrains the ability of governments to
                                     invest in sustainable energy technologies, thus perpetuating dependency on imported fossil
                                     fuels and its negative effect on fiscal space.

                                     Despite these challenges, SIDS are taking important steps to invest in renewable
                                     energy. Collectively, SIDS identified a high dependency on energy imports and the
                                     consequent vulnerability to energy price shocks as fundamental challenges to their
                                     sustainable development in the 2012 “Barbados Declaration on Achieving Sustainable
                                     Development for All in SIDS.”113 To reduce expensive oil-based energy generation,
                                     some SIDS have prioritised low-carbon growth through innovations in sustainable micro-
                                     generation. Sun, wind and ocean waves – all found in abundance in SIDS – are potentially
                                     powerful and exploitable energy sources. The international community should encourage
                                     efforts towards low-carbon development using these energy sources.

                                     SIDS are also investing in the “Blue Economy.” The “Blue Economy” is an approach to
                                     economic development based on prioritising the sustainable use and development of local
                                     ecosystem services and innovative clean solutions. For SIDS, which have large coastlines,
                                     exclusive economic zones and fisheries resources, the Blue Economy mirrors “green
                                     development” but with a focus on maritime resources. Efforts to invest in the Blue Economy
                                     should garner stronger support from the international community.

                                          CONCESSIONAL FINANCE IN SUPPORT OF CLIMATE AND DISASTER
                                          RESILIENT DEVELOPMENT

                                          At present, no internationally agreed methodology exists for assessing the share of
                                          concessional finance (hereafter used interchangeably with ‘aid’) that contributes to
                                          building resilience to climate change and natural disasters across the bilateral and
                                          multilateral agencies and across the climate and disaster resilience nexus. Therefore,
                                          the statistical data put together and analysed for this report represents a pioneering
                                          exercise to provide a more accurate picture of the breadth of concessional flows
                                          in support of climate and disaster resilient development than the exclusive reliance
                                          on climate data, measured through, for example, climate markers114 and the Joint
                                          Report on MDBs’ Climate Finance, or disaster preparedness data.115

                                          Data on climate and disaster resilience used in this report corresponds to a
                                          combination of data extracted from the CRS database capturing adaptation finance
                                          to SIDS and additional flows identified as relevant to disaster resilience.

                                          Large gaps exist in data availability and significant variation remains regarding
                                          how climate flows are measured between providers, with some using project-level
                                          estimates and others providing detailed component level assessments. Information
                                          regarding aid flows supporting disaster resilience is even more limited, with no
                                          comprehensive data currently available.

                                          Providers primarily use the following two methods for tracking climate flows.

                                          1.	 The OECD DAC-CRS tracks climate-related development finance through the
                                              Rio Markers, which provide an estimate of aid targeting climate objectives and

Annex 2: Methodological Note on the Statistical Data




                                            The method outlined below was used to develop the underlying data to this report:

                                            Step 1: Enhancing the coverage and comparability of CCA aid flows

                                            Beginning with the complete dataset of all 2011-14 ODA flows to SIDS as recorded
                                            in the CRS, flows were classified into the following categories:

                                            1.	 Relevant to climate change adaptation: All transactions marked as either
                                                  significantly (1) or principally (2) for CCA based on the OECD/DAC CCA
                                                  policy marker.118

                                            2.	 Not relevant to climate change adaptation: All transactions marked as
                                                  screened against, but found not be targeting, CCA (0) based on the OECD/DAC
                                                  CCA policy marker.

                                            3.	 Not screened for relevance to climate change adaptation: All transactions
                                                  not marked as 1, 2 or 0 based on the OECD/DAC CCA policy marker. This
                                                  included data on flows from MDBs in the 2011-12 period.

                                            To account for reporting gaps, all transactions not assessed for relevance to CCA
                                            (category 3) were then individually screened for relevance to CCA and classified as
                                            either relevant (category 1) or not relevant to CCA (category 2).

                                            Step 2: Determining transactions that supported both climate change adaptation and
                                            disaster resilience

                                            All projects identified as relevant to CCA were then individually reviewed and
                                            identified as either: (i) only contributing to CCA; or (ii) contributing to both CCA and
                                            disaster resilience.

                                            Step 3: Identifying transactions that contributed to disaster resilience

                                            Many activities, which contribute to building disaster resilience, fall outside the
                                            scope of CCA; that is, they deal with risks from geohazards and not climate-related
                                            events. To identify transactions that were likely relevant to disaster resilience, a
                                            keyword search was conducted using the ‘project title,’ ‘short description’ and ‘long

                                           This methodology is unique to this paper and seems to provide a more
                                           comprehensive and accurate estimate of concessional finance in support of climate
                                           and disaster resilience than reliance on a few relevant CRS purpose codes. However,
                                           being based on text searches,119 the accuracy of such estimates relies on the quality
                                           of descriptive information available, which varies across providers in the CRS.
                                           While the CRS offers some readily available data on activities that support disaster-
                                           related activities (e.g., from emergency response, purpose code 720; reconstruction
                                           relief and rehabilitation, 730; and disaster prevention and preparedness, 740), no
                                           distinction is made between natural disasters and other types of emergencies
                                           (political conflict, food and health epidemics, etc.). Additionally, the CRS does not
                                           provide readily available information on the full spectrum of activities in support
                                           of disaster resilience. In the case of SIDS, funding reported with the purpose of
                                           emergency response, reconstruction relief and rehabilitation, and disaster prevention
                                           and preparedness only represents a quarter of all funding for relevant activities in
                                           support of disaster resilience. Examples of projects that would have been excluded
                                           if the analysis had only covered the above-mentioned three purpose codes, and that
                                           are instead relevant to disaster resilience, include:

                                           •	   A Japanese-financed project in Fiji that aims to “improve drainage systems

                                                in support of the education sector (purpose code 11120).

                                                produce high-quality weather services in order to address the challenges posed
                                                by climate change and extreme weather phenomena” – in support of research
                                                and scientific institutions (purpose code 43082).

                                           •	   An Australian-financed project targeting Samoa for “the redevelopment of

                                           This illustrates that obtaining reliable statistics on adaptation and disaster reliance
                                           would entail adjusting existing CRS classifications, particularly in relation to disaster
                                           reliance. Recognising the growing importance that the international community
                                           attaches to the integration of CCA and DRM, the OECD-DAC is exploring ways to
                                           improve the accuracy of tracking concessional finance in support of climate and
                                           disaster resilience in the CRS. Regarding CCA, the methodology was adjusted this

                                              a proposal to establish a new policy marker for DRM was presented jointly by the
                                              World Bank, the GFDRR and UNISDR in April 2014. However, to date no significant
                                              modifications have been introduced in the CRS to this end.

                                              DISASTER DATA

                                              Disaster data was taken from the Emergency Events Data Base (EM-DAT) maintained
                                              by the Collaborating Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED).
                                              Disaster figures used in this report are a subset of the total EM-DAT disaster list, and
                                              include only geophysical, meteorological, hydrological and climatological disasters.
                                              Disasters in the EM-DAT database are counted if at least one of the following has
                                              occurred: 10 or more fatalities; and/or 100 or more people “affected” a call for
                                              international assistance or the declaration of a state of emergency. People “affected”
                                              by a disaster are defined as those who are injured, homeless/displaced or in need of
                                              immediate assistance.

                                              A number of issues with disaster data exist. Figures on economic losses due
                                              to natural disasters are largely affected by missing data. EM-DAT data only has
                                              economic loss figures for 36% of disasters reported between 1994 and 2013.120
                                              In low-income countries, a mere 14% of reported disasters include figures on
                                              economic losses, compared to 51% in high-income countries. Looking at SIDS in
                                              particular, economic losses are not reported for at least 45 natural disasters across
                                              eight countries from 2000-2014.121 This suggests that economic losses in SIDS,
