                    This Discussion Paper was prepared by the authors for the
                  World Bank Group’s Networked Carbon Markets (NCM) initiative.


         The NCM initiative is a key component of the World Bank Group’s long-term efforts to
      promote and enable carbon pricing, and complements on-going work to assist countries in
      designing and implementing carbon pricing systems through, for example, the Partnership
                   for Market Readiness and Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition.


           It is exploring how a future international carbon market could link a ‘patchwork’
             of different, domestic climate actions. The end-goal is to develop the services
            and institutions needed to enhance transparency, comparability, and fungibility
           of heterogeneous climate actions, for a connected international carbon market
                       that is liquid and delivers climate-smart financing efficiently.


        To date, it has launched a global discussion on the post-2020 services and institutions
           that might be needed for a connected international carbon market in the future.

Non-compliance in the form of “arrears” on outstanding loans prevents further borrowing. Eurozone members have to meet fiscal criteria to
participate in the benefits of belonging to a single-currency zone; members can be expelled for non-compliance (though the precise criteria
and process may be ambiguous). The five organizations comprising the World Bank Group have varying memberships and varying policies
concerning compliance and penalties for non-compliance—namely the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD),
the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The membership of the IBRD is 188; there are only 127 members of all
five organizations. The participation and compliance rules vary among the five organizations, but all have restricted participation on the
basis of some criteria—such as paid-in capital (IBRD), or have rules about compliance such as having to enforce arbitral awards (ICSID), or
have to make annual contributions to participate and gain the benefits. Non-compliance in the form of “arrears” on outstanding loans can
prevent further borrowing; participation in the benefits of borrowing is also limited by the “conditionality” of loans.

in this direction are Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, 4 of the 5 countries of the Melanesian Spearhead group (MSG).
The push is available in the transcripts of the UNFCCC COP21 negotiations. The PM of Niue has also expressed interest in e-mail dialogues.
The other countries do not have clear positions on REDD+ because they do not have enough forests to store large amounts of carbon. It is a
topic mentioned in the green growth documents developed, including the MSG and Fiji green growth documents.

achievement of the objective of the Convention . . . The developed country Parties and other Parties included in Annex I commit themselves
specifically as provided for in the following: (a) Each of these Parties shall adopt national policies and take corresponding measures on the
mitigation of climate change, by limiting its anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and protecting and enhancing its greenhouse gas
sinks and reservoirs. These policies and measures will demonstrate that developed countries are taking the lead in modifying longer-term
trends in anthropogenic emissions consistent with the objective of the Convention, recognizing that the return by the end of the present
decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol
would contribute to such modification, and taking into account the differences in these Parties’ starting points and approaches, economic
structures and resource bases, the need to maintain strong and sustainable economic growth, available technologies and other individual
