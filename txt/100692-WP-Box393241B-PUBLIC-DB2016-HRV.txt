THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 40

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 39*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      Upon registering with the Commercial Court Register and fulfilling its
      obligations with the State Bureau of Statistics, the company must
      register with the competent tax authority. Once a company is registered
      at the State Bureau of Statistics, company data is sent electronically to
      the tax authority, which levies the annual company tax. The company
      must register for VAT at the Tax Office, however, only after its first
      invoice (within 15 days of issuance). Once the company is registered for
      VAT, all tax payments can be processed through an electronic system,             1 day
      e-VAT. If the company’s total taxable annual income exceeds HRK           (simultaneous with

      Starting from January 01, 2009 a revision of the existing Croatian Law
      on Companies came into force (published in the Official Gazette no.
      146/2008). The change involves inducing "OIB" (personal identification
      number), that replaces tax number for legal entities. Personal
      identification number is defined as identification mark of personal
      identification number that users of that number use in their official
      evidences and with change of dates.

      All persons employed for the first time and age 40 are obliged to
      register in the second pillar of retirement insurance. A person has to
      choose the obligatory pension fund within 3 months of the date of
      employment. If the fund is not chosen after that period, REGOS (the
      Central Register of the Insured) itself chooses the obligatory pension
      fund that the person will register in. All persons employed for the first
      time and between ages 40 and 50 can, if they desire, register with the
      second pillar of retirement insurance. A person has to choose the
      obligatory pension fund within 6 months of the date of employment.

      Obtain decision from the Municipal Authority regarding
      utilities

      BuildCo must obtain a decision from the Municipal Authority on
      utility fees, based on the construction permit. The amount of the
      fee depends on the building size (in cubic meters) and on the
      location. Zagreb is divided into four zones for the purposes of
      communal fee calculations. The communal fee is set from HRK
      56 to HRK 118 per cubic meter of a building, depending on the
      zone. The Doing Business case study warehouse would be
      located in Zagreb zone III, with the communal fee set at HRK 75      22 days     HRK 292,613

      per cubic meter. The fee can be paid in full or in installments.

      According to Regulation on Procedure of Determining Volume of
      Buildings for Communal Fee Calculation currently in force, the
      volume of the buliding is used, and as for the warehouse used in
      the Doing Buisness case study, the volume of the warehouse is
      3901.5 cubic meters. Therefore the cost is 3901.5 * HRK 75.

        The Municipality forms an evaluation committee within 30 days
        after the submission of the application for the issuance of the
        occupancy permit, and determines the date of the on-site
        inspection. The investor submits various documents which
        substantiate that the construction has been conducted in
        accordance with the regulations (e.g., construction diary, licenses
        of the construction firm which executed the works, technical
        certificates for the material used in the construction, etc.) to the
        evaluation committee not later than on the day after the site
        inspection. If any of the members of the evaluation committee
        find that the building does not comply with a specific
        requirement, the investor may be given an additional 90 days to
        make the necessary corrections (if the error is, in fact, able to be
        corrected). If all requirements have been met, the Municipality

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       Obtain the land registry extract from the competent land register
       court

       Obtaining a land registry extract has become a crucial part during the
       preparation process for the purchase of a real estate, since the land
       registry extract enjoys public faith.

       Due diligence requires that the buyer knows the status of the land
       registry. Not knowing it can also result in conflicts on the property.
       The extract must be stamped by the Land Register Court in order to be
       verified. This usually does not take more than one day.
       Croatia has been in the process of computerizing the Registry. This
       process is still in its early stages. As the process of computerizing the
       registry is progressing, the number of properties for which data are
       available online and electronic Land Registry Extracts can be obtained is
       notably increasing.                                                           1 day

       Parties can obtain an electronic Land Registry Extract for a property that
       has been entered in the database. However, electronic extracts are not
       considered official extracts when it comes to using them for collateral
       purposes. Only Extracts obtained in paper directly in the Land Registry,
       have the legal power; the same applies for the cadastre extracts.

       The digital Land Registry can be accessed through: http://e-

       E-Cadastre also enables online insight into the legal status properties in
       Croatia, according to the number of land plot and cadastral municipality
       data. (http://katastar.hr/dgu/ind.php)
       There are 64 municipal courts that have in total 109 Land registry offices
       in all of Croatia.

      Notary notarizes the sale contract

      The sale contract contains a clausula intabulandi (i.e. the declaration by
      the seller that the purchaser may be entered in the land register) and is
      prepared by parties or by the lawyer. Pursuant to the Croatian law on
      Ownership and Other Property Rights and Land Registry Act (OG 55/13)
      it is defined that for the transfer of the property there is only a signature
      by the person whose rights have been restricted, encumbered,
      terminated or conveyed to another person (Article 52). In accordance to
      this law, the public notary verifies signature of the seller (the party whose
      property right will be terminated by the contract).

      The notary is authorized to obtain official extracts from the Company                             HRK 47.5 per

      values, there is a fixed fee on a scale. In addition to that, according to
      the Lawyers' Fee Schedule and Cost Compensation, for drafting the sales
      contract, the lawyer is entitled to the remuneration calculated according
      to the value of the propriety increased by 25 %. Further on, the lawyer’s
      fee is increased by VAT (25%) and the expenses incurred while rendering
      these services. The documentation shall include: Land register extract

      Register the title transfer at the Land Registry Court

      The request for the property registration must be submitted to the
      Registry by the parties on the appropriate registration form approved by
      the Ministry of Justice. However, the request shall not be rejected just
      because it was not submitted on the prescribed registration form. The
      participation of an attorney is not mandatory, but if one is involved, his     1-2 months
      fees will be about 0.5% of the property value. The Registry conducts the     (simultaneous       To be paid in

      land register court takes around 60-80 days, when the proceedings are
      conducted by an experienced lawyer. Depending on the various courts,
      this process may take even longer. It should be highlighted that only the
      final decision, the one allowing the registration, produces the legal
      effect. However, regardless of the time when the final decision is
      rendered, the date of applying for registration will be the date marked in

                                                                                      complete
      the Registry as the moment of transferring the ownership title. From that
      moment the party is protected towards all applications submitted
      afterwards. This rule is called the rule of priority: the buyer has the legal
      right to dispose of the property (to sell, lease, bequeath, transfer by gift,
      and mortgage the property). From that moment until the final
      registration the buyer has "quasi ownership". Therefore, even before the
      registration is completed, the first buyer - quasi owner can sell the
      property to another, second buyer. However there is a risk if the final
      registration of the first buyer - quasi owner is not allowed. In that case he
      will be liable for damage towards the second buyer. In practice the other
      contractual party will probably not be willing to enter into the legal
      transactions with the person who is not the legal owner of the real-estate
      in question (or take the risk). From 2004 the Court no longer accepts
      incomplete applications. If the registration form contains certain
      deficiencies, the court will not invite the applicant to correct the request
      but will immediately dismiss the application. The applicant may submit a
      new request, which will then have a lower rank. This has resulted in some
      reduction of backlog at the Courts and has also led to higher demand for
      professional assistance with the application process. Furthermore,
      changes in 2005 entrust the Land Registry clerks with the authority to
      decide on applications, with judges deciding on appeals. With
      registration moving from a judicial process to a more administrative
      process, this is a welcome change that indicates potential for decreasing
      the amount of time for registration. Recent internal reorganization of
      the Land Books also indicates future potential for increased efficiency.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes

consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
