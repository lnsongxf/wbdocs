This report never been a reality without the active involvement of many actors in the process of
reviewing the Ethiopia's Land Governance Performance. In this process, the work done by the
professional experts1 in developing the background reports is a crucial milestone. They performed a
very hard work within the situations where organized data source is not easily available and they
deserve a special appreciation. The support provided by Ato Tigistu Gebremeskel, the Rural Land
Administration and Use Directorate (RLAUD) director in creating favorable condition for the
process to proceed was significantly important. Specifically his contribution during the panel
preparation and pane discussion was significant and I would like to forward my gratitude to him. I
am indebted to Dr. Solomon Bekure, chief of Party for Land Administration to Nurture Development
(LAND) project for his overall support and facilitation he made during the process. I would like to
extend my sincere appreciation to the World Bank LGAF global secretariat office, specifically to Ms.
Thea Hilhorst for her generous support in reading all the background reports and the final country
report and providing critical comments to keep the reports in the framework with quality. I am
appreciative to Dr. Klaus Deininger for the opportunity he gave me to coordinate implementation of
LGAF Ethiopia. The contribution provided by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on specific
background reports in their area of professional capacity deserves appreciations. I am grateful to the

Extended executive summary

Ethiopia's performance on land governance is assessed using the Land Governance Assessment
Framework (LGAF), which is a diagnostic tool developed by the WB and its partners. The aim of
the assessment is to look the land governance status of the country and suggest ways on how to make
corrective measures in those areas that are found weak and very weak performances and how to
strengthen those performances that are found strong and very strong. Information are collected from
existing record, administrative reports, reviewing existing policies and legal frameworks and
institutional setups at federal and regional levels by nine professional experts assigned for each
panel. This country report is prepared by compiling main points from the context analysis and main
findings from the dimension analysis presented in each background reports. The result obtained from
the dimensions analysis is interpreted using descriptive statistics at two levels. The first level is at
panel level, which means to have insight how the overall performance looks like. The second level of
analysis is at Land Governance Indicator (LGI) level by aggregating the results of the dimensions
analyzed under the LGI . The scores designated as A, B, C, and D are labeled as very strong, strong,
weak and very weak respectively. To have an aggregated result, points area assigned for the scores
designated as A, B, C, and D. The points assigned are 4, 3, 2, and 1 for A, B, C, and D scores
respectively. With this methodological approach, this extended executive summary presents the
compiled country report.

Since 1995, Ethiopia has decided to follow a federal political arrangement and has nine regional
states and two chartered city administrations. Hierarchically, administrative structures of the regional
states includes Region, Zones, Woredas and Kebeles. Most of the human population leave in the
highland areas of the country with a population density of about 160 people per sq. km while the
human population density is less than 20 people per sq. km in the lowland areas. This figure gives an
indication why the highland farmers have about 0.5 ha of land per holding.

The Federal constitution has paved the way for developments of land administration legal
frameworks at federal and regional2 levels. At federal level, for rural land administration,
proclamation 89/1997 was the first proclamation that is replaced by proclamation 456/2005. For
expropriation and compensation objectives, proclamation 455/2005 has been enacted at federal level.
Regional states developed regulations for expropriation and compensation based on proclamation
455/2005. Several regional governments have formulated their land policies and land laws, among
them Tigray Region proclamation 136/2007 (first issued 1997, amended 2002 and 2007), Amhara
Region 133/2006 (first enacted 2000, amended in 2006), Oromia Region 130/2007 (first issued 2002,
amended in 2007), and SNNP Region 110/2007 (first enacted 2003, amended in 2007), Afar Region
49/2009, Benishangul Gumuz 85/2010, Gambela Region 185/2011, and Ethiopia Somali Regional
State 128/2013. There are lower level laws, which includes regulations and directives, developed by
regions. Federal and regional land administration and land use proclamations provide unlimited
period of use right to farmers, pastoralists and semi-pastoralists. The urban land management has
many types of legal instruments that includes, Condominium proclamation 370/2003, urban plan
proclamation 574/2008, revised urban land leasehold proclamation 721/2011 and the urban land

             2
                 Some commentators say that regional states are not empowered to enact land laws

                                                                                                      6
holding registration proclamation 818/2014. For the urban land management, regional states use the
federal level urban land laws.

Under the overall public ownership as stipulated in the constitution, subsequent proclamation
recognize different tenure types in the rural land administration. Proclamation No. 456/2005, defines
three tenure types. In article 2 sub article 11, it defines private holding as rural land in the holding of
peasants, semi-pastoralists and pastoralists and other bodies entitled by law to use rural land. Article
2 sub article 12 gives definition of communal holding as rural land which is given by the government
to local residents for common grazing, forestry and other social services. State holding is defined in
article 2 sub article 13 as a rural land demarcated and those lands to be demarcated in the future at
federal or regional states holdings; and includes forest lands, wildlife protected areas, state farms,
mining lands, lakes, rivers, and other rural lands. The same proclamation, article. 5:4:a, recognizes
private investors to acquire and use agricultural land, which is stated as - Private investors that
engage in agricultural development activities shall have the right to use rural land in accordance with
the investment policies and laws at federal and regional levels. The tenure types are private holding,
communal holding and state holding.

There are five tenure types that includes leasehold, old possession, state holding, condominium and
informal settlement, tenure types in the urban land administration system. The Urban Land lease
Holding proclamation No. 721/2011, defines two tenure types. In article 2 sub article 1 Lease is
defined as system of land tenure by which the right of use of urban land is acquired under a contract
of a defined period. Article 2 sub article 18 defines old possession as a plot of land legally acquired
before the urban centres entered into the leasehold system or a land provided as compensation in
kind to persons evicted from old possession. Although not clearly defined in the proclamation, the
rest is assumed under public holding. The same proclamation clearly stipulates that all land in urban
areas shall in future be transferred in to lease system. It emphasized that lease system would be the
principal landholding system in the country in the urban context.

At Federal level, Ministry of Agriculture is mandated to oversee the rural land sector while the
Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Construction is mandated to oversee the urban land
sector. The Ethiopian Mapping Agency (EMA), established at Federal level, is responsible for
countrywide topographic mapping and for the establishment and maintenance of geodetic control
points. It has also a responsibility to carry out aerial photography, surveying and orthophoto map
production, which can be used for rural and urban land cadastre. Information Network Security
Agency (INSA) is another Federal institution mandated to capture, process, store and disseminate
geo-spatial data in the country, which benefit both rural and urban land cadastre.

The day to day responsibility of overseeing rural land administration, in the Ministry of Agriculture,
lies under the responsibility of Rural Land Administration & Use Directorate (LAUD), which is one
of the directorates found under the state minister for natural resources development, conservation
and utilization. The RLAUD is responsible for overseeing land use and land tenure of rural lands
outside large scale agricultural investment lands. Specifically, the RLAUD is responsible to follow-
up implementation of the Rural Land Administration and Use Proclamation 456/2005, enacted by
the Federal Government, by providing professional support to the regional rural land administration

                                                                                                         7
institutions and coordinating competent authorities working on land related issues. In addition, the
LAUD has to create and facilitate information exchange between regions and contribute on capacity
development of the regional institutions. The directorate links the work at the federal level with that
at the regional level and provides inputs for policy making to advance the harmonization of rural
land administration in Ethiopia. The MoA has the responsibility to develop standards for rural land
administration purposes. Under the Ministry of Agriculture, there is a newly established semi-
autonomous agency to administer large scale agricultural investment lands, which is called
Agricultural Investment Land Administration Agency (AILAA). The AILAA is responsible for
federal level management and lease of state holdings. The regional states mange agricultural
investment lands up to 5,000 ha. The agency is delegated by the regional states to handle all large
scale agricultural investment lands above the limit indicated above.

As presented above, the responsibility to administer and to manage land and natural resources is
given to the regional states. Accordingly, regional states have enacted regional land laws and
established land administration and management institutions for rural lands following the federal
pattern. For the urban land administration regional states use the federal laws. Although the regional
implementing institutions for rural land administration are varying between regional states, in
naming and organizational setting, there are offices at regional, zonal and woreda administrative
levels in all the nine regional states. Some regions, such as Amhara and Oromia, extended their
office to the Kebele level, which is the lowest administrative structure. At federal and regional level,
there are institutions that have functions of land management related matters.

There are local level institutions established to implement land administration systems, which are
called Land Administration & Use Committees (LAUC). Land administration and use committee
members are volunteers elected by land holders in each kebele to implement the land administration
system. The participation of landholders in implementing land administration system is guaranteed
through public hearings and meetings as well as through the elected land administration committee
members. In some regions, Shemaglewoch Shengo3 is established in each Kebele to handle land
related conflicts using traditional rules. It plays a key role in integrating customary (traditional) law
into the formal setting. The active involvement of land holders both directly through public hearings
and indirectly through their representatives in land administration committees and shemaglewoch
shengo is a good lesson in which the Ethiopian system can contribute for other countries in similar
situation.

Having the contextual information presented above, the Ethiopian land administration performance is
assessed from the sight of land governance against international best practices. An extended
dimensions analysis have been conducted and documented in all the nine panels' background reports.
The results are extracted from each dimension analysis and are condensed with additional
explanations, when deemed necessary, and are presented. In the report, Dimension scores are
tabulated and are presented for each panel. The tables include indicators, dimensions, scores and
statements/explanation of the scores. This is assumed to help the reader to understand the meaning of
the scores without any difficulties. On the tabulated results, descriptive statistical analysis is

performed to have an insight on performance status of each dimensions and to make an informed
judgments. Furthermore, dimension results are aggregated to have an insight on the performance
level of the indicators and to make again an informed judgments. Policy statement/recommendations
are summarized for each dimension and are presented in policy matrix in annex 14. The policy
statements given specifically for each dimension are believed to support monitoring of improvements
of practices in each dimension areas in the future.

The thematic area, "Land Rights Recognition, panel 1", is assessed by two Land Governance
Indicators (LGI) and 12 dimensions. Out of the assessed dimensions, which are 12, only 2 (16.67%)
scored A. These dimensions are rural land registration and respect for women's right in property
registration. Those dimensions that scored B are 4 (33.33%). Putting together the A and B scores it is
50%. Based on this assessment, Ethiopia has very strong and strong practice, only on 50% of the
assessed dimensions, in Land Right Recognition within the existing constitutional framework.
However, there are 3 (25%) dimensions that scored C and 3 (25%) dimensions that scored D, which
is categorized as weak and very weak practices. The dimensions that scored C and D have to be a
serious concerns of Ethiopia. When performance is assessed at indicator level, Ethiopia has nearly
strong practice in recognition of a continuum of rights in the existing constitutional framework. The
country's performance in respect for and enforcement of rights is nearly strong too. Substantive and
elaborated explanations on each dimension are given in sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.

Critical and actionable policy recommendation (panel 1)
   Registration and certification of rural land holdings is conducted without formally enacted
    registration and cadastral laws. Therefore, registration and cadastral laws should be developed
    and enacted.
   Methodology for communal lands registration and certification should be developed and pastoral
    community areas registration and certification has to be conducted in time.
   Issues of compulsory land expropriation, valuation, level of compensation, and rehabilitation of
    affected people are concern areas that need revisiting. There is a big dissatisfaction on the less
    involvement of affected communities in the compensation computation process.. This situation
    needs an urgent reconsideration to revise laws
   A proper study has to be conducted before a pastoral area is allocated to large scale agricultural
    investments in order to leave to the pastoralist the very critical areas for their livelihood.
   Legal provisions essential on the right to use small rural landholders’ use rights to get access to credit
    services.
   There is a need to harmonize the land laws and family laws in regards to heirs issues

Performance of Ethiopia in the area of "Rights to forest and common lands & rural land use
regulations, panel 2" is analysed through 15 dimensions and two Land Governance indicators4. The
result shows that there is no dimension that scored A, which indicates that Ethiopia is not
performing Very Strongly on issues and subject matters addressed in any of the dimensions. There
are 7 dimension that scored B, which is 50% of the dimensions analysed. Hence, Ethiopia has strong

                  one dimension found irrelevant to the Ethiopian context

                                                                                                            9
practices in 50% of the dimensions. However, 3 dimensions scored C, which is weak performance
and 4 dimensions scored D, which is a very weak performance. The two together represent 50% of
the dimensions assessed. These dimension have to be a serious concerns for Ethiopia. The country
has to make the necessary corrective measures on (i) clearly identifying and giving responsibilities to
appropriate institutions in the legal system for common lands, (ii) defining the co-existence of
multiple rights on the same plot of land in the legal system and its enforcement, and (iii) providing
the necessary opportunities for recording and mapping of lands managed and used by identified
groups of communities. An immediate corrective measures for those dimension scored D (28.57%),
which are very weak practices, is highly essentials. The essential measures includes (i) recording and
geo-referenced mapping of lands under communal use, (ii) monitoring the swift use of rural land
after land use change is decided, (iii) making public process a mandatory in zoning of rural lands to
respect existing rights in the area, and (iv) monitoring effectively the use of protected areas in the
rural setting in accordance to the decided use. Weighted mean points are calculated for the two LGI
separately. The performance of activities under indicator "Effectiveness and equity of rural land use
regulations" is found to be weak compared with performance of activities under indicator " Rights to
forest and common lands". Substantive and elaborated explanations on each dimension are given in
sections 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and 4.2.3

Critical and actionable policy recommendation (panel 2)

   Ethiopia is using its land and land resources without having comprehensive national land use
    policy. Formulation and enactment of a national land use policy is urgently essential. At the same
    time provision of policy framework to give clearer responsibility for managing communal lands
    is needed
   Developing an appropriate guideline for participatory rural land use planning and rezoning is
    essential. Ensuring transparent public process for rural land use planning and joint forest
    management is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.
   There are protected forest areas, national parks, wildlife reserves and wetlands. These areas are
    meant to serve the purpose as the names indicate. However, there are evidences to suggest that
    the land which was classified as forest reserve, wildlife sanctuary, national park, and wetlands
    diverted to other purposes particularly for agriculture over the years. This diversion has taken
    place either in the form of encroachments by the surrounding herders and smallholder farmers or
    in the form of allocation for large scale agricultural investments. Hence, there is an urgent need
    to officially demarcate, map and register these lands to sustain initially identified use

Very strong and very weak results are not recorded in the dimension analysis of the thematic area of
"Urban Land Use, Planning, and Development, panel 3". Most of the dimensions, 64.29%, scored B,
which is strong practice and the rest, 35.71%, scored C, which is weak practice. Practices in these
dimensions have to be changed and performance has to be improved and an immediate attention has
to be paid by the municipalities and city administration. Proposed practices, among others include,
(i) making the urban land use plan change in a clear public process with full participation of all
stakeholders, (ii) making implementation of low-cost housing policy more effective in order to
decrease those living in inadequate shelters, (iii) adhere to the land use plan developed to guide the


                                                                                                    10
expansion of the largest city, (iv) develop a speedy mechanism in the land use planning process to
cope with urban growth and avoid informal settlement and (v) develop a clear regulation to manage
common properties effectively under condominiums system. After observing the result at dimension
level, further analysis is made at an indicator levels by aggregating scores under each indicator.
There is a strong practice under indicator "Restrictions on rights" and indicator " Speed and
predictability of enforcement of restricted land uses", while the practice is weak under indicator "
Efficiency in the urban land use planning process". The results of the other indicators is found in
between the results presented above. Substantive and elaborated explanations on each dimension are
given in sections 4.3.1 - 4.3.6.


Critical and actionable policy recommendation (panel 3)

      In the big towns, there are large scale eviction from old settlement locations. There is a need
       to redesign policy and strategies that limit large scale eviction problem through exploring
       other options such as more participatory urban upgrading without damaging the social,
       economic and environmental fabrics of an area
      It is common to see settlements mushrooming in risk prone locations. It is necessary to
       develop enforceable regulation to restrict settlements at risk prone areas and develop and
       implement mitigation measures for those settled in risk prone areas until resettled in non risk
       prone areas
      Stringent regulation ought to be designed for any zoning modifications to satisfy primarily
       the interest of the majority of affected communities rather than endorsing the technocrat
       based analysis
      Proper investigation is essential to harmonize the ability of the poor to pay and the cost of
       construction of condominiums, and to find out conducive environment to implement low cost
       housing

The result of dimension analysis on thematic area "Public Land Management, panel 4", shows that
only one dimension scored A (8.33%), which means there is a very strong practice to transfer
acquired land to its destined use in time. There are four dimensions (33.33%) scored B. However,
those dimensions scored C and D together, which means weak and very weak, are much higher
(58.33%) than very strong and strong practices. Ethiopia has to look seriously on those practices
scored weak and very weak. To rectify the weaknesses and improve practices in dimensions that
scored C, the following rectification measures have to be taken, which includes, (i) remove any
ambiguity in responsibility assignment and capacitate mandated institution in public land
management, (ii) allocate sufficient resources (financial, material and human) for better management
of public lands, (iii) develop a system to acknowledge unrecorded rights and making compensations
for those lost benefits due to land use change in public lands, and (iv) reduce the time in
compensation payment after rights are removed due to land use change. An immediate action is
required on those practices that are very weak (scored D) by (i) completely recording and mapping of
the public lands to know the extent of public lands, (ii) monitoring the transfer of public land satisfy
public interest, and (iii) establishing a system to compensate lost interest due to land use change.


                                                                                                     11
Additional evaluation of the result is made at indicator level. As the result indicates, there is a need
to work hard to rectify weak practices and improve performances of all the indicators. Substantive
and elaborated explanations on each dimension are given in sections 4.4.1 - 4.4.4.

Critical and actionable policy recommendation (panel 4)
       There is a need to work on clearly defining responsibilities between the federal and regional
        institutions on the management and development of public lands
       Transferring public land to private interest is through expropriation. There is no limiting
        factor that restrict the government power to expropriate public land for private interest.
        Therefore, it is essential to revise the legal framework and define the term "public purpose" to
        take land and transfer to private interest
       There are cases where decisions are made in transferring public land to private interest, but
        the land is kept unused for a long period of time, especially in towns. A regulation has to be
        developed to improve the speed of transfer of public land to private interest and to its
        destined use
       There is a need to revisit the current expropriation and compensation law and its
        corresponding regulation to consider compensation payment when people lose right as a
        result of expropriation and land use change. Alternatively compensation to secondary
        rights/unrecorded rights should be addressed through land use plan

Panel five "Transfer of Large Tract of Land to Investors, panel 5" is analyzed with nineteen
dimensions packed under four indicators. As the result indicates, there are only two dimensions,
10.53%, that scored B. Out of the nineteen dimension twelve of them scored C, which is weak
practice, and five dimensions scored D, which is very weak practice. Proportionally, 63.16% and
26.32% of the dimensions are weak and very weak practices respectively. As a matter of priority, to
rectify very weak practices, scored D, and to achieve better performance corrective measures have to
be taken that includes, (i) make the transaction of public lands transparent and open to the public, (ii)
establishing a proper mechanism for significant benefit sharing from the gains in land use change,
(iii) developing a policy for accessing assets developed in the area of transacted lands, (iv)
establishing resettlement policy to manage resettlement properly when it is implemented and (v)
involve the right holders to negotiate and establish future benefits that can be gained due to the land
use change. Analysis made at indicator level shows that the performance in all the indicators is weak
or very weak. Substantive and elaborated explanations on each dimension are given in sections 4.5.1
- 4.5.5.

Critical and actionable policy recommendations (panel 5)

   Large scale investment projects need closer follow up to check compliance with lease agreements
    and whether the projects receive proper services from the public institutions that are mandated
    for the purpose
   The institutional efficiency need to be enhanced through comprehensive analysis of pros and
    cons of the existing institutional arrangement for the rural land sector. Apparently, the
    agricultural investment land administration system need to be integrated with the general land

                                                                                                      12
    administration and use system of the country as in reality the principle of land administration is
    similar for all lands.
   Investment projects should be given the go-ahead only after full consultation with local
    communities. The government should be accountable to communities and should involve them at
    all stages of the decision-making process
   Contracts should contain clear, specific and enforceable clauses to protect the environment,
    wildlife, biodiversity, and water sources. The use of agro-chemicals must be closely regulated to
    prevent damage to the soil and to surface and subsurface water Systems from toxic waste.
   There must be an enforceable benefit-sharing scheme instead of simply leasing out the land so
    that communities stand to gain from the investment projects. This could be a profit-sharing
    scheme as is being tried in some African countries with large scale extractive projects.
   Contracts should stipulate investors’ obligations with regard to social investments in the
    communities concerned (e.g. schools, health centers, and clean water). Social investments should
    address community needs, based on consultation with them
   It is important to minimize investments that cause involuntary displacement and, where such
    displacement is absolutely unavoidable, it is essential to ensure that adequate compensation is
    paid in time

Dimension analysis result on "Public Provision of Land Information, panel 6" showed that there are
six dimensions, (33.33%) that have very strong performance. On the contrary, there are six
dimensions, (33.33%) that recoded very weak performance. When the dimensions recoded weak and
very weak performance are taken together it becomes 55.56%, which outweigh very strong and
strong performances of the dimensions under the thematic area. As a matter of priority, focusing on
those dimensions scored D, the following corrective measures are urgently essential, which includes,
(i) speedup the rural and urban cadastre and making a complete information system, (ii) develop a
system to synchronize information in the public registry for an easy information exchange, (iii)
develop a system that makes updating of transactions mandatory, (iv) develop a cost recovery system
to enable the registry to run by itself, (v) improve level of investment for land administration as land
is one of the basic resources of the country, and (vi) in the long-run, develop and incorporate ethical
education in the education system and in the short-run, develop controlling mechanism to discourage
illegal actions of staffs. The necessary measures have to be taken on other dimensions to improve
overall performances of the thematic area. Additional analysis has been conducted by aggregating
the results of the dimension to have an insight on the level of performances of indicators and to make
an informed judgment. There is a very strong practice in "mechanism for recognition of rights".
However, "reliability" and "cost effectiveness and sustainability" indicators are a serious concerns
that need an immediate actions. Substantive and elaborated explanations on each dimension are
given in sections 4.6.1 - 4.6.6.

Critical and actionable policy recommendations (Panel 6)

   The tenure system in the pastoralist and semi pastoralist areas is different and requires policy
    definition of group (clan) rights for effective formalization. Due consideration have to be made
    for local practices during policy formulation

                                                                                                     13
   The first registration is part of the establishment of the initial land administration infrastructure
    and therefore the cost has to be free of charge. Updating and maintenance of records that is not
    practiced in Ethiopia except in Amhar regional state need to be based on cost recovery policy
    principles. The implementation should be based on the study
   Policy to develop a comprehensive land administration system that can record encumbrances and
    obligations at the holding level is required. Furthermore, a policy that clearly stating as to how
    restrictions or charges are consistently recorded is necessary.
   Policy to synchronize public services and public registers is required. The data in land registers
    have to be the base for public services such as address and identification of citizens personal
    records.
   Ethiopia is now engaged in vigorous rural land cadastre activities. Mapping and registering of
    parcels information is very important activity. However, unless the cadastral information is
    updated as transactions take place, the information will be obsolete soon and its importance
    decline in time. Therefore, there must be a legal instrument that can support efficient updating

"Land Valuation and Taxation, panel 7" thematic area is assessed under two indicators and six
dimensions. There is only one dimension that have very strong, 16.67%, practice. Again, there one
dimension that scored B, which shows that there is strong practice, 16.67%. On the other end, two
dimensions scored D, 33.33%, that expresses the practices in these dimensions are very weak. There
are two dimensions that are scored C, which means weak practices. When the dimensions that scored
C and D are taken together, it becomes 66.67%. Therefore, the country has to take corrective
measures that include (i) making property valuation for taxation and compensation that reflect
market value, (ii) developing a policy and a guide that makes valuation rolls are accessible to the
public, (iii) developing a system that increase the percent of liable property tax payers in the tax rolls
more than 70% and put in place monitoring mechanisms and (iv) developing a system that increases
collection efficiency of assessed property tax values to make the collection more that 70% and put in
place a monitoring mechanisms. Indicator level result shows that "transparency of valuation" is very
weak while collection efficiency is much better". Substantive and elaborated explanations on each
dimension are given in sections 4.7.1, 4.7.2 and 4.7.3..

Critical and actionable policy recommendations (panel 7)

   Real Property valuation and taxation in Ethiopia have legal, technical, institutional and financial
    problems. To guide implementation of valuation, property valuation policy development and
    institutional establishment is essential
   Compensation that could have been paid to affected property owners/holders ought to be valued
    by independent professional property valuators. In addition to that, both the Federal and Regional
    expropriation and payment of compensation laws ought to be amended in such a way that
    property valuators have to use anyone of the three valuation methods when they find them
    appropriate
   The Government, in addition to paying fair and reasonable compensation, has to set mechanisms
    to rehabilitate the affected property owners when their property is taken for public purpose



                                                                                                       14
   The expropriation of landholdings for public purposes and payment of compensation laws should
    be reviewed to ensure that there is more extensive information dissemination to the public and
    access to the valuation rolls, and to empower the affected citizens in the process of decision
    making

Summary of scores for panel 8, shows that one dimension scored A, three dimensions scored B, two
dimensions scored C and one dimension scored D. Taking the dimensions scored A and B together,
which means very strong and strong practices, it becomes 57.14%. The balance, 42.86%, is weak and
very weak practices. Giving priority to the weak and very weak practices to change the situations and
improve performances, Ethiopia has to take corrective measures including (i) reduce court cases of
land dispute by identifying and eliminating the cause of disputes through appropriate measures, (ii)
encourage community level dispute resolutions to reduce costs and to enable disputants to use their
time for other productive purpose, and (iii) develop a system to make the appeal court cases in
shorter time and in a cost effective manner. Indicator level result shows that there is a better practice
in the area of assignment of responsibilities. Substantive and elaborated explanations on each
dimension are given in section 4.8.1, 4.8.2 and 4.8.3.

Critical and actionable policy recommendations (panel 8)

   A legislative revisit is necessary to reduce the different types of dispute settlement avenues. For
    example, it is possible to eliminate municipal courts and other tribunals and rather empower
    regular courts. The revision of the law may also be a good opportunity to adopt a comprehensive
    procedural approach for land dispute settlement
   Revise laws to encourage the recognition and enforcement of arbitral decisions and agreements.
    This will lessen the number of cases reaching courts and people will understand the result of their
    agreements
   A policy shift is necessary for courts to focus on quality of decisions instead of quantity only.
    The current policy in courts is focusing on quick disposal of cases and hence reducing
    backlogged cases. In this regard, it is performing very well. But the overall length is not
    shortened since quick decisions are open for errors and then being held for longer times in
    appellate courts. Therefore, the policy must balance the need for speedy trial with quality of
    decision. Establishing a separate land bench within the first instance court system will help
    judges to be more expert in the area and can create the balance between quantity and quality of
    decision. Furthermore, similar decision needs to be considered in opening separate benches
    within the High Court and the Supreme Court
   Further study is needed to conclude about sources and magnitude of land dispute in order to
    provide solution and thereby reduce land disputes. Further research is also necessary to determine
    the percentage of land disputes compared to other disputes. Further research is required to make a
    reasonable conclusion on the percent the cases

"Institutional Arrangements and Policies, panel 9" is analyzed under two indicators and thirteen
dimensions. As the analysis result shows, there is no dimension that scored A or D. Seven
dimension, 53.86%, scored B and six dimensions, 46.14% scored C. In this case, those dimensions

                                                                                                      15
scored C, which means weak, should get first priority to take corrective measures. Among others,
Ethiopia has to (i) remove overlaps that exist within institutions that have interest in the land sector,
(ii) Making land information readily accessible, (iii) strengthening the coordination between different
institutions that deal with land, (iv) put in place a very strong monitoring system for implementation
of ecological and environmental policy objectives, (v) establish a system and implement a system for
cost benefit analysis for land policy implementation, and (vi) Enforce and monitor policy
implementation that prevent settlement in high risks areas. During the panel discussion, two
prominent issues debated and recommended that include (a) the country should have a
comprehensive land policy and land use policy and (b) the country should have an institutionalized
valuation system to develop valuation rolls by professional valuators. Analysis made at indicated
level shows that the performance of the two indicators is not very different to each other. As the
result shows, the performance at indicators level is not weak or is not strong. Substantive and
elaborated explanations on each dimension are given in sections 4.9.1, 4.9.2 and 4.9.3.

Critical and actionable policy recommendations (panel 9)


   A harmonized and comprehensive national land policy and land use policy is required and is an
    urgent matter to be considered taking in to account other related policies and strategies such as
    the rural development policy and strategy, the conservation strategy of Ethiopia, the water
    management policy etc
   Detail assessment on the horizontal and vertical responsibility overlaps may be required to craft
    clear institutional responsibility among institutions dealing on land management.
   Government should speed up the computerized land information system to simplify information
    sharing. The computerized information system should include a web based application to create
    an enabling environment for key public bodies to get connected
   Although the land laws are enacted to satisfy the ecological and environmental objectives of the
    country, law enforcement to this end is very poor. Hence, the provisions in the legislation need to
    be enforced rigorously through a functional monitoring mechanism.
   The cost accounting on implementation of land policy needs to be holistic and demands further
    study to be able to establish efficient and effective cost of implementing various components of
    land policies
   There is a need to establish property valuation institution to develop valuation rolls by
    professional valuators for different economic activities

Comparing the result of the nine panels that are assessed under 27 indicators and 119 dimensions,
provided in which panel Ethiopia is relatively performing well. A summarized result, table 16, shows
that in three of the panels, very strong and strong practices, which means A+B, outweigh the weak
and very weak practices, which means C+D. Among these, the panel "urban land use, planning and
development" has the highest number of dimension, 64.29%, that scored very strong and strong
practices followed by the panel "dispute resolution" 57.14%, and "institutional arrangement and
policies" 53.83%. But it does not mean that there are no dimensions that scored very weak practices
among these panels.


                                                                                                      16
The highest number of dimension, 89.47%, that scored weak and very weak practices is observed in
"transfer of large tract of land to private investors" followed by "land valuation and taxation" 66.67",
"public land management" 58.33" and "public provision of land information: Registry and Cadastre"
55.56". However, as the result shows, it does not mean that there is no very strong and strong
practices in these panels. For example, the highest number of dimensions that scored A, which
means a very strong practice, 33.33%, is in panel 6. The result of panel 2, "rights to forest and
common lands and rural land use regulation" and panel 1, "Land right recognition" performances are
at the borderline. Ethiopia has to take a very serious corrective measures in panel 5, panel 7, panel 4
and panel 6 as specified in policy matrix and summarized recommendation given under the
discussion of each panel.

1. Introduction

Land governance5 is the ways property rights to land (for groups or individuals) are defined and can
be exchanged and transformed; the way in which public oversight over land use, land management,
and taxation is exercised; the type of land that is state owned; the way such land is managed,
acquired, and disposed of; the nature and quality of land ownership information available to the
public and the ease with which it can be accessed or modified; and the way in which disputes are
resolved and conflicts are managed.

Having in mind the above concepts of land governance, implementation of LGAF Ethiopia has been
initiated. Information are collected from existing record, administrative reports, reviewing existing
policies and legal frameworks and institutional setups at federal and regional levels by nine
professional experts assigned for each panel. The background reports had been reviewed by many,
which includes the country coordinator, World Bank expert responsibly for the process, Technical
Advisory Group (TAG) established for the purpose under Africa secretariat and national senior
experts. Finally, significant input is obtained to improve the background reports. Basically, this
country report is prepared by filtering and compiling main points from the context analysis and main
findings from the dimension analysis presented in each background reports. When deemed
necessary, additional explanation and discussion are included.

Chapter two is devoted for explanation of the methodology. Contextual information is presented in
chapter three. In this chapter, federal and regional land administration institutional set-ups, legal
frameworks and tenure typologies in rural and urban are presented. The rural land administration
performance is briefly indicated. Bilateral and multilateral projects and programs working in land
administration are presented and their area of operation in the country is indicated. Institutions
established for public land management, land dispute resolution and taxation are discussed.
Ethiopia's economic growth is briefly presented. The country's economic growth target, rural and
urban cadastre targets, agricultural land transfer target, aimed in GTP II, are indicated in chapter
three.

Results from the dimensions analysis are presented in chapter four. Unanimously agreed scores
during panel discussion, with score description, are tabulated for each thematic area and are
presented in this chapter. Findings of each dimension analysis are condensed and are presented.
Based on the findings of the dimensions analysis, conclusions and key recommendations are
provided for each thematic area. Chapter five deals with the way forward. Supportive information are
presented in the annexes of the report.

2. Methodology

The Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) is a diagnostic instrument to assess the status
of land governance at the country or sub-national level using a highly participatory and country-
driven process that draws systematically on local expertise and existing evidence rather than on
outsiders. The assessment is based on a comprehensive review of available conceptual and empirical
material regarding experience in land governance by local experts. The LGAF was developed by the
World Bank in partnership with FAO, UN Habitat, IFAD, IFPRI, the African Union, and bilateral
partners.

The LGAF focuses on the following 5 focus areas:-
1. Recognition and respect for existing rights
2. Land Use Planning, Management and Taxation
3. Management of Public Land
4. Public Provision of Land Information
5. Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management

In implementation of LGAF Ethiopia, the focus areas are analyzed in nine panels/modules, 27 land
governance indicators and in a total of 119 dimensions, table 1. For each dimension, pre-coded
statements are used as proposed in the LGAF manual. Scores vary from best practice (A) to weak
practice (D).

To carry out the implementation, country coordinator is assigned by the LGAF Global secretariat
established at the World Bank. The country coordinator, in cooperation with the Global secretariat
and the African secretariat, developed Terms of Reference (ToR) guided by the LGAF manual. For
each panel/module one senior investigator is contracted, based on the ToR, by the LGAF African
secretariat established for the purpose and is located in Nairobi, Kenya. The country coordinator
provided orientation to Expert Investigators (EIs) to enable them to comprehend the concepts
described in the manual. In addition several reference materials are collected, as much as possible,
and are provided to the EIs. Furthermore, EIs collected reference materials relevant to the topics they
made the investigation. As the scope of the assessment is more of a desk work, data are collected

                                                                                                    19
from administrative datasets, legislative and policy documents, institutional and project report.
Supportive information are collected from research papers and relevant land related publications.

Background reports are drafted, revised and final version produced in step by step approach, Annex
2 . Expert investigators, with support of the country coordinator, produced the first draft of
background reports. All draft reports had been reviewed and comment by the country coordinator
focused on alignment to the LGAF requirement. Comments are included by the expert investigators
and second drafts were produced. The World Bank global secretariat reviewed and commented on
second drafts before being sent to the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) established under the LGAF
African secretariat located in Nairobi, Kenya. Expert investigators revised the second version
according comments and suggestion given by the Global secretariat for LGAF and the third versions
were produced. Third version of all background reports sent to the TAG for more and deeper review.
Comments and suggestions made by the TAG are taken and the fourth versions were produced after
revisions made by expert investigators. The background reports have two main parts categorized as
context analysis and dimension analysis. In the dimension analysis part, preliminary rankings for the
set of concerned dimensions are presented. Final review on the fourth draft was launched on the
background reports by contracting three Ethiopian senior experts in the land sector in Ethiopia. There
had been two LGAF workshops the contributed to shape the implementation process. The first one
was conducted on 18-19/12/2014 in Ethiopia with participation of country coordinators, TAG
members, LGAF global secretariat and African LGAF secretariat, Figure 1. The second was
conducted on March 21/2015 in Washington DC. This progress review workshop gave significant
input to the process of LGAF Ethiopia implementation.

 Detail schedules had been developed by the country coordinator and panels conducted as planned.
The country coordinator gave a presentation on how the project initiated, LGAF implementation
status in the world and in Africa, how the background reports developed and produced, objective of
the panel session, and remaining major activities in the process. Panels were organized on each topic
for full one day discussion. To provide a common basis of information to the panel participants,
which is indispensable as a basis of consensus on rankings, background reports were sent to invited
panel participants well in advance. They discussed on each of the dimensions in detail to arrive at a
consensus ranking and agreed policy priorities. Panel experts were pooled from institutions working
in the land sector. A total of 63experts participated that makes an average of 7experts per thematic
area Figure 2. The validation workshop, with participation of 37 participants, made the final
touching on scores, conclusions and key recommendations Figure 3.

A country report, by summarizing main points from the background reports, is prepared. The result
obtained from dimension analysis is interpreted using descriptive statistics at two levels. The first
level is at panel level, which means to have insight how the overall situation looks like. The second
level of analysis is at Land Governance Indicator (LGI) level by aggregating the results of the
dimensions analyzed under the LGI . The scores designated as A, B, C, and D are labeled as Very
Strong, Strong, Weak and Very Weak respectively. To have an aggregated result, points area
assigned for the scores designated as A, B, C, and D. The points assigned are 4, 3, 2, and 1 for A, B,
C, and D scores respectively.

3. The Context6

3.1 Ethiopia's location, topography and climate7

With a surface area of about 1.1 million square Kilometers, Ethiopia is the 7th largest country in
Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South
Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south.

Located in East Africa in the sub-region better known as the Horn of Africa, the topography of the
country is composed of high plateaus and extended lowlands. The altitude of the country ranges from
100 meters below sea level in the Dallol Depression of Afar, to mountain peaks of over 4,600 meters
above sea level in Semien Mountains. The highest peaks are Ras Dashen in the Semien, located West
of the great rift valley and Batu Mountain in the Bale mountains range located in East of the great rift
valley.

The great Rift Valley separates the western and the eastern highlands diagonally; and these highlands
gradually descend to the lowland areas in the east, west, and south of the country. Much of the
country consists of high plateau and mountain ranges, which are dissected by numerous streams and
rivers. Among the biggest river basins are Blue Nile (Abay), Awash, Baro, Omo, Tekkeze, Wabe
Shebelle and Genale. The altitudinal variation that ranges from 100 m below sea level to more than
4,600 m above sea level significantly influenced the diversity of flora and fauna in the country
including the soil types.

The climate in Ethiopia is mainly influenced by altitude and the main climatic regions are the
following:-

Dega (cool to cold temperature) - This is typical of the cool highlands where average
temperature falls between 10°C and 16°C. The altitude is above 2500 meters above sea level.

Weina Dega (warm to cool climate) - Average annual temperature ranges between 16°C and
20°C and comprises much of the highlands between 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.

Kolla (warm to hot climate) - This is the climate of the hot lowlands, and the average
temperature is between 20°C to 30°C. The altitude ranges from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea
level.

Bereha (Hot and arid climate) - This covers the area of the desert lowlands below 500 meters
above sea level and the average annual temperature is over 30°C.

There are two distinct seasons in Ethiopia, the dry season which is for the most part from October to
May (mostly winter season in Europe) and rainy season from June to September (summer season in
Europe.) Precipitation across the country is characterized by high spatial and temporal variability.
On a spatial scale, the distribution of annual rainfall ranges from less than 400 mm in the Somali
Region and the Afar Triangle to more than 2,400 mm in the southwest of Ethiopia.


             6
               The context part is extracted and condensed from background reports developed by expert
             investigators. Additional issues are extracted from the inception report. For more information readers are
             advised to refer the background reports and inception report.
             7
               Most of the information is taken from the Ethiopian Government portal

                                                                                                                  22
3.2 Ethiopia's settlement pattern8

Ethiopia is one of the countries found in the horn of Africa with an area of 1.1 million square
kilometre. According to the conventional classifications of ecological systems of the country, about
44% of the country's landmass falls in highland ecology, which is above 1500 meters above sea
level. The balance, which is 56%, is categorized as a lowland area. The Central Statistical Agency of
Ethiopia projected Ethiopia's population to reach 90 million by the year 2015. Settlement pattern of
the population of the country is very much skewed to the highland ecology due to historical, climatic
and soil factors. It is estimated that about 88% of the human population, about 79 million, resides on
44% of the country's landmass. With 83% of rural population estimate, about 64 million people are
living in the highlands of Ethiopia in which their livelihood is dependent on sedentary agriculture
that integrates crop and livestock production. About 56% of the country's land mass is mainly
occupied by pastoral communities. Taking into consideration the general statistical figures for
highland and lowland proportion, indicated above, about 11 million people are living in the lowland
ecology of the country. When the 83% is used to estimate the rural population in the lowland area,
about 9 million people are found in the rural pastoral economy. In terms of population size of the two
chartered cities, most recent figure, Addis Ababa is the highest with 3,103,700 people and Dire-
dawa has about 269,100 people.

Estimates on the Ethiopian livestock population indicates that there are about 150 million heads of
livestock in the country, which makes the country to stand first in livestock population in Africa. The
livestock population pattern follows the human population settlement pattern. It is estimated that
75% of the livestock population, about 110 million heads, is found in the highland areas. The rest
25% of the livestock population is in the pastoral areas. Pastoralists, mostly in Afar, Somali, some
parts of Oromiya and SNNP Regional State, inhabit over half of the Ethiopian territory (56%). The
above crude statistical figures indicate that the highland areas are heavily populated, 163 people per
sq.km, while the lowland areas have about 18 people per sq.km.

3.3 System of Governance9 and legal frameworks

3.3.1 Administrative structures

Ethiopia decided to follow a federal political arrangement and has nine regional states and two
chartered city administrations. Hierarchically, administrative structures of the regional states includes
Region, Zones, Woredas and Kebeles. The Oromiya national regional state, which is one of the nine
regional states, covers an area of 355,000 sq.km with a projected total population of 32.8 million.
Administratively, it is divided into 20 Zones, 275 Woreda administrations and 6,814 rural Kebele
administrations. The second largest regional state is the Amhara national regional state with a total
area of 171,000 sq.km and with a projected total population of a little more than 20 million. The

              8
                A comprehensive Ethiopian highland reclamation stud had been conducted in 1984 by FAO funded by
              the WB. Although the study is not updated, it is believed that the general population pattern is still holds
              true.
              9
                It is important to note that the number of zones, Woreda, and Kebeles in a given region can change when
              there is a need and decision is made to merge or sub-divide for better service delivery purpose.

                                                                                                                      23
region constitutes 12 administrative Zones, 139 Woredas and 3,234 Kebeles. The Southern Nations
Nationalities and Peoples' Regional State (SNNPR) is the third largest regional state that covers an
area of 113,323 sq.km. Population of the region is estimated to be 17.84 million. It is the most
diverse region in the country in terms of language, culture and ethnic background. Administratively
the Region is divided into 14 Zones, 4 special Woredas with a total of 134 Woredas, and 3,600 rural
Kebele administrations. The Tigray Regional State consists of 4 administrative Zones, one special
Zone, 35 Woredas and 695 rural Kebele administrations with a total area of 80,000 sq.kms. The
regional population is estimated to be 4.96 million

The Afar regional state is one of the lowland regions with a total land mass of 96,707 square
kilometers and with a projected total population of 1.68 million. All the grazing land in the Afar
Region is owned communally except in agro-pastoral areas where some people grow crops along big
rivers and have small private grazing areas for cattle. Registration of rural land has started very
recently. The Ethiopia Somali regional state occupies about 279,250 sq.km with a total population of
5.31 million. Most households in Somali region have access to large communal grazing lands and are
primarily dependent on livestock and livestock products used as a major sources of food, cash and
assets. The benshangul-Gumuz region has and area of 48,800 sq.k divided into 3 zonal
administration, 20 woredas, 437 kebeles. The Gambela regional state has an area 25,600 sq.k with 4
zones, 13 woredas and 198 kebeles. Harari is the smallest regional state with a size of 400 sq.k
divided into 13 kebeles. The two chartered cities, Addis Abeba and Dire Dawa have an area of 500
sq.k and 1,500 sq.k respectively. The Dire Dawa town includes the surrounding rural kebeles.

In Ethiopia, population level is used to determine status of urban centres. The categorization is small
towns with a population of 2,000 - 20,000; medium towns with a population of 20,001 - 50,000;
large towns with a population of 50,001 - 100,000; cities with a population of 100,001 - 1,000,000;
and metropolis with a population of > 1,000,000. Accordingly, there are 850 small towns, 84
medium towns, 20 large towns, 16 cities and 1 metropolitan.

3.3.2 Legal frameworks

The 1995 constitution has paved the way for developments of land administration legal frameworks
at federal and regional levels. At federal level, for rural land administration, proclamation 89/1997
was the first proclamation that is replaced by proclamation 456/2005. For expropriation and
compensation objectives, proclamation 455/2005 has been enacted at federal level. Regional states
developed regulations for expropriation and compensation based on proclamation 455/2005. Several
regional governments have formulate their land policies and land laws, among them Tigray Region
proclamation 136/2007 (first issued 1997, amended 2002 and 2007), Amhara Region 133/2006 (first
enacted 2000, amended in 2006), Oromia Region 130/2007 (first issued 2002, amended in 2007), and
SNNP Region 110/2007 (first enacted 2003, amended in 2007), Afar Region 49/2009, Benishangul
Gumuz 85/2010, Gambela Region 185/2011, and Ethiopia Somali Regional State 128/2013. There
are lower level laws, regulations and directives, developed in all the regions. Federal and regional
land administration and land use proclamations provide unlimited period of use right to farmers,
pastoralists and semi-pastoralists


                                                                                                    24
The urban land management has many types of legal instruments that includes, Condominium
proclamation 370/2003, urban plan proclamation 574/2008, revised urban land leasehold
proclamation 721/2011 and the urban land holding registration proclamation 818/2014. For the
urban land management, regional states use the federal level urban land laws.

3.4 Historical perspective of land Governance

The tenure structure during the monarchy period was quite complicated and in parts of the country
highly exploitative. During this feudal period there were on the one hand small-scale owner-
cultivators, and on the other hand large landholders, who in many instances obtained their
possessions through political means. Such landholders were members of the nobility and the local
gentry. The nobility were absentee landlords while the gentry resided close to their property. The
system is said to be exploitative, because nobility and landlords contribute no part in the production
process but demand the highest share of the benefit from agriculture. The shares they demand were
ranging from one third to two thirds of the product especially in the southern parts of the country.
Complete and irreversible defeat of landlordism was the greatest achievement of the military
dictatorship Derg.

Indigenous land tenure systems in Ethiopia were varied and evolved through a complex of processes.
The major forms of land rights and land tenure systems operated in Ethiopia were Atsme Irist and
Gult. The Gult system was a decentralized taxation system, where the Gult right holder has the right
to levy and collect tax on behalf of the central government. The tax used to be paid in kind. Usually
the Gult holder adds some margins on the proportion for covering his administrative costs. The
commonly used proportion was one tenth of every product. The Gult right holders have the right to
exempt Irist right holders (gebars) from taxes. In general, the Gult right holders are responsible for
the overall administration of the area, but they have no right or power to give or take land from Irist
right holders (gebars). The Gult system was abolished during the Imperial period after the Italian
invasion and replaced by a centralized taxation system, which continued up until the end of the Derg
period.

Atsme Irist commonly known as Irist is a hereditary ownership system of land tenure. The Irist right
holder (gebar) is the kinship group of the first settlers of the area. The individuals in the kinship
group have their own private holdings, but they cannot transfer their right to an outsider without the
consent of the group leaders, which means decision on transaction of land was under strict control by
the local community. The Irist system was the most dominant system in northern part of Ethiopia.
The Irist system is believed to be the first tenure system in the region. It is believed that land was
free to everyone before the Irist system. Irist system emerged when the first settlers in an area are
legitimized as rightful holder of the area. The land being not occupied by the Irist holders was
declared to be under the control of the central government.

There was a system of allocating unoccupied land for different government services as a salary for
the military and for civil servants. This type of land was known as Maderia. Unlike Irist, Maderia
land was not hereditary, though the services sometimes were inherited. The land was reallocated
when the service to the government ended. Maderia covers only the interest in the estate, while Gult

                                                                                                    25
is the right to tax and administer land, including Maderia land itself. The government also allocated
land for church services. Sometimes the government allocated unoccupied land to the church as a
Gult area. Then the church was allowed to collect taxes from users as a compensation for running the
church services.

The church services givers are divided mainly into two groups: firstly the priests and deacons, locally
called Kedash responsible for spiritual services, and secondly the locally called Debteras, who are
assigned and educated to render the administrative and educational services. When the right holder is
not educated or no male member is available in the family (only males are qualified to be priests, but
females can be Debteras), an appropriate person has to be hired to accomplish the service. In almost
all cases the land allocated for the church services is within the vicinity of the church so that the
service giver is easily available whenever required.

Different land governance systems that existed in Ethiopia are eradicated immediately after the
overthrow of the monarchy system. One of the most popular mottos of the socialist revolution was
‘‘Land for the tiller’’. On 4th of March 1975, the Derg proclaimed the nationalization of all rural
land through the rural land proclamation number 31/1975. Since then land is under the ownership of
the government. The same proclamation is the base of the establishment of Kebeles, the lowest
administrative units in Ethiopia. The Kebele administrations were responsible for land reallocation
and resolving land related conflicts during the Derg era. The urban land was not included in the
proclamation 31/1975. It seems that the Derg was in a desperate situation to cool down its political
opponents that promote the motto of "land for the tiller". However, it seems that it had realised most
of the urban land is under the control of the nobility and landlords. Therefore, it enacted
proclamation 47/1975 to nationalize urban lands and extra urban houses. Since 1975, Ethiopia
administers and manages rural and urban lands by different legal systems and different institutions.

The current government included most important land policies in the constitution. The constitution
delegated the details of land issues to be proclaimed separately. Proclamation no 89/1997, which
later on replaced by proclamation 456/2005, which is currently active, was the result of the
constitutional provision Article 55/2). In the constitution, it is proclaimed that land is not subject for
sale or any other type of exchange in Ethiopia (Article 40/3). The ownership to land is exclusively
vested to the state and to the peoples of Ethiopia. It is only the holding right that is given to
individual citizens (Article 40/4).

By the framework law (456/2005), power is given to the regional states to enact their own land
administration and use proclamation in accordance with the federal law. (Article 17/1). The regional
laws are supposed to take into account the regional specific conditions and to achieve the regional
objectives. The proclamation also enables regional states to establish their own institutions pertinent
for the implementation of the proclamation (Article 17/2).

There are active legal instruments enacted by the Federal Government to administer and manage
urban lands and urban development, which includes Condominium proclamation no.370/2003,
Urban planning proclamation no.574/2008, Building proclamation no.624/2009, Urban land lease
holding Proclamation no. 721/2011 and Urban land holding registration proclamation no. 818/2014.

                                                                                                       26
3.5 Currently operating tenure typology

Ethiopia’s legal framework on land comprises its constitution and subsequent land laws enacted by
the Federal Government for rural and urban land administration and management. Enacting separate
laws for rural and urban land started in the mid 1970s. The then military Government of Ethiopia
enacted proclamation 31/1975 to nationalise all rural land and enacted proclamation 47/1975 to
nationalize all urban lands and extra urban houses. Hence, since 1975, Ethiopia administers and
manages rural and urban lands by establishing different legal systems and different institutions.

Many proclamations repealed and replaced successively. The current land laws includes
proclamation 455/2005 enacted for compensation matters, proclamation 456/ 2005 for rural land
administration, proclamation 721/2011 for urban land administration/lease law and proclamation
818/2014 for urban land registration. There are also regional constitutions, laws, regulations and
directives. The federal constitution (Article 40) states that the right to ownership of rural and urban
land, as well as of all natural resources, is exclusively vested in the state and in the people of
Ethiopia. The main concern of the Government in advocating state ownership is that private
ownership will lead to concentration of land in the hands of few people who have the ability to buy,
resulting in the eviction of poor peasants and thus aggravating landlessness and potentially leading to
massive rural - urban migration of people with unpredicted consequences. Therefore, as per the
federal constitution, land is a common property of the Nations, Nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia
and shall not be subject to sale or other means of exchange (Article 40/3). Sub Article 4 also states
that Ethiopian peasants have the right to obtain land without payment and the protection against
eviction from their possession. This right shall include the right to alienate, to bequeath, and, where
the right of use expires, to remove his property, transfer his title, or claim compensation for it.

Under the overall public ownership as stipulated in the constitution, subsequent proclamation
recognize different tenure types. Proclamation No. 456/2005, defines three tenure types, table 2. In
article 2 sub article 11, it defines private holding as rural land in the holding of peasants, semi-
pastoralists and pastoralists and other bodies entitled by law to use rural land. Article 2 sub article 12
gives definition of communal holding as rural land which is given by the government to local
residents for common grazing, forestry and other social services. State holding is defined in article 2
sub article 13 as a rural land demarcated and those lands to be demarcated in the future at federal or
regional states holdings; and includes forest lands, wildlife protected areas, state farms, mining lands,
lakes, rivers, and other rural lands. The same proclamation (Art. 5:4:a) recognize private investors to
acquire and use agricultural land, which is stated as - Private investors that engage in agricultural
development activities shall have the right to use rural land in accordance with the investment
policies and laws at federal and regional levels.

The Urban Land lease Holding proclamation No. 721/2011, defines two tenure types, table 3. In
article 2 sub article 1 Lease is defined as system of land tenure by which the right of use of urban
land is acquired under a contract of a defined period. Article 2 sub article 18 defines old possession
as a plot of land legally acquired before the urban centres entered into the leasehold system or a land
provided as compensation in kind to persons evicted from old possession. Although not clearly
                                                                                                       27
defined in the proclamation, the rest is assumed under public holding. The same proclamation clearly
stipulates that all land in urban areas shall in future be transferred in to lease system. It emphasized
that lease system would be the principal landholding system in the country in the urban context.

  There has been debate about the Ethiopian land tenure system largely between professionals,
academics, opposition political groups and the government or the ruling party. The Constitution of
the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia has enshrined the basic principles about the property
right of citizens under Article 40. Sub-article 1 of this Article generally provides that “every
Ethiopian citizen has the right to the ownership of private property. Unless prescribed otherwise by
law on account of public interest, this right shall include the right to acquire, to use and, in a manner
compatible with the rights of other citizens, to dispose of such property by sale or bequest or to
transfer it otherwise.” However, these general provisions are qualified and limited by exceptions
under sub- articles 2, which provides that “private property, for the purpose of this Article, shall
mean any tangible or intangible product which has value and is produced by the labour, creativity,
enterprise or capital of an individual citizen, association which enjoy juridical personality under the
law, or in appropriate circumstances, by communities specifically empowered by law to own
property in common.” According these constitutional provisions, there is no labour, creativity,
enterprise and capital to create land and to consider it as a private property. The other side of the
debate emphasis that the constitution has put the most precious resource of the nation "value less".
There are a heated debate on this issue especially during election campaign in every five years.

Type of tenure             Legal recognition, registration, transferability and characteristics
State land                 Legal recognition: Recognized as state holding by the federal Rural Land
                           Administration and Land Use Proclamation (No. 456/2005) and regional land
                           laws.
                           Registration/recording: Land banking is a method practiced in Ethiopia to
                           prepare land for investment and resettlement programs. In this program state
                           holdings were demarcated and mapped. The surveyed land is ready for the transfer
                           to investors (domestic and foreign) through lease contracts. This is a point of
                           controversy that sometimes is termed as land grabbing (Rahmato, 2011). The
                           maximum duration for the leasehold is different in different regions. Lease
                           contracts can be renewed after the expiry period. In the lease contract the rights
                           and obligations of the lessee as well as of the lessor are included. Among others,
                           taking proper natural resources conservation measures are major responsibilities of
                           the lessee. But in practice, large scale commercial investment farms are not
                           environmentally friendly.
                           Transferability: State land is transferred by lease agreement with the regional
                           states. The leased land can be used as collateral during the lease term. The lease
                           can also be inherited for the term as long as the legal heirs are willing to continue
                           to abide with the previous lease contract.
Private holding            Legal recognition: The land holding right is given by constitutional provision and
                           further clarified by federal framework land law Proclamation No. 456/2005.
                           Registration/recording: Four major regional states are issuing primary books of
                           holdings following participatory adjudication process. The coverage can be
                           estimated between 60 to 98% of the land holders in the four major regional states.
                           Transferability: Private individual holdings cannot be sold and can be transferred
                           only through inheritance to family members practicing agriculture and living with
                           the right holder. Holdings can be leased to other farmers or investors, subject to
                           restrictions on the extent and duration of leases.
Communal holding           Legal recognition: Access rights to communal holding over rural land are
                           recognized by the constitution and proclamations (Proc. No. 456/2005).
                           Registration/recording: Registration of communal holdings in four major regions
                           is similar to individual holdings except that the holders of communal holding are
                           group of people. However, the users generally are not happy on the enforcement of
                           billows for the protection of communal holdings. In pastoralist areas the group,
                           clan is the owner of the area of land though they are not permanently settled on the
                           area.
                           Transferability: for example Proclamation 133/2006 defines the common holding
                           as rural land not under the ownership of the government or of any private holding,
                           but used by the local people in common for grazing, forestry and other social
                           services. In most cases, communal holdings are governed by traditional rules and
                           by-laws. According to the regional states regulations the local society is entitled to
                           establish by-laws based on local circumstances. The decisions based on these local
                           rules are legally valid unless or until they are in contradiction with established
                           formal law.
                           The regional land laws have also provisions how to transform communal holdings
                           into individual holdings. Legal restrictions in the transformation process are the
                           agreement of the rightful users of the concerned area and the perpetuation of the
                           existing land use type after individualization. Additionally, the transformation

                                                                                                          29
                    process has to be approved by the authorities to minimize possible environmental
                    consequences.
                    The common rights are normally given to specific Kebele (parish) membership,
                    but in some cases the rights are limited to specific groups within the Kebele.
                    Common rights are linked to the place of residence. The landless dwellers of the
                    Kebele have full right and responsibility to use the common pool resources within
                    their vicinity.
                    Common pool resources are grazing lands, community and conservation forests,
                    market places and other service areas, river banks, and water bodies. In practice
                    the right to use the common pool resource is not exclusively given to the
                    landholding rights, but it is a beneficial right with a weak connection to the
                    holding right. Communal rural land holdings can be changed to private holdings as
                    may be necessary” (Proc. No. 456/2005, Art. 5-3).
Leasehold /rental   Legal recognition: Lease according to the definition of some regional states is the
                    agreement between investors and regional states. Whereas rent is the agreement
                    between individual land holders and tenant. Private investors can acquire time-
                    bound use rights on payment basis over rural land to engage in commercial
                    activities through contract with the state or private landholders (Proc. No.
                    456/2005, Art. 5/4 and art.8).
                    Registration/recording: any rural land that is held through lease or rental shall be
                    registered by the competent authority ((Proc. No. 456/2005, Art. 6/).
                    Transferability: Investors who hold rural land through lease or rent have the right
                    to transfer and use as collateral their holding right.

Tenure typologies      Legal recognition, registration, transferability and other characteristics

                       Legal recognition: pursuant to the constitution, article 40, sub article-3, the right to
                       ownership of rural and urban land as well as all of natural resource exclusively vested
                       in the state and in the people of Ethiopia.

                       Registration: Pursuant to urban land holding registration proclamation no.818/2014,
                       article 14, sub-article 4, unless proved to the contrary, any parcel of land on which use
                       right is not created shall be presumed to belong to the government, and, up on
                       application be registered in the name of the organ in charge of administering or
 Public/state land     developing the land.

                       Transferability: As per the constitution article 40, sub-article 3; land shall not be
                       subject to sale or other means of exchange. Nonetheless, pursuant to urban land
                       leasehold proclamation no.721/2011, article 5(sub-article 5), article 8 (sub-article 1
                       &2), article 12 (sub-article 1-5), it recognizes public land right transfer through lease
                       either by tender or allotment modalities. So, to sum up as per the aforementioned legal
                       frameworks, land is not transferred but it’s the abstract right on land that is
                       transferred.

                       Legal recognition: as per urban land holding registration proclamation no.818/2014,
                       article 2, sub-article 3, land holding means a use right on urban land acquired in
                       accordance with lease law or an old urban land possessions recognized by the lease
                       law. It includes private residential permit system acquired legally before the urban
                       centres entered in to the leasehold system.

                       Registration: Pursuant to urban land holding registration proclamation no.818/2014,
                       article 30, sub-article-1, all rights, restrictions, and responsibilities’ stipulated in
                       contracts of old possessions shall be registered.
  Old possession       Transferability: pursuant to urban land leasehold proclamation no.721/2011, article 6
                       (sub-article 3), a property attached to an old possession is transferred to a third party
                       through any modality other than inheritance, the person to whom the property is
                       transferred become the possessor through lease holding.



                       Note: Proclamation no.47/1974 declared state ownership of urban land and extra
                       houses and privileged the tenants and other homeless to live paying very low rent for
                       the Kebele and Rental House Administration. Nonetheless, these old possession
                       ownership right administered by kebele has been transferred illegally to natural person
                       for unscrupulous gain by corrupted municipal professionals.

    Leasehold          Legal recognition: urban land leasehold proclamation no.721/2011 provides for lease
                       holding administration of all new residential dwellings and regularized unauthorized


                                                                                                         31
                settlements administered under urban land lease holding.

                Registration: Pursuant to urban land holding registration proclamation no.818/2014,
                article 30, sub-article-1, all rights, restrictions, and responsibilities’ stipulated in
                contracts of lease holdings shall be registered. Besides, as per the same proclamation,
                article-2, sub-article 3, land holding means a use right on urban land acquired in
                accordance with the lease law

                Transferability: Pursuant to urban land leasehold proclamation no.721/2011, article-
                24, sub-article 1 & 2, a lessee may transfer his leasehold right or use it as collateral
                and capital contribution to the extent of the lease amount already paid. If a lessee,
                with the exception of inheritance wishes to transfer his leasehold right prior to the
                commencement or half completion of construction, he shall be required to follow
                transparent procedure of sale to be supervised by appropriate body.

                Legal recognition: under the condominium proclamation no.370/2003, article 9, sub-
                article 1-5, any units owners have the right to use common elements, which includes
Communal land   all that are part of the condominium (including common areas) except the unit.

                Registration: Pursuant to urban land holding registration proclamation, article 14,
                sub-article 5, when two or more persons are registered as co-holder of a right on
                single land holding, the verifying officer shall, unless proved otherwise, presume that
                each of the joint holders have equal share on the land and verify the right accordingly

                Transferability: Pursuant to condominium proclamation no.370/2003, article 1, sub-
                articles 1-5, unit holders of a condominium have a right to sell or transfer their unit,
                which implicates the transfer of the undivided share of interest in the common
                element as common elements are not divisible.

                The above proclamation, article 9, sub article 5 specifically stipulates that any legal
                act on a unit shall also be effective up on the undivided share of interest.

Informal        Legal recognition: Urban land holding registration proclamation no.818/2014 article
settlements     6, sub-article 4, in order to regularize possession held without the authorization of the
                appropriate body, the possession which have to be found acceptable in accordance
                with urban plan and parcelling standards following the regulations to be issued by the
                region and city administration shall be administered by lease holding. As per the
                above proclamation, if the unauthorized settlements can be accommodated as per the
                regularization regulation provisions of the region and city administration; and if the
                possession of unauthorized settlements is not contravening urban plan and parcelling
                standards, it can be administered under lease holding system. Yet, those unauthorized
                settlements not accommodated by the region and city administration regulation as
                well as those contravening urban plan and parcelling standards are not legally

Unauthorized settlements are not registered directly. As per urban land holding
registration proclamation no.818/2014 article 6, sub-article 4, unauthorized settlement
must be administered under urban land lease holding system in order to be registered,
fulfilling the following conditions:

      The possessions are legally recognized, as per regularization regulation
       provision of the region or city administration.
    The possessions are not contravening urban plan and parcel sub-division
       standard of the region or City administration.
Transferability: informal transactions are not legally recognized by the lease holding
proclamation no.721/2011 albeit in practice there is informal transaction.

It shall be noted that despite the lack of legality privileges in de jure regulation,
informal land market perpetuates due to the informal are expecting regularization and
recognition in the registration system one day and by occasional legal decision tracing
the history of continual time line based regularization conducted in Ethiopia.

3.6 Land administration institutions11

Institutional setup is one of the most important factors contributing to the success of land
administration systems through transforming legal tools and policies into practice. It is believed that
institutional mandates shall emanate from legal provisions. Since 1975, Ethiopia decided to
administer and mange its lands by enacting two different proclamations. Proclamation 31/1975 was
enacted to nationalize all rural lands and proclamation 47/1975 to nationalize all urban lands and
extra houses. Since then, Ethiopia administers and manages rural and urban lands by different legal
systems and institutions. After the overthrow of the military government, Ethiopia adopted a new
constitution that established the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in 1995. Since 1995, the
country has Federal Government, nine Regional States and two chartered city administration. The
division of power between the Federal Government and the Regional States is asserted by the 1995
constitution. Enacting laws for utilization and conservation of land and other natural resources is
vested in the Federal Government pursuant to Article 51. Sub-article 5 of the Federal Constitution.
Regional States are vested with the power to administrate land and other natural resources in
accordance with the federal laws as provided under Article 52. Sub-article 2(d) of the Federal
Constitution.

At Federal Government level, Ministry of Agriculture is mandated to oversee the rural land sector
while the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Construction is mandated to oversee the
urban land sector. The Ethiopian Mapping Agency (EMA), established at Federal level, is
responsible for countrywide topographic mapping and for the establishment and maintenance of
geodetic control points. It has also a responsibility to carry out aerial photography, surveying and
orthophoto map production, which can be used for rural and urban land cadastre. Information
Network Security Agency (INSA) is another Federal institution mandated to capture, process, store
and disseminate geo-spatial data in the country, which benefit both rural and urban land cadastre.
The INSA has recently developed a national spatial data management policy and currently working
on National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) system development.

The day to day responsibility of overseeing rural land administration, in the Ministry of Agriculture,
lies under the responsibility of Land Administration & Use Directorate (LAUD), which is one of the
directorates found under the state minister for natural resources development, conservation and
utilization. The LAUD is responsible for overseeing land use and land tenure of rural lands outside
large scale agricultural investment lands. Specifically, the LAUD is responsible to follow-up
implementation of the Rural Land Administration and Use Proclamation 456/2005, enacted by the
Federal Government, by providing professional support to the regional rural land administration
institutions and coordinating competent authorities working on land related issues. In addition, the
LAUD has to create and facilitate information exchange between regions and contribute on capacity
development of the regional institutions. The directorate links the work at the federal level with that
at the regional level and provides inputs for policy making to advance the harmonization of rural
land administration in Ethiopia. The MoA has the responsibility to develop standards for rural land
administration purposes. There are remarkable success stories registered in rural land administration

Under the Ministry of Agriculture, there is a newly established semi-autonomous agency to
administer large scale agricultural investment lands, which is called Agricultural Investment Land
Administration Agency (AILAA). The AILAA is responsible for federal level management and lease
of state holdings. The regional states mange agricultural investment lands up to 5,000 ha. The agency
is delegated by the regional states to handle all large scale agricultural investment lands above the
limit indicated above. In the last five years, the agency transferred 2.4 million hectares of land for
national and foreigner investors. However, it is only 840 thousand ha of land that is brought into
agricultural production13.

As presented above, the responsibility to administer and to manage land and natural resources is
given to the regional states. Accordingly, regional states have enacted regional land laws and
established land administration and management institutions for rural and urban lands following the
federal pattern. Although the regional implementing institutions for rural land administration are
varying between regional states, in naming and organizational setting, there are offices at regional,
zonal and woreda administrative levels in all the nine regional states. Some regions, such as Amhara,
extended their office to the Kebele level, which is the lowest administrative structure.

There are local level institutions established to implement land administration systems, which are
called Land Administration & Use Committees (LAUC). Land administration and use committee
members are volunteers elected by land holders in each kebele to implement the land administration
system. The participation of landholders in implementing land administration system is guaranteed

through public hearings and meetings (direct participation) as well as through the elected land
administration committee members. In some regions, Shemaglewoch Shengo (traditional arbitration
committee) is established in each Kebele to handle land related conflicts using traditional rules. It
plays a key role in integrating customary (traditional) law into the formal setting. The Shemaglewoch
Shengo is established according to land law. The active involvement of land holders both directly
through public hearings and indirectly through their representatives in land administration
committees and shemaglewoch shengo is a good lesson in which the Ethiopian system can contribute
for other countries in similar situation. Institutional establishments of the rural land administration is
presented in table 5.

Looking the urban land administration and management, the Ministry of Urban Development,
Housing and Construction institutionalized itself by establishing two state ministerial offices (see
figure 1), nine bureaus and other supportive offices on the following objectives, responsibilities and
mandates.

          undertake studies relating to urbanization, and set criteria for grading urban centers;
          provide all-round and coordinated support to urban centers to make them development
           centers capable of influencing their surroundings;
          provide capacity building support to urban centers for improving their service delivery; and
           where necessary, organize training and research centers in the field of urban development;
          in cooperation with regional states, undertake studies for the integration of urban and rural
           development activities; assist and follow-up the implementation of same;
          follow up the activities of city administrations accountable to the federal government;

      undertake studies for setting general directions for urban dwellers to build residential houses
       compatible with their own means; provide capacity building support to urban centers for the
       implementation of same;
      undertake studies for the integration of urban development with poverty reduction activities,
       and support the implementation of same;
      promote the expansion of micro and small enterprises;
      without prejudice to the powers given by law to other organs, set and follow up the
       compliance of standards for construction works;
      create conducive conditions for the development of internationally competitive construction
       industry;
      provide necessary support in the preparation of designs and contract documents for, and in
       the supervision of building constructions financed by the federal government;
      register and issue certificates of professional competence to engineers and architects;
       determine the grades of contractors and consultants, and issue certificates of competence to
       those operating in more than one regional states;
      undertake research for improving the types and qualities of local construction materials;

At regional level there are different institutional arrangement. In some regions, urban land
administration and management is established as trade, industry and urban development, such as in
the case of Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) and in some regions it is
organized as industry and urban development, such as in the case of Amhara National Regional
State. Keeping the regional level arrangement, the structure goes down to Zonal level. Below zonal
level, city administrations are responsible for urban land administration and management.

In addition to administrative structures indicated above, population level is used to determine status
of urban centres or city administrations. The categorization is small towns with a population of 2,000
- 20,000; medium towns with a population of 20,001 - 50,000; large towns with a population of
50,001 - 100,000; cities with a population of 100,001 - 1,000,000; and metropolis with a population
of > 1,000,000. Accordingly, there are 850 small towns, 84 medium towns, 20 large towns, 16 cities
and 1 metropolitan. The total number of parcels that are managed by the urban land administration
and management is estimated to be 6.5 million.

Ethiopia's urbanization and industrialization is speeded up in the last decade. Expansion of towns
always bring more land from the surrounding agricultural fields into the built up environment. These
are the areas where cooperation between the urban land administration and the rural land
administration institutions needs to cooperate and work together to make the transfer to happen
smoothly.

3.7 Federal level institutions mandated to manage state owned lands

There are state owned lands, defined as public lands, managed by different federal Governmental
institutions in accordance the type and nature of the resource and product in which the land is used.
The Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA) is responsible in managing protected areas
for the purpose of developing fauna and flora of the country in significantly populated areas. The
Authority manages 20 national parks, 2 wildlife sanctuaries, 2 wildlife reserves, 17 controlled
hunting areas and 7 open hunting areas.

The recently established Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) is mandated to conserve and
developed state owned forests and forest areas and to market forest products. The total estimated area
that fall under the ministry's management is about 3.5 million ha. The forest type encompasses
natural forest area and plantation. The type of plantations can be categorized as plantation developed
for lumber production and plantations established for fuel-wood production. Some regions, such as
Amhara and Oromiya, have established forest enterprises to manage their forest resources. In
addition, the MoEF provides extension services to smallholder farmers in forest resources
development for their own household consumption and to market for their own household income
generation.

Ethiopia has an ambitious plan to bust up the number of sugar factories to 13 from the current 3
factories. Most of them have already established sugar cane plantation in thousands of hectares
managed by the Ethiopian sugar corporation. These plantations sites are managed by the Ethiopian
sugar industries development corporation owned by the federal government. The plantation sites are
established in the pastoral areas where the government claims that the land is publicly owned. There
are a few public lands managed by the ministry of mines and energy. In the urban context, the
MoUHC is responsible for the management of public lands. There are public lands in cities and
towns managed by public institutions. During urban expansion, once the land is acquired from the
surrounding rural kebeles, it becomes a public land and is managed by the urban land low.

3.8 Land disputes and institutions for dispute resolution

3.8.1. An overview of land disputes

Historically, the origin of many conflicts in Ethiopia may be traced back to disputes over land.
There was little attention given to land administration in general and land dispute settlement
mechanisms in particular. Even if land dispute constituted much of the courts cases starting from the
imperial period, cases were supposed to be handled through the formal judicial system. During the
period of the military government, rural land dispute settlement was handled mainly by a local
peasant association (PA) without a right to appeal to formal courts, and as a result the process was
spoiled with corruption and inefficiency.

For the first time a rural land administration proclamation was promulgated at Federal level in 1997
(Proc. 89/1997) even if it failed to address issues of land dispute. Nevertheless, regional states tried


                                                                                                     39
to incorporate rural land dispute settlement mechanism in their respective rural land administration
proclamations. The Federal Rural Land Administration Proclamation 89/1997 was replaced with the
current proclamation in 2005 which among others provides a guiding principle on dispute settlement
mechanism.

There is no overarching urban land administration legislation like its rural counterpart and hence no
specific urban land dispute settlement mechanism. However, this issue is treated under the different
municipal and lease laws which one way or the other are related to urban land.

Land dispute is one of the major types of disputes in Ethiopia which arises from different sources as
indicated above. In the present rural Ethiopia, the root cause of dispute is shortage of agricultural
land in the face of high population pressure and very limited alternative means of livelihood. This
can be manifested in the form of boundary conflict, encroachment and land grab of community
owned, divorce, land transaction related conflicts (inheritance, donation and lease) and corruption by
land administration officers and the like.

One of the objectives of the current rural land administration proclamation is to create conducive
environment to resolve land dispute amicably and efficiently. It envisages that “where dispute arises
over rural landholding right, effort shall be made to resolve the dispute through discussion and
agreement of the concerned parties. Where the dispute could not be resolved by agreement, it shall
be decided by an arbitral body to be elected by the parties or decided in accordance with the rural
land administration laws of the region.” The law prefers the resolution of disputes at local level with
the assistance of the land administration institutional apparatus before it resorts to judicial one. The
law also aims to reduce disputes through systematic registration and certification of landholdings.
Land certification is the best measure to reduce land dispute and enhance tenure security among land
holders and users. Hence, one of the results which was hoped to be achieved during the initial stage
of the registration process in Ethiopia was a significant fall in the number of land disputes. The
assumption had been that unclear land boundaries were the main reasons for land related conflicts.

In the rural land administration part, in spite of all the impressive gains of the land registration and
certification activities in Ethiopia, the number of land disputes among landholders and family
members is increasing at an alarming rate. It is not strange now to see Courts in many parts of the
country being congested with land-related cases and farmers filling their halls. For instance, it is
reported that land related disputes are claiming more than 70 percent of civil litigations, table 6, and
48 percent of homicide crimes in the Amhara Region Courts. This shows that the source of land
conflict is wider than what was anticipated. Field study in Amhara region and interviews conducted
with regional land experts indicated that besides boundary dispute, cases also emanate during
inheritance, rental, and community land encroachment16. Although the magnitude is different, the
trend is similar in the other regions.

3.8.2 Institutions for dispute resolution

Federal and Regional land laws and court establishment laws show that there are various avenues for
land dispute settlement. Regular courts (woreda/first instance, high, and supreme) are recognized as
having binding power over all disputes including one emanating from land. However, in some
instances, administrative authorities entertain land related disputes even without having specific
authority under the law.


               17
                    Taken from panel 8 background report

                                                                                                             41
It is observed that regional rural land laws are not similar in adopting provisions to resolve a land
disputes. However, there is a similarity in that all regions recognize customary or village level
arbitration as starting point in dispute settlement stage. In most cases, while the poor and vulnerable
group tends to try first their case by arbitration, the rich and the powerful usually skip arbitration and
rather prefer courts. With regard to procedure which shall be followed by rural land arbitration
committee, even if some regions are good in elaborating the role of arbitration committee and the
procedure for dispute settlement, it is not uniformly followed by all. Amhara and Tigray regions are
providing detailed procedures to be followed by the arbitral committees.

There are also religious courts recognized by the constitution as operating side by side with regular
courts. The federal Constitution under Article 78.5 recognizes the possibility of establishment of
“religious and customary courts” besides the regular courts. As a result, Sharia courts are esta blished
at Federal and Regional levels. The consent of both parties is necessary for the Sharia courts to
entertain the case according to Islamic laws.

There are also other types of land related dispute hearing tribunals operating in urban areas:
municipal courts and clearance and compensation hearing tribunals. Urban municipal courts operate
on some limited level. When the city administration becomes a party, municipal courts are the ones
to hear the case. In the event of expropriation of land, there might be claims related to compensation,
public purpose or ownership/holding rights. In this case the urban land clearance and compensation
hearing tribunal which is responsible to the city administration and possesses a qusi-judicial power,
will hear the case. The urban land clearance and compensation hearing tribunal is administrative
body with quasi-judical power, and the judges put in this tribunal are not legally trained judges but
people working within the urban land administration institution, and this makes their competence
questionable at best. They have neither clear procedure to follow during dispute settlement nor legal
knowledge to interpret the law.

3.9 Tax reforms Institutions for taxations

The Federal government of Ethiopia has attempted to rationalize the tax structure, broaden the tax
base, and improve equity, fairness, consistency, in the administration and the tax laws so as to
increase revenues performance. As part of this reform program, the government has undertaken
different tax policy measures through designing and implementation of six projects under tax policy
and administration package.

The Government has been introducing tax policy and administration reforms over the last twenty two
years; specifically during the last ten years tax policy and administration reform was comprehensive
and intensive in nature. On the policy side, rate schedules have been rationalized and the numbers of
rate slabs have been substantially reduced. Moreover, Value Added Tax (VAT) has been introduced
as a replacement of conventional sales tax in 2003 and foreign trade tariffs brought down from the
maximum of 230 percent to a maximum of 35 percent by the reforms. In parallel to tax policy
reform, tax administration reform has taken place. In line to tax administration reform objective,
Revenues Board was replaced by the Ministry of Revenues in 2001 to lead the tax system reform and
the Tax Reform Taskforce was established to deepen tax policy and administration reforms. An
                                                                                                       42
inter-ministerial steering committee chaired by the Ministry of Capacity Building- unique ministerial
office established to lead the national reform program to refine and support the tax system reform
program.

The most notable tax administration reform has taken place recently in 2009 which centralized tax
collection by merging different tax collection authorities under one umbrella headquarters. This
administration reform was the result of Business Process Reengineering (PBR) study which was
carried out to streamline the process of the tax administration operations with a view of process
efficiency and effectiveness. As a result, the BPR study came up with the new proposal of merging
different tax offices-Federal Inland Tax Authority (FIRA), Ethiopian Customs Authority (ECA) and
the regulatory ministry office-Ministry of Revenues (MoR) under one headquarters of Ethiopian
Revenues and Customs Authority (ERCA). The primary objective of the tax policy and
administration reform was to raise tax revenues measured in terms of tax to GDP ratio from less than
10 percent to 18 to 20 percent of over medium range plan after implementation of the reform
program. Land tax is collected by two different institutions. Rural land tax that include land tax and
income tax, is collected by the kebele administration and deposited to the woreda finance account. In
urban areas land tax and building tax is collected by municipal mandated institutions and deposited
in the account of the woreda finance. In all cases tax collected goes to the government treasury.

3.10 Human resource development for the land sector

The country's progress in education sector is remarkable. Up to the end of firs GTP, the number of
universities in the country reached 33 with a total capacity of about 500,000 students. The plan for
the second GTP period is to build 10 more universities, which makes the total number of universities
43 at the end of the second GTP period. Out of the existing 33 universities, currently operating, it is
only three universities that offer comprehensive land administration training. These universities are
Bahir Dar, Woldia and Haromaya universities. The two universities, Woldia and Haromaya, not yet
started producing trained manpower. There are some land related courses at Civil service University.
Bahir Dar University, received the first batch of students in 2006, the average annual enrolment in
the Institute of Land Administration (ILA) is about 80 students, far below the sector requires per
year. The first batch graduated in 2010. Up to July 2015, the number of graduates from the university
is 1,015 (M 853 and F 162).

Ethiopia has developed National Technical Vocational and Education and Training (TVET) strategy
in 2008. As stated in the national TVET strategy document18, the overall objective of the National
TVET Strategy is to create a competent, motivated, adaptable and innovative workforce in Ethiopia
contributing to poverty reduction and social and economic development through facilitating demand-
driven, high quality technical and vocational education and training, relevant to all sectors of the
economy, at all levels and to all people. To insure the coordination and effective implementation of
the TVET strategy, the Federal Government Established Technical and Vocational Education and

Training Agency (FTA) under the Ministry of Education in 201119. Some of the objectives of the
agency are;

      to ensure that technical and vocational education and training is properly organized and its
       quality and sustainability are maintained with a view to realizing the country's objectives for
       economic and social progress; and
      to ensure that equitable training is provided to citizens and that all training programs are
       based on the country's development strategies and labor market needs.

In accordance to the TVET strategy and requirement, the Ministry of Agriculture has initiated
production of trained manpower at a technical level recently. With the support from the Government
of Finland, through the Responsible and Innovative Land Administration (REILA) project, a new
Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) program on Rural Land Cadastre and
Registration launched in Assosa Agricultural TVET college. This initiative is a significant milestone
in human resource development in the land sector of Ethiopia, which is needed at grassroots level. A
study conducted20 to estimate and project human resource needs of the country in the land sector
reported that 36,200, 47,400 and 55,200 in 5 years, 10 years and 20 years time respectively. Out of
this estimated and projected human resources demand, 70% is proposed to come from the Technical
and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs.

3.11 Research on environment, forest and other natural resources

The Federal Government of Ethiopia established Environment and Forest research Institute, which is
an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Environment and Forest (Regulation 327/2014).
This research institute conduct research on environment, forest and other natural resources on its
own and coordinate research activities implemented by the regional research organizations. It also
coordinate similar research activities conducted by academic institutions. The institute has eight
technical directorates that includes Plantation and agroforestry research directorate, forest resources
utilization research directorate, natural ecosystem and management research directorate, forest
protection research directorate, climate science research directorate, environmental pollution and
management research directorate and socio economics, policy extension and gender research
directorate. Furthermore, the institute has planning, monitoring and evaluation sections, public
relation section and administrative and finance sections. It has developed a 10 years, (2015 - 2025)
strategic plan and aiming to be a centre of excellence in environment and forest research in Africa by
2025. The strategy focuses on technology adaptation and generation, research coordination, and
capacity building and system development.

3.12 Current initiatives on urban and rural land administration in Ethiopia

As it is mentioned many times in this report, Ethiopia administers its urban and rural land by
establishing separate institutions and legal frameworks since 1975. Bilateral and multi-lateral
projects are initiated in accordance to this separation. In the urban land administration, there are a
few projects compared to the rural land administration. One of them is a project called Modernized
Property Tax System project (2013 - 2016). This project is implemented in three town (Bahir Dar,
Dire Dawa and Mekele) and financed by Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. The project will create
a modernized urban property tax system that aims at the creation of a substantial, consistent and
equitable urban property tax that will provide a source of general revenues to provide for the
recurrent operation and maintenance of local public services. Another project to mention is Ethiopian
urban expansion initiative that works on 18 towns with the objective of preparing land at the
expansion areas up to 2040. The project is implemented in cooperation with New York University.

However, the country's rural land administration initiative has attracted many development partners
in support of the country's effort. Main contributions of initiated projects are directed to technical
capacity building, awareness creations to the public at large, policy and legal framework gap
analysis, rural cadastral works, institutional and human capacity development. Almost all projects
are in the rural land sector are coordinated by the Rural Land Administration and Use Directorate of
the Ministry of Agriculture. These initiatives are briefly presented in this section of the country
report.

3.12.1 Land Administration and Land Use Development Project (LALUDEP) (2009/10 - 2015/16)

The ELALUDEP is summarized concept note developed by the Ministry of Agriculture, as roadmap
for the development of the land sector, to share Ethiopia's commitment with development partners in
order to solicit funding. This document is meant as a working document during the GTP period,
2010/11 - 2014/15. As presented in the document, the overall objective of the ELALUDEP is to
improve land administration and land use planning and implementation in order to achieve
sustainable land management by enhancing security of tenure of small holder farmers, pastoralists
and agro pastoralist through efficient and effective land policies and legislation, cost-effective land
holding certification and responsive and sustainable land administration. The ELALUDEP describes
the challenges in the land sector that include policy and legal frameworks, institutional arrangements,
technical and financial aspects. It outlines a very ambitious plans to finalize all rural cadastre, more
than 40 million parcels, and issue second level land holding certificates during the GTP period. It
presents financial, material and human resources requirement for such voluminous plan to be
effectively implemented. It had served to initiate discussion with development partners and
contribute for materialization of many land projects during the GTP period

3.12.2 Community-Based Integrated Natural Resources Management Project in Lake Tana
Watershed (2010 - 2017)

This 7-year project focuses on the Lake Tana watershed (LTW) within Amhara National Regional
State (ANRS). As described in the project document, it will pioneer a new approach in Ethiopia
                                                                                                     45
under the national SLM platform, which has been developed in the spirit of TerrAfrica initiative and
the GEF’s Strategic Investment Program. The project’s goal is to contribute to poverty eradication
undertakings in the watershed and its objective is to increase household income through
disseminating and up-scaling of sustainable land management practices in the watershed.
Simultaneously, ecosystem integrity will be improved, and global environmental benefits realized:
these include carbon sequestered in the land and CO2 emission reduced at rural household level
through alternative energy supply, biodiversity (including agro-biodiversity) of global importance
protected, and the source of the Blue Nile conserved. The project is under implementation in Lake
Tana watershed and supported by GEF-IFAD funding. The project will build on the baseline and
provide incremental funding to ensure sustainable land management, delivering both local and global
benefits. As presented in the project document, the project’s immediate objective will be achieved
through the following four components

       Institutional, Legal, Policy Analysis and Reform Enabled (Land administration, second level
        certification is included in this component)
       Alternative Livelihood Options diversified and adopted
       Community -Based Integrated Watershed Management implemented
       Project Management and Coordination

3.12.3 Sustainable Land Management Project (SLMP) (Phase 2, 2014 - 2018/19)

Ethiopia, in collaboration with multi-donor groups, has launched a15 years national initiative named
Ethiopian Sustainable Investment Framework for Sustainable Land Management (ESIF-SLM) Project
that seeks partnerships among different stakeholders committed to harmonize and align their
investments in order to alleviate rural poverty through restoring, sustaining and enhancing the
productive capacity, protective functions and bio-diversity of Ethiopia’s natural ecosystem resources
(FDRE/MoARD, 2008). Accordingly, Sustainable Land Management Project (SLMP) launched. The
overall goal of SLMP is to provide an integrated holistic framework to effectively address poverty,
vulnerability, and land degradation in order to improve the livelihoods of land users while restoring
ecosystem functions and ensuring sustainable land management.

The SLMP is a holistic framework under which government, civil society, and development partners
can work together to promote and scale up SLM. With the support from the World Bank, GEF, and
other donors, Project implementation is in progress already in six regional states that includes
Amhara, Oromia, Tigray, SNNP, Beneshangul Gumuz, and Gambela. According to the project
implementation manual (PIM) (2014),the Project has four components, namely:
       Integrated Watershed and Landscape Management;
       Institutional Strengthening, Capacity Development and Knowledge Generation and
        Management;
        Rural Land Administration, Certification and Land Use; and
       Project Management



                                                                                                 46
3.12.4 Responsible and Innovative Land Administration (REILA) Project (2011 - 2016)

The REILA Project is a land administration project found under implementation through the bilateral
agreement made between the Governments of Ethiopia and Finland. REILA focuses particularly on
two areas of Ethiopia, in Benishangul-Gumuz National Regional State and Tana-Beles development
Growth Corridor in Amhara National Regional State. The Finnish cooperation supports ESIF in
addressing the interlinked problems of poverty, vulnerability and land degradation at the rural
community level, and more specifically ESIF's component 2 of improving Ethiopia's land
administration and certification system. Thus the Overall Development Objective of the Finnish
support is adopted from ESIF: improved livelihood and economic well-being of the rural population
through promotion of sustainable land management practices. The support is also based on ESIF's
key guiding principles of ecological, socio-cultural, and economical sustainability, as well as
institutional sustainability. The Purpose of the Finnish support is to have an improved and
appropriate land administration system for Ethiopia, and to that end Finland:

      Support public information and participation in Ethiopian land administration, with a focus
       on Benishangul-Gumuz and Amhara regions;
      Support capacity building at the federal level through the newly established Directorate for
       Rural Land Administration and Use in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development;
       and capacity building for Ethiopian Mapping Agency;
      Support basic capacity building for land administration in the Benishangul-Gumuz region;
      Support improved process and capacity for responsible land allocation for investments in the
       Tana-Beles Growth Corridor; and
      Support university level education in Ethiopia in the field of land administration.

The project has institutionalised rural cadastre and land registration training at Assosa Agricultural
Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) college. The program is launched in 2014 at
level III in accordance to the Ethiopian TVET program requirement. The project supports the
development of National Rural Land Administration Information System (NRLAIS) development.

3.12.5 Land Administration to Nurture Development (LAND) Project (2013 - 2018)

Land Administration to Nurture Development (LAND) is a follow - on project to two previous land
administration projects implemented in Ethiopia,
           1. Ethiopia – Strengthening Land Administration Program (ELTAP); and
           2. Ethiopia – Strengthening Land Administration (ELAP)

The projects were implemented in the regional states of, Amhara, Oromia, SNNP, and Tigray, Afar
& Somali with funding from USAID/ETHIOPIA. LAND Project activities are implemented with &
through the Ministry of Agriculture’s Land Administration and Use Directorate (MOA/LAUD) & the
regional land administration bureaus of Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somali, SNNP, and Tigray.

The LAND Project has four Components:

                                                                                                   47
   1. Improving policy & legal frameworks at national & regional levels;
   2. Building capacity in national, regional & local land administration and use planning;
   3. Strengthening capacity of Ethiopian Universities to engage in policy analysis & research
      related to land tenure & train land administration & land use professionals ; and
   4. Strengthening community land rights in pastoral & agro-pastoral areas to facilitate market
      linkages and improve pastoral livelihoods

The LAND project is leading at the moment the revision of proclamation 456/2005 and supporting
different studies that eventually lead for a comprehensive land policy and land use policy for
development in Ethiopia.

3.12.6 Land Investment for Transformation (LIFT) Project (2014 - 2019)

Land Investment for Transformation (LIFT) project is a land administration project found under
implementation through the bilateral agreement made between the Governments of Ethiopia and
British Government. Major objective of the project is to improve the incomes of the rural poor and to
enhance economic growth, through support to:

   •   second level land certification
   •   improved rural land administration, transparency, and regulatory environment
   •   development of the rural land sector to enhance productivity and investment

The project assumes that cadastre based land certification and sustainable land administration,
supported by market initiatives brings:
   • increased security of tenure
   • reduced level of dispute
   • increased productivity of land
   • higher incomes for farmers
   • greater empowerment of women and disadvantaged
   • better environmental practices
   • improved domestic revenue collection

The project uses Aerial image for second level certification and operates in Amhara, Oromiya, SNNP
and Tigray regions.

3.12.7 Ethiopia’s Agriculture Sector Policy and Investment Framework (PIF) (2010 - 2020)

The Policy and Investment Framework (PIF) provides a strategic framework for the prioritisation
and planning of investments that will drive Ethiopia’s agricultural growth and development. As
described, it is designed to operationalise the CAADP Compact signed by the Government and its
development partners. The PIF is a 10-year road map for development that identifies priority areas
for investment. It is anchored to, and aligned with, the national vision of becoming a middle income
country by 2020 together with a number of key policy and strategic statements. The CAADP


                                                                                                  48
Compact and the PIF are critical in policy alignment and securing access to the finance needed for
sectoral development from both domestic budgetary and international sources.

The agricultural sector, critically important to both overall economic performance and poverty
alleviation, has performed strongly over most of the last decade, but there is still substantial scope to
sustainably improve productivity, production and market linkages. Government has demonstrated
strong commitment to the sector through allocation of more than 15% of the total annual budget.

The Goal of the PIF is to “contribute to Ethiopia’s achievement of middle income status by 2020”.
The Development Objective aims to “sustainably increase rural incomes and national food
security”. This objective embodies the concepts of producing more, selling more, nurturing the
environment, eliminating hunger and protecting the vulnerable against shocks; all of which are
embodied in various national policy instruments, and are expressed in terms of four main themes,
each with its own and the following Strategic Objective:

      To achieve a sustainable increase in agricultural productivity and production
      To accelerate agricultural commercialization and agro-industrial development
      To reduce degradation and improve productivity of natural resources
      To achieve universal food security and protect vulnerable households from natural disasters

3.12.8 The Ethiopian Land Research and Development Network (ETHIOLANDNET) (Long-term)

The ETHIOLANDNET is a recent initiative, in the land sector, taken by the Institute of Land
Administration (ILA) at Bahir Dar University with other collaborators. ILA is the centre of
excellence in higher education on land administration in Ethiopia. Overall objective of the
ETHIOLANDNET is to provide the academic, research and development communities a forum for
promoting research and disseminate research outputs on land issues, providing access to the expertise
and information they need in the areas of land tenure, land administration and land management to
inform the nation’s research, training and development agenda in these fields.

The ILA and its collaborators took the initiative on the bases of;

      Realizing that research on land issues in Ethiopia is conducted on an ad hoc basis and the
       need for systematic, coordinated and sustained effort by institutions engaged and/or
       supporting such research;
      Recognizing that lack of a regular forum where findings of research and development efforts
       on land are discussed, debated and the proceedings published is limiting the ability of field-
       based evidence informing formulation of policy and development in the land sector;
      Noting that there is no central repository, where results of research and development work in
       the land sector in Ethiopia are archived and access to them is difficult and laborious;
      Desirous of promoting, facilitating and guiding research in land tenure, land administration
       and land management issues by researchers in Ethiopia.

   Among others, some of the functions of the Network are;
                                                                                                      49
   a). Developing and maintaining a roster of professionals, organizations, associations, Networks
       etc. working in land-related research and development in Ethiopia;
   b). Establishing and maintaining database on land-related research and development and serve as
       a national repository of data and information on research, development projects, legal
       documents, etc. on land tenure, land administration and land management and operating a
       website for online access to such data and information;
   c). Conducting research and development review meetings once a year;
   d). Establishing and strengthening linkages with national and international Networks;
   e). Disseminating information through publications of journals, newsletter, proceedings, reports,
       policy briefs, radio/television programs, websites, social media and other means;
   f). Identifying, promoting and supporting focus area of research among members;
   g). Facilitating joint research and development activities;
   h). Facilitating research grants on land issues to graduate students and other researchers;
   i). Contributing to curriculum development, harmonization and reviews of training in land
       tenure, land administration and land management upon request;
   j). Facilitating and enhancing the capacity of stakeholders;
   k). Working constructively with government and legislative bodies (local, regional and federal
       levels) on land issues.
   l). Organizing national and/or international conferences, conducting public lectures, seminars,
       symposia and workshops on land issues;
   m) Steering and coordinating the preparation of research and development projects to secure
       funds from supporters and donors.

3.13 Ethiopia's economic performance in a glance (till 2014/2015)

The agricultural sector is the trusted sector to transform Ethiopia's economy to a higher level of
performance and transformation to industrializations. This is due to the reason that agriculture has
the biggest labor force in the country, 85% of the population, it is the main contributor to the
country's export products, 85% of export earnings, and contribute 44% to the country's GDP 21. In
the long run, intended strategy of the country is to increase contribution of the industrial and service
sectors to the country's GDP growth and enable these sectors to overtake the contribution of the
agricultural sector step by step.

Taking into consideration the potential of the agricultural sector, according the existing Ethiopian
situation, for future growth and development of the country, the Ethiopian Government has
committed to design relevant policy and strategy to guide the country's economic development. The
basic policy foundation for Ethiopia's economic development is Agriculture Development Led
Industrialization (ADLI), which is a generic type policy. Abide by the policy, the Federal
Government made a commitment to allocate annual budget for the agricultural sector more than
10%, which is the minimum level agreed in Maputo 200322 by African heads of states while other
African countries allocate about 5% as average.

The periodic plans followed the ADLI, which includes Sustainable Development and Poverty
Reduction Program (SDPRP) 2002/03-2004/05, Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to
End Poverty (PASDEP) 2005/06-2009/10 and Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) 2010/11-
2014/15, gave significant emphasis for the agricultural sector. Agriculture in Ethiopia has
experienced steady growth since 200423. Planning for the GTP II, 2015/16 - 2019/20, is underway,
which is expected to give significant weight in budget allocation to the agricultural sector.

Though Ethiopia started to lean on the agricultural sector for its future development in the early
2000, the 2008 worldwide food crisis influenced the political leaders of Ethiopia to work hard on
how to remove obstacles in the agricultural sectors and make the agriculture sector a strong and
reliable driving force for the country's economic development. In this regard, as a think-tank
institution, the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) is established and mandated to target
major bottlenecks and look ways on how to remove them in order to boost agricultural production
and productivity24.

As indicated above, since 2003, Ethiopia has launched aggressive development goals in its periodic
plans to enable the country to reach at a middle income country by 2025. As reported 25, during the
Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP) plan period, the
country's achievement was a remarkable success. During this plan period, the country's real GDP
growth was targeted to reach 7 - 10%, in base and higher scenario respectively, but the achieved real
GDP growth was 11%26. When the achieved growth is disaggregated, agricultural and service sectors
registered beyond the higher scenario while the industry sector achieved a bit below the base
scenario. This higher performance has encouraged the country to plan for a higher and ambitious
targets. As indicated in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP), 2009/10 - 2014/15, the
minimum and maximum GDP growth expected is 11% and 15% respectively. During this plan
period, learning from other countries development path is found important and some Asian countries,
such as South Korea, are selected that can be used as an example in a reasonable adaptation and
adoption of their development path to the Ethiopian situation. The country registered successful
results in reducing poverty. The country's population living below the poverty line was 48% in 1990
and reduced to 29.6% in 2012 and targeted to reduce further to 22.2% in 201527. Nominal GDP per
capita has increased from 370 US$ to 538 US$ between 2010 and 201328.

There are Mega projects initiated during the PASDEP period and continued in the first GTP period
with additional Mega projects initiations. In the energy sector, the country has launch an ambitious
project in hydropower development. The Grand Renaissance Dam is the largest hydro-power project
in the country and expected to generate about six thousand mega-watt of electric power. When it is

network development is one of the Mega projects, which is going on to connect the capital city to
Djibouti port and internally to connect regional states. Developing big sugarcane farms and
establishing sugar production factories are part of the Mega projects initiated during the first GTP
period. The Government claim that the country's economic performance is the main reason that
enabled Ethiopia to host the third international conference on Financing for Development conducted
13-16 July 2015 in Addis Ababa.

3.14 The five years plan (2015/2016 - 2019/2020)

The Growth and Transformation Plan, GTP I, (2009/10 - 2014/205), has been completed. The
federal government has reported that two digit average annual growth is achieved although it is less
than the base scenario expected during the plan period. In the draft plan prepared for GTP II, it is
reported that the average annual growth achieved in GTP I was 10.2% while the expectation was
11.2%. One of the reason given for lower achievement is due to the lower achievement of the
agricultural sector growth. During the GTP II, expected average annual growth rate of the economy
is 12.2%.

In GTP II, Rural and Urban Land Administration is considered and targets are established. During
the plan period, a total of 28.6 million parcels, holdings of 7.2 million rural households, will be
surveyed, mapped and registered into the cadastral system, which covers 359 woredas. Large tracts
of land for agricultural investment will be transferred to national and foreigner investors.
Accordingly, 671,800 ha of land is the target to transfer during the plan period. On the urban land
management side, there is a plan to bring 1.6 million parcels in 91 towns into the urban cadastral
system. There is a plan to transfer 62,000 ha of public land to private sector through tender and
allotment. Establishment of modernized property tax system in 970 cities/towns is targeted. In the
forestry sector, there is a plan to increase the forest coverage of the country from the current 15.5%
to 20% at the end the plan period.

4. Summary of results of Dimensions analysis

An extended dimensions analysis have been conducted and documented in all the nine panels
background reports. In this report, results are extracted from each dimension analysis and are
condensed with additional explanations, when deemed necessary, and are presented in this part of
report. Dimension scores, after final comments and adjustments are made by panellists, are tabulated
and are presented for each panel. The tables include indicators, dimensions, scores and
statements/explanation of the scores. This is assumed to help the reader to understand the meaning of
the scores without any difficulties (Table 7 - Table 15). Following the summarized results of each
panel, conclusions and key recommendations are presented. On the tabulated results, descriptive
statistical analysis is performed to have an insight on performance status of each dimensions and to
make an informed judgments on the status of the practice compared with international practices
(Annex 2 - Annex 10). Furthermore, dimension results are aggregated to have an insight on the
performance level of the indicators and to make again an informed judgments (Table - 17 - Table 25
in the annex part of the report). Both information are presented in annexes. Detail policy
statement/recommendations are summarized for each dimension and are presented in policy matrix
and are presented in annex 11. The policy statements given specifically for each dimension are
believed to support monitoring of improvements of practices in each dimension areas. score card is
developed and is presented in annex12.

4.1.1 Recognition of a continuum of rights

1.1.1a Individuals' rural land tenure rights are legally recognized

Individual’s rural land rights are recognized under federal and regional land administration laws.
Most rural land holders’ rights were recognized since the nationalization of all rural lands under
Proclamation 31/1975 even if there were no certificates of holdings. Since 1995, land is given a
constitutional recognition and peasants, pastoralists and semi-pastoralists who are or wish to be
engaged in agriculture including women have the right to get land without charge for indefinite
period of time as well as the protection against eviction from the land they possess. Private investors
are also entitled to use land on the basis of rent payment for a specified period of time. According to
the proclamation 456/2005, rural land can be acquired either by allocation, redistribution-in irrigable
areas, settlement programs, donation or inheritance.

1.1.1b Individuals' rural land tenure rights are protected in practice.

It is necessary to analyze the translations of the rights enacted in the federal and regional land laws to
better understand whether individual land tenure rights protected in practice or not. The issuance of
the federal proclamation on Land Expropriation for Public Purposes and Payment of Compensation,
Proclamation No. 455/2005, was also a step in the right direction to protect the land rights of holders.
The proclamation is elaborated by regulation 137/2007. Before the issuance of the proclamation and
the regulation indicated above, government agencies and local administrative bodies, in most cases,
were expropriating farmers’ holdings without compensation under the pretext that land belongs to
the state. The bundle of rights protected in practice includes, rent out for a specific period, rent for
share cropping, pass though inheritance and gift. The Proclamation gives regional states the power to
issue directives. Amhara and Tigray have developed valuation and compensation guidelines. Most
regional states have not developed. There is a wide variation in compensation practices between
different projects; and across the different regions. Furthermore, the federal government’s
expropriation, valuation and compensation laws do not deal with valuation of communal lands and
compensation of holders or users of the communal lands.

1.1.2 Customary tenure rights are legally recognized and protected in practice.

Customary land use rights and other productive natural resources rights in Ethiopia are very popular
among the pastoral communities where livestock grazing, shifting cultivation and hunting practices
are common in regions like Afar, Ethiopian Somali, Benishangul Gumuz, SNNP, Oromiya and
Gambela regions. In Ethiopia, pastoralists reside mainly in semi-arid and arid lowlands that covers
the biggest part of the country. The customary land tenure system has been recognized under the
1995 Constitution and proclamation 456/2005. All regional states have enacted regional land laws
under the federal umbrella laws that recognize the rights of the pastoralists. However, the practice is
a concern. There are increased encroachment upon the pastoralists' land and water resources in favor
of interventions that are less useful for pastoral production and social organization. Large state and
private farms emerged and or expanded at the expense of pastoralist herders in different regions.


                                                                                                       55
1.1.3 Indigenous rights to land and forest are legally recognized and protected in practice.

There are no legally recognized indigenous groups or communities in Ethiopia. However, there are
vulnerable communities in remote areas of the country. For instance, the Gumuz, Berta, shinasha,
Mao and Komo in Benishangul Gumuz, the Anuak (Anywaa), Nuer, Majangir, Opo and Komo in
Gmbella Regional states, Mursi, Suri and many others in SNNP, the Borenna Ormos in Oramiya
Regional states are considered as vulnerable communities with their distinctive cultural and
traditional land tenure regimes. Different scholars and think thank institutions wrote that the lives
and livelihoods of these vulnerable communities continue to be endangered by land management and
governance policies put in place by the Ethiopian government keen to attract investment.

1.1.4 Urban land tenure rights are legally recognized and protected in practice.

Urban land and extra houses are nationalized by proclamation 47/1975, which abolished private
ownership that existed before. Since then, the country maintained the state ownership of the urban
land. However, successive legal instruments issued that includes proclamation 80/1993,
proclamation 272/2002, (FDRE 2002) and proclamation 721/2011 (FDRE 2011) to administer the
urban land. The tenure rights recognized in the currently operating proclamation 721/2011, are old
possessions, leasehold and condominiums. As it is indicated in the lease proclamation lease periods
differs based on the land use function starting from 50 years minimum to 99 years maximum. The
lease contract can be renewed when both parties agreed. When the municipalities want land for
development activities, based on change of urban plan, the contract shall not be renewed. The effect
of non-renewal of contract is that the land will be taken after the removal of any property erected on
the land by the owner. The compensation paid is only for the erected infrastructure based on a cost
replacement approach, which is not popular by the society. The federal government is committed to
ensure recognition of property rights by introducing a secure and sustainable real property
registration system focused on development of legal cadastre. The legal cadastre demanded new laws
to be formulated and implemented. The Urban Landholding Registration Proclamation No 818/2014
is the first in its kind in the country. This proclamation intends at creating a harmonized cadastral
system in the country. Organizational Structure at national, regional and city levels instituted. Clear
responsibilities for the different stakeholders at different levels are identified.

4.1.2 Respect for and enforcement of rights

1.2.1 Accessible opportunities for tenure individualization exist.

The federal rural land administration and use proclamation 456/2005 defines “communal holdings”
as land to be allocated to local residents for the common grazing, forestry and social services.
However, it further subjects such holdings to be transferred to individual holdings when the
government consider it necessary. This notion of the federal government is further strengthened in
the regions where customary land use is exercised.

In Benishangul-Gumuz, the proclamation affirms the Federal Proclamation which subject
communally held land to be converted to private holding upon the decision of the government. There

                                                                                                    56
is no provision either in the regulation or the directive that requires the decision of the Kebele
community for such conversion. The Afar regional state rural land administration and use
proclamation 49/2009 Article 5(8) clearly stipulates “no private holding allowed in the area assigned
for pastorals grazing land.” Moreover, it further declared “communal lands that are used communally
by pastoralist for grazing, and social services shall not be leased to investors. Similar provisions
stated in the Ethiopian Somali Regional State Rural Land Administration and Use proclamation No.
128/2013 Article 5 (9 & 10). However, in some areas where communal use is threatened by external
forces, the community resort for individualized use.

1.2.2a. Individual land in rural areas is registered and certified with book of holdings.

According to the data compiled from the federal land administration and use directorate annual
reports of MoA, there are 560 districts, 13,846 rural Kebele administrations, close to 50 million
parcel of land, and 11 million households with an average 4.5 parcels of landholdings in the four
major regions. Reportedly, over 10.2 million households registered their parcels in the first level
registration program and of which 9.5 million households got their landholding certificates. A
number of studies show that the first level registration and certification of rural land has attained its
primary objective of enhancing tenure security to individual landholders.

However, due to lack of experience and methodology in communal land surveying and registrations,
pastoral areas are not covered in the registration programs of the country. Now pastoralists are
claiming that their communal lands should be surveyed registered and certificate of holdings should
be issued to user communities to protect their communal land holdings. Pastoralists presented
petitions to government officials at the 2014 National Pastoralists’ Day that their communal lands
should be registered and certificates of holding be issued to them.

1.2.2b Individual land in rural areas is registered and mapped.

As indicated above, there are more than 50 million parcel of land, and 11 million households with an
average 4.5 parcels. Current reports indicate that about 1.8 million parcel, about 4 %, of individual
rural landholdings registered and mapped by using various surveying technologies such as Hand held
GPS, Total Stations, RTK GPS, and ortho-images. There is big movement by regional states using
their own resources and resources obtained from development partners to cove wide areas by ortho-
mage for second level registration.

1.2.3 Individual land in urban areas is recorded and mapped.

The Ministry of Urban Development and House Construction has decided on implementation of a
cadastral surveying and land registration project in all Ethiopian towns and cities which have more
than 20,000 inhabitants (87 towns) in the coming few years. The MUDHC has selected 23 towns for
the first phase according to population size priority order. The total estimated built up area of the 23
towns excluding Addis Ababa found to be about 1,862 sq.km. This indicates that the size of
registered and mapped urban land is small.


                                                                                                      57
1.2.4 The number of illegal land sales is low.

In principle, land sale is forbidden by the competent Ethiopian laws. Some studies indicates that
there are illegal land sales both in urban and rural areas. The practice seems common in peri-urban
areas. In most cases the source of illegality emanated from the imbalance between the demand and
supplied sides. When access to urban land and basic services are beyond the reach of low and
middle-income people through the formal institutions people look for the other way out. One of the
employed mechanism to stop illegal land deals is the use of coercion approach refers to all forms of
legal and/non legal measures that result in the forceful eviction of illegal settlers. In most towns and
cities of Ethiopia, this approach has often been in the form of bulldozing of illegal structures and the
use of the law and the courts to evict illegal settlers.

1.2.5 The number of illegal lease transactions is low.

Though land markets are underdeveloped in the urban centres of Ethiopia significant amount of
capital money transacts in the economy. According to recent information, 2013, the urban lease price
index report published by MUDHC, the average bid winning price per square meter for mixed use in
Addis Ababa city was 9, 610.00 ET Birr. One year later in May 2014 the Addis Ababa city
administration announced its 8th round lease bid. In this specific bid one of the parcels set for
auction has a mixed land use function with 202 square meter total area and a lease benchmark price
of 290.00 ET Birr. According to the result announced after 3 weeks showed that the winner quoted
65, 552.00 ET Birr with 20% down payment for the same parcel of land. This shows that more than
55,000.00 ET Birr increment than the average winning price per square meter just in a year, and
therefore it leads to the emergence of artificial and sky rocketed land price per square meter. There
are restrictions on the size of land that can be leased/rented out by private land holders in the rural
land sectors. The restriction varies between regions. However, the restriction are not fully respected.
As illegal lease transaction are not recorded, it is not easy to trace and get reliable information.

1.2.6 Women’s property rights in lands as accrued by relevant laws are recorded

During implementation phase of land rights’ adjudication, cadastral surveys, and registration
women’s land right sought high level of attention and cares. According to RLAUD30, in Amhara
region there are about 3.5 million estimated households of which 3.4 have registered and completed
first level certification of their holdings. About 52% of land holdings are registered in the name of
both spouses, 27% in women and 21% are registered in men in Amhara. Similarly, out of more than
4 million estimated land holders in Oromiya regional state 3.4 registered their land holdings and of
which 84% have received their first level land holding certificate/book as of June 2013. About 54%
of land holdings are registered in the name of both spouses, 16 % in women and 30 % are registered
in men in Oromiya. In SNNP, from registered land holders, about 51% of land holdings are
registered in the name of both spouses, 12 % in women and 37 % are registered in men. Whereas in
Tigray national regional states, from the registered land holders, about, 13 % land holdings are
registered in women while 68 % in the name of both husband and wives and the balance is in men's
name.

1.2.7   Women’s property rights to land are equal to those of men

One of the underlying public policies principles of Government of Ethiopia stipulates that all
interventions have to be gender sensitive and can ensure equitable development for all women and
men. Consistent with this public policy principles, Article 35 of the Ethiopian Constitution (1995)
restates principles of equality of access to economic opportunities, including the right to equality in
employment and land rights. Moreover, all federal and regional land laws boldly recognize women’s
land rights equally with that of men. However, in practice, in areas and societies where polygamy is
allowed, the right written in the legal system is not respected.

4.1.3 Conclusions and key recommendations

   i.   Registration and certification of rural land holdings is conducted without formally enacted
        registration and cadastral laws. Therefore, registration and cadastral laws should be
        developed and enacted. Methodology for communal lands registration and certification
        should be developed and pastoral community areas registration and certification has to be
        conducted in time.
 ii.    Issues of compulsory land expropriation, valuation and compensation, and rehabilitation laws
        are concern areas that need revisiting, There is a need to carry on empirical research
        undertakings to inform policy makers to enable them to take corrective measures.
 iii.   The current municipal land supplies for the market and the price signals have to be studied
        under the context of understanding the viability of the land lease system and its policy
        implications
 iv.    A proper study has to be conducted before a pastoral area is allocated to large scale
        agricultural investments in order to leave to the pastoralist the very critical areas for their
        livelihood.
  v.    There is a need to conduct rigorous research on the implications of restriction on land use
        right transfers in different regions and the need to have formal provisions on the right to use
        small rural landholders’ use rights to get access to credit services. Furthermore, there is a
        need to study and harmonize the land laws and family laws in regards to heirs issues and
        issues related to polygamy.
 vi.    It is essential to conduct robust study to improve the system and determine good land
        governance in the urban environment. To speed-up mapping and registration in the urban
        land sector is highly essential
vii.    To make the recent cadastral initiative, both in rural and urban, more effective there must be
        a well-articulated strategy and effective implementation with availability of financial,
        material and properly educated human resource

4.2.1 Rights to forest and common lands

2.1.1 Forests are clearly identified in law and responsibilities for use is clearly assigned

The current Federal Forest Development, Conservation and Utilization Proclamation No. 542/2007
recognizes two types of forest ownership, namely, state forests that may be under the ownership of
the federal or regional government, and private forests, which may be developed by private
individuals, associations, NGOs or investors (Article 3 & 4:1). In the Oromia Forestry Proclamation
(No.72/2003) and SNNPR’s Forest Proclamation (No147/2012) a third category of forest tenure is
defined, namely, community ownership. The regional authorities allocate state forests in the form of
concessions for the purpose of privately managed plantations, or for conservation purposes managed
by regional authorities and/or NGOs in participation with local communities.

The need of forest communities leaving in and around the forests area in accessing and use of state
forests for household and subsistence use is recognized in the Federal Proclamation which states that
the extraction of Non Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) is permitted as long as this follows an
approved management plan (Article 10.3 & 10.4 of 542/ 2007). Part II, article 4 paragraph 3 of the
proclamation states that “management plan shall be developed, with participation of the local
community, for forests that have not been designated as protected or productive state forests, and
such forests shall be given to the community, associations or investors so that they conserve and
utilize them in accordance with directives to be issued by the appropriate body”.

Both federal and regional Forest Proclamations are supportive of the engagement of communities in
the management of state forests. For example, Article 4:2 (e) of the federal Forest Proclamation
(542/2007) promotes the encouragement of farmers and pastoralists to sustainably manage and use
forest resources by engaging in PFM (542/2007); Further, Article 4:3 encourages communities,
associations, or investors to develop PFM forest areas out of non-gazetted forest reserves by stating
that such areas shall be “given” to them (implying ownership or management rights). Article (9:3 of
542/ 2007) provides communities with the incentive to participate in forest management by enabling
them to share the benefits of state forest products with the relevant management authority.

Establishing PFM involves developing a Forest Management Plan (FMP), which states the specific
uses of the forest and management activities, and a Forest Management Agreement (FMA), which
outlines the specific roles and responsibilities of the participating parties. Once the FMP and FMA
have been approved by the regional authorities they will transfer use and management rights to a
designated community Forest Management Group. The FMA is a legally binding contract between
the Forest Management Group and the relevant regional authorities and includes details about benefit
sharing arrangements between parties.

2.1.2. Common lands are clearly identified in law and responsibility for use is clearly assigned

Common lands broadly cover all lands under common use. There is no single category or
classification of land use that corresponds to all of these lands. Variously, they are found as hill-side
closures, forestlands - outside state management, grazing lands, roadsides, riversides, and wet-lands.

                                                                                                      61
The common feature that bring these lands as common resources is that the nearby
community/communities have the right to access. Under Section one, article 2 of the Federal Land
Administration and Use Proclamation, 456/2005 , "communal holding" means rural land which is
given by the government to local residents for common grazing, forestry and other social services.
According to Section 3 (3) of the same proclamation, the government being the owner of land, it can
change communal rural land holdings to private holdings if necessary. In the highland areas of
Ethiopia, common lands are registered in the name of those groups using the common land resources
and a group certification is exercised. Once certificate is given, the holders of the certificate are
responsible for sustainable use of the land. But, in practice, the management is very poor. In the
pastoral areas, where extended communal land exists, the registration and certification process is not
yet in practice. But there is an interest by the regional governments and the pastoral community to
register and map the common lands in the area.

2.1.3. Rural group rights are formally recognized and can be enforced

The obvious and the largest rural groups in Ethiopia are the pastoralists that occupy about 60% of the
land mass of the country. In addition, there are smaller rural groups of hunters and gatherers in some
locations, still in the lowland areas. The constitution of the country recognizes the right of
pastoralists (article 40:5) and is stated as "Ethiopian pastoralists have the right to free land for
grazing and cultivation as well as the right not to be displaced from their own lands". The rural land
administration and use proclamation (456/2005) confirms constitutional rights of pastoralists. Further
confirmations found in regional land laws. The Afar regional state rural land administration and use
proclamation 49/2009 Article 5(8) clearly stipulates “no private holding allowed in the area assigned
for pastorals grazing land.” Moreover, it further declared “communal lands that are used communally
by pastoralist for grazing, and social services shall not be leased to investors. Similar provisions
stated in the Ethiopian Somali Regional State Rural Land Administration and Use proclamation No.
128/2013 Article 5 (9 & 10). However, in practice, pastoral group rights are infringed due to
conversion of grazing lands into private and state owned large farms.

2.1.4 Users’ Rights to Key natural resources on land (inc. fisheries) are legally recognized and
protected in practice

Pastoral lands are largely managed by customary authorities using rules and regulations that evolved
over a long period of time. Clans operate in a socially recognized territory over which they have
exclusive primary land use rights. Such territories have dry and wet season grazing areas where
members of the clan practice rotational grazing. River basins that are usually flooded during rainy
seasons and valley bottoms whose soils retain moisture far into the dry season constitute dry season
grazing areas. Neighboring clans who have similar primary land use rights over their territory also
have secondary rights in their neighboring clan territories during droughts or failure of water
resources. These secondary rights are based upon inter-clan negotiated reciprocity. When such
reciprocities are practiced, the guest clan has to observe the rules and regulations of the host clan on
the use of the grazing and water resources such as refraining from cutting trees, observing turns at
watering points and not stealing livestock. When the pastoral community is hit by severe droughts,
there is a traditional migration of pastoral communities into the area of sedentary agriculture, which

                                                                                                     62
means an area of higher altitudes. During cropping seasons, where the farm area is fully occupies by
crops, the highlanders move down their cattle to the pastoral areas.

To extend the information outside the pastoral system, users' rights on key natural resources like
water resources, forest resources including fishing has been recognized under different
proclamations. Forests are regulated by Federal Forest development, conservation and utilization
proclamation, No. 542/2007.

Forest resources are accessible to communities in different forms. Fodder harvesting from natural
forests and closure areas is allowed free of charge based on certain procedures arranged by the
communities. Generally right to collect dead wood, medicinal herbs, honey, fuel wood, fodder, and
grazing are permitted unless specifically prohibited for a defined reasons. Regional Forest
Development Proclamations, proclamation 72/2003 of Oromia and proclamation 147/2012 of SNNP
region, have detailed provisions that allow forest resources use by communities.

Regarding water resources use, the Ethiopian Water Resources Management Policy declares that
water is a “common property of all Ethiopians”, (GoE Water Resources Management Policy 1999).
Any community can access any water resources as far as the water resources is available in their
area. All fisheries development and fishing related issues are regulated by the Fisheries Development
and Utilization Proclamation No 315/2003. Article 5 (1-12) describes that a person is entitled to fish
in any waters with the terms and conditions stipulated by the license granted for that purpose by the
relevant authority. Specifically, part two, section five, paragraph 3 of the proclamation states that any
person who undertakes subsistence fishing, commercial fishing or recreational fishing within a
national park or a reserved fishery area shall hold a written permit from the authority responsible to
administer the parks.

2.1.5 Multiple rights over common land and natural resources on these lands can legally coexist

Multiple rights on common land, as described in the instruction part of the LGAF manual, is not a
widely known common practice in Ethiopia. Although there is no as such a low that recognizes or
restricts co-existence of multiple rights over common lands, there are some practical uses on
common lands. For example, in the pastoral areas, there are local artisans who use special types of
soil for making pottery while the majority of people are engage in rearing animals and own the
pastoral land. The rights of such artisans on the communal lands that have the soil type they prefer is
exercised. Individual farmers can use trees of their neighboring farmers to hung traditional bee hives
to trap bee colonies. Use of small springs nearby a village can be other example. The spring can be
found in common lands owned by specific community, while individuals from other communities are
allowed to use water from the spring. In some cases, the water spring can be on a land owned
privately.

2.1.6 Multiple rights over the same plot of land and its resources (e.g. trees) can legally coexist

Multiple rights on the same parcel of land in the form of right of way is the most common practice in
Ethiopia. If there is no public access road to reach a farm, then farmers have the right to pass on

                                                                                                      63
someone farm. The same is true to channel irrigation water on someone's parcel. If we take national
parks and game reserve areas a parcel, there are multiple rights on the same parcel. Game hunting is
allowed for people over 18 years old who possess a resident hunter license. Recent wildlife policies
and regulations emphasize development-oriented conservation, the practical use of tourism, and the
local people’s participation in natural resource management and utilization. Local artisans such as
potters can also collect potting materials like clay soil from communal and private land. Clay soil
collection from privately owned land is becoming more difficult as landowners feel that clay mining
destroys their valuable farmland. Nevertheless, there may be conditions where joint holders, like
divorcees, or heirs agree to use the parcel jointly. In this case one could use the trees while the other
farm the parcel for growing crops.

2.1.7 Multiple rights over land mining/ other sub-soil resources located on the same plot can legally
coexist

The new Mining proclamation No. 678/2010, supports the modern and global approach of the
utilization and administration of the natural resources for sustainable mining development. The
proclamation declares that no person shall be granted an exploration license, a retention license or a
mining license over an area if it is (i) reserved for cemeteries and religious sites (ii) containing
archaeological remains or national monuments (iii) reserved for physical infrastructure (iv)within
areas reserved for natural habitats or national parks (v)within 500 meters from the boundary of a
village, city or water reservoir or dam without the consent of the competent body; or (vi) reserved by
any other law of the country. The Government may, however, where it is in the national interest of
the country, authorize the opening of any reserved area for mining operations upon providing
appropriate compensatory arrangements. However, small and local mining rights co-exist on
communally owned areas as explained before.

2.1.8 Accessible opportunities exist for mapping and recording of group rights

The Federal Rural Land Administration and Use Proclamation 456/2005 in article 6 provides the
need of measuring          lands found under private use, communal use, governmental and
nongovernmental use and preparation of cadastral maps for those lands. All Regional Rural land
Administration and Use Proclamations have also provisions on land registration and certification
including private and group holdings. However, the practice is not yet implemented in pastoral areas
due to technical difficulties to identify clan boundaries and to demarcate, register and map the
property in the name of the clan. Communally owned lands in the highland part of the country area
demarcated and registered in the name of the users. The country has invested a lot of effort in
choosing and deciding the best suitable cadastral methodology. After several piloting and testing, it
has arrived on to use a hybrid of technologies and methods as deemed necessary. The widely
accepted tool is ortho-photo in rural cadastre. It is currently in practice in the main four highland
regions of the country. It will be used in the pastoral areas soon.

2.1.9 Boundary demarcation of communal land




                                                                                                      64
Though the Federal and Regional States' Land Administration and land Use proclamations declare
that lands in pastoral areas are to be registered and recorded with appropriate traditional and modern
measurements, pastoral land areas are not demarcated, registered and mapped due to the reasons
explained before. The Forest Development, Conservation and Utilization Proclamation(542/2007)
emphasizes that communal forest areas to be demarcated, delineated and management plan to be
developed. But the practice on the ground does not reflect the statements in the legal provisions.

4.2.2 Effectiveness and equity of rural land use regulations

2.2.1 Restrictions regarding rural land use are justified and enforced

There are many restriction in the legal system. For instance, a farmer is not allowed to cultivate land
having 30 degree slope, without putting terraces on the land (456/2005, Article13.4). There are other
legal tools (proclamation 381/2004) issued to restrict land use changes of biodiversity hotspot areas
into agricultural use. Restrictions are framed to ensure that there is reliability to the purpose in which
the land is to be used and area described in the preamble of the Federal and regional Land
Administration and Use proclamations. Restrictions are stemmed from the necessity to put legal
conditions which are conducive to enhance and strengthen the land use right of farmers to encourage
them to take the necessary conservation measures in areas where mixed farming of crop and animal
production is prevalent and where there is threat of soil erosion and forest degradation. Besides, to
establish a conducive system of rural land administration that promotes the conservation and
management of natural resources, and encourage private investors in pastoralist areas where there is
clan based communal landholding system. Other forms of restriction area connected to plant species
selection for agroforestry practices, biodiversity conservation and wildlife protection.

Despite that there are a lot of restrictions on rural land use, in the legal system, as described above,
these restrictions which are mainly top-down, have challenged with various reactions when enforced.
They are neither monitored nor enforced in most cases. Moreover, restrictions especially those that
do not take into consideration livelihoods needs of the rural community are generally challenged and
difficult to enforce. Especially in the northern part of the country, communities cultivate very steep-
slope areas that are in fact prohibited by law. Usually they encroach forest areas in search of
agricultural land and space for settlement and hunt wild animals without permit. National parks
designated for wildlife protection are invaded by livestock herders. It can thus be summarized that
even though these restrictions are in existence, they are not enforced to the desired level. Finally,
there are also unwritten local restrictions within customary land tenure (e.g. cutting down of trees in
monasteries, churches, graveyards, ritual places, etc.) which need to be taken advantage of by the
government.

2.2.2 Restrictions on rural land transferability effectively serve public policy objectives

Tenure security is a policy objective and concern of the Ethiopian government. The FRDE
Constitution prohibits any sale and exchange of land. State ownership of land is considered as the
best mechanism to protect the peasants and pastoralists from evictions. In particular, it has been
argued that private ownership of rural land would lead to massive eviction or migration of the

                                                                                                       65
farming population to urban centers. Restrictions are placed on rural land transferability so that land
may be used for the purpose it is sought to be used, and so that the holders, most of whom are
intended to be farmers, pastoralists, semi pastoralists, would not be deceived out of their rights over
the land. In most cases, restrictions are set to protect landholders from disadvantaged backgrounds
who are often prone to be cheated of their land or are simply not able to prioritize the long-term
interest of land security over short-term cash gains that could result from such transfer.

The Federal Rural Land Law provides a general provision that allows leasing of rural land. It
generally says that peasants and pastoralists can “lease to other farmers or investors land from their
holding of a size sufficient for the intended development in a manner that shall not displace them, for
a period of time to be determined by rural land administration laws of regions based on particular
local conditions” (Art. 8(1) of Proc. 456/2005).

The other means of acquiring land is inheritance and donation. Any person who is a member of
peasant family may have the right to get rural land from his/her family through inheritance or
donation/gift (Art. 5.2 of Proc. 456/2005). A family member is defined as “any person who
permanently lives with holder of holding right sharing the livelihood of the latter” (Art. 2.5 of Proc
456/2005). As can be inferred from the above cited provision, a family member is one who “lives”
with the peasant who holds the land and “shares” his “livelihood.” This means, the law does not
specifically require marital or blood relations for a person to be considered as a family member.

Hence, a laborer who has no alternative income of his own and lives with the farmer without salary
under the same roof may be considered as family member and eligible for inheritance. The Amhara
Rural Land Proclamation goes one more step by allowing inheritance of land by will to any farmer
engaged in agriculture (Art.16.1). By contrast, it is not possible to inherit or donate rural land to
one’s children who live elsewhere or are engaged in other professions. The rationale behind such rule
seems that since land belongs to the state and the people and not a private one, it has to be transferred
to those who are in need of it, irrespective of their blood relations. There are similarities among all
the regions on restriction of land transferability.

2.2.3 Rural land use plans are elaborated/changed via public process and resulting burdens are
shared

The Rural Land Administration and Land Use Proclamation of 2005 recognizes that it is necessary to
“sustainably conserve and develop natural resources through the development and implementation of
sustainable land use planning based on different agro-ecological zones of the country”. The same
Proclamation states that “A guiding land use master plan, which takes into account soil type,
landform, weather condition, plant cover and socio-economic conditions and which is based on a
watershed approach, shall be developed by the competent authority and implemented”

The Regions’ Land Administration and Use proclamation puts a number of obligations on the rural
land users. Not adhering to these can lead to loss of the land use right. For instance, if land is not
used according to the comprehensive rural land use plan, or if land is not properly conserved, this
can lead to withdrawal of the land use right. There is also a strong notion among officials in Ethiopia

                                                                                                      66
that land use planning is essential for all lands. Land use planning needs consultation, endorsement
and decision making at various levels. Implementation of land use plans needs long-term
supervision, monitoring and other relevant actions. However, although the importance of rural land
use plan is recognized in the legal system of the country, the country does not have an enforceable
land use planning system and land use policy.

2.2.4 Rural lands, the use of which is changed, are swiftly transferred to the destined use.

It had been explained above that there is no land use plan policy and enforceable land use planning
system. But it does not mean that there is no land use change. For instance, lands can be taken from
smallholder farmers and can be transfer to investors for development of modern production systems.
Due to urban expansion, agricultural lands get incorporated into the built up environment. There are
big forest areas transferred to investors for development of tea and coffee plantation. Farmers are
slowly changing their land uses. As there is no land use plan that guides land use change process,
there are situations where land uses are being converted to other uses not intended at all. For
example, farmers plant eucalyptus trees or chat (stimulant plant) on lands that are supposed for crop
production; since eucalyptus and chat generate more income to farmers. In addition, farmers who
have farm lands along main roads build houses on their farm lands and sale the house. Such actions
have given rise to the mushrooming of un planned small towns here and there in the rural landscape.
Similarly, due to absence of appropriate control mechanism, some lands that are transferred to
investors are staying ideal for long time before entering into intended production. There are also
cases where wildlife parks and wetlands are converted to other land uses. However, there is no well
document information at hand to decide of the speed of transfer except a general judgment.

2.2.5 Rezoning of Rural Land use follows a public process that safeguards existing rights

The constitution, in article 43:2, says " Nationals have the right to participate in national
development and, in particular, to be consulted with respect to policies and projects affecting their
community." Other lower level legal, policy and strategic documents incorporate the need of public
consultation in any development initiatives.

Laws promulgated by the Federal Government including Proclamation No. 455/2005 on the
Expropriation of Landholdings for Public Purposes and Payment of Compensation and Council of
Ministers Regulation No. 135/2007 pertaining to the Payment of Compensation for Property situated
on landholding expropriated for public purpose. However, the modality of compensation payment in
the case of regional infrastructure projects such as rural roads and various water works constructions
is not involving the public to the expected standard. In many cases, the implementing agencies do not
involve the public in the issue of compensation level calculation. There is widespread belief among
the staff of these agencies that they are not supposed to pay compensation because land belongs to
the government. The process for rezoning is hardly public, as it is merely notified for persons who
are interested in finding out about it, and does not involve them in the decision making process. In
the case of urban expansion, including the zoning of industrial parks, compensation is paid by
municipalities in cash, in-kind (providing urban plots) or a mixture of both. Urban expansion
problems were not anticipated early enough and the municipalities were not at all prepared for the

                                                                                                   67
eventuality of compensation payments. Articles 3 (1) and 4 (3) of Proclamation 455/2005 clearly
indicate that compensation in cases of expropriation is to be made in advance of the eviction of the
holder.

In general, as there is no national land use policy, rezoning is not practiced systematically with
public participation. Development has happened without clear strategic analysis of optimal
allocations of land in the regions for industry, forestry, crop, pasture, fisheries, tourism and wildlife.
Though methods of land use planning shall involve a systematic evaluation of resources, an active
participation of all stakeholders and an interactive partnership between governments and people, the
current rezoning particularly allocation of land for urban development and agricultural investment
lacks transparency and in general not open to the public as expected.

2.2.6. For protected rural land use (forest, pastures, wetlands, national parks etc.) plans correspond
to actual use.


There are protected forest areas, national parks, wildlife reserves and wetlands. These areas are
meant to serve the purpose as the names indicate. However, there are evidences to suggest that the
land which was classified as forest reserve, wildlife sanctuary, national park and used for extensive
grazing for pastoralists has been diverted to other purposes particularly for agriculture over the years.
This diversion has taken place either in the form of encroachments or in the form of allocation of
land overlooking the existing norms and uses. A recent example is allocation of natural forests in
Gambella with livelihood and cultural significance to the Mazengar community to Verdanta Harvests
despite the Environmental Protection Authority recommending to the Minister of Agriculture that the
lease should not proceed, since the short term benefit would not outweigh the long term costs of this
land diversion.

Wetlands are critical to local livelihoods. They serve as a buffer against floods, are areas of high
biodiversity, help to regulate river flows and recharge groundwater supplies. Yet little attention is
given to protecting wetlands in Ethiopia. Several key wetland areas have been given to investors
such as the Karuturi’s Gambella that drained the wetlands for the purpose of agricultural crop
production.

The national parks are suffering from encroachment and in some cases they are invaded by herders
such as the Awash National park. In most national parks it is common to see wild animals and
domestic livestock grazing side by side. Most reports indicate that wildlife reserves and game parks
exist on paper only. The Gambella National Park and Yabello Sanctuary have been seriously
challenged by an agricultural investment projects. .Bale Mountains National Park has suffered from
uncoordinated development in and near its boundaries. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that
state holdings are generally not mapped or recorded. Recording and demarcation of publicly held
land in some regional states had occurred in some cases by the end of the 1990s: Awash and the
Simen Mountains national parks were legally mapped, and demarcation of the Omo and Mago
national parks was completed in 2005. It is not difficult to say protected rural land use is not
corresponding to actual use.

                                                                                                       68
4.2.3 Conclusions and key recommendations

   i.   Ethiopia is using its land and land resources without having comprehensive national land use
        policy. Formulation and enactment of a national land use policy is urgently essential. At the
        same time provision of policy framework to give clearer responsibility for managing
        communal lands is needed
  ii.   Develop appropriate land registration and certification system conducive to communally
        owned lands in pastoral system to exercise collective tenures arrangement in recording and
        mapping land rights
 iii.   Although there are attempts to exercise participatory local level land use planning, it is not
        guided by a national framework. Therefore, developing an appropriate guideline for
        participatory rural land use planning and rezoning is essential. Ensuring transparent public
        process for rural land use planning and joint forest management is an indispensable
        requirement for sustainable development.
 iv.    There are protected forest areas, national parks, wildlife reserves and wetlands. These areas
        are meant to serve the purpose as the names indicate. However, there are evidences to suggest
        that the land which was classified as forest reserve, wildlife sanctuary, national park, and
        wetlands diverted to other purposes particularly for agriculture over the years. This diversion
        has taken place either in the form of encroachments by the surrounding herders and
        smallholder farmers or in the form of allocation for large scale agricultural investments.
        Hence, there is an urgent need to officially demarcate, map and register these lands to sustain
        initially identified use.
  v.    Although there are attempts to manage forests through participatory forest management
        (PFM) approach, in some of the regional states, this approach is not guided by a national
        legislation/framework. Therefore, issuing a federal level legislation on this regard is essential.
 vi.    There are multiple rights exercise on the same plot of land. It is necessary to develop a
        harmonized legal instrument that supports multiple rights to co-exist on the same plot of land.
vii.    It is necessary to conduct adequate research to develop mechanisms to manage conflicts that
        can arise on the use of critical and common natural resources such as pastures
viii.   Provision of Institutional Capacity Building is essential to the newly established Ministry of
        Environment and Forest to enable the ministry to handle effectively the ongoing process and
        efforts in amending, harmonizing and unifying various laws and policies related to forest
        management.

4.3.1. Restrictions on rights

3.1.1. Restrictions regarding urban land ownership and transferability effectively serve public
purpose and are enforced.

According to the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, article 40, the right to
ownership of urban and rural land, including natural resources, is vested in the state. The government
has eminent domain and restricts its use through land use planning and management interventions.
Pursuant to article 40, sub-article 3 of the constitutions, it is legally enforced that land shall not be
sold or subject to other means of exchange.

As per proclamation no. 721/2011, chartered cities and the region have developed regulations for
limiting minimum and maximum parcel size as per standards in their own context. The minimum
and maximum parcel size restriction for replacement land for those properties liable for
expropriation varies from one city to the others. For Addis Ababa (min 75m2-max 500m2) while the
restriction is stringent in case of replacement land for expropriation as the maximum legal extent is
only175m2 whatsoever the previous parcel size. In Dire dawa (160-500 m2), Adama (105-500m2),
and Sebeta (160-500 m2) while in case land expropriation for public purpose, there is restriction on
parcel size provided as replacement land for those relocated due to redevelopment.

There are restriction on transfer prices. Pursuant to proclamation no.721/2011, article 24, sub-article
2-3, the seller is eligible only 5% of the profit from land increment value including the invested cost
and bank interest rate while the current law allows the government to collect 95% of the land value
increment.

Pursuant to proclamation no.721/2011, article 24, sub-article 4, market based increment in land value
is not considered for collateral purpose while building and its accessories constructed on leasehold as
well as the use right are subject to collateral. The regulation on mortgage restriction is actually
enforced.

The urban land holding registration proclamation no.818/2014 article 4 sub-articles 1 recognizes
uniform protection of land holding rights of private, joint holders, associations, and government and
non-government institutions. Moreover, the same proclamation article 30, sub-article 1, recognizes
the registration of all rights, restrictions and responsibilities of old possessions and lease holdings
concluded with the appropriate government body in the course of creation of landholding right. The
regulation does not recognize the registration of informal settlements unless administered through the
lease holding administration. The registration does not recognize newly formed squatters
contravening the lease proclamation and regulation.

The regulatory restrictions have provided range of benefits in urban development and
redevelopment, easier for infrastructure installation, securing land for social and physical
infrastructure development through the state power of eminent domain.

3.1.2. Restrictions regarding urban land use (disaster risk) effectively serve public policy objective.

                                                                                                      71
As per urban plan proclamation no.574/2008, article 5, sub-article 7, any processes of urban plan
preparations and initiations have to safeguard the community and the environment as well as
preservation and restoration of historical and cultural heritage. Actually, in most urban centers of
Ethiopia, settlements ranges from new squatter proliferation to consolidated ones are seen on risk
prone areas and in repeated occurrences the risk of flood and land slide are claiming the lives of
people and property.

In Addis Abeba, informal settlements are existing and squatters are still mushrooming on high risk
prone and environmental sensitive areas while the measures that has so far been taken to resolve the
problem is either resettling informal settlers incorporated in regularization plan or else bulldozing
newly formed squatter.

The common denominator of problems for most urban centers are the practice of designing copying
strategies for mitigating the risk till they resettled is either non-existent or minimal which leads to
vulnerability of the settlers to risk or disaster. For instance, in Dire Dawa, due to the settlements of
informal on risk prone areas, during the flash flood in 2006, 256 people were killed, 244 disappeared
and 10,000 were displaced. In general, there is discretionary enforcement of zoning regulations to
protect the inhabitants and the environment as most of the old consolidated settlements are still
residing on risk prone areas and the extent of settlements on risk prone area is high for largest cities.
Although the intention of the law reflect public purpose, enforcement is a challenge.

4.3.2. Transparency of land use restrictions

3.2.1. Process of urban expansion/infrastructure development process is transparent and respects
     existing rights

The urban centers of Ethiopia are experiencing horizontal urban expansion. The horizontal urban
expansion is affecting the livelihood of farmers on peri-urban area. In order to address the needs of
affected farmers and communities, urban plan preparation document recommends the participation of
the community in phases of planning such as preparation stage, planning stage, and implementation
and evaluation stage. However, in the course of expropriation of land for development activities, the
participation of affected farmers and communities in urban expansion is varied from one urban
center to the others. In this regards, many scholars underscore the little participation of community in
compensation decision making and benefit packages, which implies government is the sole decision
maker in compensation and benefit package computation. The compensation can be in kind and in
cash. The procedure says that an urban land holder whose holding has been expropriated under
proclamation shall be provided with a plot of urban land with access to similar public infrastructure
and services.

The procedures for public participation on infrastructure development especially on right of ways are
specified in step wise manner from right of way request to the affected dwellers taking compensation
that includes 16 defined steps. The most important element of the this procedure is the establishment
of a committee, with 3-7 members, to represent affected dwellers in the process of relocation from
planned land for infrastructure.

                                                                                                      72
In general, there is appreciated practices pertain to community consultation and participation, clear
procedures, election of community representatives, and publicizing of compensation value and parcel
size for the public, and signing memorandum of understanding with the community for infrastructure
development and compensation during urban expansion and redevelopment, however, the practice
and depth of community participation is not the same throughout the country.

3.2.2. Changes in urban land use plans are based on clear public process and input by all
     stakeholders.

As per urban plan proclamation no.574/2008, article-15, sub-article 1-3, stipulates that the process of
urban plan approval shall be preceded by public hearing to be conducted at convenient location, and
such process and hearing shall be transparent and adequately communicated to the public at large.
Besides, the relevant suggestions and objections shall be taken as input to rectify the plan.
Moreover, the structure plan preparation manual mentions that public advisory committee should be
established for urban centres at all levels to reflect the view of the community. In principle, initiation
for preparation of LDP for specific area could come either from government, private investor and
community. Yet, in real practice most of the planning is not derived from the initiation of the
community rather it is government driven. LDP is not initiated from the community for most urban
centres while community consultation and feedbacks are obtained from vision setting, preparation
and approval stage not-withstanding the fact that some LDP’s have still been done with more
technocrat oriented approach with no meaningful community participation.

The current strategy is more stringent on participation by stipulating that neighbourhood plan is
initiated after the plan proposal is dialogued by the affected dwellers and if at least 30 % of dwellers
council endorses the Neighbourhood Plan (NP) preparation. However, the practice very far from
what is described in the procedure documents.

3.2.3 Approval requests for change in urban land use are swiftly followed by development on these
     parcels of land

In case of Ethiopia, no organized surveillance and monitoring practice of inventorying urban land
use change to destined land use has so far been practical. Yet, the increasing speed of land use
change through dominantly formal land delivery system, especially on large cities, is witnessing the
extent of prompt land use change for its destined use.

Ethiopia is now one of the most rapidly urbanizing countries in the world. According to recent U.N.
estimates, the urban population of Ethiopia is expected to triple between 2010 and 2040, growing at
an average rate of 3.5% per year. The built-up areas of the four largest cities (Mekele, Adama,
Hawassa, Bahirdar) are expected to expand at an even faster rate than their population.

In small and medium urban centers, where the urbanization trends are low and the resource is meager
for financing infrastructure cost, the formal land delivery system is failed to cope up with urban
growth and investment needs. As a result, the change in use to destined use occurs so slowly which

                                                                                                       73
by in turn liable the existing statutory urban plan to be outgrown by proliferation of squatter
settlements and informal land market. Besides, the capacity to provide serviced land is weak as one
goes from largest cities to small urban areas, which implies large undeveloped land liable for
squatting in situations where the change in use to destined use in formal land delivery system is
weak.

4.3.3 Efficiency in the urban land use planning process

3.3.1 Policy to ensure delivery of low-cost housing and services exists and is progressively
implemented.

The government estimates that the current housing deficit is between 900,000 and 1,000,000 units in
urban areas, and that only 30 per cent of the current housing stock is in a fair condition, with the
remaining 70 percent in need of total replacement. In Addis Ababa alone, 300,000 units are required
to meet the deficit. For Dire Dawa, city category based on urban level, there is a backlog of 24,000
houses, and it is expected to grow annually by 2,900 houses. For Adama, city category based on
urban level, the housing backlog is estimated to be greater than 4,000 housing units in 2013/14. For
Hossaena, large town as per urban level, there is huge backlog that stands about 7,034 unit, out of
which only 948 houses (13.47%) are transferred through formal land delivery as per 2013/14.

Out of the planned 400,000 units’ condominium low cost housing construction, more than 171,000
units (43%) have been constructed while comparing with the aforementioned housing backlog figure,
much has remained to be done. The housing deficit is set to increase concurrently with the foreseen
high population and urbanization growth which indicates the failure of the formal housing system
responsiveness to housing demand.

Housing policy development is recent phenomena. As per the 2005 urban development policy, the
construction of housing estate has to be carried out through the participation and co-ordination of the
government. The major role of the urban administration shall be supplying land and infrastructure for
housing estates, supplying cost-saving alternative designs, supporting rehabilitation and repairing of
dilapidated houses and villages by the owners and improvement of the infrastructure and social
services of their locality. Moreover the urban administration and the regional government, as much
as possible, shall allocate finance for the construction of housing estates to be sold to low income
group of the society through long-term loan. Such housing schemes shall be space saving
condominium buildings designed to save cost and material the construction of which shall participate
the beneficiaries thereby creating job opportunities.

One of the main pillars of urban development and urban good governance packages was Integrated
Housing Development Program (IHDP) which is the prominent current government approach for
solving the low-income housing challenge initiated by MWUD in 2005. The IHDP has been
successful in many respects.
Although the large-scale program has not met all of its original targets, it has built more than
171,000 housing units based on 2010 figure, a significant achievement considering the previously
limited capacity of the Ethiopian housing sector. The program has greatly increased the number of

                                                                                                    74
homeowners that would never otherwise have owned a home within their lifetime, and, in parallel,
has benefited the housing market by increasing the supply of owner occupied housing and rental
units.

There are, however, a number of unanticipated challenges facing the program. The most pressing is
the affordability of the units for low-income households, with the cost increases in the price of
condominium houses deeming them no longer an option for many low-income households.
Furthermore, the inability to pay the monthly mortgage and service payments forces many
households to move out of their unit and rent it. Regional governments are taking different measures
to minimize costs.

3.3.2 Land use planning effectively guides urban spatial expansion in the largest city.

Based on the experience of Addis Ababa, urban plan is prepared following the hierarchies stipulated
in urban plan proclamation no. 574/2008 as national and regional development plan is considered in
city wide structure plan preparation. Subsequently, Local Development Plan is prepared based on the
framework of Structure plan. Structure and local Development plan is statutory plan which is legally
binding. In structure plan preparation, the physical implication of sectoral plan, infrastructure
development and public investment are integrated in regional development strategy.

The legally binding urban plan is ineffective in controlling the pace, direction and intensity of urban
development. Lease sub-division is performed on outskirts of the city without the preparation of
detail local development plan guided only by paved road without fulfilling the required infrastructure
and utilities for provision of serviced land. There are couples of cases that condominium housing
(Yeka Ayat and Yeka Abado) project is constructed on peripheries before preparation of LDP and
thereafter infrastructure is integrated with urban plan. Yet, in most encountered cases, LDP and
urban design is approved before indulging in construction of large condominium housing projects. In
expansion areas where LDP or NP is prepared before large scale housing and infrastructure project,
the structure plan framework is not satisfactorily guiding to reflect the anticipated population change,
service and infrastructure demands envisaged to be implemented in LDP. Currently, due to planning
failure, quite reasonable numbers of condominium sites have critical shortage of water for
accommodating the residential and services demands of dwellers as a result water expansion project
is commenced for some LDP sites after the units are occupied by the proprietors.

Though hierarchies of statutory urban plan are specified by law, land use planning has not effectively
guided and controlled urban morphology and forestalls changes arising from the demand for land for
different uses, infrastructure and utility requirements. In repeated occurrences, the prepared statutory
urban plans are modified through zoning changes. Urban expansion is guided by major
infrastructure development, large scale housing projects and informal development for reasonable
number of cases. In some of the cases, large scale condominium housing projects are executed
without well-articulated detail LDP and forestalling the demand of land, services and infrastructure
requirements.



                                                                                                     75
3.3.3. Land use planning effectively guides urban development in the four largest cities, excluding the largest
city.

Next to Addis Ababa, the four largest cities are Mekele, Adama, Dire Dawa and Hawassa. The four
largest cities have shown significant increase in population size. For instance, the population of Dire
Dawa has shown an increase of 24 % between 2000 and 2005. Hawassa will grow to more than 6-
fold its 2010 population by 2040, Mekele to almost 5-fold its 2010 population, and Adama and Bahir
Dar to almost 4-fold their 2010 populations

In the largest cities, the legally binding urban plan is ineffective in controlling the pace, direction and
intensity of urban development. In Diredawa, lack of formal access and a huge demand for housing
has made squatter settlements a main growth area in the city. An estimated 182,000 people live in
sub-standard housing in Diredawa, many of which are living in hills and flood plains. In Mekele,
ineffective implementations of urban plan regulations, speculation and poor supply of land are
contributing factor for urban expansion through informal development. For Adama, the urban plan
on the periphery is either occupied by farmers or susceptible for squatters and speculation though the
municipality has taken measures to increase the incremental land value on the outskirts through lease
for discouraging speculation. In practice, land use change is mainly driven by informal development,
major public investment and infrastructure project.

3.3.4 Planning processes are able to cope with urban growth

Currently in Ethiopia, serviced land is delivered for different development activities by lease either
through the modality of allotment or tender. The serviced land is allotted by lease mainly for
residential development of condominium housing targeting middle and low income while lease by
tender modality is allotted for private construction and Real Estate Housing Development.

Though land is delivered for residential development, Ethiopia has astounding housing deficit of
about 1 million housing units. It is estimated that over 2 million housing units need to be built in
urban areas of Ethiopia in 2015 to accommodate the current housing deficit and urbanization. On the
other hand, in Ethiopia, only 171,000 housing units were constructed through condominium IHDP
while the initial goal was to construct 400,000 units, which means achieving only 43% of what is
planned. In Addis Ababa alone, more than 300,000 housing units are required to meet the deficit.

As indicated above, in fact, there remains huge unmet demand for housing. So, the plot allocation for
grand housing development especially condominium housing projects and the previous housing
cooperative efforts did not reflect the ability of urban planning to cope with urban growth and did not
contribute for effectively reducing housing backlog.

4.3.4 Speed and predictability of enforcement of restricted land use

3.4.1. Provisions for residential building permits are appropriate, affordable and complied with.



                                                                                                             76
The Ethiopian building code, the provisions of building proclamation no.624/2009 and derived
building regulation no.243/2011 are legally binding and enforced by local government to guide and
regulate standards, planning, design and requirement of building in general. Parts of Ethiopia are
located in an earthquake zone and a code exists to ensure buildings resist maximum predicted
earthquake loads. The codes are only used and enforced in buildings developed in the formal system.

As per assessment made based on regulation and practices in local government for processing
building permit, the procedures specified for lease agreement, title deed, involvement of adjacent
neighbors, reviewing urban plan compliance as well as criteria and time limit for reviewing the
design and structure, and fire safety inspection are all technically justified and reasonable.

As per building regulation no.243/2011, article 24, sub-artcile-2, the planning consent costs birr 300
from urban administration. Plan review is also paid unless the applicable building plan is standard
plan prepared by city administration. Furthermore, as per building regulation mentioned above,
building plan review fee is affordable and especially low rate for residential houses.

There is a pressing need for more cost efficient alternative materials, as the current cost of
construction materials is a high proportion of total construction cost, typically around 70 percent.
Building materials are high in price and of a low quality relative to neighboring countries as the
material, production and supply is shifted to market based although the government is still active in
retailing and some subsidies remain in place. The urban planning regulations and building standard
are not affordable for the majority of the poor urban population, which is replicated and modified
based on developed countries standard. For instance, the building standard for G+0 and G+1 in
Addis Ababa have entailed construction cost of 3,889 and 6,667 USD , which are only affordable for
households who earn a monthly income of more than 167 and 222 USD respectively. While,
paradoxically in terms of income, 92% of the dwellers earn below 167 USD.

3.4.2 The process for obtaining a building permit for a residential dwelling is short.

In case of efficiency, if all requirements are met, the issuance of building permit is executed within
three months, which is well with the practice standard of three months. Yet, due to the defect found
on qualifying the preconditions, planning and design scrutiny for complex building, sometimes, the
time limit for processing building permit has extended to up to 6 month. Though the normal time
period for building permit execution is three months, however, the processing of building permit is
pended or rejected with the justification of contravening urban planning or design regulations while
the process is executed and approved sometimes after unscrupulous benefit, which provides room for
discretionary enforcement of the building permit regulation and creeping of corruption practices.
This fact is evidenced by measures taken by firing and demotion of officers in large cities as well as
the consistent building permit violations and zoning regulation changes. Moreover, the other factor
hindering the efficient processing of building permit is the disagreement of neighbors on building
permit, and poor surveillance/monitoring of building progress.

4.3.5 Tenure regularization schemes in urban areas


                                                                                                   77
3.5.1 Formalization of urban residential housing is feasible and affordable.

Pursuant to urban lease holding proclamation no.721/2011,article 6, sub-article 5, through
transitional period, starting from the date of coming in to force of this proclamation up to four years,
those unauthorized possessions not contravening urban planning and parceling standard are
regularized and administered under leasehold system, which implies guarantying tenure security for
large section of the population consisting of unauthorized settlements and there by implicates the
success of the land administration system.

A directive is developed to guide the formalization and regularization process. The directive has a
number of steps to follow that includes identification of informal settlements for regularization as per
directives, field survey and adjudication, checking whether the parcel and property on it is not
contravening urban planning and sub division standard as per directives, checking if the building on
the site meets the minimum standard requirement for building permit, execute lease fee and penalty,
and provision of title deed.

However, the requirements of regularization for urban planning and parceling standard are clearly
showing disparity treatment as those properties affected significantly by urban planning and parcel
standard are liable for demolishing of their properties without compensation and the only privilege
they got is the replacement land with restricted parcel size (75m2-common wall or 150m2-single) in
case of Addis Ababa. On the other hand, those unauthorized properties not affected by urban
planning and parcel standard are privileged in terms of parcel size and landed property as they are
not affected till their legal extent is not exceeding 500m2. As per the above disparity treatment of
unauthorized settlers, speculators have manipulated government regulation to their own advantage as
they got somewhat access of the structure plan from the land officers/technicians and adjust the
informal built up structure accordingly.

Currently, the penalty imposed for regularizing unauthorized settlement is very high to be afforded
by many of informal settlers. In cases of Addis Ababa, for new regularizing plan based on 1994 E.C
and 1997 E.C aerial photograph, the penalty for unauthorized occupation is very high, while
residence plot, up to 75m2, is exempted from penalty. For instance, computing based on Illegal
settlers situated in an area with highest land grade (L1_1), if the unauthorized person acquired
360m2, she/he will be compelled to pay penalty US $ 721.5 or birr 14,535, which is very expensive
to afford for low income people. On the other hand, if we take squatters settled on low land grade
(L3_4) acquiring small parcel size (172 m2) of land illegally lying on the lowest land grade will be
forced to pay birr 2,529 or US $ 126, which is at least on affordable range.

3.5.2 In cities with informal tenure, a viable strategy exists for tenure security, infrastructure and
housing.

Urban centers especially Metropolitan, City levels and large towns are embarking on massive
systematic regularization ventures in order to curb the illegal settlement problems once and for all as
stipulated on urban land management policy and within four years period of enactment of urban
lease holding proclamation.

                                                                                                         78
As per urban land management policy of Ethiopia, in order to control the rampant illegal tenure and
informal settlement problems in the country once and for all, the policy bestowed the responsibility
for the regions to devise systematic regularization contextualized to regional setting. It also stipulates
the obligatory implementation of physical regularization complying with urban land use plan and
parcel standard before intervening in tenure regularization and legitimize the tenure by the law. The
policy also underscores that unauthorized settlements regularized after qualifying urban planning and
parceling norms and standard, have to be administered under leasehold tenure. In order to solve
illegal settlement problems once and for all, the policy strategize the stringent legal framework and
putting in to practice strong enforcement system.

The urban leasehold proclamation also enforces the swift implementation of systematic
regularization and conversion of unauthorized settlements to lease holding administration.
Accordingly, as per urban leasehold proclamation, the regularization process to be undertaken by the
region and city administration in accordance with sub article (4), shall only be effective within four
years of the coming in to force of this proclamation.

Currently, though sporadic regularization is the normative prevailed experience in most urban
centers, for implementing the aforementioned policies and regulatory frameworks, systematic
regularization has been launched in haphazard manner especially for the largest 23 cities based on
high resolution aerial photograph. In the prevailing practice of Ethiopia, systematic regularization is
conducted based on the acquisition date of aerial photograph unluckily banning squatters proliferated
after the acquisition date.

3.5.3 A condominium regime allows effective management and recording of urban property

In order to implement other alternatives of urban land use in addition to plot basis urban land use, the
government ratified condominium proclamation no.370/2003. Related to ownership right, subject to
the condominium Proclamation article 8, sub article 1-2, a unit owner is entitled to ownership right
upon the unit and a unit of a building registered under this proclamation shall be subject of any legal
transaction. According to the proclamation, it recognizes the right of ownership to the unit and the
possible transaction right of right holders on the unit.

Regarding the common unit, the above proclamation article 9 stipulates that the right to use common
element is undivided and attached to the unit ownership and the percentage of undivided interest in
the common element shall be part of the unit ownership and any legal act on a unit shall also be
effective up on the undivided share of interest. Common includes the roof, staircases, exterior walls
and windows, building foundations, infrastructure such as water pipe, and electric cables.

The provision has also bestowed the responsibility for unit owners association pertains to the
management of common elements and areas. As per condominium proclamation article 13, the unit
owners' association is entitled to adopt or amend the declaration description by laws and rules,
approve budgets and amendments there to, determine the condition on the use of common element,
lease, subject to security and transfer the common element, determine fines, fees and contributions,

                                                                                                       79
hire, administer and fire employees, own, enter in to contract, to sue or be sued. In addition, the unit
owner association elected board of directors responsible for external maintenance of the roofs, use of
common areas, pet and livestock restrictions and other above mentioned administrative matters.

As aforementioned on article 13 of the proclamation, the unit owners' association board of director is
bestowed with the responsibility of managing common areas such as green areas, parking lots,
playfields and so forth but detail provisions related to directives, norms and standards for
management of common areas are required for management of common areas in environmentally
friendly manner. Though the degree of management varies from one site to the other, the unit owner
associations have exercised to manage common facilities and areas by renting common building,
developing park and green areas, fencing and patrolling the area as well as ensuring waste
management and recycling practices.

On part of the city administration, there is no practice of regular follow up whether the institutions
are regularly functioning to administer the common elements and areas in efficient and effective
manner as well as there is no scrutiny and monitoring to check whether the designed internal
directives by the association are sufficient enough to derive efficient and effective management of
the common elements and areas.

4.3.6 Conclusions and key recommendations

   i.   In the big towns, there are large scale eviction from old settlement locations. There is a need
        to redesign policy and strategies that limit large scale eviction problem through exploring
        other options such as more participatory urban upgrading without damaging the social,
        economic and environmental fabrics of an area
 ii.    It is common to see settlements mushrooming in risk prone locations. It is necessary to
        develop enforceable regulation to restrict settlements at risk prone areas and develop and
        implement mitigation measures for those settled in risk prone areas until resettled in non risk
        prone areas
 iii.   There is a big dissatisfaction on the less involvement of affected communities in the
        compensation computation process and on the level of compensation payment. This situation
        needs an urgent reconsideration
 iv.    Stringent regulation ought to be designed for any zoning modifications to involve primarily
        the interest of the majority of affected communities rather than endorsing the technocrat
        based analysis by the process council.
  v.    System development to track land use change is essential with all rounded institutional
        development.
 vi.    Proper investigation is essential to harmonize the ability of the poor to pay and the cost of
        construction of condominiums, and to find out conducive environment to implement low cost
        housing.
vii.    Measures have to be designed and implemented to make proper implementation of the legal
        tools enacted. Additional legal tools have to be developed to guide the urban expansion based
        on land use plans.


                                                                                                     80
viii.   Institutional capacity building is essential to make the system effective and to cope with the
        increasing demand
 ix.    Appropriate study on different alternatives of regularization approach and to enable genuine
        participation of informal settlers during the regularization process is essential

4.4.1 Identification of public land and clear management

4.1.1 Criteria for public land ownership are clearly defined and assigned to the right level of
government.

As it is defined in proclamation 456/2005 (2:14), state holding means "rural land demarcated and
those lands to be demarcated in the future at federal or regional state holding; and includes forest
lands, wildlife protected areas, state farms, mining lands, lakes, rivers and other lands". In urban
areas public lands include those areas that are under the ownership of municipalities. Public lands are
managed by public institutions based on the size of the holding and significance of the resources on
the holding from the public interest perspective. There are federal and regional institutions that are
responsible for the management of public lands. The ministry of environment, forest, and climate
change and bureaus at regional level are responsible to manage state forest areas in the country.
Ethiopian wildlife conservation authority is assigned for the management of national parks, and other
areas identified for the protection of wildlife resources. The big sugarcane plantations are managed
by the country's sugar enterprise established for the purpose. There are ministries and regional
bureaus established for the management of mining lands and water resources. Urban public land is
managed by the ministry of urban development, housing and construction and municipalities at a
lower level. However, efficiency of the management of these resources to satisfy the needs of the
public is a serious concern.

4.1.2 There is a complete recording of public land

In Ethiopia, in its modern and scientific form, land registration and certification is a recent
development. The registration process was started in the early 2000 and most of the smallholder
holdings are register in the areas of sedentary agriculture is practiced with the support of rural land
registration and certification program. This registration is based on the application of traditional
instruments and they are not supported with maps. Currently, there is a significant move to cover the
country with multipurpose cadastre. However, the previous registration and certification process in
rural areas excluded public lands. In urban areas, systematic property registration is not yet in full
function. The law is issued only recently (Proc. No. 818/2014). Therefore, records of public lands is
far from completeness.

4.1.3 Information on public land is publicly accessible

In the last three decades attention given in management of public lands is significantly low. As a
result, in the rural areas, there are reports indicating serious encroachments by the communities into
areas of public lands for the purpose of crop production and grazing. The changes in area of the
public lands is not properly registered and documented. The Gambella National Park has, for
example, challenged very seriously by an agricultural land investment promoted by the regional and
federal governments. The same is true to Yabello Sanctuary, which has challenged by a livestock
project, and Bale Mountains National Park, which has suffered from uncoordinated development in
nearby its boundaries. The Awash national park is under intense pressure from the surrounding
pastoralists and sugar cane plantation. All these and other dynamics are not properly registered and

                                                                                                    83
documented. Information on management of other public lands is not easily available. The situation
in management of public lands in urban areas is not very much different from the rural public lands.

4.1.4 The management responsibility for different types of public land is unambiguously assigned

Ambiguity in the assignment of management and responsibility has been observed in the
management of national parks, game reserves, sanctuaries. The federal and regional land policies and
laws enacted prior to 2008 attempted to address tenure insecurity only for landholders in the settled
agricultural areas. Public lands managed by the Federal and regional states are scattered in different
agro-ecological zones in most of the regional states in the country. There are conflict of interest
between the Federal and regional state on public lands. For example the Simen Mountain National
Park is transferred to the federal level management without the consent of the regional state. In all
the national parks and designated priority forest areas there are overlapping of interest. Management
and development responsibilities of these areas are not clearly separated and established.

4.1.5 Responsible public institutions have sufficient resources for their land management
responsibilities

Public lands management and development needs resources like any development activity. In this
case, resource is seen to mean both human resources as well as technical and financial resources.
Mandated institutions to manage public lands get their budget from the government annual budget
allocation, which is not as required. In addition, technical and management capacity constraints are
seen as a major hindrance for the Ethiopian government to carry out its land administration and
record land rights.

4.1.6 All essential information on public land allocations to private interests is publicly accessible

Information on public land allocation to private interest is not difficult once recorded. In 2012/2013
fiscal year Addis Ababa city was acquired 1,632 ha of land and out of it 1,611 ha was transferred to
different stakeholders. Out of the land acquired and transferred in 2011/12, 743 ha of land was used
for construction of housing, 480 ha for industry, 73.3 for Micro and Small Enterprises, and 21.7 is set
to be transferred by lease based on public auction. All these hectares of land were acquired in the
expansion area, by expropriating surrounding farm lands. Further, a total of 314 hectares of land was
acquired from within the city center of which 58.37 is used for private investment, such as hotels and
company buildings, and 255.63 hectares of land is used for public offices, embassies, and other
NGOs.

4.4.2 Justification and time-efficiency of acquisition processes

4.2.1 There is minimal transfer of acquired land to private interests.

The Ethiopian Expropriation Proclamation defines public purpose in its widest meaning as one that
gives “direct or indirect” benefit to society, and relates to the “urban structural development” and the
country´s general economic and development strategy. These parameters invite for a variety of

                                                                                                         84
limitless projects and activities, which in effect, leave the “public purpose” requirement in a difficult
situation. There is no visible limit to the state´s power of expropriating private property, even for
private use purposes. The expropriation law may not openly state that land which belongs to
individual A can be expropriated for transfer to individual B. But it is perfectly possible to take the
land from individual A and transfer it to individual B, provided that the latter would put the land to a
better use, such as building a hotel or grow flowers for export or to produce. The present law
entertains economic gain as one of the attributes of public purpose. This means expropriations are the
only major means of land acquisition by the government for almost all purposes. The land in rural
areas under communal use and all properties, which are found within the city centre and the
peripheries are at the risk of expropriation. If a new road is constructed in a neighbourhood, for
example, the city may demand the land owners either to upgrade their buildings according to the
master plan, which most of the time is beyond their ability, or else the land would be transferred to
those who can afford. It is common for people in cities to cede their land for the construction of
hotels, and for farmers to do the same for the establishment of horticulture farms.

4.2.2 Acquired land is transferred to destined use in a timely manner

In Ethiopia, since the existing land policy forbids land transfer through sale, the only mechanism of
land acquisition left for the state and private developers is the use of expropriation procedure.
Expropriation is used as a tool to supply land that is required for all economic activities. So destined
use here includes both public and private uses. Data on time taken to transfer acquired land to
destined use is not readily available. It also varies from place to place. But many practices reveal that
expropriated land is mostly transferred to destined use within a period of 3 years. This shall be
considered as good practice in Ethiopia. Delays are encountered after land is transferred to
developers in developing the land. Delays may be related to lack of infrastructure in the area,
shortage of capital and lack of credit facility and speculations on the part of the developers.

4.2.3 The threat of land acquisition does not lead to pre-emptive action by private parties

The federal and regional governments of Ethiopia acquire land through expropriation. In principle,
after expropriation Ethiopian government is paying compensations to individuals not for land but for
improvements made on land by their labour, skill and capital (For example for buildings, trees, etc.).
In the peri-urban areas ‘wise’ farmers plant trees on their farm and build houses on their plots
adjacent to the urban boundaries to increase the value of their plot. Many farmers living in the peri-
urban areas informally 'sell' their land to speculators instead of expecting the ‘low’ government
compensation. This is one of the reasons for expansion of informal settlements around urban areas.
Therefore, there are some pre-emptive action in the area where expropriation is going to take.

4.4.3 Transparency and fairness of acquisition procedures

4.3.1 Compensation is provided for the acquisition of all rights regardless of their recording status

The practice of compensation payment suffers mainly from the following problems. The first issue is
reluctance or refusal to compensate. There are government agencies that refuse to pay compensation

                                                                                                        85
for no apparent reasons. Furthermore, small towns which expropriate land from the nearby farmers
are reluctant to pay compensation on the ground of lack of financial capacity. Secondly, in most
cases, payments of compensation are protracted and delayed. Especially, rural farmers complained
that the compensation was paid a year after they vacated from their land. And the government did not
make good as inflation caused them much loss that came as a result of the delay in payment.

Thirdly, unrecorded rights to their land are not eligible for compensation of any kind. This includes
both rural land and pastoral land. Under normal circumstances most rural lands and some pastoral
lands are registered and certified. Thus most farmers are not victims of this practice. But in peri-
urban areas many farmers are informally selling their land to urban speculators. The buyers have no
legal rights over the land they bought from farmers. If government expropriate such lands for urban
expansion, compensation may not be paid. Actually the government may consider duration of
occupancy and other issues to regularize such lands. If such lands and pastoral lands are not endorsed
by community leaders and neighbours they are not eligible for compensation. Unregistered rights
such as grazing are not compensated.

4.3.2 Land use change resulting in selective loss of rights there is compensated for

Compensation is paid according the Expropriation Proclamation 455/2005 and Compensation
Regulation No. 135/2007. Recorded right holders get compensation in accordance the legal
framework. However, those rights lost due to change of land use are not compensated.

4.3.3 Acquired owners are compensated promptly

Compensation must be paid in advance (before people moved from their land and houses), and it can
be effected either by the woreda/ municipality or by the implementing agency itself (Article 5.2
(13.1) of Expropriation proclamation 455/2005). If the implementing agency is a public body
(administrative or enterprise), then, usually, it is the woreda that pays the compensation after the
money is transferred to its account. On the other hand, if the implementing agency is a private one,
then, mostly, it is this body that pays the compensation directly, but in some regions, the woreda
pays once the money is put in its account by the private investor. One discrepancy that is detected is
that the requirement of advance payment of compensation is not properly observed.

4.3.4 There are independent and accessible avenues for appeal against acquisition.

If the owner or holder has a grievance on the amount of the compensation, s/he may petition to the
administrative “compensation grievance hearing committee” established within the woreda or
municipality. The Compensation grievance hearing committee, after investigating the matter may
either affirm the amount or order re-evaluation of assets. If the person is dissatisfied with the
decision of the grievance hearing committee, he may appeal to “regular appellate court or municipal
appellate court within 30 days from the date of the decision.” However, expropriated person cannot
establish an appeal against acquisition due to an absolute power given to the governments to acquire
land as deemed necessary.


                                                                                                   86
4.3.5 Timely decisions are made regarding complaints about acquisition

As explained in 4.3.4, appeal cases cannot be established.

4.4.4 Conclusions and key recommendations

   i.   Ethiopian has made considerable progress to improve the availability and accuracy of land
        information system. The successful first level rural land registration and certification
        programs as well as the recent land holding registration of urban areas are among such
        prominent measures. However, public land management in Ethiopia still suffers from lack of
        proper recording, scarcity and inaccessibility of data. This in turn results to lack of
        transparency and weak governance in land administration and management. This needs an
        urgent attention
  ii.   Attention should be paid for the management of public lands to generate public goods and
        services. Strategic commitment for surveying, mapping and registration of public lands and
        making the information accessible for public use is an urgent matter
 iii.   There is a need to work on by the government to clearly define responsibilities between the
        federal and regional governments on the management and development of public lands
 iv.    Transferring public land to private interest is through expropriation. There is no limiting
        factor that restrict the government power to expropriate public land for private interest.
        Therefore, it is essential to revise the legal framework and define the term "public purpose" to
        take land and transfer to private interest.
  v.    There are cases where decisions are made in transferring public land to private interest, but
        the land is kept unused for a long period of time, especially in towns. A regulation has to be
        developed to improve the speed of transfer of public land to private interest and to its
        destined use.
 vi.    Developing and enacting legal tools is essential to prevent pre-emptive actions by private
        parties
vii.    There is a need to revisit the current expropriation and compensation law and its
        corresponding regulation to consider compensation payment when people lose right as a
        result of expropriation and land use change. Alternatively compensation to secondary
        rights/unrecorded rights should be addressed through land use plan.
viii.   All rounded institutional capacity building is essential for institutions involved in public land
        management

4.5.1: Transfer of public land to private use follows a clear, transparent, and competitive process

5.1.1: Public land transactions are conducted in an open transparent manner.

 Ethiopia promotes national and internationals investors to engage them in large scale investment in
the areas of agricultural, hotels development, manufacturing industries and other investment
dimensions. The federal and regional governments acquire and transfer land to investors. Transfer of
public land to private use follows a mix of practices mostly selection of investors for a rural
investment land is by a committee (composed of different experts which is different from urban)
taking in to account predetermined selection criteria. In Amhara region the bureau of environmental
protection land administration and use is responsible to screen and select potential investors and
present it to the regional cabinet for approval. In all stages of the selection process, minutes are
prepared and signed. There are similarities in the process of selection in other regions of the country
although there some differences between the institutions handling the responsibility.

In urban areas usually land is transferred by advertising lease tender (proclamation 721/2011 article
11). However, each plot of urban land have a benchmark price which is determined on the basis of
objective conditions of each urban center in accordance with regulations issued by the respective
regions and city administrations (proclamation 721/2011article 14). Therefore, during
implementation there is a need to make the whole processes of investors’ selection more transparent.
There are other process, such as allocation to transfer land to investors. Therefore, the approaches for
the transfer of land to investors follow different approaches and institutions in urban and rural areas.

5.1.2: Payments for public leases are collected.

Given the investment incentives provided under Article 12/4, Article 16 of the investment
proclamation 769/2012 and Article (5) and (6) of regulation 270/2012 investors are obliged to pay
the agreed payments (lease prices). Usually, lease payments are collected annually. Investors have to
renew their investment permits on annual bases. Unless they pay the annual lease payment, it is not
possible to get a renewed permit. However, for various reasons, such as production failure in rain fed
production areas, the collection is not as high as expected. In some cases due to inefficient follow-up
at lower level of the government institutions the collection could less than expected

5.1.3: Public land is transacted at market prices unless guided by equity objectives


The land valuation system in Ethiopia is not well developed. It suffers from lack of valuation system
and lack of well trained professionals. In both the urban and rural land regulations, the valuation of
property is carried out by a committee. Public land, an agricultural investment land, is transferred to
investors with a predetermined rental payment per hectare, which is very small as compared to other
countries. Rental value increases for an agricultural land when the location is near to the capital city,
Addis Abeba. Rental value difference between the regional state of the country. Urban land is
transferred by government to investors based on advertised lease prices above the predetermined


                                                                                                      89
bench mark prices. This implies that bench mark price of urban land varies from location to location
which in turn will vary during tender.

5.1.4: The public captures benefits arising from changes in permitted land use

In the rural landscape, investment in large-scale farms is part of the government effort to shift the
agricultural production system from smallholder subsistence production to commercialized
production system. The main objective is agricultural modernization and rural transformation leading
to food self-sufficiency and economic growth. However, there is no evidence that many of these
objectives are attained as it has been contested due to the damage caused by the projects outweighs
the benefits.

From the information that is available, however, there appears to be little evidence that Ethiopians
living in the areas where investment is taking place have benefited in ways consistent with the
government’s goal of promoting sustainable development of smallholder farms. Moreover, there is
little sign that broader goals, such as employment and infrastructure creation, technology transfer and
enhanced foreign currency earnings, have been realized. Therefore, the public is not yet fully
enjoying the benefits of the land use changes. Besides, investors are not utilizing the whole land they
received at full capacity.

5.1.5: Policy to improve equity in asset access and use by the poor exists, is implemented effectively
and monitored.

Investors include potential asset creation in their project proposals and possible potential benefit
from created assets to communities leaving in the investment areas. In most cases, these promise is to
convince authorities how important is the project for the communities in the project. However,
commonly, promised asset creation remains unrealized. If it is created, it is based on the will of the
investor. There is no policy instrument to influence investors to implement asset creation as
promised in the project proposals and to create enabling conditions for the communities to access the
assets.

4.5.2 Private Investment Strategy

5.2.1: Land to be made available to investors is identified transparently and publicly, in agreement
with right holders

In areas where land registration and certification is not finalized the right of the local community can
be affected by the land transfer to Investors. The whole exercise of large scale public land transfer to
investors may contradict the equity principle and affects the poor. It appears that in many cases
pastureland, grassland, woodlands and waterways that is used by local communities but not actively
and regularly cultivated or occupied, are considered to be unused and made available to investors.

It is reported that in Oromiya and Gambella, investment projects have enclosed land and water
sources and are posing a threat to local communities who fear that they will be denied access to the

                                                                                                       90
rivers on which they depend for fishing and household water. In addition, there is a report that local
communities have been denied access to the woods where they obtained firewood, grass for roof
thatching, and wild food collection during times of food scarcity.

As has happened in regional states (eg. Amhara region) investment lands are identified and mapped
and investors are provided with the lease agreement including of the map and coordinates of the
investment land. Therefore, identification of investment land before transfer of the same is rooted in
each regional land laws and the federal regulation on administration of investment land

Reports indicate that there has been lack of inter-agency consultation in decision-making. Although,
at the federal level MoA makes all the decisions, key agencies such as, the Ethiopian Wildlife
Conservation Authority (EWCA) was not aware of the decision to transfer thousands of hectares of
lands in the middle of the Gambella National Park to investors until environmental and conservation
groups raised the apprehension and took the matter to the authorities concerned. Besides, there has
been limitation in consulting the local communities. This dictates that there have been gaps in
consulting the local community in the transfer of public land to investors. In rural areas where
registration and certification is implemented and in urban areas, compensation is paid for the right
holders though the level of payment is not appreciated by the right holders.

5.2.2 Investments are selected based on economic, socio-cultural and environmental impacts in an
open process.

Ethiopia issued investment proclamation No.769/2012 with a view of, accelerating the economic
development of the country by encouraging and expanding investment, increasing the inflow of
capital and speed up the transfer of technology into the country. With regard to areas of investment,
the proclamation No.769/2012 categorizes those exclusively reserved to government, allowed for
foreign investors and those reserved to domestic investors. Pursuant to investment proclamation, the
council of ministers issued regulation on investment incentives and investment areas reserved for
domestic investors. The country has environmental policies and laws, such as environmental impact
assessment proclamation, solid waste management proclamation, biosafety proclamation, that
demand investors to come up with environmental impact assessment document that shows how to
minimize negative impacts and potential positive benefits. However, in most cases, the potential
economic gains are prioritized and less attention is given to negative impacts that can occur on socio-
cultural and on the environment.

5.2.3: Public institutions transferring land to investors are clearly identified and regularly audited


It should be noted that based on regulation 283/2013 the Ministry of agriculture has established an
Agricultural Investment Land administration Agency, which is in charge of administering the
allocation of land above 5,000 hectares for investment purposes. The responsibilities given to the
agency may bring about changes in the future provided that it works at full capacity.

The agricultural investment land regulation 283/2013 declares that the Agency is responsible to
administer investment land for which it gets delegation from the regional states. In addition, at both

                                                                                                         91
federal and regional levels, there are investment Agencies responsible for the registration and
promotion of investment. The Regional states have also the jurisdiction to transfer investment land to
investors. However, the institutional responsibility in transferring investment land and signing
contract varies from region to region. In urban areas, transferring public land to investors is managed
by municipalities and city administration.

5.2.4: Public bodies transferring land to investors share information and coordinate to minimize and
resolve overlaps (including sub-soil).

Under its program of large-scale land investments, the Ethiopian government has leased out tracts of
land to foreign as well as domestic investors and plans to lease out more. The investment program is
part of the government’s overall plan for export promotion or raw materials production for domestic
industries. There is a strong emphasis on attracting foreign investors into the agricultural sector by
providing a favorable investment climate and offering financial incentives. The Ministry of Mines
has the power to grant mining license and allocate mining areas to investors. Municipalities and city
administration acquire land and release it to private investors. However, there is no policy and legal
instrument to influent these institutions to share information.

5.2.5: Compliance with contractual obligations is regularly monitored and remedial action taken if
needed.

Usually, the compliance of investors with contractual obligations is not regularly monitored and
remedial actions are not taken. This responsibility of monitoring compliance lies on those institution
which are signatories of the lease agreement. Likewise at the federal level the investment land
administration is lead institution for large scale investment in the rural areas. In addition there are
responsibilities for regional institutions to monitor compliance. In urban areas, municipalities and
city administration are responsible to follow up compliance of investors. To be able to monitor
compliance of investors with contractual obligations, the capacity of both regional and Federal
institutions including municipalities and city administration must be strengthened. Hence, the
technical, financial and proper staffing gaps need to be filled. To enforce the contract, baseline data
must be collected for every investment land.

5.2.6: Safeguards effectively reduce the risk of negative effects from large scale land-related
investments.

The federal conservation strategy of Ethiopia has aims to ensure that the disadvantaged stakeholders,
especially local communities and women at all levels of society are fully involved in the
development, management and use of the natural, man-made and cultural resources and the
environment and thus social, cultural and economic sustainability is achieved. Accordingly,
investment contracts usually take into account environmental concerns to be respected by the
investor. However, sometimes due to lack of inter-agency consultation in decision-making, there are
reported impacts on national parks where agricultural investment is permitted to happen inside the
boundary of national parks as the case is in Gambella national park and Nechsar national park.
Besides, there has been limitation in consulting the local communities.

                                                                                                    92
There is lack of effective safeguards to reduce the potential negative impacts of large scale transfer
of public land to investors. A recent report of the federal investment land administration agency
shows that out of the 85 agricultural investment projects which took agreement with the Agency for
534,280.87 hectare of investment land; 28 (33%) projects have EIA (Environmental Impact
Assessment) document, 15 (17%) projects are preparing EIA document and 42 (50%) projects have
no EIA yet.

Those safeguards which are applied partly in ad hoc manner are usually about respecting what is
included in the approved EIA reports. Therefore, compliance with environmental impact assessment
reports and mitigation measures entails the safeguards to be respected.

5.2.7: The scope for resettlement is clearly circumscribed and procedures exist to deal with it in line
with best practice.


Resettlement practiced in many countries for different reasons. Ethiopia has exercised resettlement
programs for many years. The resettlement is in some case conducted by the resettlors themselves or
motivated by government. Due to the need to deal with food insecurity in some highland areas of the
country, the Government of Ethiopia and its development partners created a new coalition for food
security in June 2003. The was a working document prepared for the resettlement program. It is
called “voluntary resettlement program (access to improved land). The program rests on four pillars;

      The first is the principle of voluntarism which entails that settlers will migrate voluntary, they
       can return to their home areas if they change their minds, and they have a use right for their
       land in the home area for three years.
      The second pillar is the availability of underutilized land. The regional governments must
       identify and have enough land available before the program starts.
      The third pillar is the consultation with the host communities. The host community must
       agree to receive settlers in their areas.
      The fourth pillar is proper preparation. This means that a minimum of infrastructure must be
       in place before moving people (New Coalition for Food Security in Ethiopia 2003).

The resettlement program has been continued from 2003 to 2005. In some regions there has been
cases where resettlement has been implemented until recently. However, currently, resettlement is
not taking place many parts of the country.

Where foreign and local investors have acquired extensive land in Benishangul Gumuz and
Gambella regions, resettlement program has been launched to relocate communities away from their
previous home areas. Both the Regions and the federal government justify the relocation on the
grounds that this will enable local authorities to provide essential services such as education, health,
clean water, etc. Conversely, interviews held with local farmers in Gambella shows that the
relocation is done for investors to provide them access to land and other resources.

4.5.3 Policy implementation is effective, consistent and transparent and involves local stakeholders


                                                                                                       93
5.3.1: Investors provide sufficient information to allow rigorous evaluation of proposed investments.


Before transfer of public land to investors, investors are required to qualify for an investment permit.
To qualify for an investment permit an investor should submit personal and legal document and
project proposal. In many cases investors provide a project document prepared by consultants and
experts. Although, there are project documents which seem copies of previous documents, usually
investors’ interests are included in the project document. However, still investors' business plans
require some evidence of technical viability and community consultation which do not deeply
identify project risk forecasts. Likewise, after the project document is selected for implementation, it
often becomes apparent that short-term profit seekers are more likely to take advantage of weak
governance and tend to be less concerned about the adverse impact of their actions. In general, since
there is a trend to encourage more investment in both rural and urban setting, scrutiny on project
proposal is less rigorous.

5.3.2: Approval of investment plans follows a clear process with reasonable timelines.

The land banking system, for agricultural investment is managed by the Agricultural Investment
Land Administration Agency, an agency under the Ministry of Agriculture. The role of the Agency is
to create a more coherent investment system than previously existed; to put together information and
attract investors; to provide technical support, such as use of GIS, surveying and mapping, capacities
that regional governments generally do not have; to streamline the investment process; to assess the
capacity of investors; and to carry out auditing and monitoring of investments.

The land investment process entails first submitting an application to the Ethiopian Investment
Agency, detailing the proposed project, the capital to be invested, employment creation, marketing
plans, and utility and raw material requirements. The investor then receives investment license. After
the license, a land use agreement is then developed with the Agricultural Investment Land
Administration Agency. The process of developing a land use agreement is as follows: the investor
puts together a business plan; the Agency investigates the capacity of the investor, including
technical competency and financial capacity; land is identified from the land bank; a feasibility study
is carried out; and finally, a land lease agreement is signed. The land use agreement specifies terms
and conditions, such as the need to carry out an environmental impact assessment within three
months of signing the land use agreement, the land rent, and any requirements to develop land within
a certain period, as well as arrangements for termination of the agreement. However, land allocation
is seen by many critics as too rapid, without adequate capacity for assessment and monitoring of
investments, and biased towards foreign investors.

5.3.3: Right holders and investors negotiate freely and directly with full access to relevant
information.

As per the land law it is apparent that landholders have the right to rent out their land if they are
registered and certified. Accordingly, those small holder farmers are renting out their land to those
who are able to rent in either in the form of share cropping or money. However, since the size of

                                                                                                     94
landholding in the areas of sedentary agriculture are very small, it is not a point of discussion for the
purpose of this analysis, which is transferring large tract of land to investors.

Ethiopia is implementing the land expropriation and compensation laws before transferring any land
to private investors. Therefore, if a certain piece of land is required for the purpose of benefiting the
public, any land can be expropriated. Usually large scale agricultural investment lands are found in
the lowlands where smallholder farmers are not using the land rather it is occupied by communal
owners. Communal owners in these areas are not registered and are not certified to be eligible for
compensation as per the law. Both in rural and urban areas, the government acquire the land before it
is transferred to investors. Therefore, there is no possibility for the land users to negotiate with any
investors that need large tract of land.

5.3.4: Contractual provisions regarding benefit sharing are publicly disclosed

Ensuring social and financial sustainability requires the sharing of benefits arising from investments
among all stakeholders. Such benefit sharing is usually decided by the investor, who benefits from
arrangements that improve its relationship with local communities. Benefit-sharing arrangements
that maximize social development, however, are best when decided jointly by local communities,
investors, and local governments. These arrangements should include enforceable provisions for
including communities in decisions surrounding local development, and for including infrastructure
and other benefits in the development plans of local governments. Ideally, partnerships between local
communities, governments and investors should agree on an optimally balanced sharing of benefits
that is acceptable by all.

In Ethiopia in many cases investors include the elements of benefit sharing in their proposal. Because
they know that their project document will be selected by doing so. Knowing the low level of
compliance monitoring, usually the investors do not keep their promises. On the side of the
government there is no clear enforcement mechanisms on promised benefit sharing by investors.

4.5.4. Contracts involving public land are public, easily accessible and with agreements monitored

5.4.1 Information on spatial extent and duration of approved concessions is publicly available

Availability of well organized information about on-going and concluded projects to the public is a
prerequisite for checking of the extent to which investors comply with their obligations and taking
measures to encourage compliance and avoiding transaction costs or risks incurred by investors who
have to check whether a given plot has already been requested by or transferred to another party.

On the agricultural investment side, as indicated under Article 6 (6) of regulation 283/2013, the
investment land administration agency is responsible to “collect data on lands transferred to investors
and lands under investment and create agricultural investment land information system easily
accessible to beneficiaries”. It is expected also from municipalities and city administration to record
and document public lands transferred to private investors. However, due to the fact that there is lack
of well organized public information, accessibility is a challenge

                                                                                                      95
5.4.2: Compliance with safeguards on concessions is monitored and enforced effectively and
consistently

The potential of using local land use plans for environmental purposes is best illustrated in some
countries where states have embarked on a significant effort with support by major multilateral
institutions, to establish such plans as a tool to mainstream environmental issues and ensure that
large land holders comply with broader environmental obligations. Methods for enforcement and
sanctions for non-compliance should be specified.

Usually, the compliance of investors with contractual obligations is not regularly monitored (third
party monitoring is not yet put in place) and remedial actions are not taken. To this end the
government has been temporarily suspending consideration of new land allocations for agricultural
investment. It did so because of concerns that many project developers were too slow in undertaking
land development activities. Compliance with safeguards in urban areas is a challenge too. In urban
areas, if the developer is not putting the land for intended purpose in a given time period,
municipalities and city administration take back the land and put it in the urban land bank system.

5.4.3: Avenues to deal with non-compliance exist and obtain timely and fair decisions.

It is an advantage to specify methods for enforcement and sanctions for non-compliance.
Accordingly, the investment land administration Agency establishment regulation 283/2013 under
Article 6 (5) gives responsibility to the agency to “monitor and ensure that investors to whom
agricultural investment land is transferred are implementing the business plans they have submitted”.
Besides, contract agreements disclose the rights and responsibilities of both the investor and
government. However, it lacks monitoring (including third party monitoring) and enforcement of the
same.

4.5.5 Conclusion and key recommendations

   i.   Ethiopia is using its land without having a comprehensive national land use policy and
        guideline for land use planning. A harmonized and comprehensive national land policy, land
        use policy and guideline is required urgently.
 ii.    Large scale investment projects need closer follow up to check compliance with lease
        agreements and whether the projects receive proper services from the public institutions that
        are mandated for the purpose. The government should enhance the capacity of concerned
        institutions at all levels to enable them to conduct monitoring and oversight and enforce
        project obligations effectively.
 iii.   The differences in institutional responsibility across regions shall be reasonably reviewed in
        such a way that flow of information and uniformity of implementation standards can be
        attained. The institutional efficiency need to be enhanced through comprehensive analysis of
        pros and cons of the existing institutional arrangement. Apparently, the investment land
        administration system need to be integrated with the general land administration and use
        system of the country as in reality the principle of land administration is similar for all lands.


                                                                                                       96
 iv.    The investment land information system need to be implemented as stipulated in the
        investment land administration regulation. However, the information system shall be
        compatible with the general land administration information system, as for instance in
        Amhara region; ISLA captures all forms of landholding including state land. When a state
        land is leased out it will be recorded accordingly.
  v.    The quality of investment land administration in terms of policy implementation and progress
        of planned activities should be regularly monitored, selection of investors need to be an even
        transparent for the betterment of the investment sphere. Land use regulation in the country is
        loose and should be considered as a tool to enhance optimized utilization of investment land.
        Therefore, land use policy development is an urgent matter.
 vi.    Investment projects should be given the go-ahead only after full consultation with local
        communities. The government should be accountable to communities and should involve
        them at all stages of the decision-making process.
vii.    Contracts should contain clear, specific and enforceable clauses to protect the environment,
        wildlife, biodiversity, and water sources. The use of agro-chemicals must be closely regulated
        to prevent damage to the soil and to surface and subsurface water Systems from toxic waste.
viii.   There must be an enforceable benefit-sharing scheme instead of simply leasing out the land
        so that communities stand to gain from the investment projects. This could be a profit-sharing
        scheme as is being tried in some African countries with large scale extractive projects
        (mining, petroleum, etc).
 ix.    Contracts should stipulate investors’ obligations with regard to social investments in the
        communities concerned (e.g. schools, health centers, and clean water). Social investments
        should address community needs, based on consultation with them.
  x.    A team of experts and community members should carry out monitoring and supervision to
        ensure that investors are honoring their obligations.
 xi.    Government shall clearly define the scope of "public purpose" to avoid ambiguities while
        interpreting and implement any transfer of land to investors.
xii.    It is important to minimize investments that cause involuntary displacement and, where such
        displacement is absolutely unavoidable, it is essential to ensure that adequate compensation is
        paid in time
xiii.   To ensure greater land tenure security, it will be necessary to assess whether laws requiring
        compensation for expropriated land are being adequately implemented. If appropriate,
        changes in law and policy should be considered.
xiv.    It is critical for the legal and policy framework for large scale land deals to specifically
        address and protect the land and water rights of pastoralists. This is especially so in countries
        and regions where a significant number of people are dependent on grazing lands for their
        livelihood.
 xv.    It would be useful for the state and other stakeholders to determine whether the country's
        laws requiring environmental impact assessments are being followed by investors properly
        monitored

4.6.1 Mechanisms for recognition of rights

6.1.1 Land possession by the poor can be formalized in line with local norms in an efficient and
     transparent process

The land rights in the four major regional states of Ethiopia said to be formalized after first
registration and issuance of primary book of holdings. The current holding rights of land holders in
four major regional states came from informal rights. During the derg era land used to be
redistributed by local leaders (kebele administration). Therefore kebele administrators and the local
community have knowledge about who had the informal right on which land. In addition to this
farmers were obliged to pay land use taxes and the tax receipts were considered as supportive
document to prove informal land holding rights.

The process of the recognition of informal rights in four major regional states has a number of steps
and procedures that includes provision of repeated information on the importance of formalized
rights to elders and land holders, election of land administration committee to lead the formalization
process and future administrative activities, application by the landholders to get formal right,
approval of the application by the committee, filling the field form all the details, and public hearing
as a final confirmation. Following the approval with public hearings temporary certificates will be
given by the Woreda (district) land offices for about one year. During this period all claims are
expected to be settled. The primary books of holdings will be given after the adjudication process is
completed and the claims are then said to be formalized after this period. However, possessions on
public lands such as in national parks, forest areas etc cannot be formalized.

The land holding types in pastoralist and semi pastoralist areas are different from that of the system
in four major regions. Informal rights in pastoralist areas are mainly group rights. Traditionally many
of the clans in the pastoralist areas have a vaguely defined boundary where they have a traditional
right to graze. The right is said to be vague because the members of the clan are not clearly defined
and also the boundary of the land they can claim grazing right is also not definite. Land
administration and use laws are enacted by the regions that have pastoralist and semi pastoralist
dominant life style. But the conversion of informal rights to formal property rights is not yet
implemented.

The four main regional states have efficient and transparent land administration process. On contrary
to this the process on the remaining developing regional states can be said at its early stage. Urban
land administration process that is the responsibility of municipalities is mainly using lease law and
it has its own formalization and regularization process.

6.1.2 Non-documentary evidence is effectively used to help establish rights

Small scale farmers' rights on their land, before first level book of holdings are issued to them, had
no documentary evidences to prove. The only evidence that can be presented by the land holders
were tax receipts. The tax receipts were assumed as the proof for the use of the land for the particular
taxation period. The participatory way of working accepted by the four major regions is a step by

                                                                                                     99
step approach including public hearings, adjudication of rights, land surveying (mapping),
registration and issuance of primary and secondary book of holdings. The process is deployed to
convert none documentary evidences to legal land holding rights. The evidences collected and
approved by consecutive public hearing activities are converted to legal rights after approval by
public authorities. Local recognition or neighbors’ recognition of each other’s holdings is also
important proof that courts or administrative authorities accept as evidence. Participatory methods
and the way public hearings can be implemented to pastoralist areas should be the point of attention
in the coming future.

Landholders are involved in the land administration processes from the very beginning to the end.
Public hearings with landholders are carried out as final collective approval meetings. Land
administration committees, that are elected members of the landholders in the Kebele, participate at
all stages of the land administration process.

Customary land disputes arbitration committee is playing a significant role in reducing conflicts to be
submitted to the courts. The committee is a bridge between the formal and customary (informal)
system. All decisions taken under customary rules were acknowledged by the formal system as long
as the case is not of criminal nature and decision will be used as evidence to assure holding rights.
However this practice is only limited to four major national regional states and have to be expanded
to the remaining regional states.

Communal holdings in the area of sedentary agriculture are rural lands that are not under the
ownership of the government or of any private holding, but used by the local people in common for
grazing, forestry and other social services. In most cases, communal holdings are governed by
traditional rules and by-laws. According to the regulation the local society is entitled to establish by-
laws based on local circumstances. The decisions based on these local rules are legally valid and are
important evidence for communal holding right unless or until they are in contradiction with
established formal law.

6.1.3 Long-term unchallenged possession is formally recognized.

The land holding system in Ethiopia do not include land ownership right. The recognition of long-
term unchallenged possession is not connected to holding right on land. Land laws in Ethiopia are
silent about the formal recognition of long-term unchallenged possessions. However the 1960 civil
code put the limit for long term unchallenged possession to a maximum of ten years. The ruling of
the Supreme Court on the legal status of unchallenged long time possession is based on this
argument. According to the ruling of the Supreme Court (rulings of a supreme court are legal
provisions according to Ethiopian law) long-term unchallenged possession for more than ten years is
accepted on private landholdings.

Long term possessions without proper legal documents exists both in rural and urban settings of
Ethiopia. The long term possessions can be possessions that have no legal evidence or can be
possessions occupied illegally. Settlers who cannot prove their holding rights by presenting legal site
plans and parcel maps but who can show evidences of occupancy such us tax receipts, telephone and

                                                                                                     100
electricity connection fees are mostly considered as traditional holdings. These holding types are not
illegal but have no proper evidence for their holding rights. The traditional land holding rights are
expected to be converted to formal holding right after passing through legal processes and checks
and therefore they are not subject to eviction.

6.1.4 First-time recording of rights on demand includes proper safeguards and access is not
restricted by high fees.

The first time systematic adjudication and issuance of first level certification is free of charge for the
land holder and had all the legal protection to land holders. The book of holding is legally accepted
as a proof of holding right in front of courts. The book of holding can be revoked and challenged
only if evidence can be presented that the document was issued by using wrong data and corrupted
practice.

The precision level of parcel identification and mapping has a strong influence on the costs of land
rights formalization. The costs of formalization increase exponentially with precision level. It is not
obvious that a high precision level of second level certification program in Ethiopia is worth the
additional cost. The low-cost and participatory approach using neighbours as witnesses in the first
Stage registration in Ethiopia was enough to bring about tenure security.


4.6.2 Completeness of the land registry

6.2.1 Total cost of recording a property transfer is low.

The cost of registration and certification for first stage land registration and certification in Ethiopia
was estimated to be about 1USD per farm plot or 3.5USD per household. Property transfer is the
activity limited to Amhara regional state rural land administration system and hence the discussion
on total cost of recording a property transfer is on limited significance. Though land transactions and
transfers like inheritance and gift are also legal in other regions activities on demand are not
registered and no cost is associated for the activity. Cost described here are establishment costs for
property formation. The total cost for recording property transfer includes overhead costs, material
costs and running costs. The estimated average cost for first time surveying, per parcel for remote
sensing tools is $8 and $10 for orthophotos and HRSI respectively. The cost for giving the demanded
cadastral services is not determined yet in Ethiopia. There is no data or information about the cost of
transfer of property rights in urban areas. In the rural areas, adjudication cost is reduced as a result of
participatory way of working and the active participation of committee members free of charge. The
committee members contributed in fast and easy approval for application for getting first level books
of holdings.

6.2.2 Information held in records is linked to maps that reflect current reality.

Information held in records is linked to maps only to main cities and trial and pilot project sites in the
rural lands of which the total area is not known. Some of the examples of pilot projects and trials

                                                                                                       101
conducted in Ethiopia are: Gerado and Adisna gulit pilot projects in the Amhara region supported by
SIDA (Swedish International development Agency), ELTAP and ELAP land tenure pilot projects
supported by USAID and conducted in selected districts of Amhara, Oromia, Tigray and SNNP
regional states focusing on the use of hand held GPS for cadastral purposes, The World bank and
FINIDA supported pilot projects conducted in selected districts in four regional states focusing on
the use of remote sensing tools for cadastral purposes. Since cadastral mapping is a very recent
phenomenon it is too early to discuss about the problems related to updating. The good thing is the
system development and piloting is well aware of the importance of updating. The old cadasters built
in big cities like addis Abeba had no built in system for updating and therefore the maps are not
capable of reflecting the current reality. Due to lack of studies and evaluation documents it is
difficult to comment the level of the problems related to the ability to reflect the current situation in
the urban cadaster.

6.2.3 All relevant private encumbrances are recorded.

Encumbrances on holding rights in Ethiopia can emanate from both individual rights and public
regulation. The main encumbrances emanating from individual rights are servitudes and easements.
Land laws in Ethiopia allow the landholder the right to use other holders’ land, if he has no other
possibility to access the public infrastructure, e.g. roads. Another case to use others’ land is to pass
runoff water, if the contour and drainage pattern forces him to do so. This is the encumbering right
for the servant property. The encumbrances locally called obligations are stated on laws but not
commonly recorded on registers. The rights and obligations of the holder described in Ethiopian
federal and regional land laws are similar to the right of way and easements in other countries.

There is no provision or practice in Ethiopian land laws, where a land holder has any right on the
users of his property. He only has the right to rent his land. The maximum legally permitted period
for a rental agreement between the landholder and the tenant in a single term is 25 years in Amhara
region. Other regions have different rent durations. The right for sublease of land is dependent on the
prior contract agreement. The landholder has to be notified, when the tenant is subleasing the rented
holding with the possibility to cancel the contract, if he is against the subleasing. The obligation to
give notice before cancelling contracts and the tenant protection laws are encumbrances on the land
holders.

Detailed land-use plans that entail encumbrances are missing in rural Ethiopia. The master plans that
can be considered as detailed land use plans are operational only on few large cities in Ethiopia. The
state is entitled to take land for public purposes from land holders by paying compensation in
advance. The eminent domain of the state is an encumbrance on land holders. In the urban land
administration system, mortgages are registered as encumbrance.

6.2.4 All relevant public restrictions or charges are recorded.

Public restrictions or charges are not commonly recorded in Ethiopia. There are no records of
charges except rental contracts and mortgage agreements for leased state holdings with investors in
Ethiopia. The introduction of land administration system in Ethiopia contributed to an increased

                                                                                                     102
involvement of landholders in land rental market. The significance of rental market for the
landholders is very high. The rental income share for the landholders increased from 30% up to 50%
in the past ten years. The rented holdings normally are used for crop cultivation. Some exceptions are
rental agreements in peri-urban areas. Parcels in peri-urban areas are rented for house construction
and for eucalyptus plantations. The involvement of landholders in the rental market before the
introduction of land administration system for example in ANRS was only about 5%. Some studies
found that land certification has enhanced tenure security and the willingness to rent out land and
amounts of land rented out among potential landlord households in Tigray region, and especially for
female-headed households.

Investors who have land lease agreement with the state can take loan from banks by using their lease
agreements as collateral. The land administration offices that are responsible for managing lease
contracts on behalf of the state are also responsible to register the loan agreements with banks. The
land administration offices will write confirmation letters to the concerned banks. Basically the letter
is stating that the banks will be notified about any forthcoming transactions on a leased land so that
they can take appropriate measures.

6.2.5 There is a timely response to requests for accessing registry records.

Records are manual and limitations related to access are related to the ease for searching paper files.
The filing system and filing facilities are generally poor and can even cause loss of valuable
documents. The other bottleneck for getting copies or extracts of documents is the location to which
they are stored. The closest office for small scale farmers to get official documents is at District
(woreda) land administration offices. The distance from kebeles to the woreda offices is in most
cases long enough to demand days of travel time. Kebele offices are established in some regional
states such as Amhara to serve as a front office. The front offices are planned to collect applications
and ask users to fill the relevant forms at Kebele level. The kebele land administration officer then
will take the issue to relevant woreda officer every week and present the result for applicants. The
planned arrangement is expected to improve the service to land holders. The registry in urban land
administration system is not to the level expected in terms of modernity.

6.2.6 The registry is searchable.


The registry in Ethiopia in general is mainly manual. The manual system is inherently not suitable
for searching. But searching of documents in the registry can be facilitated by creating suitable
design. The layout of the registry books in Ethiopia includes both unique parcel identifier and the full
names of the land holders. The unique parcel identifier is hierarchically organized. The region, Zone,
Woreda, kebele, holding and parcels are represented in the unique identifier. The unique parcel
identifiers are available on both the book of holding and on land registers. The availability of
systematic parcel identifier can be identified as a tool to make data in the manual registers
searchable. The search in the manual system can also be conducted by the names of the land holders
and the bordering land holders. The records in the manual system can be searched by both the right
holder name and parcel unique number.

                                                                                                    103
Computerization is introduced only in Amhara national regional state. The computerized system
developed in Amhara national regional state is called Information System for Land Administration
(ISLA). The development of computerized land registration system to serve the whole country is
under development by the federal ministry of agriculture with technical and financial support from
the Finland government. The computerized systems under development will facilitate searching land
related records both by right holder name and unique parcel identifier. Unique parcel identifiers in
the urban land administration are a bit different. However, the unique parcel identifiers are available
on both the book of holding and on land registers.

6.2.7 Land information records are easily accessed.

There is little capacity for the dissemination of information to the public about the various land
administration reform programs, their objectives, and ways that they will impact local resource use.
Insufficient effort has been undertaken by either regional or national authorities to inform the public
about the land administration reform exercises currently underway. Programs should be developed to
inform the public of the certification programs well in advance of the field exercise. Sensitization of
the public to the issues of land rights and implications for the certification programs is critical to the
acceptance and ultimate success of the programs. Land administration information can be accessed
through public awareness campaigns. Private land records are accessible on demand basis. The
requirement to get permission to access land records is to prove the interest on the record and get
permission from registrars. Copies of land records can be requested. However, there is no law to
govern how to get copies of land administration documents and who will cover the costs.

4.6.3 Reliability

6.3.1 Information in public registries is synchronized to ensure integrity of rights and reduce
     transaction cost

The world best experience showed greater benefits from synchronized public registers. In many of
the instances the base for public information is the land register. The register and cadastral offices
generate process and disseminate land information to the users. Historically land registration and
cadastral offices are organized in separate places. The unitary land administration offices organized
to serve both land registration and cadaster are the once that can better serve the synchronization of
public registers. The land information offices can contribute for example by the use of unique parcel
and building identifiers that can serve as a basis for other public services too. The synchronization
can better facilitate when land registers are computerized. Land registers and cadastral information in
Ethiopia are not computerized yet. There is nearly no online public service and public registers in
Ethiopia that are synchronized. Some efforts are reported from land offices to informally share the
land register data for tax and revenue purposes. This cooperation is also confined to some
jurisdictions and on ad hock basis.

6.3.2 Registry information is up-to-date and reflects ground reality.


                                                                                                      104
Updating is the tool for making ownership information in the registry/cadaster up-to-date and reflects
ground reality. In the rural land administration, updating of records is exercised only in ANRS rural
land administration. The Ethiopian first level rural land registration has been increasingly
deteriorating over the past decade or so. There have been no exhaustive or in-depth studies on the
subject or steps that could be taken to redress the root causes, particularly those available within the
existing legislative framework. There have been increasing concerns expressed by commentators
regarding the erosion of the accuracy and reliability of the land record database that was created
during the “1st Level Certification” and therefore the increasing degradation of the massive land
registers created in Amhara, Oromiya, Southern, Nations and People’s (SNNP) regional states . In a
study that covered Amhara, Oromiya, SNNP and Tigray regional states new certificates were issued
in about 60% of the sample kebeles (i.e. from the total sample kebeles of 115) where cases of
inheritance were reported and the records were updated in only about a quarter of the cases. The lack
of clear procedures, deficiencies in the various registry formats to accommodate transactions and the
lack of awareness on the part of the land users are often cited as key reasons for permanent land use
right transactions not being officially reported and updated.

4.6.4 Cost-effectiveness and sustainability

6.4.1 The registry is financially sustainable through fee collection to finance its operations.

The first registration and associated costs for issuance of second level certification in Ethiopia is free
of charge. Service charges and fees will be collected only during updating and transaction of land
records. Irrespective of some variation in the way of working across regions, the broad-scale First
Stage land registration and adjudication of rights is without fees. Updating and recording land
transactions are limited to Amhara region. At this stage it is difficult to say that land registration
system in Ethiopia is financially sustainable through fee collection from system users to finance its
operation. The users showed their willingness to cover the costs for land administration system.
Multipurpose cadaster can in the future also attract many users and generate income through sell of
maps of different kind. The methodology on cost recovery principle can be adopted for all regional
states in Ethiopia. Municipalities and city administration fee collection is not enough to run the
business by itself. Annual budget allocation from government is the working modality at the
moment.

6.4.2 Investment in land administration is sufficient to cope with demand for high quality services.

The First Stage land registration and certification in Ethiopia is implemented almost without any
outside assistance. International researchers have been involved in evaluating the impacts of the First
Stage reform in Tigray. The cost for evaluation is covered by international funding organizations.
SIDA has provided support for high quality registration and certification in selected areas (East
Gojjam and South Wollo) in the Amhara region. USAID has provided support among others for
piloting Second Stage certification in selected districts in the four regions Tigray, Amhara, Oromia
and SNNP through the Strengthening Ethiopian Land Tenure and Administration Program (ELTAP)
project that lasted from 2005 to 2008 and the following program, the Ethiopia Strengthening Land
Administration Program (ELAP), that lasted from 2008 to 2013 (USAID 2010). The investment from

                                                                                                      105
international development partners is mainly for system establishment and capacity building. It is
only big municipalities like Addis Abeba that are struggling to generate income to run their land
administration system. In general investment both from internal and external financial sources is not
enough to effectively run land administration services in Ethiopia.

Land administration services especially the spatial part of land information system is resource
demanding. Increased investment in land sector is required to deliver services that can satisfy user
needs and fulfill expectations. Investment in capacity building includes investment on university
level training. Institute for Land Administration (ILA) was established in Bahir Dar University to
train professionals at BSc and MSc. The intake capacity is growing every year and it reached near
100 per year. Other universities such as Woldia University and Civil Service University are also
starting land administration training on different level.

4.6.5 Fees are determined transparently to cover the cost of service provision

6.5.1 Fees have a clear rationale, their schedule is public, and all payments are accounted for.

Since there is no active record of transactions, especially in the rural land administration, except in
one national regional state, fee collection cannot be clear and rational activity. But receipts are
mandatory for all transactions with in land administration systems. Municipalities and city
administration are much better in this activity. However, it is not possible to say fee levels are
determined in a transparent manner.

6.5.2 Informal payments are discouraged.

Incidence of corruption in the Ethiopian public sector is evident. Both petty and grand corruption is
spreading. It was reported that one could not get government services in several institutions without
paying bribes to persons in charge. Corruption has become a serious problem in the country
assuming several forms. In most cases, it is very difficult to distinguish one form of corruption from
the other because they partly overlap and used interchangeably with other concepts. The government
clearly announced that corruption is a threat to the country's futurity unless tackled in time.

Land administration services especially services in town municipalities are identified as corruption
prone sectors in Ethiopia. However there are policy measures implemented to control rent seeking
behavior in land sector. The first policy measure is making prominent land issues of constitutional
category. The measure helped to control the administrative system and officials to modify land
policies for their individual benefits. It is difficult for officials to distort land issues because they are
widely known by the public as it is part of the country’s constitution. In addition to that it is not easy
to modify the constitution without public support. The participatory way of working or the
procedures that demand public approval before any legalization in the other tool to increase
transparency in decision making. Public education and awareness raising campaigns contributed for
clear understanding of rights and obligations by land holders. When the rights and obligations are
clarified the room for informal payments is narrowed. The book of holding distributed for every land
holder includes the major rights, responsibilities and obligations of the land holder in addition to the

                                                                                                         106
major information about the land and land holders. Within all this measures, corruption in the land
sector is apparent.

6.5.3 Service standards are published and regularly monitored.

Service standards emanate from institutional mandates. Standards can be crafted based on the
mandates of respective institutions. The division of power between the Federal Government and the
Regional States, the legislation concerning the use and conservation of land is vested in the Federal
Government pursuant to Article 51. Sub-article 5 of the Federal Constitution. Regional States are
vested with the power to administrate land and other natural resources in accordance with the federal
laws as provided under Article 52. Sub-article 2(d) of the Federal Constitution.

The boundary of the responsibilities between federal and regional institutions needs to be clarified by
law. The institutional mandate shall emanate from legal provisions. For land administration issues,
the main responsible ministries at federal level are the Ministry of Agriculture (rural land) and the
Ministry of Urban Development and construction (urban land). The Ethiopian Mapping Agency is
responsible for countrywide topographic mapping and for the implementation and maintenance of
geodetic control points.

In Ethiopia the responsibility to administer and to manage land and natural resources was given to
the regional states. Most regional states have created similar regional and zonal institutions for urban
land administration, whereas municipalities are the major implementing agencies. The regional
implementing agencies for rural land administration are varying between regional states – in naming
and organizational setting. The last restructuring was made after the completion of a BPR (Business
Process Reengineering) study by the federal and regional land offices. BSC (Balanced Score Card)
was used as a tool to plan and to define responsibilities. Service standards were defined but the
follow up of their implementation is weak.

Regional governments do not appear to have adequately thought through monitoring and evaluating
the impacts of their reform efforts. Without this information it will be difficult to measure impacts,
review and modify existing administrative procedures, and develop new policy reform measures.
There was no evidence of any mechanism to monitor the impact of the certification program on
changing land use, changing cropping patterns, investment in land, or the reduction in property
disputes. There is no indication that there has been (nor is there planned) any effort to undertake
socioeconomic surveys to determine if tenure security has been increased as a result of the
certification programs. The service standards are not clear and the customers cannot easily demand
for their rights.



4.6.6 Conclusions and key recommendations

  i.   Policy statements to effectively identify long term unchallenged possessions with good will
       are necessary to avoid the spread of illegal possessions with the assumption of the possibility


                                                                                                    107
        of being legal. Rural and urban land laws have to incorporated the issue in a way it should be
        addressed.
  ii.   The tenure system in the pastoralist and semi pastoralist areas is different and requires policy
        definition of group (clan) rights for effective formalization.
 iii.   Public hearings as a tool for recognizing none-documented evidences and the use of
        shimaglewoch shengo36 to connect the informal rules to the formal legal system is
        significantly important and it has to be expanded to the regions other than the four main
        regions. In-depth study of traditional rules and informal setting is required for coding
        customary law in the pastoral setting.
 iv.    The first registration is like establishing land administration infrastructure and therefore the
        cost has to be free of charge. Updating and maintenance of records that is not practiced in
        Ethiopia except in Amhar regional state need to be based on cost recovery policy principles.
        To establish such a system proper research has to be implemented.
  v.    Currently ongoing engagement to link land records with maps have to be strengthened and
        continue till all land parcels are managed. Policy for the continued use of adjudication
        records from first level certification during second level certification is necessary. Cadastral
        maps need to be simple, connected to the national grid, low cost and multipurpose. The
        cadastral maps should be able to gradually serve for legal, financial and technical functions.
 vi.    Policy to develop a comprehensive land administration system that can record encumbrances
        and obligations at the holding level is required. Furthermore, a policy that clearly stating as to
        how restrictions or charges are consistently recorded is necessary.
vii.    Policy to synchronize public services and public registers is required. The data in land
        registers have to be the base for public services such as address and identification of citizens
        personal records.
viii.   Ethiopia is a beginner country to establish proper land administration system. System
        development, implementation and sustained management needs huge investment. The current
        investment to the land sector is not to the level required and needs serious consideration in
        investment budget allocation.
 ix.    Ethiopia is now engaged in vigorous rural land cadastre activities. Mapping and registering of
        parcels information is very important activity. However, unless the cadastral information is
        updated as transactions take place, the information will be obsolete soon and its importance
        decline in time. Therefore, there must be a legal instrument to make updating obligatory.
  x.    Cost recovery principles have to be supported by policy provisions so that the system is
        enabled to finance itself and to deliver quality services on demand basis.
 xi.    Existence of illegal payments for individuals working in land offices is a threat to the system.
        A system needs to be designed to detect and discourage illegal payments.
xii.    All rounded institutional capacity building is essential to mandated land administration
        institution.

4.7.1 Transparency of valuations

7.1.1 There is a clear process of property valuation.

The expropriation process passes through a long procedure beginning with the conceptualization
stage up to the payment of compensation despite it lacks procedural laws and uniformity in all
places. After the City/Woreda administration has decided to expropriate the land for public purpose,
in principle Project preparation and implementation sensitization meetings shall be organized in the
project affected area aiming at explaining to the residents on the likely project benefits. The
claimants would be informed that they will be compensated and resettled and that their legal rights to
get compensation will be intact. Different alternatives may be given according to the interest and
financial capacity of the affected people. After the overall discussion has been undertaken and a
consensus reached on developmental issues, the people that are going to be displaced will nominate
their representatives that will handle problems and negotiate with expropriators.

After consulting the affected people, tasks to be undertaken by the City / woreda administration are
identified. These tasks include identification of expropriates and/or the people to be displaced and

resettle in the resettlement site; plotting of existing property boundaries, inspection of properties,
preparation of the layout plans/ scheme, cadastral surveying, valuation and assessment of
compensation, payment of compensation, and undertaking the resettlement process. Property valuers
would be assigned to inspect and identify site and property boundaries to know the extent of
acquisition. The assigned properties valuers list and record compensable items and then determine
the amount of compensation that would be paid.

7.1.2 Valuation rolls are publicly accessible

One of the common problems experienced in the country is lack of full public participation and the
secrecy involved in the determination of property values for compensation and other purposes.
Property owners /holders, especially those living in rural areas are usually powerless, with
inadequate sources of information, and without access to unbiased valuation organizations. Most
often, the government assigns property valuers to assess the value of the structure for the purpose
deemed and to come up with a certain value. On the one hand valuation committee members are not
professionals and on the other hand valuation workings and property values are all kept secret from
property owners. This contradicts the right of property owners to know how the values are derived
and what rates have been used. If the property owners object or disagree, the government agents
often threaten them for obstructing public development and for acting against “public purpose”. It is
based on these arguments that the claimants believed that “confidentiality” of the valuation working
increases the chances of inconsistencies, and arbitrary use of valuation rates and methodology.

According to Proc.455/2005, Article 4(3), any landholder who has been served with an expropriation
order shall hand over the land to the Woreda in rural areas or city administration in urban areas
within 90 days, or within 30 days where there is no crop, perennial crop or other property on the
expropriated land from the date of payment of compensation. However, the law did not say anything
about the date of valuation, payment of compensation, the new compensation rates applicable and
additional interest payments if the compensation is not paid within a reasonable period of time after
valuation.

4.7.2 Collection Efficiency

7.2.1 Exemptions from property taxes payment are justified and transparent

Tax collection has shown significant improvements since 2009. Though about 70% to 80% of
assessed land tax is collected, still there are uncollected assessed land taxes. One of the reasons for
non-collection is thus in a large number of exemptions the criteria for which are not always clearly
based on equity or efficiency grounds and are not always applied in a transparent and consistent
manner. In urban areas notably in Addis Ababa, exemption from property taxes are granted to
specific investment sectors or specific land uses while regions additionally exempt rural land below a
minimum stated size. Exemptions of religious institutions, schools, health facilities, burial grounds,
premises used for recreational purposes, and any other premises by resolution of the local authorities
with the regional tax authorities’ approval. These exemptions are generally found to be justified.
Despite rural land use and agricultural income tax is based on flat form (land size), there is some

                                                                                                   110
inconsistencies among regional states. For instance, in Oromiya regional state, a rural land holder is
exempted from land use payment and agricultural income tax if its landholding is less or equal to 0.5
hectare. In general, the exemptions to the payment of land/property taxes are not always clearly
based on equity or efficiency grounds and are not always applied in a transparent and consistent
manner.

7.2.2 All property holders liable to pay property tax are listed on the tax roll.

Allocated land is listed in the tax rolls as a matter of procedure which implies that tax rolls are
normally complete. In urban areas the process of listing property for taxation purpose is integrated
into the land allocation system, resulting in low cost of collection. The property listing in urban areas
extend beyond those liable to pay taxes. The preparation of the list is integrated with land allocation
process. There is also misconception that a tax roll listing is a means of formalization for informal
settlements despite stipulations to the contrary in the official tax reforms. Similar misconceptions
have been identified in rural areas. This is one of the reasons that informal land holders are
expanding at the pre-urban lands of Addis Ababa in particular and in Ethiopia in general. In rural
areas where second level registration and certification is implemented, 10-15% of parcels are found
unregistered during the first level of registration.

7.2.3 Assessed property taxes are collected

In Ethiopia, the contribution of land tax to local economy has not been adequately analyzed.
However, tax revenue constitutes the lion share of government revenue. About 70% of total
domestic revenue is derived from tax, and makes > 13.7% of GDP. Recently, its contribution showed
substantial increase, especially due to the recent introduction of urban land lease and rental taxes as
well as application of tax reform programs. The rural land use fee used to be 51.3 million birr in
1982/3 and reached more than double in 2000/1, which has become 116.2 million birr. However, this
makes 1.1% of the total government revenue.

Domestic revenue collection has been improving in the past several years owing to vigorous tax
reform measures, improved tax administration and trade-facilitation efforts. During 2012/13, tax
revenue increased by 24.8%. In recent years, rural land use fee and urban land lease fee collection at
regional level has improved in nominal terms. There is a high level of collection which is estimated
to range between 50% and 70% of assessed property taxes, especially in urban areas. This is due to
number of reasons, including tax payers land rent payments at the finance offices instead of
deployment of tax collectors, integration of property tax in the land allocation system

7.2.4 Receipts from property tax exceed the cost of collection.

The cost of collecting property taxes is minimal both in urban and rural areas mainly because of the
simplicity in the tax legislation and concurrent collection of taxes. In urban areas the process of
listing property for taxation purposes integrated to the land allocation system, resulting in low cost of
collection. In rural areas, the land use fees are calculated along with agricultural income taxes,


                                                                                                     111
resulting in low cost of collection. In most cases the cost of identification and valuation, which
accounts for most of the costs, is very low in Ethiopia.

4.7.3 Conclusions and key recommendations

   i.   Real Property valuation and taxation in Ethiopia have legal, technical, institutional and
        financial problems. To guide implementation of valuation, property valuation policy
        development and institutional establishment is essential
  ii.   Compensation that could have been paid to affected property owners/holders ought to be
        valued by independent professional property valuators. In addition to that, both the Federal
        and Regional expropriation and payment of compensation laws ought to be amended in such
        a way that property valuators have to use anyone of the three valuation methods when they
        find them appropriate.
 iii.   The Government, in addition to paying fair and reasonable compensation, it has to set
        mechanisms to rehabilitate the affected property owners when their property is taken for
        public purpose.
 iv.    A policy should be developed on tax exemptions with guidelines that can be used in urban
        and rural context
  v.    A policy measure has to be devised to avoid illegal land holding and to avoid misconception
        reflected among informal settlers
 vi.    The expropriation of landholdings for public purposes and payment of compensation laws
        should be reviewed to ensure that there is more extensive information dissemination to the
        public and access to the valuation rolls, and to empower the affected citizens in the process of
        decision making.
vii.    Taxation plays key role in helping the country’s development goal. The government is
        facilitating the development of the nation through the collected money from the taxation.
        Hence, to avoid tax evasion on the one hand and to get the trust and full participation of tax
        payers so that to improve tax collection on the other hand, the overall tax system both in rural
        and urban areas should be analyzed further
viii.   Institutional capacity building to keep up the system is necessary

4.8.1 Assessment of responsibilities

8.1.1 There is clear assignment of responsibility for conflict resolution

Federal and Regional land laws and court establishment laws show that there are various avenues for
land dispute settlement. Regular courts (woreda/first instance, high, and supreme) are recognized as
having binding power over all disputes including one emanating from land. However, in some
instances, administrative authorities entertain land related disputes even without having specific
authority under the law. It is observed that regional rural land laws are not similar in adopting
provisions to resolve a land disputes. However, there is a similarity in that all regions recognize
customary or village level arbitration as starting point in dispute settlement stage. In most cases,
while the poor and vulnerable group tends to try first their case by arbitration, the rich and the
powerful usually skip arbitration and rather prefer courts. With regard to procedure which shall be
followed by rural land arbitration committee, even if some regions are good in elaborating the role of
arbitration committee and the procedure for dispute settlement, it is not uniformly followed by all.

There are also religious courts recognized by the constitution as operating side by side with regular
courts. The FDRE Constitution under Article 78.5 recognizes the possibility of establishment of
“religious and customary courts” besides the regular courts. As a result, Sharia courts are established
at Federal and Regional levels. The consent of both parties is necessary for the Sharia courts to
entertain the case according to Islamic laws.

There are also other types of land related dispute hearing tribunals operating in urban areas:
municipal courts and clearance and compensation hearing tribunals. Urban municipal courts operate
on some limited level. When the city administration becomes a party, municipal courts are the ones
to hear the case. In the event of expropriation of land, there might be claims related to compensation,
public purpose or ownership/holding rights. In this case the urban land clearance and compensation
hearing tribunal which is responsible to the city administration and possesses a qusi-judicial power,
will hear the case.

8.1.2 Conflict resolution mechanisms are accessible to the public

Institutions for providing first instance conflict resolution are accessible at the local level in the
majority of communities at no cost or affordable cost. As already mentioned above, dispute
settlement mechanisms are established at the lowest administrative unit of most areas and are
accessible to the public. They are affordable and accessible to the public even if they have capacity
problems.

In the regions where first level registration is exercised, the dispute settlement committee is
established at kebele level by nominating three representative from the three sub-kebeles. The
committee members serve the public freely for 3-4 years. Their task is to encourage the disputing
parties to solve their problems through conciliation and negotiation. In some regions, they directly
involve the committees to help both parties to resolve their disputes. In regions where land


                                                                                                   114
administration (LA) offices are effectively established at kebele level, the committee is monitored by
the kebele LA officer. In others, the woreda LA or the woreda administration gives direction.

The next higher administrative unit is the woreda wherein a woreda court (lowest hierarchy of the
formal judicial system is located) is found. Based on the geography, a woreda may include 20-40
kebeles under its administration. The woreda court basically entertains both civil and criminal cases
and land issues are categorized as one part of civil litigation. Since the magnitude of land related
disputes is large, in some courts (Eg Amhara) a separate bench is dedicated to hear land related cases
only. Legally speaking, the woreda court is the first instance court for formal litigations as village
level dispute settlement is categorized as informal.

The cost is affordable to rural disputing parties since dispute settlement committee is closely
available to the public and takes less time to resolve cases. However, if the dispute cannot be
resolved amicably through negotiation or arbitration or if one of the parties prefers not to settle the
case by arbitration, the disputing parties need to go to regular woreda court. This causes relatively
higher transaction costs since disputing parties need to travel longer distances and incur higher costs.
Of course, the court fee is small as already mentioned above. In urban areas, there are
municipal/woreda/first instance regular courts to entertain land dispute cases.

8.1.3 Mutually accepted agreements reached through informal dispute resolution systems are
     encouraged

There is a local, informal dispute resolution system that resolves a significant number of conflicts in
an effective and equitable manner but might not be recognized in the formal judicial or
administrative dispute resolution system. In all regions of Ethiopia, agreements reached through
negotiation, compromise, or arbitration is encouraged. About half of disputes are resolved through
locally established institutions before reaching the formal judicial system. However, there is no
uniformity in recognizing these agreements by court of law. In most cases only agreements reached
by arbitration are recognized and enforced but not those reached by negotiation. Some regions
(Oromia) clearly recognize arbitral decisions/agreements as binding while others fail to specify its
status in clear terms. The non-clarity of the law is resulted in an inconsistent approaches followed by
courts. For example, in a field visit made in North Gonder of Amhara Region, courts do not at all
recognize arbitral decisions as binding agreements; they start afresh irrespective of the fact that the
parties had reached agreement through negotiation or arbitration. The fear of the courts is that if
arbitral agreements are to be taken as final ones, disputing parties may be left without right of appeal.
This in other words means that one party who might be forced to cede a certain interest because of
cultural influence (mostly women) would ultimately be a victim of the agreement and hence a fresh
and fair investigation from courts is warranted.

8.1.4 There is an accessible, affordable and timely process for appealing disputed rulings

Appeal is accessible but requires more money, time and knowledge of law. Appeal is available to
disputing parties to take their case to higher courts. But this demands longer time and higher costs
and especially not affordable by women and the poor. For rural land disputes, as already mentioned

                                                                                                     115
before, the initial stage for disputing parties to settle their cases is through either negotiation or
arbitration. Agreements reached by arbitration are accepted as final decisions and may not be heard
again in court of law. This is at least the position of the Civil Procedure Code and rural land laws of
certain regions.

In all urban and rural dispute settlement systems, a right of appeal is recognized except, of course, in
case of expropriation where appeal is allowed only in relation to compensation grievances. Any
decision given by a woreda/first instance/municipal court is appealable to a regional or federal high
court. Any decision rendered by woreda/first instance Sharia court is similarly appealable to a High
Sharia Court. If the court decides in favor of the appellant, the aggrieved party has further right to
appeal to Regional or Federal Supreme Court. And if there is any error of law in the decision of
either of the Supreme Courts, the cases may finally be taken to the Federal Cassation Court, which is
the highest appellate court in the country.

While it is true that the cost of initial dispute settlement is affordable to majority of rural and urban
disputing parties, the cost of dispute in appellate courts is higher especially to rural people who are
forced to travel repeatedly to urban centers. In urban areas, there are municipal/woreda/first instance
regular courts to entertain land dispute cases. Of course, the cost may not be as cheap as that of the
traditional dispute settlement since disputing parties are required to pay court fee and sometimes fee
for legal support. And if the case is further taken by appeal to a high court and thereby to Supreme
Court, people will incur more cost and time. In case of high court, rural people may be required to
travel hundreds of kilometer to bigger urban centers.

Appellate courts are expensive to rural poor not because the court fee is as such big but because they
need to pay higher expenses for such costs as fees for legal assistance, transportation,
accommodation and food. Appellate courts take much time first to investigate the case thoroughly
and second because they are flooded with more appeals. For example, in 2013 the North Shewa High
Court entertained 265 newly initiated cases but 2808 appeals coming from all the 31 woreda courts.

4.8.2 The share of land affected by pending conflicts is low and decreasing

8.2.1 Land disputes constitute a small proportion of cases in the formal legal system

The general scenario in the country shows that more than 50 percent (in some areas up to 70 %) of
civil cases in woreda courts are associated to land arising in the form of inheritance, marital, private
or community land right encroachments and land transactions (lease, exchange, gift). The sheer size
of land related disputes in Ethiopia are dominating the other types of disputes. This is especially the
case in rural areas. Population growth together with lack of additional arable land makes competition
for land resource stiff. Our estimation in Rural Amhara is that about 50% of the rural population is
landless. The last land distribution was conducted in 1997 and those youths below 18 year by then
are now in search of land. In each household, there are at least two youths without land. Parents tried
to give part of their land by donation but this is not enough. Hence, conflict is always flared between
family members during divorce, donation, and inheritance. Conflicts are also raised out of lease
contracts when the powerful takeaway the land they leased from women and the poor. The landless

                                                                                                     116
is involved in massive land grab activities belonging to the communities (common land such as
grazing land) and government lands (such as forest land.)

The other factor that contributes to the increase of land disputes is the law itself. Many regions
incorporate unfair, unclear and contradictory provisions which are reasons to fuel disputes. For
instance, in Amhara Region, inheritance and donation laws are considered as reasons to contribute
for disputes raised between family members.

In other regions, such as Oromia, the significant appreciation of land value becomes a reason for
higher land disputes. There are large amount of informal land sale around the city of Addis Ababa
and other major towns in all the regions. Farmers just sale land informally and over time this
becomes a reason for conflict. Sellers when they see the appreciation of land value, they want their
land back. In Oromia and the South land resource in pastoral areas are reasons for escalated conflicts.
For example, there is continuous armed conflict between the pastoralists of Borona and Guji Oromo
in Oromia Region, and the Afar and the Amhara around the borders of Amhara and Afar Region
because of pasture and water points.

8.2.2 Conflicts in the formal system are resolved in a timely manner

Conflicts in the woreda court, which is formally the first instance court, are mostly on average
resolved within 6 months for more than 90% of cases. This is true from data collected from Amhara
region. As per the telephone conversation with experts from different regions as well (Oromia,
Tigray and South) the figure is not as such different. This is as a result of the court reform introduced
in Ethiopia that requires judges to dispose cases in their hands within fixed period of time unless the
cases are found to be complicated. In Amhara, judges explained that if all evidence is readily
available, cases may be decided in less than three months. However, in reality there are many ups
and downs until all evidence is completed. Woreda courts usually demand evidences from
woreda/kebele land administration offices, and because of the poor recording and preservation of
data, the office in turn demands the evidence from the local land administration committee. The
committee again calls public meeting and collects evidence from the public discussion and sends
such finding to the LA office and thereby to the court.

8.2.3 There are few long-standing (> 5 years) land conflicts

The share of long-standing land conflicts is less than 5% of the total pending land dispute court cases
in woreda courts but higher in percentage in the high court or the regional supreme court (10% and
20%). This is because it is only highly complicated cases or cases for which evidence is difficult to
find that are held for longer period by woreda courts. But in higher and supreme courts, one may
find several such cases because of the intricate procedure.

4.8.3 Conclusions and key recommendations

  i.   A legislative revisit is necessary to reduce the different types of dispute settlement avenues.
       For example, it is possible to eliminate municipal courts and other tribunals and rather

                                                                                                     117
       empower regular courts. The revision of the law may also be a good opportunity to adopt a
       comprehensive procedural approach for land dispute settlement
 ii.   Revise laws to encourage the recognition and enforcement of arbitral decisions and
       agreements. This will lessen the number of cases reaching courts and people will understand
       the result of their agreements
iii.   A policy shift is necessary for courts to focus on quality of decisions instead of quantity only.
       The current policy in courts is focusing on quick disposal of cases and hence reducing
       backlogged cases. In this regard, it is performing very well. But the overall length is not
       shortened since quick decisions are open for errors and then being held for longer times in
       appellate courts. Therefore, the policy must balance the need for speedy trial with quality of
       decision. Establishing a separate land bench within the first instance court system will help
       judges to be more expert in the area and can create the balance between quantity and quality
       of decision. Furthermore, similar decision needs to be considered in opening separate benches
       within the High Court and the Supreme Court.
iv.    Strengthening local arbitral bodies through provision of training, legal materials and work
       offices so that to enhance their capacity to settle disputes cheaply and efficiently. If the local
       community is confident about their ability, ethical behavior and efficiency, more people
       would prefer them to regular courts. The support can also be extended from courts and the
       administration by recognizing and enforcing their decisions. Supporting local legal aid
       centers established by universities will be very important actions. These centers can assist the
       poor and vulnerable groups in their litigations
 v.    Further study is needed to conclude about sources and magnitude of land dispute in order to
       provide solution and thereby reduce land disputes. Further research is also necessary to
       determine the percentage of land disputes compared to other disputes. Further research is
       required to make a reasonable conclusion on the percent the cases
vi.    Enhance land law capacity of woreda judges through capacity building programs of short
       term trainings.
vii.   There is a problem in case classification and reporting of woreda courts concerning land laws
       and the system of land cases classification and recording needs to be revisited in order to
       accommodate the registration of more than two names (eg. inheritance and land, contract and
       land etc). In this way it is possible to address all land cases.

4.9.1 Clarity of mandates and practice

9.1.1 Land policy formulation, implementation and arbitration are separated to avoid conflict of
     interest

It must be noted that Ethiopia has no a comprehensive land policy unless otherwise it is inferred
from the constitution and land laws. Therefore, the land laws are formulated and endorsed by the
House of People’s Representatives at the federal level (HPR). The regional states councils, based on
the federal frame work law, enact their laws. Accordingly, implementation of the law is the
responsibility of ministry of agriculture and the regional states' land administration institutions. The
regional states through their land authorities (bureaus) are the most responsible organs in the
implementation of both federal and regional laws. Thus, implementing Agencies are different from
law makers and the Judiciary.

There is a local, informal dispute resolution system that resolves a significant number of conflicts in
an effective and equitable manner. Hence, the land disputes arbitration committee, is playing a
significant role in reducing conflicts to be submitted to the courts. It serves as a bridge between the
formal and customary (informal) system. In all regions of Ethiopia, agreements reached through
negotiation, compromise, or arbitration is encouraged. At a higher level, there are first instance
courts, higher courts and supreme courts.

9.1.2: Responsibilities of the ministries and agencies dealing with land do not overlap (horizontal
     overlap).

The Ministry of Agriculture (the rural land administration and use directorate) is the lead institution
in the countrywide implementation and oversight of rural land administration. The responsibility of
rural land administration in the Ministry of Agriculture lies in two offices namely the rural land
administration and use directorate and the Agricultural Investment Land Administration Agency. The
first is responsible for land use and land tenure, while the second is responsible for federal level land
administration of large scale agricultural investment lands.

The ministry of urban development and construction (MoUDC) is responsible for guidance and
oversight of urban land administration. However, the institutional separation between urban and rural
areas is an essential weak point of the institutional setting in Ethiopian land administration as there
are peri urban land holders whose land rights are not registered either by the urban or the rural land
administration institutions.

At regional level, there lacks clarity and overlap of responsibility in the preparation and
implementation rural land use planning (e.g in between Amhara Bueau of Agriculture and Bureau
Environmental Protection, Land Administration & Use). The responsibility of land administration
and use and the Bureau of Agriculture of other regions including Somalia and Gambela regional
states are also blurred and lack clarity. For instance, BoA is preparing watershed development plans
which synonymously call it “land use plan” for watershed development objectives. However, the
land use types of a specific watershed should be determined by the Land Administration and use

                                                                                                      120
Authority as the watershed development options will largely be influenced by the selected land use
type. The ministry of mines, ministry of environment and forest have competing interest on land use.
The ministry of environment and forest is mandated to protect, conserve, develop and for the
provision of goods and services from the forest resources. On the other hand the ministry of mines
and energy is mandated for extraction and use of different mineral resources for public use.
Sometimes large deposit of mineral get explored in highly forested areas. The two interests can not
be implemented on the same area.

9.1.3: Administrative (vertical) overlap is avoided.

The overall mandate to enact laws for the utilization and management of land and other natural
resources in Ethiopia is given to the federal government. Simultaneously, the responsibility to
administer land and other natural resources is given to regional states within their jurisdictions.
Institutions responsible for administration of land are divided for rural and urban land despite the fact
that there is an overlap management, leading to conflict of interest and lack of clarity on the matters
related to peri-urban land. Responsibilities are also shared between the federal and regional level,
with large differences in structure and capacity between the regional states.

At the federal level, rural land matters are handled by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), Directorate
for Land Administration and Use. The key responsibility of this directorate is to implement the Rural
Land Administration and Use Proclamation by providing professional support and coordinating
competent authorities. The directorate links the work at the federal level with that at the regional
level and provides inputs for policy making to advance the harmonization of land administration.

The federal constitution under article 52/1 stipulates that Regional governments are the principal
administrators and regulators of land, including the assignment and granting of use-rights and
regional land-use planning. The organizational structure and arrangement of regional land
administration authorities vary from region to region in Ethiopia. For instance, rural land
administration matters such as land registration and certification of holding rights, allocation of land,
dispute resolution and other rural land matters in ANRS are handled by the Bureau of Environmental
Protection, Land Administration and Use (BoEPLAU), reporting directly to the regional government.
In Oromia National Rregional State, the responsibility to administer rural land is given to the Bureau
of Land and Environmental Protection (BoLEP) which is also accountable to the regional state. Rural
land administration matters in Tigray National Regional State (TNRS) are handled by Environmental
Protection, Land Administration and Use Agency (EPLAUA), which is accountable to the regional
Bureau of Agricultural. In SNNP, the responsibility to administer rural land has been given to the
regional Environment and Natural Resources Agency. Implementation of the land administration
exercise both in urban and rural areas is often challenged by interference from the local
Administration. Hence, the lack of clarity regarding the roles and responsibilities of institutions may
be resolved by establishing elaborated list of responsibilities to each level of implementing agency
(National, Regional, and Local institutions).

9.1.4: Land right and use information is shared by public bodies; key parts are regularly reported on
     and publicly accessible.

                                                                                                     121
At all levels it is quite a common practice of the government of Ethiopia to prepare and agree on
annual plans. The plan usually includes the monitoring and reporting arrangement. It is further
communicated to line agencies at the beginning of each fiscal year and disaggregated by zone and
woreda and the woreda again disaggregates the annual plan by kebele.

Each level of implementing institution submits regular report on the implementation status of the
planned activities. However, sharing of the land use information is limited and regularly reported to
regional Bureau of finance and economic development (BoFED) and Ministry of Finance and
Economic development (MoFED). Later, BoFED compiles and reports to the regional
Administration. At woreda level (e.g. in every woreda of Amhara region), the printed land
registration data are shared upon request by the tax authority. Likewise, the urban land right and use
information is reported to the city administration.

Since computerization is not well exercised a full set of information related to rights in land is not
readily accessible. Hence, there is no uniform textual and spatial land-related information at all
levels. However, it is worth mentioning that initiatives in Amhara region has been started and is
being implemented, although, it lacks spatial information. The fact that computerization of uniform
textual and spatial land related data is not in place; means that the accessibility of land records is
under question. As in many developed nations, computerization has given a lot of opportunity to
avail land related information to all the institutions such as tax authorities, courts, local
administration, etc that might have an interest in land issues at reasonable cost.

The regular reports of each line institution are simply a fraction of the information held in the rural
land registry (e.g. Number of registered parcels or number of landholders). Hence, the rural land
information is not in position to facilitate such access. In addition, even though there is a project
which is on progress, there is no such facility in urban land administration. The traditional practice of
making information available to public bodies is what is working now a days and it is not easy to
avail information using the existing paper based information administration.

9.1.5: Overlaps of rights (based on tenure typology) are minimal and do not cause friction or
dispute.

The rural land law and the urban land law identifies the types of tenure and defines the right holder.
The fact that land registration has started means that the rights attached to a specific piece of land is
clarified. By doing so, blurred land rights in many rural areas are getting cleared and overlapping
rights are avoided. However, those rights which are not properly registered and those rights which
are not properly protected are subject to overlap of use rights. This is mainly manifested in
communal holdings encroached by individuals and in urban areas where informal settlements occur
on state land. It is important to note that farmers whose land is included under the urban boundaries
following the expansions of towns has been subject to informal/illegal transfer of their rights to
urban dwellers leading to informal settlements.


                                                                                                     122
From the point of view of tenure typology, often disputes stem from the overlapping claims of
communal landholders. Individual right holders who have rights in the same land also overlap when
one of them grants rights to someone through secondary arrangements, such as renting out, or
sharecropping. Any events that bring these multiple and overlapping rights into contradiction may
reduce the security with which they are held, and increase the likelihood of conflict, unless effective
dispute resolution mechanisms are in place. The land laws of Regional states expressly state
grievance redress mechanisms.

For instance Amhara (proclamation 133/2006), Southern Nation and Nationalities (proclamation
110/2007), Tigray (proclamation 136/2008), Oromia (proclamation 130/2007) regions have a legal
provisions to resolve conflicts/disputes on land through the administrative procedures at kebele level
by the land administration and use committee. Accordingly, when dispute arises over rural land
holding right, the case is brought to kebele land administration committee. The committee then tries
to let the dispute be resolved by negotiation & arbitration through local elders set by the choice of the
two parties.

9.1.6: Ambiguity in institutional mandates (based on institutional map) does not cause problems.

The Ministry of Agriculture (the rural land administration and use directorate) and the Ministry of
Urban Development and Construction are the lead institution in the country wide guidance and
oversight of rural and urban land administration respectively. Besides, the Ministry of Agriculture
has established an agency to take over the administration of agricultural investment land in excess of
5000 hectares.

In urban areas the city administration is responsible to approve permits for land and building. In rural
areas, it is the Land Administration Committees at the kebele level that are most relevant units in the
process of land registration and certification. In Amhara region, there are kebele offices responsible
for the implementation of planned land administration and use activities. Besides, proclamation
818/2014 gives urban land registration responsibility and will avoid the urban-rural complexes as it
provides legal basis for the registration of urban land which were conflict zones in the urban rural
fringes particularly where the rural and urban boundary were not demarcated.

4.9.2. Equity and non-discrimination in the decision-making process

9.2.1: Land policies and regulations are developed in a participatory manner involving all relevant
     stakeholders.

The Ethiopian system is essentially parliamentarian, where the political party or parties with the
greatest number of seats in the HPR shall form and lead the executive. The most important function
of the HPR is to enact laws on matters assigned to federal jurisdiction and ratify national policy
standards. The HPR also exercises other important functions including the appointment of federal
judges, the ratification of international agreements and the investigation of the conduct of members
of the executive.


                                                                                                     123
The FDRE Constitution, 1995 (Art.50/3) empowers member states of the federation to establish a
legislative organ called the State Council. The State Council is composed of representatives
accountable to the people of the State. The State Council represents the highest level of state
authority, and has the power of legislation on all matters falling under state jurisdiction. The FDRE
Constitution (Art.50/5) declares that the State Council is also given the power to draft, adopt and
amend the state constitution. Most regional States have only a single parliamentary Council that both
enacts laws and decides State constitutional issues.

However, before any policy document goes to endorsement by the House of Peoples Representatives
(HPR), any ministry is expected to draft policy and present to the council of ministers for review. It
is also a common practice that workshops are conducted to get feedbacks from stakeholders. After
deliberation in the council of ministers, the policy/legal document is passed to HPR. The HPR then
pass it to a standing committee for review. After it is reviewed, it comes back to the HPR. For wider
participation of the public at large, media announcement is made to collect comments. This in
principle explains the participation of people during the approval of the laws through their
representatives. When it comes to land policy, in Ethiopia there is no such comprehensive land
policy and hence it is inferred from the existing legislation. Hence, it requires formulation of a
comprehensive land policy. The experiences of policy making in Ethiopia both at federal and
regional levels is generally initiated by implementing government institutions. Accordingly, it lacks
thorough consultation with communities; validation and enrichment process with researchers and
Academics practitioners before delivering of the validated draft policy to policy makers for
endorsement.

9.2.2 Land policies address equity and poverty reduction goals; progress towards these is publicly
monitored.

Right to equality and access to justice are provided for both the in Federal Constitution (Article 25
and 37). The development policies and strategies pursued during Sustainable Development and
Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP), the country’s vision and achievements registered under
SDPRP were the basis for the PASDEP. The Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to
End Poverty (PASDEP) is the First Five Year Phase to attain the goals and targets set in the MDGs
at a minimum. The main objective of the PASDEP was to lay out the directions for accelerated,
sustained, and people-centered economic development as well as to pave the groundwork for the
attainment of the MDGs by 2015. Fundamental policy directions that agriculture and rural
development sector among other things focuses on are scaling up productivity of land.

The Ethiopian government seeks growth that is poverty reducing, and substantial poverty reduction
requires an increase in growth. The government is committed to making meaningful changes to the
role of private investment in agriculture. The plan envisages that private investors in agriculture will
focus on the lowlands, where land is abundant, which means sparsely populated. The government
will assess and identify suitable land and keep a land bank, establishing an effective land
administration system and implementation agency and providing the necessary support to attract
local and foreign investors. The government plans to identify, prepare and transfer 3.3 million ha of


                                                                                                    124
land to commercial farming investors within the GTP period, primarily for export crops. It also plans
to increase nine fold the area under horticulture in the GTP period.

In addition, certification programs of use-rights have been carried out and have increased perceptions
of tenure security and resulted in economic benefits for participants. In this short period of
experience of regions, notable benefits have been registered. Preliminary findings of studies confirm
that GoE‘s regional land certification program is appreciated by rural landholders and is resulting in
increased sense of tenure security leading to attitudinal change from short term exploitation to long
term protection and development of land with multiple positive benefits. Recorded benefits include:
increased soil conservation; increased planting of perennial crops including timber; increasing
intensive production; enhanced land rental market; gender equality in tenure rights; and significant
reductions in land disputes. In some woredas reported court cases are down, and the cadastral-based
modern method of land certification appears to be enhancing farm households’ confidence and
security of tenure.

Although there is no strong monitoring of the policy implementation at higher levels, the plan
usually includes the monitoring and reporting arrangement and it is communicated to line agencies at
the beginning of each fiscal year and disaggregated by zone and woreda and the woreda again
disaggregates the annual plan by kebele. Given the fact that the performance of the planned activity
is evaluated, the measures taken following the evaluation on the implementation gaps to address
poverty reduction goals are usually not satisfactory.

9.2.3: Land policies address ecological and environmental goals; progress towards these is publicly
     monitored.

Ethiopia has no comprehensive land policy; however, some regions have developed land
administration and use policies. For instance, the Amhara Region has formulated and put in place a
land use and administration Policy. The basis for the policy is the Amhara Regional Conservation
Strategy. The policy was adopted in July 2000 and followed by proclamations on land administration
and establishment of the authority to manage land administration and use.

The Federal Conservation Strategy of Ethiopia is emphasizing the necessity to ensure the
empowerment and participation of the people and their organization at all levels in environmental
management activities; and raise awareness and promote understanding of the essential linkages
between environment and development. The cross sector objectives and strategies gives emphasis to
provide security of tenure for land and natural resources users by clearly defining and strengthening
land and other natural resources tenure rights and responsibilities so as to support sustainable
agricultural, pastoral, forestry and fisheries production and a sustainable urban environment.

The federal land law (proclamation 456/2005) in its preamble emphasized the necessity of
sustainably conserving and developing natural resources and pass over to the coming generation
through development and implementation of a sustainable rural land use planning based on different
agro-ecological zones of the country. More bluntly, article 13 deals about land use planning to have
eco-friendly agricultural practices. Besides, the same land law stipulates that in areas where soil and

                                                                                                   125
water conservation works have been done, free grazing is to be prohibited. Based on the federal land
law, the regional land laws address environmental and ecological goals of their respective regions.

Article 3 of the Environmental Impact Assessment proclamation number 292/2002 stipulates that no
person is allowed to commence implementation of any project that requires environmental impact
assessment should get authorization from the environmental protection agencies of the federal
government or the regional states. In addition, prior to issuing an investment permit or a trade or an
operating license for any project any licensing agency should ensure that the federal or the relevant
regional environmental agency has authorized its implementation.

9.2.4: The implementation of land policy is costed, matched with benefits and adequately resourced.

Land administration in Ethiopia has been started from scratch and initially there was no trained
manpower to estimate the cost of implementation of land administration/policy. However, the land
law (proclamation 456/2005 article 13) stipulates that the land registration approach to be pro poor
and low cost (the measurement simply employs traditional units and lacks spatial information). In
addition, the law demands, when possible, the measurement of land using modern surveying
instruments.

The cost of registration and certification for first Stage land registration and certification in Ethiopia
was estimated to be about 1USD per farm plot or 3.5USD per household. Property transfer is the
activity limited to Amhara regional state rural land administration system and hence the discussion
on total cost of recording a property transfer is on limited significance. Cost described here are
establishment costs for property formation. The total cost for recording property transfer includes
overhead costs, material costs and running costs. The estimated average cost for first time surveying,
per parcel for remote sensing tools is $8 and $10 for orthophotos and HRSI respectively. The cost
reported by REILA pilot projects was $8.5 for orthophotos and $11 for HRSI. The cost per parcel for
the ground survey is accounted for both the cost for RTK GNSS and total station accurate surveys
and the second is for ground survey using cheap hand held navigation GPS. The average cost per
parcel for RTK GNSS surveys is calculated to be $12.6 and the equivalent cost for hand held GPS
surveys is $6.9. The cost estimated for total station surveys by other studies is 175 Ethiopian Birr
that is equivalent to 9.7USD. However, the whole cost of land policy implementation has not been
accounted for and adequately resourced. It should be noted that there is a great gap in terms of
technical and financial capacities which has to be considered in the cost estimation.

9.2.5: There is regular and public reporting indicating progress in policy implementation.

The official reports of tracking implementation progresses of the planned activities are regularly
prepared at all levels. The recent development on tracking of land policy implementation sound
better. Accordingly, statistical records by responsible institution are becoming available and field
visit by regulating body and reports to public bodies are now regular.

9.2.6: Land policies help to improve land use by low-income groups and those who experienced
     injustice.

                                                                                                      126
Regional States of Amhara, Tigray, Oromia and SNNP are at a relatively better stage in registration
of landholding rights in the rural areas which helps to establish security of tenure and put in place
legal conditions which are conducive to enhance and strengthen the land use rights of farmers and to
encourage them to take the necessary conservation measures where there is threat of soil erosion and
forest degradation.

Some of the fundamental characteristics of an effective legal framework include transparency and
predictability, equal and fair treatment, rapid adjudication as well as consistency with customs,
norms and level of development. Likewise, the rural land laws of each region are designed to equally
serve the poor taking into account local contexts and norms as for instance in conflict resolution. The
land registration in rural areas is pro poor and approved through the participation of the community.
The joint titling of land rights has greatly improved the right of women on land who before titling
was not benefited from the economic returns of the land. Having a joint title enables women to have
a know share of landholding.

Government has established a youth package to enable the landless youth in the rural areas to be
engaged in any income generating sector. One of the ways described in the package is to allocate
them land when available through consensus with the landholding community to engage in any
identified business plan such as tree nursery establishment, beekeeping, and production of
horticultural crops, sand mining, etc. In addition, providing access to credit for the youth to be able
to rent in any productive land is also part of the package approach.

The rural land laws favor aged, disabled, orphans, women, and also those in the same situation to use
their holdings by renting out or entering an agreement to share income with a developer. However, in
some regions (as in SNNP and Oromia) the laws do not clearly address the rights of women in
polygamous unions. The major gap that impedes proper land use by the low income community is
the poor level of preparation and implementation of land use plans in rural areas.

9.2.7: Land policies proactively and effectively reduce future disaster risk.

With 17 % of the population living in urban areas, Ethiopia is one of the least urbanized countries in
the world. However, urbanization can be observed on a rapidly increasing rate with Addis Ababa
holding 25% of the urban population of the country. While in the past most disaster risk profiling
focused mainly on rural areas, these trends show that more attention needs to be given to urban
contexts.

There is a general paradigm shift from reactive post emergency response to ex-ante preparedness,
mitigation and holistic and proactive Disaster Risk Management (DRM) that aims to improve
knowledge through better multi-sectoral and multi-hazard assessments as outlined in the National
Policy and Strategy on Disaster Risk Management. Tackling urban hazards has also been part of the
GTP1, especially under the objectives of urban development and construction such as integrated
housing development program, urban infrastructure program and capacity building of regional, urban


                                                                                                   127
and city administration officials. In order to operationalize the DRM policy a strategic program and
investment framework (DRM-SPIF) has been developed.

Proclamation 624/2009 applies only to urban centres and to public, industrial and commercial
buildings outside of urban centres. It determines certain national standards for the construction or
modification of buildings, and outlines the regulations and requirements for local authorities to
enforce in their own jurisdictions. Construction is also regulated at the individual level, as
Proclamation 491/2003 requires construction workers as well as architects to hold aptitude
certificates. There are many legal frame works enacted to reduce future disaster risk.

4.9.3 Conclusions and key recommendations

   i.   A harmonized and comprehensive national land policy and land use policy is required and is
        an urgent matter to be considered taking in to account other related policies and strategies
        such as the rural development policy and strategy, the conservation strategy of Ethiopia, the
        water management policy etc
  ii.   The preparation of land policies and laws need to take reasonable time for consultation and
        seek comments through a thorough involvement of relevant stakeholders (policy makers,
        rural & urban community representatives, civil societies and scholars)
 iii.   Provided that more than 50 percent (in some areas up to 80 %) of civil cases in woreda courts
        are associated to land, establishing clear institutional mandates concerning the regulation and
        management of the land sector is deemed relevant which will avoid duplication of
        responsibilities.
 iv.    Detail assessment on the horizontal responsibility overlaps may be required to craft clear
        institutional responsibility among institutions dealing on land management.
  v.    A vertical ambiguity of responsibility should be avoided through establishing clear
        responsibilities at all levels. These responsibilities need to be backed by directives or
        guidelines.
 vi.    Government should speed up the computerized land information system to simplify
        information sharing. The computerized information system should include a web based
        application to create an enabling environment for key public bodies to get connected
vii.    The ongoing land registration exercises both in urban and rural areas need to be completed.
        The registered rights should then be protected and the laws need to be enforced rigorously
        through a functional monitoring and evaluation mechanism.
viii.   Although the land laws are enacted to satisfy the ecological and environmental objectives of
        the country, law enforcement to this end is very poor. Hence, the provisions in the legislation
        need to be enforced rigorously through a functional monitoring mechanism.
 ix.    The cost accounting on implementation of land policy needs to be holistic and demands
        further study to be able to establish efficient and effective cost of implementing various
        components of land policies
  x.    There is a need to establish property valuation institution to develop valuation rolls by
        professional valuators for different economic activities.



                                                                                                   128
xi.   It is essential to conduct study on advantages and disadvantages of having two separate land
      administration institutions for urban and rural lands to enable decision makers to make an
      informed decision.




                                                                                              129
5. Final Conclusions, Recommendations and the way forward

5.1 Conclusions

The nine panels are assessed under 27 indicators and 119 dimensions. Results of the dimension
analysis are condensed and are presented in section 4 of this report with score tables. Conclusions
and actionable key recommendations are presented for each panel in the same section. As a final
conclusion, a summarized result for all panels is presented in table 16. As presented in the table, in
three of the panels, very strong and strong practices, which means A+B, outweigh the weak and very
weak practices. Among these, urban land use, planning and development has the highest number of
dimension, 64.29%, that scored very strong and strong practices followed by dispute resolution and
institutional arrangement and policies panels. But it does not mean that there are no dimensions that
scored weak and very weak practices within these panels. Although Ethiopia has achieved significant
results in the first level registration and certification in the rural land sector and legally recognizing
women's land right, there remains a lot to make geo-referenced parcel mapping to enhance tenure
security and enforcing the legally recognized women's land right specifically in communities
exercising polygamy marriage arrangements.

The highest number of dimensions, 89.47%, that scored weak and very weak practices is observed in
transfer of large tract of land to private investors followed by land valuation and taxation, public land
management and public provision of land information: Registry and Cadastre panels. However, as
the result shows, it does not mean that there is no very strong and strong practices in these panels.
For example, the highest number of dimensions that scored a very strong practice, 33.33%, is in
panel 6. The result of panel 2, rights to forest and common lands and rural land use regulation
performance and panel 1, land rights recognitions are at the borderline. Ethiopia has to take a very
serious corrective measures on land governance issues in panel 5, panel 7, panel 4 and panel 6 as
specified in policy matrix in annex 12.

5.2 Summarized main recommendations

There are recommendation given as an assignment to the government that serve as an instrument to
open policy dialogue and to take actions The main recommendations are presented as follows.

   i. Ethiopia, since mid 1970s, administer and manage its land by two different legal instruments
      and two separate institutions. The LGAF Ethiopia recommends that the government has to
      open a policy dialogue to merge the two institutions or to continue as they are operating.

   ii. In the rural land sector there are two institutions. The RLAUD, which is responsible for the
       administration of smallholders' and government owned lands in the rural areas. The Ethiopian
       Agricultural Investment Land Administration Agency (EAILA) is mandated to oversee large
       scale agricultural investment lands in the rural areas. The LGAF Ethiopia questions the
       importance of this institutional arrangement and request the government to open a policy
       dialogue to merge the two institutions or to allow them to continue as they are currently
       operating.

   iii. Real Property valuation and taxation in Ethiopia have legal, technical, institutional and
        financial problems. To guide implementation of valuation, property valuation policy
        development, legal formulation and institutional establishment is essential. Compensation
        that could have been paid to affected property owners/holders ought to be valued by
        independent professional property valuators. In addition to that, both the Federal and
        Regional expropriation and payment of compensation laws ought to be amended,
        proclamation 455/2005, in such a way that property valuators have to use anyone of the three
        valuation methods when they find them appropriate. The policy and legal framework has to
        address rehabilitation of affected people in addition to compensation payment.

   iv. Neither the federal government nor regional states issued detailed rural lands registration and
       cadastral survey laws which define the system of registration; the standards set for surveying;
       the powers and functions of the registering officer (registrar), the power to cancel or amend
       and maintain the registry file in general; the procedure of updating the files; and the legal
       effect of the holding certificate; etc. Therefore, registration and cadastral laws should clarify
       this situation so as to enforce and implement the law accordingly. Hence, the draft land
       registration and cadastral surveying legislation shall get promulgated and enforced before any
       unintended effects on registered rights practiced. Methodology for pastoral and semi pastoral
       communal lands registration and certification should also be developed and implemented in
       time.

   v. Ethiopia is using its land and land resources without having comprehensive national land use
      policy. Formulation and enactment of a national land use policy is urgently essential. At the
      same time provision of policy framework to give clearer responsibility for managing
      communal lands is needed.



                                                                                                    131
 vi. There are protected forest areas, national parks, wildlife reserves and wetlands. These areas
     are meant to serve the purpose as the names indicate. However, there are evidences to suggest
     that the land which was classified as forest reserve, wildlife sanctuary, national park, and
     wetlands diverted to other purposes particularly for agriculture over the years. This diversion
     has taken place either in the form of encroachments by the surrounding herders and
     smallholder farmers or in the form of allocation for large scale agricultural investments.
     Hence, there is an urgent need to officially demarcate, map and register this lands to sustain
     initially identified use. Attention should be paid for the management of public lands to
     generate public goods and services. Strategic commitment for surveying, mapping and
     registration of public lands and making the information accessible for public use is an urgent
     matter.

 vii. In the big towns, there are large scale eviction from old settlement locations. There is a need
      to redesign policy and strategies that limit large scale eviction problem through exploring
      other options such as more participatory urban upgrading without damaging the social,
      economic and environmental fabrics of an area. There is a big dissatisfaction on the less
      involvement of affected communities in the compensation computation process and on the
      level of compensation payment. This situation needs an urgent reconsideration. Measures
      have to be designed and implemented to make proper implementation of the legal tools
      enacted in urban land use. Additional legal tools have to be developed to guide the urban
      expansion based on land use plans.

viii. Investment projects should be given the go-ahead only after full consultation with local
     communities. The government should be accountable to communities and should involve them
     at all stages of the decision-making process. There must be an enforceable benefit-sharing
     scheme instead of simply leasing out the land so that communities stand to gain from the
     investment projects. This could be a profit-sharing scheme as is being tried in some African
     countries with large scale extractive projects (mining, petroleum, etc). Contracts should
     stipulate investors’ obligations with regard to social investments in the communities concerned
     (e.g. schools, health centres, and clean water). Social investments should address community
     needs, based on consultation with them.

 ix. The first registration is like establishing land administration infrastructure and therefore the
     cost has to be free of charge. Updating and maintenance of records that is not practiced in
     Ethiopia except in Amhar regional state need to be based on cost recovery policy principles.
     To establish such a system proper research has to be implemented. Cost recovery principles
     have to be supported by policy provisions so that the system is enabled to finance itself and to
     deliver quality services on demand basis. Ethiopia is now engaged in vigorous rural land
     cadastre activities. Mapping and registering of parcels information is very important activity.
     However, unless the cadastral information is updated as transactions take place, the
     information will be obsolete soon and its importance decline in time. Therefore, there must
     be a legal instrument to make updating obligatory.



                                                                                                 132
   x. A policy shift is necessary for courts to focus on quality of decisions instead of quantity only.
      The current policy in courts is focusing on quick disposal of cases and hence reducing
      backlogged cases. In this regard, it is performing very well. But the overall length is not
      shortened since quick decisions are open for errors and then being held for longer times in
      appellate courts. Therefore, the policy must balance the need for speedy trial with quality of
      decision. Establishing a separate land bench within the first instance court system will help
      judges to be more expert in the area and can create the balance between quantity and quality
      of decision. For appeal cases, to provide speedy trial especially in relation to land related
      disputes needs establishing a separate bench at the high and supreme court level dedicated
      only to land disputes.

   xi. There is a need to establish property valuation institution to develop valuation rolls by
       professional valuators for different economic activities. It is essential to conduct study on
       advantages and disadvantages of having two separate land administration institutions for
       urban and rural lands to enable decision makers to make an informed decision.

5.3 The way forward

The LGAF Ethiopia implementation came up with specific recommendation given under each
thematic area. Recommendations include policy matters, organizational issues, legal related subjects
matters, institutional capacity building measures and research needs. This is an important result that
has to be acknowledge as a benchmark for future monitoring of the land governance performance of
the country. It is believed that this benchmark will help both decision makers and practitioners.
Decision makers can make a focused and prioritized decisions to shape up the land sector
management for the benefit of the country's economic, social and environmental development and on
the use of the country's scares resources for important areas of land governance measures that need
urgent corrective actions. Practitioners can benefit in prioritizing activities for those land governance
issues that demonstrated weak and very weak performance and that need immediate attentions.

The result provides an opportunity to focus on the monitoring of progresses and to make continuous
corrective measures in an incremental approach. Conducive environment for monitoring progress is
expected in GTP II. As presented in section 3.14, in the rural land sector, the plan for the GTP II
period is to survey, map and register 28.6 million parcels and in the urban land sector is 1.6 million
parcels. During the plan period, there is a target to transfer 62,000 ha and 671,800 ha of land to
private investors in the urban and rural land sectors respectively. This huge task need to be monitor
in time and necessary adjustments have to be made vigilantly to achieve successful results.

During the GTP II, period, it is believed that there are ample opportunities to implement monitoring
activities of land governance progress and improvement. One of the areas that the government
identified as problematic sector in terms good governance is the land sector. The government
promised to the public to use any available means to remove all bad governance related issues in the
land sector, which implies to put and practice monitoring measures. As presented in section 3.12 of
this report, there are many projects operating in the urban and rural land sectors. This opportunity has
to be exploited as much as possible for enhanced monitoring activities. Hence, it is necessary to work

                                                                                                     133
out how to streamline a monitoring activity in the projects in their area of interest and project
objectives.

The EthioLandNet established at Institute of Land Administration in Bahir Dar University, presented
in section 3.12.8 of this report, which is a new initiative, is an opportunity to use it in the monitoring
activities of the country's land governance improvement. Other Universities such as Woldia and
Haromaya universities are potential institutions for monitoring of progress of the country on land
governance implementation. In all these universities and others to come to provide land
administration education, students' term papers and graduating thesis research can be oriented to
monitoring of the country's progress on land governance. Environment, forest and climate change
impact research institute is an important organization to monitor progress of governance issues
related to key natural resources. All Ethiopian experts40 involved in LGAF Ethiopia implementation
are potential human resources to be invited to participate on land governance monitoring activities.
The coordination of the monitoring activities have to be managed by the responsible federal and
regional institutions supported by international institutions such as the World Bank and others.

A legislative revisit is necessary to reduce the different
types of dispute settlement avenues. For example, it is
possible to eliminate municipal courts and other tribunals

law may also be a good opportunity to adopt a
comprehensive procedural approach for land dispute
settlement
Revise laws to encourage the recognition and
enforcement of arbitral decisions and agreements. This         Law
                                                                                   Ministry of Justices
will lessen the number of cases reaching courts and            revised/endorsed
people will understand the result of their agreements
A policy shift is necessary for courts to focus on quality
of decisions instead of quantity only. The current policy
in courts is focusing on quick disposal of cases and hence
reducing backlogged cases. In this regard, it is
performing very well. But the overall length is not
shortened since quick decisions are open for errors and
then being held for longer times in appellate courts.          Policy guideline

trial with quality of decision. Establishing a separate land   established
bench within the first instance court system will help
judges to be more expert in the area and can create the
balance between quantity and quality of decision.
Furthermore, similar decision needs to be considered in
opening separate benches within the High Court and the
Supreme Court

Annex 4. Panel 1, statistical interpretation of results


The thematic area, Land Rights Recognition, is assessed by two Land Governance Indicators (LGI)
and 13 dimensions. The Expert Investigator assessed each dimension and gave preliminary scores
except dimension 1.2.4 that says " The number of illegal land sales is low " due to the reason of lack
of data or information. Because there is no official record on illegal land transaction. However,
during the panel discussion, participants debated in length and agreed to score B for the dimension,
which is stated as " The number of illegal land transactions is low and some are unambiguously
identified on a routine basis ". The panel changed some of the score levels. Dimension 1.2.3 was
scored C by the expert, but the panel changed it to a lower level of score D. Similarly, Dimension
1.2.5 was scored C by the expert. But the panel changed the score to D. Furthermore, the panel
scored dimension 1.2.7 C that was scored B by the expert investigator. One of the dimensions,
dimension 1.1.3, which says " Indigenous rights to land and forest are legally recognized and
protected in practice" is not scored by the panel due to the reason that there is no legally recognized
indigenous communities in Ethiopia. However, the dimension was assessed and scored D by the
expert investigator. For the other dimension, scores given by the expert investigator are approved by
the panel and the final score result is presented in table 7. Based on the adjustments made by the
panel on scores, an overall evaluation is made on the thematic area. Out of the assessed dimensions,
which are 12, only 2 (15.38%) scored A. These dimensions are rural land registration and respect for
women's right in property registration. Those dimensions that scored B are 5 (38.46%). Putting
together the A and B scores it is 53.84%. Based on this assessment, Ethiopia has strong and very
Strong practice in Land Right Recognition within the existing constitutional framework. However,
there are 4 (30.77%) Dimensions that scored D, which is categorized as Very Weak practices. These
dimensions have to be the concern of the country. Concerning these dimensions, the country has to
take corrective measures, which includes, (i) creating access opportunities for tenure
individualization, (ii) geo-referenced mapping of individual parcels in rural areas, (iii) registering
and geo-referenced mapping of parcels in urban areas, and (iv) managing properly lease transaction.
When the country's performance is assessed at indicator level, as presented in table 17, Ethiopia has
nearly Strong practice in recognition of a continuum of rights in the existing constitutional
framework. But the country's performance in respect for and enforcement of rights is nearly weak.

Annex 5. Panel 2, statistical interpretation of results

The thematic area "Rights to forest and common lands & rural land use regulations" is assessed
under 15 dimensions that are packed under 2 Land Governance Indicators, table 8. Preliminary
scoring is given by the expert investigator and an adjustment is done during the panel discussion.
The panel changed the score for dimension 2.1.3 from A to B, which means from higher level score
to a lower level score. Preliminary score given by the expert investigator for dimension 2.1.5 has
been debated by the panel participants and finally agreed to change it from C to B. This change is
from a lower level of scoring to a higher level of scoring. With similar trend of debate on each
dimension the panel changed the score of dimension 2.1.6 from C to B, dimension 2.1.8 from B to C,
and dimension 2.2.5 from C to B. Dimension 2.2.3, which is stated as " Rural land use plans are
elaborated/changed via public process and resulting burdens are shared" is one of the highly debated
dimensions. The issue is that there is no land use policy in the country and there is no systematic land
use planning and implementation in practice. From this perspectives, although the expert investigator
scored D, the panel decided to cancel the score and to leave the dimension without score due to the
reason that there is no score that fit to choose. The expert investigator is unable to assign preliminary
scores for dimension 2.2.4 that is stated as " Rural lands, the use of which is changed, are swiftly
transferred to the destined use" and dimension 2.2.6 stated as " For protected rural land use (forest,
pastures, wetlands, national parks etc.) plans correspond to actual use" due to insufficient data and
relevant information. Although there is limited data and information, the panel made a judgment and
scored each dimension D.

According score adjustments made by the panel, the performance of the country in the thematic area,
which is stated as " Rights to forest and common lands & rural land use regulations" is analysed. The
result of scoring of the dimensions under the thematic area is presented in table 8. The result shows
that there is no dimension scored A, which indicates that Ethiopia is not performing Very Strongly
on issues and subject matters addressed in any of the dimensions. There are 7 dimension scored B,
which is 50% of the dimensions scored. As presented in the methodology, score B is labelled as
"Strong" performance. Hence, Ethiopia has strong practices in 50% of the dimensions. However, 3
dimensions scored C and 4 dimensions scored D. The two together represent 50%. Again as
presented in the methodology, C is labelled as "Weak" and D is labelled as "Very Weak" practice.
These dimension have to be a serious concerns for Ethiopia. The country has to make the necessary
corrective measures on (i) clearly identifying and giving responsibilities to appropriate institutions in
the legal system for common lands, (ii) defining the co-existence of multiple rights on the same plot
of land in the legal system and its enforcement, and (iii) providing the necessary opportunities for
recording and mapping of lands managed and used by identified groups of communities. An
immediate corrective measures for those dimension scored D (28.57%), which are Very Weak
practices, is highly essentials. The essential measures includes (i) recording and mapping of lands
under communal use, (ii) monitoring the swift use of rural land after land use change is decided, (iii)
making public process a mandatory in zoning of rural lands to respect existing rights in the area, and
(iv) monitoring effectively the use of protected areas in the rural setting in accordance to the decided
use. The analysis performed at LGI level is presented in table 18. Weighted mean points are
calculated for the two LGI separately. Calculated weighted mean values are found to be 2.44 and 1.8


                                                                                                     149
for LGI 2.1 and LGI 2.2 respectively, which are in the area of Weak and Very Weak. In general
terms, Ethiopia has to make serious corrective measures in order to improve the indicators.

Annex 6. Panel 3, statistical interpretation of results

During the panel discussion, panel 3, there was an approval of scores on most of the dimension
proposed by the expert investigator and the senior national reviewer. Changes of scores have been
made only on two dimensions. The score for dimension 3.3.4 changed from B to C and dimension
3.5.1 changed from C to B. The final result of the scores is presented in table 9. As presented in table
9, Very Strong and Very Weak results are not recorded. Most of the dimensions, 64.29%, scored B,
which is Strong practice and the rest, 35.71%, scored C, which is Weak practice. The specific
dimensions that scored C are, dimensions 3.2.2, dimensions 3.3.1, dimensions 3.3.2, dimensions
3.3.4 and dimensions 3.5.3. Practices in these dimensions have to be changed and improved and an
immediate attention has to be paid by the municipalities and city administration. Proposed practices,
among others, (i) making the urban land use plan change in a clear public process with full
participation of all stakeholders, (ii) making implementation of low-cost housing policy more
effective in order to decrease those living in inadequate shelters, (iii) adhere to the land use plan
developed to guide the expansion of the largest city, (iv) develop a speedy mechanism in the land use
planning process to cope with urban growth and avoid informal settlement and (v) develop a clear
regulation to manage common properties effectively under condominiums system.

After observing the result at dimension level, further analysis is made at an indicator levels by
aggregating scores under each indicator. As presented in table 19, there is a Strong practice on
restriction on rights, (indicator 3.1) and on speed and predictability of enforcement of restricted land
uses (indicator 3.4). However, the practice on efficiency in the land use planning process is almost
weak (indicator 3.3). Looking the situation on how to improve the practices under this indicator has
to be a serious concern for the urban land sector.

Annex 7. Panel 4, statistical interpretation of results

Table 10 shows the summary of results in panel four. Some scores changed during the panel
discussion. The changes are on dimension 4.1.3, from C to B, dimension 4.1.5 from D to C and on
dimension 4.1.6 from C to B and on dimension 4.3.1 from D to C. Furthermore, the panel cancelled
scores of dimension 4.34 and dimension 4.3.5. and concluded not appropriate to the Ethiopian
situation. Therefore, the result on table 10 is after all these adjustments are made.

Dimension 4.2.2 scored A (8.33%), which means there is a very strong practice to transfer acquired
land to its destined use. There are four dimensions (33.33%) scored B. However, those dimensions
scored C and D together, which means weak and very weak, are much higher (58.33%). Ethiopia has
to look seriously on those activities scored weak and very weak. Dimensions that scored C are
dimension 4.1.4, dimension 4.1.5, dimension 4.3.1 and dimension 4.3.3. To improve practices in
these dimensions, the followings have to be made respectively. (i) remove any ambiguity in
responsibility assignment and capacitate mandated institution, (ii) allocate sufficient resources
(financial, material and human) for better management, (iii) develop a system to acknowledge
unrecorded rights and making compensations for those lost benefits, and (iv) reduce the time in
compensation payment after rights are removed. An immediate action is required on those practices
that are very weak (scored D) by (i) completely recording of the public lands, (ii) monitoring the
transfer of public land satisfy public interest, and (iii) establishing a system to compensate lost
interest due to land use change.

Additional evaluation of the result is made at indicator level and is presented in table 20. As the
result indicates, there is a need to work hard to improve performances of the indicators that scored
C&D. Those dimensions scored A and B are outweighed by those scored C and D.

Annex 8. Panel 5, statistical interpretation of results

Panel five is analyzed with nineteen dimensions packed under four indicators. On relative terms,
many changes of scores, on seven dimensions, took over in this thematic than the others during the
panel discussion. There are only two dimensions, 10.53%, that scored B, table 11. Out of the
nineteen dimension, twelve of them scored C, which is weak, and five dimensions scored D, which is
very weak. Proportionally, 63.16% and 26.32% of the dimensions are weak and very weak practices
respectively. As a matter of priority, to improve practices and to achieve better performance, (i)
make the transaction of public lands transparent and open to the public (dimension 5.1.1), (ii)
establishing a proper mechanism for significant benefit sharing from the gains in land use change
(dimension 5.1.4), (iii) developing a policy for accessing assets developed in the area of transacted
lands (dimension 5.1.5), (iv) establishing resettlement policy to manage resettlement properly when
it is implemented (dimension 5.2.7) and (v) involve the right holders to negotiate and establish future
benefits that can be gained due to the land use change (dimension 5.3.3). Analysis made at indicator
level shows that the performance in all the indicators is weak or very weak, table 21.

Annex 9. Panel 6, statistical interpretation of results

Table 12, depicts summary of scores after adjustments made during panel discussion. There has been
upward score change on dimension 6.2.3 and dimension 6.5.3. Downward score change is made on
dimension 6.1.1, dimension 6.2.5 and dimension 6.5.2. The other scores are maintained as proposed
by the expert investigator. As illustrated in table 12, there are six dimensions, (33.33%) that have
very strong performance. On the contrary, there are six dimensions, (33.33%) that recoded very weak
performance. When the dimensions recoded weak and very weak performance is taken together it
becomes 55.56%, which outweigh very strong and strong performances. As a matter of priority, the
following corrective measures are essential. (i) speedup the rural and urban cadastre and making a
complete information system (dimension 6.2.2), (ii) develop a system to synchronize information in
the public registry (dimension 6.3.1), (iii) develop a system that make updating mandatory
(dimension 6.3.2), (iv) develop a cost recovery system to enable the registry to run by itself (
dimension 6.4.1), (v) improve level of investment for land administration as land is one of the basic
resources of the country (dimension 4.2.1), and (vi) develop and incorporate ethical education in the
education system and develop controlling mechanism to discourage illegal actions of staffs. The
necessary measures have to be taken on other dimensions to improve overall performances.

Additional analysis has been conducted by aggregating the results of the dimension to have an
insight on the level of performances of indicators and to make an informed judgment. As presented
in table 22, there is a very strong practice in mechanism for recognition of rights (indicator 6.1).
However, reliability (indicator 6.3) and cost effectiveness and sustainability (indicator 6.4) are a
serious concerns that need an immediate actions.

Annex 10. Panel 7, statistical interpretation of results

Scores' summary of panel seven is presented in table 13. As the table tells, there is only one
dimension that has very strong, 16.67%, practice (dimension 7.2.4). Dimension 7.2.1 scored B,
which shows that there is strong practice, 16.67%. On the other end, dimension 7.1.1 and dimension
7.1.2 scored D , 33.33%, that expresses the practices in this dimensions is very weak. When the
dimensions that scored C and D are taken together, it becomes 66.67%. Therefore, the country has to
take corrective measures that include (i) making property valuation for taxation and compensation
that reflect market value (dimension 7.1.1), (ii) developing a policy and a guide that makes valuation
rolls are accessible to the public (dimension 7.1.2), (iii) developing a system that increase the percent
of liable property tax payers in the tax rolls more than 70% and put in place monitoring mechanisms
(7.2.2) and (iv) developing a system that increases collection efficiency of assessed property tax
values to make the collection more that 70% and put in place a monitoring mechanisms (dimension
7.2.3). Indicator level result shows that transparency of valuation is very weak while collection
efficiency is much better, table 23.

Annex 11. panel 8, statistical interpretation of results

Summary of scores for panel 8 are presented in table 14. There has been changes of scores during the
panel discussion. The panel changed the score of dimension 8.1.3 from B to C and score of
dimension 8.2.2 from C to B. As the table shows, one dimension scored A, three dimensions scored
B, two dimensions scored C and one dimension scored D. Taking the dimensions scored A and B
together, which means very strong and strong practices, it becomes 57.14%. The balance, 42.86%, is

                                                                                                                 154
weak and very weak practices. Giving priority to the weak and very weak practices to change the
situations and improve performances, Ethiopia has to take corrective measures including (i) reduce
court cases of land dispute by identifying and eliminating the cause of disputes through appropriate
measures (dimension 8.2.1), (ii) encourage community level dispute resolutions to reduce costs and
to enable disputants to use their time for other productive purpose (dimension 8.1.3), and (iii)
develop a system to make the appeal court cases in shorter time and in a cost effective manner.
Indicator level result, table 24, shows that there is a better practice in the area of assignment of
responsibilities.

Annex 12. Panel 9, statistical interpretation of results

Panel nine is analyzed under two indicators and thirteen dimensions, table 15. During the panel
discussion, score of three dimensions changed. The changes are dimension 9.1.1 from A to B,
dimension 9.1.5 from C to B and dimension 9.2.7 from D to C. The rest of the scores remained as
proposed by the expert investigator. The result of the final scoring is summarized and presented in
table 17. As it is shown in the table, there is no dimension scored A or D. Seven dimension, 53.86%,
scored B and six dimensions, 46.14% scored C. In this case, those dimensions scored C, which
means weak, should get first priority to take corrective measures. Among others, Ethiopia has to (i)
remove overlaps that exist within institutions that have interest in the land sector (dimension 9.1.2),
(ii) Make land information readily accessible (dimension 9.1.4), (iii) strengthening the coordination
between different institutions that deal with land (dimension 9.1.6), (iv) put in place a very strong
monitoring system for implementation of ecological and environmental policy objectives (dimension
9.2.3), (v) establish a system and implement a system for cost benefit analysis for land policy
implementation (dimension 9.2.4), and (vi) Enforce and monitor policy implementation that prevent
settlement in high risks areas (dimension 9.2.7). Analysis made at indicated level is presented in
table 18. The performance of the two indicators is not very different. However, indicator 9.2 is a bit
better than indicator 9.1, table 25.
