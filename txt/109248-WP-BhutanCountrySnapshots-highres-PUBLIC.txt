BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Kingdom of Bhutan has been experiencing rapid social and economic development over the past two decades, and this socio-economic transition is fueling
rapid urbanization. Meeting the challenges of urban development, management, and finance is now a key developmental agenda of the government of and its
international development partners. The World Bank started its support with the Bhutan Urban Development Project (1999-2006), which helped develop urban
infrastructure systems in 10 secondary towns. The government showed strong interest and appreciation of the Bank’s policy advice through the project and technical
assistance to prepare the National Urbanization Strategy (2008) and the Thimphu City Development Strategy. On the government side, the Local Government Act of
2009 and Municipal Finance Policy (2012) provide the framework for the roles and responsibilities of urban local governments. In that context, the ongoing BUDP2
focuses on supporting urban/municipal development in Thimphu (the capital and Bhutan’s largest city) and Phuentsholing (second largest city and a commercial hub),
as well as technical assistance for the urban local governments and the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement.
The project development objectives are to (i) support Bhutan’s municipal reform program by strengthening municipal finance and management services in Thimphu
and Phuentsholing; and (ii) improve infrastructure services in northern Thimphu where no formal services are currently available.
The original BUDP2 as well as the Additional Financing consists of three components: municipal finance and management, Thimphu Northern Area Development,
and capacity building.
■■     Component 1 aims at strengthening the institutional systems of Thimphu and Phuentsholing Thromdes, or city corporations. The support for the city-specific
       reforms is being done broadly through strengthening both the local revenue administration systems and processes, and the expenditure management systems
       and financial management systems and processes of the two city corporations. Two new towns (Gelephu and Samdrup Jongkhar) will also be covered under the
       Additional Financing. This component also supports government policy reforms aimed at setting up a policy framework for municipal financing.
■■     Component 2 supports the development of basic infrastructure systems in two “local area plans” in northern Thimphu, including roads, storm-water drainage,
       water supply, sewerage, and street lighting, as well as support for increasing low-income housing units in these areas.
■■     Under Component 3, resources are being provided for training programs, equipment, technical assistance, and studies based on the needs of Thimphu and
       Phuentsholing Thromdes as well as preparation and implementation of urbanization-related policies by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement. This com-
       ponent aims to significantly upgrade each city corporation’s capacities in various aspects of their internal work processes and service delivery to citizens through
       training of operational staff and provision of relevant equipment.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■     Increase in local revenue collection: 50 percent by Thimphu and 40 percent by Phuentsoling.
■■     New building permits issued for serviced plots: 175 (in two Thimphu “local area plans” being developed).
■■     Number of households with new piped water and sewerage connections: 600 (in two Thimphu “local area plans”).
■■     Number of municipal staff trained: 250 (with 150 in Thimphu and 100 in Phuentsholing)

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:
     The Remote Rural Communities Development Project (RRCDP) project area covers 26 gewogs, or village administrative units, and six dzongkhags or districts, in
     southwestern and south central Bhutan. The RRCDP is designed to improve living conditions and incomes in the poorer and more remote rural areas. The populations
     in these areas currently rely on subsistence agriculture, and lack roads, irrigation, technologies, and community and social infrastructure that would allow them to
     improve their incomes and social integration.

     The main objective of the project is to increase agriculture productivity in remote rural areas by improving access to markets, irrigation, agricultural technologies, and
     community infrastructure. Improvement in market access would be achieved by investments in farm roads and marketing infrastructure. Agricultural productivity
     and rural incomes would increase through promotion of improved irrigation and agronomic practices, and rehabilitation of productive assets for key commodities.
     Community-led investments will improve the access of the poorest people to the critical and missing infrastructure in the selected area. The RRCDP consists of three
     components:
     ■■     Rural Infrastructure: Connects the communities to larger roads and regional markets and to improve production potential through improved availability of ir-
            rigation.
     ■■     Community, Marketing and Productive Infrastructure: Covers investments in marketing and post-harvest infrastructure, critical community-level infrastructure,
            and investments identified by producers to increase agricultural productivity.
     ■■     Project Management and Institutional Strengthening: Supports project management, including the monitoring and evaluation functions. It covers technical and
            financial management; procurement; and supervision of compliance with environmental and social safeguards.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■     Formation cutting and construction of permanent works on all five farm roads are in progress.
     ■■     34 irrigation schemes have already been completed or near completion.
     ■■     A total of 76 sub-projects have been financed benefitting 27,387 persons in 4,393 households (13,829 males and 13,558 females).
     ■■     A total of 78,223 grafted seedlings and 258,248 cardamom suckers have been supplied.A total of 225 cows and 15,662 pullets have been distributed. Farmers
            from the five project supported dzongkhags have been able to earn a cash income of Nu 12.444 million and Nu 7.231 million from the sale of 1,387,074 eggs
            and 2,98,413 liters of milk respectively.
     ■■     The project has supported 33 community forest groups benefitting 2520 households in 22 gewogs from 6 dzongkhags. Plantation area covered is now 77.25 ha
            and 5.35 ha under nursery.

PROJECT BACKGROUND:
This programmatic Technical Assistance (TA) seeks to improve the investment climate of Bhutan across two pillars. The first pillar supports the DPC2 operation by
addressing key constraints in the investment climate, in the areas of:

business registration, property registration, and insolvency. These constraints were highlighted and prioritized by the Government in the 2013 Investment Climate
Reform Memorandum and the ensuing Action Plan.
The second pillar consists of an enterprise survey that updates and expands the 2009 survey, and policy notes on competitiveness issues and agribusiness.

The support provided to RGoB to meet the investment climate policy triggers includes:
Revision of the Bankruptcy Act to provide a framework for businesses to resolve insolvency and strengthen the rights of secured creditors.

Introduction of a single window for online business registration.

Improvements of the electronic property and land registration system

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
The first pillar of the Technical Assistance is currently in progress. The WBG has delivered to the Government ICT and workflow assessments of the company registry and
the land registry. Based on those, the Government has hired two vendors that will develop the updated system solutions. The Enterprise Survey was conducted in 2015,
and the results are publicly available in the Enterprise Survey website. The policy notes on the competitiveness of the agribusiness sector, and the broad investment
climate are currently being drafted.

          *As of August 23, 2016


     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bhutan lies in a high risk seismic zone in the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. The earthquake in September 2009 (magnitude 6.1 on the Richter scale) which caused
     damages estimated at approximately $52 million followed by floods throughout the country again revealed Bhutan’s vulnerability to adverse natural events. The
     earthquake caused 12 deaths and 47 injuries in three eastern districts. Nearly 91 educational institutions, including schools, 25 basic health units, 3 hospitals, 50 local
     government offices, and numerous cultural and religious structures such as monasteries and temples were damaged during this earthquake. In total, 4,614 individual
     houses were damaged, out of which 446 houses were classified as beyond repair. Major challenges faced during the 2009 earthquake were the unavailability of a
     standard post disaster assessment format, manuals for reconstruction of traditional structures with incorporation of seismic resilient techniques. The unavailability of
     adequate information on seismic activities in Bhutan was mentioned as a challenge for developing adequate building codes for the Bhutan. The Policy and Human
     Resources Development Grant (PHRD) for $1.285 million was approved in February 2013 to address the above challenges.
     The objective of the Project is to improve the understanding of earthquake risk in Bhutan as well as opportunities and challenges associated to its mitigation. The
     Project consists of the following Components:
     ■■     Investigations and mapping for improved understanding of seismic risk: $0.29 million (implemented by the Department of Geology and Mines under the
            Ministry of Economic Affairs )
     ■■     National vulnerability assessment and retrofitting: $ 0.55 million (implemented by the Department of Engineering Services under the Ministry of Works and
            Human Settlement)
     ■■     Improving Seismic Resilience of Traditional Bhutanese Buildings: $0.20 million (implemented by the Department of Culture under the Ministry of Home and
            Cultural Affairs)
     ■■     Development of emergency structural assessment capacity: $0.05 million (implemented by the Department of Engineering Services under the Ministry of
            Works and Human Settlement)
     ■■     Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation: $0.1955 million (implemented by the Department of Disaster Management under the Ministry of Home
            and Cultural Affairs)

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■     Strengthen the seismic network with installation of 6 seismic stations across the country including communication items
     ■■     Work on site for retrofitting of all four public buildings started
     ■■     Typology survey of rammed earth buildings in Bhutan completed and first draft of General guideline for seismic resilient construction techniques for the rammed
            earth structures in Bhutan prepared

     *As of August 23, 2016


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Bhutan is highly exposed to natural disasters and climate risks. Some of the major hydrometeorological hazards facing Bhutan include riverine floods, glacial lake
outburst floods (GLOFs), flash floods, landslides, forest fires, and windstorms. These have significant economic and social consequences. The 2009 cyclone Aila alone
resulted in damages of approximately $17 million (roughly 1.7 percent of Bhutan’s GDP in 2009). However, at present, Bhutan faces significant challenges in terms
of providing accurate weather forecasts and early warnings to communities. Flood-affected communities or infrastructure operators get flood warnings but do not
get flood forecasts with sufficient lead time. Some of the key economic sectors driving Bhutan’s economy, such as agriculture, hydropower, tourism, aviation, water
resources, and infrastructure, are heavily dependent on weather, water, and climate-related information. However, information products tailored to these sectors are
highly limited. Despite the severity of natural hazards, Bhutan also faces significant challenges in its disaster response and emergency preparedness capacity. In the
past decade, Bhutan has demonstrated steady and pro-poor economic growth and a strong commitment to peace and democratic governance. For it to maintain and
build on its development gains and economic reforms, it must strengthen disaster preparedness and improve development of hydromet and climate services.

The project development objective is to strengthen Bhutan’s capacity for hydromet services and disaster preparedness. It has three main Components:
■■     Hydromet Services Improvement: $1.60 million (implemented by the Department of Hydromet Services under the Ministry of Economic Affairs )
■■     Disaster Preparedness and Response Capacity Improvement: $2.00 million (implemented by the Department of Disaster Management under the Ministry of
       Home and Cultural Affairs)
■■     Design of an Agromet Decision Support System: $0.2 million (implemented by the Department of Agriculture under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■     The project is expected to support increase in the number of hydromet services provided to users such as wind advisories for aviation sector and flood forecasts
       to vulnerable communities.
■■     The project will also result in improved capacity for disaster preparedness through construction of a national emergency operating center and strengthened
       emergency communications capacity at the district level.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Even though Bhutan is a net sequester of greenhouse gases (GHG), the effects of climate change and variability are becoming increasingly visible. Bhutan is highly
     exposed to hydro-meteorological hazards such as floods, flashfloods, landslides, Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF), windstorms and cyclones. According to the
     International Disaster Database, the 10 most significant natural disasters in Bhutan have all occurred in the last twenty years in terms of casualties and number of
     people affected. With climate change, the frequency and intensity of major hydro-meteorological hazards is expected to increase and this will have a major impact on all
     key socio-economic sectors such as agriculture, hydropower, tourism, transport, infrastructure and water, particularly affecting marginal and poorer communities. The
     country is also increasingly experiencing prolonged and extreme droughts which in turn increases the risk of loss of biodiversity, crop yield, agricultural productivity, as
     well as forest fires. To address these risks, the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) is undertaking a variety of actions with support from different agencies and sectors
     in Bhutan. However, what is unclear is how they are embedded in a long term vision, how adaptation in Bhutan can be understood in the context of a low carbon
     development path, which sectors to prioritize or what the role of the private sector can play in supporting climate resilience.

     Bhutan’s National Adaptation Action Plan focused on identifying “urgent and immediate projects and activities that can help communities adapt to climate change,”
     and the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions put a broad spectrum of priorities for both mitigation and adaptation for low GHG emission development
     and broadly describes how this will be implemented. But there is a need to take a more long term and strategic view of how Bhutan can position itself for addressing
     climate related risks. In order to develop such a strategic vision, Bhutan has been selected as a participating country for support through the Climate Investment Funds
     (CIF). This pipeline project supports the development of this strategic vision and the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR).
     The project development objective is to strengthen the capacity of the RGoB for improving climate resilience. The output of the process will be the SPCR document
     which is expected to develop a programmatic approach outlining country priorities and capacity development, and articulate a program of investments to achieve
     climate resilience. It will also inform the formulation of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and inform the 12th Five Year Plan (July 2018-June 2023) now being
     prepared.
     The Project will consists of the following Components:

     Development of the SPCR: $1.10 million

     Project Management, Capacity building and Institutional coordination: $ 0.40 million

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Bhutan is a FCPF member country. The Grant Agreement for REDD+ Readiness Preparation was signed between the WB and the Ministry of Finance in March 2015,
and the REDD+ Readiness Preparation project was launched officially on May 27, 2015. The REDD+ Secretariat in the Watershed Management Division, MoAF has a
strong team and is delivering the REDD readiness activities on schedule ensuring to develop a robust in-house capacity for leading on a number of readiness analytical
studies. Keeping the current pace of delivery disbursements are likely to reach if not exceed 50% by mid-term, one of the eligibility main criteria for the $5 million in
additional funding. As part of the Readiness activities, the RGoB has completed data collection for the National Forest Inventory. One of the underlying studies under
the REDD+ Readiness - to assess the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation- is ongoing with plans to contract a number of consultancies in Q2. As part of the
Readiness, the Secretariat is in the process of developing a pilot PES system for the Bhutan Sustainable Hydropower Development Policy that has a provision to support
Environmental Services.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     In February 2015, the RGoB requested the World Bank’s assistance to carry out an assessment of the environmental and social impacts of the current and future
     hydropower development in Bhutan. The requested assistance aimed to support the RGoB to prepare a realistic plan for action for implementation of hydropower
     projects based on absorptive capacity of the economy and social-economic impacts. The study complemented the Macro-economic impact assessment of the
     Government’s planned 10,000 MW hydropower development initiative, also led by the World Bank, thereby providing the RGoB with a complete sustainability
     analysis and assessment of its planned hydropower development. The development objective was to support sustainable hydropower development in Bhutan at
     the strategic level through an assessment of Bhutan’s policy framework, institutional capacity, and the expected high-level impacts of hydropower development. The
     immediate objectives of the ESW are to:
     ■■     Apply the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol for one hydropower project in Bhutan,
     ■■     Conduct a geographic analysis of potential environmental and social impacts of hydropower in Bhutan
     ■■     Conduct a review of the Bhutanese policy framework and the institutional capacity for hydropower development
     ■■     Provide advice on how Bhutan could improve environmental and social practices for hydropower development.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     The project has identified and documented main gaps in the current planning and management, including the absence of basin planning and cumulative impact
            assessments of hydropower development in Bhutan. The interim results of the study (Interim Report, November 20, 2015) was an important input to a 2-day
            discussion on the country’s capacity to develop hydropower in the 16th Session of the National Council (the Lower Chamber) of RGoB.
     ■■     The identification of these gaps led to concrete recommendations, which were presented at a workshop on April 12-13, 2016, for more than 50 participants from
            key ministries, hydropower developers, and NGOs. Key recommendations, including urgently conducting national studies relating to cumulative impacts and im-
            proving guidelines for preparation and implementation of hydropower, were agreed, and were summarized in the Final Project Report: Managing Environmental
            and Social Impacts of Hydropower in Bhutan (June 15, 2016)
     ■■     A request for conducting planning studies for hydropower development, including the cumulative impact assessments on the national scale and improved
            guidelines, has been requested by the RGoB (Letter to World Bank January 15, 2016), which led to a new technical assistance project. The new Hydropower Policy,
            currently being drafted by the Department of Hydropower and Power Systems (DHPS), is being informed by the results of this project;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The recent review of management of environmental and social (E&S) impacts of hydropower in Bhutan concluded that despite awareness and a good regulatory
framework, challenges remain in upstream planning and in the implementation of the assessment and mitigation of impacts, mainly due lack of capacity among key
governmental institutions to quality assure and enforce good practices. The focus on developing hydropower as the main revenue for the RGoB has also given concern
of being too dependent on only one sector. The Bhutan Development Update 2015 highlighted that the low growth rate of only 2 percent in 2013 was partly caused
by delays in the construction of some of the major hydropower projects due to geological challenges. This indicates that technical sustainability of the hydropower
development is important for the economic growth. Given the significance of hydropower for the economy of the country, and the rapid pace with which Bhutan
intends to develop its hydropower potential, the RGoB has therefore realized that it must ensure that the hydropower investments are durable, safe and sustainable
to deliver expected power and revenues. The Department of Hydropower and Power Systems (DHPS) is the main governmental authority responsible for hydropower
development in Bhutan. With the rapid development of hydropower now occurring, DHPS must establish rules and ensure that these are followed. As part of this role,
DHPS is currently updating the Hydropower Policy for Bhutan. To support the update of the regulatory framework for hydropower development in Bhutan, the RGoB
has requested the World Bank for assistance for preparation of guidelines for preparation of hydropower and strengthening and building of institutional capacity.

The development objective is to support sustainable hydropower development in Bhutan by providing guidelines and strengthening institutional capacity for
preparing and implementing new hydropower projects. The main outcome will be informed policies and practices for hydropower development in Bhutan. The new
Hydropower Policy in Bhutan, being formulated during 2016, will give the overall direction for the guidelines and be influenced by them in turn. The guidelines will
provide more details than the Hydropower Policy, especially focused on implementation of the policy advices

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■     The main technical consultant has been procured and project inception has been conducted. A first workshop for a broad range of stakeholders was held in August,
       2016, focusing on the methodology and approach for the work.
■■     Draft guidelines are expected to be presented in February 2017.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Zhiwa Ling Hotel has been operational since 2005. It is a locally owned and operated 45-room five-star property located in Paro. The investment of $3.5 million to
     expand the Zhiwa Ling Hotel is the first external commercial borrowing by a private-sector entity in Bhutan and has involved significant legal work and very close
     government engagement.

     EXPECTED RESULTS:
     The project will contribute to the development of the tourism sector in Bhutan. More specifically it will:
     ■■     Have a catalytic effect with regard to attracting private investment into Bhutan in general and to high-end hotels in particular;
     ■■     Help create jobs;
     ■■     Support the government’s ”high value - low impact” approach to expanding the tourism sector in Bhutan by attracting high spending, environmentally conscious
            and culturally interested visitors to the country;
     ■■     Transfer international best practices in hotel management – including service and quality standards, occupational health and safety, and environmental manage-
            ment – from an experienced sponsor to the emerging Bhutanese tourism industry;
     ■■     Encourage utilization of a significant proportion of goods and services required by the resort guests from local sources, which will help develop the local supply
            base and encourage the growth of SMEs;
