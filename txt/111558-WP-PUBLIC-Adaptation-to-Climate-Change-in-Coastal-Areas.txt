Executive Summary
Climate-related hazards are increasing in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), and
geographical variations notwithstanding, most societies are faced with the need to adapt
by trying to minimize negative impacts while seizing on the few positive effects.

Adaptation strategies aim at reducing vulnerability as a way to manage climatic
uncertainty. Vulnerability is defined as a function of exposure to weather events,
sensitivity and adaptive capacity; it varies significantly according to the magnitude of
changes (which originate from the interaction between global and local climate patterns),
and the characteristics of the system and sector affected. To reduce vulnerability, it is
necessary to study the projected exposure and current levels of sensitivity and adaptive
capacity of a specific region. This allows for understanding where interventions are
necessary, which interventions can be implemented, and which are most likely to
succeed.

The ECA region is at a stage where knowledge needs to be gathered on future changes,
likely impacts and possible adaptation measures; the Umbrella Report has the specific
goal to initiate this process and inform future analyses of climate change in ECA. The
present section contributes by analyzing vulnerability and adaptive options of the coastal
areas of ECA, with particular a focus on rising sea levels.

Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable because exposure to hazards comes both from
the sea and from the land, and because of their high socioeconomic and naturalistic value.
These hazards are not limited to climate change. The coasts of ECA may be particularly
vulnerable as part of an economic system that is still struggling to complete the transition
after the fall of the Soviet Union.

The basins under study, with the exception of the Arctic, are enclosed and as a result are
going to be strongly influenced by changes in sea temperature and run-off. The synergy
between these two factors and the already high nutrient loads especially characteristic of
the Black, Baltic and Caspian Seas, threaten to increase the likelihood of eutrophication,
algal blooms, and extension of hypoxic/anoxic zones, with consequent impacts on
fisheries production, human health, and tourism. Run-off may increase in the Baltic and
in the north of the Caspian (from the Volga) therefore flushing more nutrients and
fostering extended eutrophication episodes. In the Mediterranean, Black, and Adriatic
Seas, a decrease in total run-off is more likely, but this may still heighten the risk of
eutrophication. In fact, during periods of drought or low-flow, pollutants are less likely
to be flushed away, so when rainfall occurs it causes bursts of highly concentrated
nutrients and pollutants that reach the sea.

Additional threats to human health and tourism may come as a result of the impacts of
sea-level changes and increased storminess. Poor waste management practices in ECA
have resulted in coastal pollution, worsened by the unregulated building of waste dumps
and landfills. Shore erosion may increase the amount of pollutants and solid wastes
flushed into the sea.


                                                                                             4
In the Caspian, where a drop in sea level is expected, the population may be encouraged
to extend the development seaward; the result being increased exposure to heavy metals
trapped at high concentrations in bottom sediments.

A few studies have analyzed the current sea-level-rise and storm conditions in ECA
basins, including the Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea, and projected the possible
consequences of a one meter sea-level-rise. Erosion, floods, and infiltration of saltwater
into aquifers already affect vulnerable lowland areas, river deltas, coastal wetlands and
port cities. A one meter sea-level-rise would aggravate these problems, affecting for
instance the alluvial plain of the Neretva in Croatia where land has been recovered for
agricultural purposes, coastal protected wetlands in Estonia and in the Lena delta near the
Arctic Sea, port cities in Turkey (including Istanbul), and along the Black Sea coast,
Varna in Bulgaria and Rovinij, Pula, Split in Croatia. Vulnerability to these climatic
changes is likely to be exacerbated by unregulated development in areas of the Arctic,
and along the Albanian and Black Sea shores, including Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Georgia.

Overall, impacts are likely to be restricted to a limited number of sites along the coasts of
ECA basins such that general vulnerability is considered low to medium. However, there
is reason for concern, and it could be argued that vulnerability is higher when taking into
consideration that in ECA there is a lack of awareness of climate change projections and
impacts both at the Institutional and public levels, and that coastal development is
accelerating, driven mainly by the tourism and energy sectors.

Because of poor understanding of the climate change threat, and because of the economic
challenges faced by ECA countries, current ECA adaptive capacities are weak. In order
to improve the situation, education and awareness of climate change must reach higher
levels. Furthermore, it is necessary to analyze and improve the status of those
technological, governance, and social aspects that contribute to adaptive capacity.

More research is also needed to consolidate the current knowledge of exposure and
sensitivity of the natural and socioeconomic systems along the coasts. It is critical that
coastal stakeholders across ECA are educated on the available adaptation options so they
can tap into this expertise through the international community.

An Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) process could provide the framework
to perform vulnerability assessments, guide awareness-raising, build adaptive capacity,
and select the appropriate adaptation measures. It is suggested that ICZM would be the
ideal instrument to manage adaptation to climate change events, and minimize human
and material losses.

Typically, ICZM is a proactive process (but it can also be reactive and adjust goals along
the way) that is often triggered by new developmental needs, new coastal threats, or the
need to manage conflicts of interest between stakeholders.

Several of the coastal adaptation measures recommended by experts are part of an
assortment of interventions ordinarily associated with ICZM. Generation and



                                                                                            5
enforcement of zoning schemes, interventions to control erosion and the development of
alternative employment are part of the ICZM arsenal; they can support adjustments in
spatial planning (protect, accommodate, retreat) that are the center of coastal adaptation.
ICZM can also promote strong ties between various sectors of the coastal communities
and strengthen community organization. This, in combination with the promotion of
awareness of climate change, is critical to the success of warning systems, another
important piece of successful adaptation strategies.

Additionally, goals to empower local authorities and resolve conflict between coastal
stakeholders address two of the main issues that most commonly undermine adaptive
capacity.

In parallel to ICZM, Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM) has the characteristics
to implement adaptation measures to control climate change events affecting coastal
areas, by targeting issues along watersheds. An IRBM project can tackle river-planning
water resources management and flood control measures to control the quantity, seasonal
pulses, and quality of water reaching the coasts while taking into consideration the
different uses and stakeholders’ needs (agriculture, industry, urban needs).

In ECA, an IRBM to control emission from the Danube has met with good results.
However, the rate of ICZM success to date is not very encouraging (SDN week 2008;
World Bank 2003). Given these considerations, and the uncertainty of the projections, the
interventions should be two pronged: (1) A process should be initiated to strengthen
ICZM plans or kick start such projects where they are missing; (2) Local-scale projects
should be implemented to address adaptation needs at a smaller scale; this is based on the
idea that small positive outcomes may build consensus among Institutions and the public
for the need of a wider approach managed through a general ICZM.

1. Introduction

1.1 Why coastal areas: definition and importance
The world’s coastal areas represent only 20% of the available land but host between 40%
and more than half of the global population (Burke et al. 2001). No single definition can
encompass the complexity of coasts, and the demarcation of coastal boundaries is no easy
matter, for coastal areas are complex systems composed by a range of terrestrial,
intertidal, and marine environments with seaward and landward zones of influence that
stretch far inland and out to sea. Different countries use different definitions and
boundaries for coastal zones variably based on a combination of ecological, geographical,
socioeconomic, historical, political, administrative, and legislative reasons1. While
certainly informed by the ecological and geophysical characteristics of the coasts, these
definitions are very much determined by functional and management requirements.

Coastal areas have been centers of human activity throughout history and current trends
indicate that migration toward these zones is continuing. The main reason for this is that
the rich variety of ecosystems and habitats in coastal zones provides a range of goods and
services critical to human sustenance and well-being, particularly food production (e.g.
fisheries and aquaculture), raw materials, and transportation options.

Coastal areas provide also other ecological and socioeconomic services with deep
interrelations between them: erosion control of land and intertidal ecosystems (e.g.
wetlands and salt marshes), storm protection, water purification, nutrient recycling, and
recreation (tourism).

Due to their unique location, coastal areas are also at the receiving end of impacts coming
both from the sea and from the land. This exposes coastal areas to the influences of
climate change either directly (sea-level-rise, storm surges, floods, droughts) or indirectly
through events that originate off-site but whose consequences propagate down to the
coasts (river floods and changes in seasonality, pulses, quality of run-off).

This report will analyze coastal vulnerability to climate change, and possible adaptation
options in four ECA basins: the Baltic Sea, the East Adriatic coast and Mediterranean
coast of Turkey, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Russian Arctic Ocean (Figure
1).

In terms of climate change impacts, the focus will be mainly on sea-level-rise (SLR), but
comments will be provided on other hazards threatening the physical and socioeconomic
dimensions of coastal areas.

1.2 Importance of coastal areas in ECA

1.2.1 Social dimension of coastal areas

Coastal areas are most often defined through a combination of physical-geographical and
management criteria. However, this presents difficulties when trying to assess the
socioeconomic or biodiversity conservation value of coastal areas through the use of
global data. To overcome this limitation, coastal areas are commonly defined as:
“intertidal and subtidal areas on and above the continental shelf […] areas routinely
inundated by saltwater, and adjacent land, within 100 km from the shoreline” (Martinez
et al. 2007).

Using this definition, the social importance of the coastal areas in ECA basins is
demonstrated by the percentage of population living within 100 kilometers of the coast
(Figure 2 and Table 1). Albania and Estonia are small countries, which is why almost the
entirety of their populations is included in this group.

           1.2.2 The economic dimension of coastal areas in ECA

           Establishing the relevance of coastal areas to the economy of a country is a more
           complex exercise. Fisheries do not constitute a great share of GDP in ECA basins.
           Fishery landings within a country EEZ1 account for less than one percent of the GDP.
           Buys et al. (2007) examined a subgroup of ECA coastal countries and suggest that a SLR
           of one, two, or three meters would only affect between 0.13% and 1.99% of a country’s
           GDP (Table 2). Georgia and Ukraine are predicted to be the worst off, followed by
           Estonia. Bulgaria and Romania are predicted to be the best off.

The source study (Buys et al. 2007) has been object of criticism and this data may
provide only a rough indication of the actual GDP affected. Firstly, model projections of
sea-level-rise based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios are
between 0.09 and 0.88 meters by 2100; forecasts of two and three meters appear to be
biased toward catastrophic previsions. Secondly, the study overlays sea-level-rise
projections on a static socioeconomic system, and does not consider future development
trends. This is a major shortcoming considering that coastal development is progressing
quickly in ECA basins. Tourism is on the rise in the Mediterranean, Black, and Baltic
Seas, and coastal tourism is expanding particularly in Ukraine, Russia, Romania, and
Georgia. According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) Turkey, Russia,
Ukraine, Poland, and Croatia rank among the top 25 tourism destinations in the world.

Furthermore, these basins are the sites of important port cities (e.g. Constanza, Odessa,
and Sevastopol in the Black Sea) and represent key routes for the shipping of oil and gas
from Asia to Europe.

1.2.3 Natural capital of coastal areas

In addition to economic and social values, the fifteen coastal countries of the region are
important from a biodiversity conservation standpoint (Table 3). Croatia, Albania and
Turkey are part of the Mediterranean basin hotspot, and the entire Caucasus (including
parts of Russia and Turkey) makes up the Caucasus hotspot.2

Figure 3 shows ecosystem service product (ESP) as a percentage of GDP. “ESP can be
defined as the total value of ecosystem services and products of the different ecosystem
types” in coastal areas (Martinez et al. 2007). This is an estimate of the “non-market”
value for goods and services provided by the coasts: food, salt, minerals, oil,
construction materials, shore protection against storms, cycling of nutrients, water
purification, recreation, etc.

The very high number provided by Martinez et al. (2007) for the Russian Federation may
be the result of several very important goods and services provided by the long coasts of
Russia (37,653 kilometers): Arctic tundra controlling atmospheric CO2, productive
fisheries of the Barents and Bering Seas, numerous coastal wetlands providing storm
protection, nutrient cycling and biodiversity conservation services, and raw materials
provision.

  Ramsar is the international Convention on Wetlands (signed in Ramsar, Iran in 1971). “The Convention's
mission is the conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local, regional and national actions and
international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the
world" (Ramsar 2002).

  1.3 Climate change in coastal areas
  Climate change causes various impacts on ECA coastal areas through extreme weather
  events, long-term changing averages in climatic variables and increased weather
  variability (Table 4). Sudden severe phenomena such as storm surges, and gradual
  changes like SLR, will directly affect human well-being by damaging investments and
  infrastructures, and indirectly through modification of coastal ecosystems and habitats
  (Alcamo et al. 2007). Although climate change may offer positive opportunities as well
  as cause harm, it is expected that the latter will far outweigh the former. Furthermore, the
  IPCC reports that for the first decades of the 21st century some of these events will be
  heavily influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)4.

  According to several models these impacts would become most significant after 2050
  (Alcamo et al. 2007). However, two aspects must be considered: (1) several observations
  indicate that climate change may be more dramatic than predicted (see glacier melt
  section), (2) coastal exposure to climate change can vary greatly according to interactions
  between global, regional, and local weather and biogeophysical factors. The rate of sea-
  level-rise is influenced by cyclical regional weather patterns, local atmospheric pressure,
  sea thermal expansion, coast subsidence, uplift caused by tectonic movements, and other
  hydrogeological factors (Nicholls et al. 2007; Nicholls and Klein). While the IPCC
  projects Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES) indicatinh a global SLR of between

   The NAO is the air pressure gradient between Iceland and the Azores that influences the weather in
  northern and central Europe.


                                                                                                                12
0.09 to 0.88 meters by 2100, in Europe the interaction with local factors may induce a
SLR that could be 50% greater than the global estimates (Alcamo et al. 2007).

Given the uncertainty of current estimates, it is critical that an adaptation strategy be put
into action in ECA. Adaptation to climate change in the context of coastal areas is
defined as a policy process entailing decisions on policy and technological interventions
that aim at reducing the vulnerability of the system to climatic changes. This section
follows the general approach of the Umbrella Report in defining vulnerability as a
function of exposure to climate change, sensitivity of the system, and adaptive capacity
(Figure 4).

capacity. Sources: Nicholls et al. 2007; Allen Consulting Group 2005.

In order to reduce the vulnerability of coastal areas to climate change it is therefore
necessary to examine the exposure to climate change of the basins of interest, their
sensitivity to the changes, the adaptive capacity (Box 1) and other factors that may
influence these components. Some adaptation options can then be proposed to reduce
vulnerability by reducing sensitivity to climate change and by promoting the
development of adaptive capacity.

         The local sediment budget will determine the level of erosion, but in general sea-level-rise exacerbates erosion, more strongly on beaches and sandy shores,
      and less so in rocky coasts. The combined action of sediment starvation, sea-level-rise, and land subsidence may create conditions by which the water level rises
      too quickly for natural habitats to adapt and move inland. As a result, these habitats may be flooded and disappear.
      11
         Storm intensity is predicted to increase both in tropical and non-tropical areas – this implies more coastal impacts than from sea-level-rise alone.

Box 1 The elements of vulnerability in coastal areas

     Exposure

     Exposure refers to the natural hazards affecting coastal areas. The hazards belong mainly to three broad
     categories:

     1. Discrete hazards (also referred to as extreme events)
              a. Storm surges
              b. Extreme rainfall events or droughts in upstream terrestrial areas
     2. Continuous hazards (changing averages)
              a. Sea-level-rise
              b. Gradual increase in air and water temperature
              c. Acidification of seawater
     3. Increased weather variability, in terms of storm seasonality, frequency, and intensity, and changes in
          run-off quantity and seasonality.

     Sensitivity14

     The biophysical and socioeconomic properties of a system are the determinants of sensitivity of the
     system to climate change, and determine the magnitude of the outcome (impact) of a physical hazard
     (Brooks et al. 2005).

     • Generic determinants: mediate sensitivity to a broad range of hazards including non-climatic ones
       (e.g. poverty and inequality levels or the general health of the population apply to coastal areas as
       well as to other systems and range of hazards.
     • Specific determinants: mediate sensitivity for particular hazard types. For instance, the topography
       of a coast is a determinant specific for the sensitivity to sea-level-rise and storm surges; given a
       magnitude of exposure, a particular cliff height might result in a low or high sensitivity of the coast to
       that hazard. This is intuitive, as a higher cliff provides more protection to human settlements.
       Another example is the quality of housing; this can be a determinant specific for sensitivity to floods
       and windstorms (Brooks et al. 2003).

     Adaptive capacity

     The UK Climate Impact Programme (2003) defines adaptive capacity as “the ability of a system to
     adjust to climate change, to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope
     with the consequences. Adaptation can be spontaneous or planned, and can be carried out in response or
     in anticipation of changes in climatic conditions.” Adaptive capacity is therefore a combination
     between the availability of policy and technological adaptation options, and how fast they can be
     implemented. Adaptive capacity can be both at the country and local levels: quality of corruption
     control and effectiveness of regulatory environment, access to health care, education and information,
     and presence of social networks.

 It is important to stress the difference between sensitivity and adaptive capacity. For instance, coastal
 population density is a property of the system and as such mediates the impact of a hazard. On the other
 hand, the level of expenditure for coastal protection structures is a way to reduce the threat and as such
 is part of adaptive capacity.




14
  This is the basic definition of sensitivity, prior to any adaptation measure and without considering the
actual adaptive capacity of the system.

                                                                                                               16
1.4 Exposure and sensitivity to hazards in coastal areas
Coastal areas are complex environments where natural and socioeconomic systems are
deeply intertwined. Therefore, before investigating exposure, sensitivity and adaptive
capacity in the ECA region, it is necessary to clarify how these definitions apply to the
specific context of coastal areas.

Table 5 focuses on the different coastal dimensions of exposure and sensitivity.
Proceeding from left to right, the climatic hazards initially affect the natural system and
the magnitude of floods, erosion, etc. (Outcome I) are mediated by the sensitivity of this
system. For instance, the magnitude of erosion caused by sea-level-rise depends on
geological features of the coasts, in particular on the relief and geology (beaches versus
rocky reefs). Similarly, the extent of flooding caused by extreme rainfall events in the
upstream catchments is mediated by the state of the basin, its hydrogeological
characteristics and water resources in the aquifer.

The biogeophysical events triggered by climate change hazards, and mediated by the
sensitivity of the natural system (first level sensitivity) affect a range of natural and
socioeconomic coastal sectors. The magnitude of the impacts on the socioeconomic
system (Outcome II) depends both on the type and the magnitude of the hazards hitting
the system (the Outcome I) and on its second level sensitivity. The latter is often
calculated based on the social and economic importance of coasts as measured by a range
of indicators: population density, economic importance of fishery activities, and
industries like tourism and shipping. The division in sectors helps to identify all the
activities and elements that could be affected by hazards.

Extreme events, sea-level-rise, and changes in precipitation all cause second level
outcomes (Outcome II) that include damages to housing, industrial, and transport
infrastructure. Human health can be affected due to damages to water treatment systems
and waste disposal sites. Also, ecosystems can be damaged; sea storms may impact
wetlands as saltwater infiltration into aquifers has been proven to reduce resilience of
coastal forests to storms. Increases in sea temperature and acidification impact flora and
fauna directly, causing consequences for biodiversity, fisheries, and aquaculture. All
these outcomes are summarized in Table 5.

2. Exposure and sensitivity in ECA coastal lines
This section presents some details of exposure and sensitivity to climate change for
coastal areas of the basins of interest (Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Adriatic and Mediterranean
Seas, Caspian Sea, and Arctic Ocean). Specific examples illustrate how hazards from
sea-level-rise and storm surges result from a combination of global trends and local
conditions, including tectonic uplift or subsidence of the coasts, local weather and
pressure systems, changes in river run-off and evaporation patterns. As it was not
possible to obtain original modeling projections for SLR, data was collected from
different literature sources analyzing different scenarios and time horizons. An effort has
been made to be explicit on the source and the scenarios utilized.

In addition, some cases will be presented to describe possible synergies between climatic
changes and other stressors currently affecting ECA marine basins. This is important as it
must be recognized that vulnerability to climate change of both natural and
socioeconomic sectors of coastal areas will depend not only on changes in climate, but
also on the interaction between these and stresses like pollution, overfishing, land use
change, and habitat fragmentation, along with population increase and changes in
governance, economics and cultural values. These external factors affect vulnerability by
impacting either the sensitivity or the adaptive capacity of the coastal area systems make
(Figure 5).

2.1 Baltic Sea
2.1.1 Weather observations in the 20th century

The Baltic is an area of great weather variation, daily and annually, mainly correlated
with the patterns and strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, in the
last few decades some climatic trends have been detected, which do not match with the
patterns of NAO, and are therefore consistent with a changing climate.

Regarding long-term gradual changes, a warming trend has been registered in the Baltic
greater than the global averages, 0.08 °C increase per decade versus 0.05 C globally
(HELCOM 2007). The overall results in the basin have been an increase in the growing
season and in the length of the frost-free season; the ice season (the period of the year
when ice covers the sea) has been reduced to between 14 and 44 days in the 20th century
(HELCOM 2007). In rivers and lakes, ice thickness has decreased by up to twenty
percent in the past 40 to 50 years, and the duration of river ice coverage has shortened
to/by 25 to 30 days in the north and 35 to 40 days in the south. Also, between 1990 and
2005, annual sea surface temperature has increased up to 0.8 °C in some areas
(HELCOM 2007).

An increase in precipitation has been reported, mainly restricted to the northern part of
the Baltic, while the south has experienced a decrease in precipitation. The increase in
precipitation in the northern areas has overshadowed the general increase in temperature
and caused an increase in snow cover. Conversely, in the last 50 to 70 years, the mean
snow cover duration in the south has decreased in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania13.

No significant trend has been noticed in the past century for what concerns extreme wind
episodes. These are relevant for storm surges, and flooding, and therefore impacts on
coastal areas, but the collected data is consistent with NAO-generated events.

2.1.2 Climate change projections

Projections for the Baltic presented in the climate science section of this Umbrella Report
show an increase in mean annual temperatures, with greater warming in the winter with
respect to the summer. Increases in winter precipitation, decreases in frost days, and
longer heat-waves are also predicted, and will lead to less sea-ice cover. Run-off will
vary between different regions and projections forecast an overall small increase in run-
off for the Baltic (HELCOM 2007).

The Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) has produced a
study (2007) on projections of climate change variables using global and regional GCM
(global circulation models) based on four different Special Report Emission Scenarios
(B1, B2, A2 and A1Fl) using 2100 as time horizon. In summary, the study estimates that
the warming in the Baltic will exceed the global mean warming up to 50% (mean
13
 Snow accounts for large proportions of run-off and is a major factor in flooding, so this may mean better
conditions in the south

                                                                                                        20
atmospheric annual to increase of 3 to 5 °C). The northern areas should experience the
largest warming in winter-spring, and the south should comparatively warm up less, and
mainly in the summer months.

Due to the temperature increases the snow season will reduce further. Also, the sea-ice
season will shorten, decreasing dramatically both in the north (1 to 2 months less) and in
the central Baltic Sea (2 to 3 months less) (HELCOM 2007). The increase in sea
temperature (strongest in the central and south Baltic) and the reduced ice cover (-50 to -
80 % by end of 21st century) are expected to further increase storminess and enhance
coastal erosion (HELCOM 2007). These impacts are presented in Table 4.

Regarding the hydrological conditions the HELCOM (2007) predictions are:
 1. Increased mean annual river flow in northern catchments
 2. Decreased mean annual river flow in southern catchments
 3. Decreased summer river flows
 4. Increased winter flows by 50%.

Hydrological conditions vary regionally and locally. Temperature increases influence
snow volumes along with geological features, evaporation, and changes in precipitation.
These conditions then alter the timing and volume of run-offs.

Sea-level-rise conditions are expected to depend mostly on a combination between global
sea-level-rise, the “uplift of the Scandinavian plate” on the north, and the lowering of the
southern Baltic coasts. Taking these factors in consideration, a sea-level-rise of 1.7
millimeters per year has been recorded in the southeastern Baltic, while a decrease in sea
level of 9.4mm per year is reported for the Gulf of Bothnia between Finland and Sweden
(HELCOM 2007).

SLR may increase coastal erosion particularly in the south (i.e. Poland). And an increase
in windiness as projected through several GCMs could further increase these impacts but
the current forecasts have high levels of uncertainty, and the magnitude of climate change
impacts cannot be ascertained above natural variability as yet.

2.1.3 Examples from Baltic: Estonia and Poland

The best studies on coastal vulnerabilities to SLR in the Baltic have been carried out in
Estonia and Poland.



Estonia

The effects of climate change, in particular sea-level-rise and increased storminess, have
been studied in seven different sites, covering the most characteristic Estonian coastal
areas (Kont et al. 2008; Kont et al. 2003).



                                                                                            21
The low-lying and mostly sandy coast of Estonia is highly sensitive to sea-level-rise,
flooding, and erosion. Historically, the Estonian sea level has fluctuated due to changes
in precipitation, river discharge, and storm patterns, but to date no obvious trend of sea-
level-rise has been recorded. This may be due to a combination of local weather
conditions and to tectonic uplift, that in the area is between 1 and 2.8 millimeters per year
(Kont et al. 2008).14 Despite this, in the past decades erosion rates on sandy beaches
have increased, probably as a result of increased storminess linked to sea warming and to
the reduction of sea-ice cover, particularly during the winter.

The geological characteristics of the coast (Figure 6a), and the low relief makes the
natural system of Estonia particularly sensitive to storms, consequent flooding, and
erosion. Kont et al. (2003) assessed vulnerability of Estonian coasts in terms of natural
and socioeconomic systems, considering a one meter global SLR taking place between
1990 and 2100.

Taking into land uplift consideration, the western shores (including the Hiiumaa island)
would be exposed to wetland inundation, extensive flooding leading to loss of reed beds,
coastal meadows, lagoon ecosystems, spawning trout grounds, and breeding grounds of
migratory birds, including grouse (Figure 6b). The Matsalu bay (the bay depicted in
green at the center of the western Estonian coasts, Figure 6b) is home to Ramsar sites and
important bird areas, and it would be particularly impacted by flooding and storm events.

Differently from most of Europe, the Estonian coasts are scantily populated and, with the
exception of few harbors, coastal settlements are on higher elevations and further inland.
Therefore, the sensitivity of the socioeconomic system is presently very low, and
moderate SLR does not represent a threat. The only two vulnerable sites are the city of
Tallinn (the capital of Estonia) and the Sillamae industrial center. The latter is the
dumping site for radioactive wastes of a former uranium enrichment plant. These wastes
regularly leach into the soil and water and are separated from the sea by a narrow dam.
Increased storminess and sea-level-rise could result in a massive quantity of radioactive
material being flushed directly into the Baltic. The city of Tallinn is one third protected
by seawalls and groins, but the defense system will require adjustments due to the
increased storminess. In general it seems unlikely that climate change will bring great
harm to Estonian coasts; however, the conditions may change in the future as the country
is registering an increased interest for coastal development, partly for tourism purposes.

Poland

Studies based on GCM models have predicted an increase in temperature for Poland,
along with increased frequency and strength of storm conditions (Pruszak and Zawadzka
2008). Measurements begun in the 19th century also show a trend of increasing sea level
through a combination of global SLR forecasts and local observations; Poland coasts are
projected to see an increase in sea level of 45 to 65 centimeters by 2100 (Pruszak and
Zawadzka 2008).

Poland’s coasts are low-lying and mostly sandy (Figure 6a) and they are historically
exposed to flooding and erosion (coastal defenses have been built since the 19th century).
These events have been increasing since the 1970s as a result of sea-level-rise, increased
storminess and sediment starvation caused by regimentation of rivers.15 Pruszak and
Zawadska (2008) point out that the socioeconomic vulnerability of the coasts (without
considering adaptive measures) is particularly high at the eastern and western extremities
of the Polish coast. The cities of Gdansk, Gdynia, and Szczecin are of particular
industrial, economic, and social importance and are in proximity to the main areas of
flooding: the lagoons and lowlands of the Odra and Vistula deltas (Figure 7). Sensitivity
could increase as coastal development is on the rise since the 1990s, following growth in
national GDP.

The ports of Swingujscie and Ustka are of national importance and are also in sensitive
areas. However, the central regions of the Polish coast ecosystems are the most
vulnerable to flooding, and include lagoons, important bird areas, and a UNESCO
biosphere reserve (Figure 6b).

2.1.4 Synergies between climate change and current stresses in the Baltic Sea:
eutrophication & human health

Eutrophication16 is a serious issue in the Baltic Sea. It is caused by the discharge of
nutrients and sediments collected along the vast river basins feeding into the sea, and it is
worsened by the slow water exchange with the North Sea. Extensive blooms of algae and
cyanobacteria have been reported in the since the 19th century, but in the last decades
they have increased in duration, frequency, and biomass (Bianchi et al. 2000).

Run-off into Baltic Sea is predicted to increase over this century due to enhanced
precipitations related to climate change (HELCOM 2007). ECA countries in the south of
the Baltic basin are likely to be exposed to a higher risk of flooding which will contribute
to leaching of nutrients into the sea. Because run-off accounts for up to 97% of the
nutrient influxes from the land to the sea in the Baltic area, it is assumed that increased
run-off will translate into a greater input of nutrients, and possibly exacerbate
eutrophication events (HELCOM 2007).

In addition, surface sea water in the Baltic has been warming for the past fifteen years
and the trend is projected to continue (HELCOM 2007, Alcamo et al. 2007). Assuming a
concurrent increase in nutrients, the combination of these two factors may result in
enhanced phytoplankton growth. An increase in frequency and intensity of these events
raises concern as several species of cyanobacteria carry toxins harmful to human and
animal health.

Warming may exert selective pressure limiting the growth of cold-water species like
diatoms while favoring warm water species like the toxic Nodularia. In fact, the growth
of diatom and dinoflagellate species is optimal only at temperatures just above freezing,
while blooms of cyanobacteria occur only at temperatures higher than 16 ºC.
Furthermore, temperature increase has an enhancing effect on cyanobacteria regardless of
run-off nutrient inputs. This is partly due to the fact that cyanobacteria can naturally fix
nitrogen and therefore contribute directly to eutrophication (HELCOM 2007).

Nodularia spumigena produces toxins called nodularins. These have hepatotoxic effects
causing gastrointestinal illnesses and liver damage in case of persistent exposure
(Hallegraeff et al. 2003). Acute toxicity is the most direct threat, but short, chronic
exposures could lead to serious health effects. For instance it is hypothesized that
“cyanobacterial toxins are part of a complex of risk factors” that determine the high
incidence of human hepatocellular carcinoma registered in China (WHO 1999).

Cases have been reported of death of cattle and pets after ingestion of water or scum
containing Nodularia (WHO 2003) , and although there are no reported cases of human


16
  Eutrophication literally indicates an over-nourishment. The term is used commonly to refer either to out
of norm algal blooms, or to the massive death of organisms following the decomposition of algae and the
loss of oxygen in the water. The trigger of these events is the availability of enormous quantities of
nutrients both inorganic and organic.

                                                                                                        25
poisoning to date, the possible increase of Nodularia blooms represents a hazard for
human health. The risk of exposure could be particularly high for children (WHO 2003).

2.2 Caspian Sea
The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed water body. It is a 1,200 kilometer–long brackish
basin, and because of its north-south orientation it is subject to a variety of climatic
conditions, from a continental climate on the northern shores to sub-tropic conditions in
the south. In winter, sea temperatures in the north are close to 0 ºC, with large expansions
of water covered in ice. In the south, temperatures are around 10 ºC.

Fluctuations in sea level have been one of the most defining characteristics of the
Caspian, and they depend on both natural and human-induced factors. The Volga
provides 80% of the total water inflow to the Caspian, and the outflow is mainly
determined by surface evaporation. Changes in river flows and in climate temperature
modify inflow and outflow, hence causing most of the sea level change. Human
activities, such as damming and water abstraction, have a smaller impact.

Climate change is likely to modify the hydrological budget17 of the Caspian Sea, and
induce variations in sea-level-rise through increased inflow from the Volga and enhanced
surface evaporation from the sea itself.

Recent studies (Renssen et al. 2007; Elguindi and Giorgi 2007) have projected sea level
change in the Caspian using climate models based on the IPCC A1B scenario for the 21st
century. Incidentally, this is the scenario adopted for this Umbrella study on climate
change in ECA (see climate science section).

The model used by Renssen et al. (2007) largely agrees with the Elguindi and Giorgi
(2007) work, and predicts a decrease of six meters in sea level from 1975 to the end of
the 21st century. Based on the simulation, the drop in level is the result of increased
surface evaporation exceeding the augmented run-off from the Volga caused by enhanced
precipitation in the Volga catchment basin. Because the model did not include “direct
anthropogenic influences upon river hydrology, such as water extraction and dam
building” (Renssen et al. 2007), it is reasonable to expect an even greater drop in sea
level.

A significant decrease in sea level, in combination with evaporation and increasing
temperatures may particularly affect fisheries, infrastructures, human health, tourism, and
biodiversity.

The reduction in ice cover, particularly in northern areas, may impact the population of
seals. This species, endemic of the Caspian, uses floating ice as pupping sites and a
drastic reduction of cover may negatively affect its reproductive success. Evaporation,
increase in sea temperatures, and consequent changes in water salinity has the potential to
17
  Net sea-level-rise or drop due to various components, mainly river run-off, precipitations, and
evaporation.

                                                                                                    26
impact fish stocks and put additional stress over the already imperiled sturgeon
population. Furthermore, a reduction in sea level would increase costs for industry
(mainly oil and gas) and transports as it would require modification of structures and
procedures in response to the new conditions.

Finally, this scenario represents a potential health hazard. The Caspian Sea has been
characterized in the past by significant fluctuations in sea level, whose causes have not,
as yet, been completely uncovered. They may include changes in precipitation and run-
off, along with tectonic and carsic movements and other factors. Nevertheless, awareness
of the unpredictability of sea level has not discouraged coastal developments from
occupying new land once the sea has retreated. As a result, past rise in sea level has
caused vast damages, for instance on the Russian coast (Frolov 2000; GEF 2002).

There exists the possibility that a new drop in sea level may again produce an unregulated
rush to occupy newly available land. As a result, the populations would risk contact with
a range of potentially very dangerous substances that are presently locked in the
sediments of the basin (Figure 8).

The increase in temperatures could also promote the generation of algal blooms, which
have recently been recorded along the coastal areas of Iran (Amy Evans, personal
communication), in the south of the Caspian. The formation of red tides would be a
health threat, and cause damage to tourism as well as a problem for fisheries and
aquaculture.

2.2.1 Stressors in the Caspian Sea

As introduced above, climate change events will potentially interact with current stresses,
in particular pollution and unregulated coastal development.

Industrial emissions, toxic and radioactive wastes, agricultural run-off, sewage, and leaks
from oil extraction and refining are the major sources of pollution in the sea. The sources
are both local and off-site. Due to its vast drainage basin, the Volga is the principal
contributor of Caspian nutrients and the projected increased run-off (see climate science
section) may amplify the risk of eutrophication and algal blooms in the shallow northern
part of the sea.

Other impacts include overfishing and habitat destruction in coastal areas, the latter due
mainly to damming and construction of hydroelectric plants on the Volga. The
combination of climate change and current stressors has the potential to impact fisheries,
human health, and biodiversity.

2.3.1 East Adriatic – Northern areas, Croatia, and Albania

High Adriatic

From data monitoring of Venice and its lagoon, a long-term trend of rising sea level has
been clearly established for the north Adriatic coast. This phenomenon is due both to
global changes in sea level and to land subsidence, particularly in deltaic areas. This is
exacerbated by water surges due to storms and by particularly strong winds typical of the
Adriatic basin such as the Bora (cold, dry, northeastern wind) and Sirocco (south-
southeastern wind). The combination of these factors has increased the frequency and
intensity of floods in the northern Adriatic coastal areas (Valiela 2006).

Croatia

Currently there is a lack of sea level projections for the Croatian coast. Only one study
has been run to date with the collaboration of UNEP-MAP and the Climate Change
Group of the University of East Anglia. The modeling exercise produced projections of
sea-level-rise for the 2030, 2050, and 2100 time horizons and for two locations on the
Croatian coast: the island of Cres (with the main city, Losinij), and the Kastela Bay
(Baric et al. 2008). The results are shown in the table below.

To add to the uncertainty, the East Adriatic coast is tectonically active, and observations
of sea-level-rise at different locations recorded between 1956 and 1991 show great
differences, with average sea level rising in one site and dropping in another (Ref.).

A United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/Global Environment Facility (GEF)
project is under way to produce the first national report on climatic changes,
vulnerability, and national adaptive capacity. Because of the lack of consistency in the
data, the project is conducting a qualitative assessment, based on expert judgment, of the
vulnerability of coasts to 20 and 86 centimeter sea-level-rise (Baric et al. 2008)18.

The Croatian coastal zone has high socioeconomic and biodiversity importance. The
narrow coastal strip (1-5 km) has a population density higher than in the hinterland (Baric
et al. 2008). Coastal tourism is a major source of revenue, with 95% of all tourists
remaining on the coasts. Maritime transport and shipbuilding are important industries.
Fisheries and aquaculture have been on the rise, and agriculture is widely practiced on the

The high economic, social, and cultural value of Croatia’s coast indicates that its
socioeconomic system has high sensitivity to climatic hazards. However, from the
biophysical point of view, the sensitivity of the Croatian coast to sea-level-rise and storm
surges is generally low (Baric et al. 2008, Republic of Croatia 2006). In fact most of the
coastline (including the many islands) is rocky, with few steep gravel or sandy beaches,
which are little prone to erosion. The only areas potentially exposed to threats are small,
uninhabited islands, the coastal plain between the cities of Zadar and Sibenik, the alluvial
plain of the Neretva, and a few other areas. The current UNDP/GEF study shows that a
twenty centimeter sea-level-rise would not have a significant impact. Some cities like
Rovinij (on the island of Cres), Pula and Split (on the mainland) are already experiencing
some flooding events and their frequency may increase slightly (Baric et al. 2008). It is
possible that the SLR will cause minor problems to some outlets of sewerage systems,
and to salt pangs. Minor flooding may also occur in the plains of the Neretva, Rasa, and
Cetina rivers.

Contrastingly, a sea-level-rise of 86 centimeters would constitute a much more serious
threat considering that tourism, fisheries, and shipping infrastructures are often built right
up to the shore. Marinas may be seriously damaged, even if one grants that many are built
on floating docks which allow them to adapt more easily to changes in water level
(personal experience). The entire low-lying Istrian west coast, and the aforementioned
cities, with the addition of Dubrovnik, Omis, and Trogir, would be exposed to a much
higher risk of flooding from sea rise and storm surges, and agriculture activity in the
Neretva alluvial plain may be seriously impacted.20 Vulnerable spots include two
freshwater lakes (both named Vrana), one on the Cres Island and another close to city of
Biograd. Saltwater intrusion may occur in the latter (used for irrigation in agriculture), as
the lake is very close to the shore, and the short land strip that separates it from the sea is
of high porosity, karstic in nature (Baric et al. 2008). However, in general it is not
possible to assess the effects of sea-level-rise on saltwater intrusion along the Croatian
coast because there is no available data on current groundwater table levels or soil
permeability.

In summary, SLR effects in Croatia will be localized; it is more complicated to assess the
risk to the 1,185 islands, some of which are of high historical, biodiversity, and tourism
value.

Albania

The socioeconomic system of the Albanian coast is highly sensitive to flooding and
increased storminess. This is mainly a result of unregulated urban development that has

   “An alluvial plain is a relatively flat landform created by the deposition of sediment over a long period of
time by one or more rivers coming from highland regions, from which alluvial soil forms” (Wikipedia,
“Alluvial plain,” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_plain.).
20
   The alluvial plain of the Neretva has been reclaimed for agriculture using dikes and pumping stations.

                                                                                                            31
allowed building right up to the shoreline, exposing infrastructures to a high risk of
damages (World Bank Staff, personal communications).

Considering a 2100 time horizon, “a sea-level-rise of 48-60 cm would result in direct
flooding of coastal areas” and significant saltwater infiltration (Republic of Albania
2002), whereas the projections for 2050 (20 to 24 cm) will not have major impacts. SLR
particularly threatens beach areas in the northern and central zones of the Adriatic.
People, infrastructure, tourism (hotels), roads, and agricultural lands are vulnerable.
Again considering the 2100 time horizon, the Republic of Albania National
Communication to the UNFCCC (2002) identifies particularly vulnerable areas affected
by land subsidence (Shengjin, Kune-Vain, Tale, Patok, Ishem), roads like the new Fushe
Kruje- Lezhe, and former swamps (Durres, Myzeque, Narta, and Vrug). It is also
expected that wetlands will be threatened by the reduction of stream flow which is likely
to result from the reduction in run-off projected for the region (see climate science
section).

Mediterranean coast of Turkey

The Mediterranean coast is diverse both from geomorphological and socioeconomic
points of view.

Karaca and Nicholls (2008) affirm that “there are no reliable long-term sea-level
measurements in the eastern and southern Mediterranean.” However, based on global
projection from several studies, and anecdotal evidence, it is expected that sea-level-rise
and storm surges will especially impact tourism and agriculture along the Mediterranean
coasts of Turkey. The impacts are likely to be localized, as in general the geophysical
characteristics of Turkey’s coastline indicate a low vulnerability to SLR (Republic of
Turkey 2007).

Turkey has tectonically active, high-elevation terrain (85% of Turkey is above 450
meters). Black Sea coasts included, 69% of Turkish coasts are rocky, 19% sandy, and the
remaining 12% are swampy deltaic plains often comprising wetlands and lagoons.
According to the vulnerability study by Karaca and Nicholls (2008), these low-laying
areas are the most vulnerable to flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion assuming a one
meter SLR and storm surges. Several deltaic plains (e.g. Gediz, Seyahn and Ceyhan) are
particularly vulnerable because of land reclamation for agricultural purposes (Karaca and
Nicholls 2008).

While the Black Sea coast of Turkey provides most of the tonnage of the fishery industry,
the Mediterranean coasts and the coasts of the Marmara Sea are most important for the
tourism industry. This sector has a high growth rate and increasing sensitivity to SLR as
most of the newly developed accommodations are built right up to the shoreline.
Moreover, tourism drives most of the large increase in urbanization toward the coast and
large coastal cities like Izmir, Adana, Antalya, and Alanya on the Mediterranean, and
Istanbul on the Marmara. The increase in population in coastal cities significantly
amplifies the sensitivity of the socioeconomic system to sea-level-rise. Istanbul is a


                                                                                         32
particularly sensitive site, as ten percent of the population lives within one kilometer of
the shore, and the city by itself accounts for 21% of the national GDP. The major threats
are actually from saltwater intrusion, particularly to two coastal lagoons and to Terkos
lake, the freshwater supply of the city (Karaca and Nicholls 2008).

The overall vulnerability of the Turkish coastline to SLR is estimated to be low to
medium. However, increases in economic development are expected to increase the
overall sensitivity. Several important sites are going to be significantly affected,
particularly Saros bay, and the eastern Mediterranean (Hatay Yumurtalik, Iskenderun).
Storms are also already heavily affecting the Izmit-Glolcuk bay in the Marmara Sea,
Izmir Bay in the Aegean Sea, and the Fethiye and Antalya gulfs in the Mediterranean.
Damages are projected to increase in absence of an adaptive response. Furthermore,
sensitive cultural and historical sites in Istanbul, and on the Aegean and Mediterranean
coasts, like the ancient Greek cities of Phaselis and Patare, are already threatened by
wave action.

2.4 Black Sea
At present there is a serious lack of studies addressing possible climate change trends in
the Black sea region, and a lack of consistency in the few existing reports.

Regardless, a recent article has focused the attention on some climatic changes along the
southwestern coast (Bulgaria and European side of Turkey) of the Black Sea (Alexandrov
et al. 2005). This modeling study, based on the A2 and B2 IPCC scenarios, projects that
in the 21st century the western coast of the Black sea will experience an increase in the
trends observed during the last two decades of the 20th century, particularly in freshwater
shortages originating from increasing temperatures and droughts, decreasing
precipitations, decreasing run-off, and diminishing groundwater levels. Although the A2
and B2 scenarios do not show complete agreement in the rate of change, they do agree on
predicting increasing warming until 2080, with temperatures that increase by 7to 8 ºC by
the end of the century under the A2 scenario. The model also pointed to a trend that can
lead to a decline in precipitations of up to 70%. As this area of the Black Sea is important
for the agricultural sector, an increase in demand for irrigation has to be expected. This is
expected to clash with the overall reduced water availability.

Valiela (2006) reports that the rate of sea-level-rise has been higher in the Black Sea than
in the Mediterranean (27 ± 2.5 mm per year, versus 7 ± 1.5 mm per year), and this has
repercussions both on urban centers, infrastructures and wetlands. For instance, the
Bulgarian coast is mostly flat and therefore physically sensitive to SLR; the overall
vulnerability is high because of the unregulated development. Increased erosion and
flooding would negatively affect tourism assets, infrastructures, and the energy sector
through impacts on coastal oil and gas refineries (Milen Dyoulgerov World Bank Staff,
personal communication).

Because coastal areas in Bulgaria, Ukraine (chiefly Crimea), and some parts of Georgia
are already affected by chemical and/or wastewater contamination, inundations would


                                                                                           33
likely exacerbate coastal pollution. Furthermore, SLR and storm surges could have an
impact on the erosion affecting the Black Sea coast between Turkey and Georgia,
exacerbated because of unlawful urbanization, sand mining, and poor judgment in site
selection, design, and construction of coastal structures, especially harbors (Yuksek et al.
1995).

Karaca and Nicholls (2008) report tide gauge data collected from 1930 to 2000 for the
following cities: Varna (Bulgaria), Constantza (Romania), Sevastopol (Ukraine), Tuapse
(Russia), Pito (Georgia), and Batumi (Georgia). The relative sea-level-rise over 70 years
is 3.7 millimeters per year for Pito, 6.8 millimeters per year for Batumi, and 1 to 2
millimeters per year for the other cities, which is consistent with global trends. The
results seem to indicate that the Georgian coast is subsiding with respect to the rest of the
Black Sea basin. The Russian coast will be particularly vulnerable to erosion due to high
economic activity and development of coastal tourism; it is also expected that several
large cities along riverbanks will be impacted (Frolov 2000). It is expected that at this
rate cultural and industrial areas will be flooded and salt water will infiltrate coastal
aquifers. For its part, Ukraine is already experiencing erosion problems that caused the
loss of housing, arable land, industrial sites, and traditional spas and resorts for mud
treatment important to the tourism industry.

Sea-level-rise for the Black Sea coast of Turkey has been estimated at 1 to 3 millimeters
per year (Karaca and Nicholls 2008). Flat areas vulnerable to sea-level-rise and storms
are rare, and are represented mainly by deltas and lagoons (19% of Turkish lagoons are
on the Black Sea). The major deltaic areas are the Yesilirmak, Kizilirmak, and Sakarya.
The first two would be particularly sensitive because of agricultural development.
Despite a generally low vulnerability of the biophysical system, a sea-level change of this
magnitude would significantly impact the coastal socioeconomic system. Similarly to the
Mediterranean coast, the Black Sea coasts have high population density concentrated in
coastal cities. Population livelihood is based on fisheries and agriculture, and both
activities are going to be affected by sea-level-rise. In the year 2000, 76% of the Turkish
fishing tonnage came from the Black Sea. The industry is already threatened by
overfishing and pollution, so climate change could worsen the situation (see 2.4.1).
Storm surges already affect some settlements (Karaca and Nicholls 2008) and worsening
conditions may bring damages to the 23 ports along the Black Sea. Furthermore, storms,
erosion, and sustained flooding are predicted to damage the very important shoreline
east-west road system that runs along the coast.

The Black Sea is a very important source, refinement point, and transport route for oil
and gas. There is a concern that oil and gas refineries and infrastructure (e.g. in ports like
Batumi) will be impacted by SLR, increased storminess, and erosion on the Russian,
Bulgarian, Ukrainian, and Georgian coasts.

2.4.1 Stressors in the Black Sea

The coasts of the Black Sea share most of the problems affecting the Baltic. Three main
stresses have caused major degradation of its natural resources:


                                                                                            34
     1. Water pollution: eutrophication/nutrient enrichment (sewage and inorganic
        nutrients), and chemical pollution (including oil and other industrial pollution)
     2. Biodiversity changes: introduction of alien species
     3. Unsustainable use of natural resources: overfishing.

Many rivers open up into the Black Se, and transport sediments, nutrients, and chemicals
collected over vast drainage basins. Three of the four biggest rivers in Europe end in the
Black Sea, and the Danube (the second biggest) has a basin that covers most of central
Europe. Exactly like in the Baltic the ensuing eutrophication problem is exacerbated by
the enclosed nature of the basin, and by its slow water exchange with the Mediterranean.
Despite the 20% reduction in nitrogen emissions from the Danube in the last ten years
(GEF 2007), agricultural and livestock wastes are still an issue, and eutrophication may
be worsened by rising temperatures in the Black Sea (Figure 10).

Rising temperatures and eutrophication may lead to an expansion of anoxic areas with
consequent impacts on fisheries and tourism. The fishery sector has already suffered
greatly in terms of reduced catches, mainly due to overexploitation and introduction of
exotic species. In the mid 1980s, the wart comb jelly Mnemiopsys leidyi (Phylum
Ctenophora) was accidentally introduced in the Black Sea (most likely through the ballast
water21 of ships), and caused a collapse in catches by predating on fish larvae and on their
preys. The spread of other exotic species may be favored even more by the warming of
the sea.

Sea-level-rise and increased storminess represent an additional threat with respect to
chemical pollution. Coastal landfills have been identified as pollution hot-spots in the
Black Sea (GEF 2007); in areas like the coasts of Georgia sea-level-rise and coastal
erosion may further damage these landfills and incease the amount of pollutants flushed
to sea (Darejan Kapenadze World Bank Staff, personal communication).

Finally, the damming and channeling of rivers, along with ill-managed coastal
development are responsible for alteration of the sediment balance, distribution, and a
resultant erosion problem. In Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Georgia there is a major
issue with unregulated construction close to the shore. This promotes erosion and
increases the sensitivity to climate impacts.

usually available for the Caspian.

  2.5 Arctic – Russian coasts in the arctic
  The arctic is one of the areas most vulnerable to climate change. Arctic vulnerability
  may increase due to its rising socioeconomic importance. The IPCC (2007) reports that
  from 1980 to today the arctic has had the highest warming rate, with an increase of
  approximately 1 ºC per decade in the winter and spring months. Future changes will
  have a major impact on the arctic ecosystem and biodiversity and will modify the
  availability of natural resources. These aspects are analyzed in the biodiversity section of
  this Umbrella Report therefore they will not be treated further in this section.

  Declining snow cover and increasing precipitations are expanding the river flow and the
  amount of run-off into most of the Arctic Ocean (Anisimov et al. 2007). This, in
  combination with the melting of glaciers and the retreat of summer sea ice cover is
  driving a global rise in sea level that along the arctic coasts has been measured at between
  ten to twenty centimeters in the past century, and is projected to grow of additional ten to
  ninety centimeters over the course of this century (ACIA 2005).

  On the arctic coasts of Russia, sea-level-rise is already accelerating erosion rates. The
  process will be exacerbated by the thawing of the permafrost, which makes the soil less
  resistant to wave impact, and by the reduction in sea ice, which allows higher, stronger
  waves and storm surges to hit the coast. Erosion, flooding, and receding coastlines will
  impact both natural and socioeconomic systems. Flooding and storm surges are already
  threatening wetlands, settlements, and industrial facilities, some of which will be forced
  to relocate. Thawing of land ice and permafrost will threaten the stability of buildings and
  industrial installations like oil and gas pipelines, while at the same time damaging roads
  and shortening the periods when ice roads can be used for travel, thereby disrupting
  transport and making communications more difficult and costly (ACIA 2005).

  On the positive side, the reduction in sea ice will likely open new shipping routes in the
  arctic, and increase marine transport and access to resources like gas and oil. The
  opening of a northern passage is likely to shift trade routes, change trade links and
  transportation networks, and generally trigger major development. This will undoubtedly



                                                                                                              36
raise sovereignty and environmental concerns that will need to be addressed (ACIA
2005).

2.5.1 Destabilization of the arctic coasts, erosion, and economic damages

The arctic is exposed to a range of environmental impacts of human origin, including
pollution, overharvesting of natural resources, and habitat conversion (see biodiversity
section). Warming of the climate is expected to boost the drilling operation for oil and
gas and consequently more infrastructures and facilities will be built.

This type of development will need to be regulated and will need to take into
consideration synergies between operations on the coasts and sea-level-rise. Past failures
to do so are already inflicting damages and raising costs for industry. The oil storage
facility at Varandei on the Pechora Sea, on the southeastern part of the Barents Sea,
exemplifies the consequences of synergy between impacts on the local environment and
climate change. The area is geologically fairly stable, however industrial constructions
have damaged the natural environment and reduced the stability of the coast so that the
erosion rate is twice as fast than in areas free of human activity (Ogorodov 2004).
Coastal retreat combined with the ensuing direct effects of increasingly strong storm
surges and sea-level-rise have already damaged facilities and housing and are threatening
the airport area. The problem will be exacerbated further as the climate continues to
warm while sea ice cover decreases, giving way to stronger waves and greater sea-level-
rise (ACIA 2005).




                                                                                           37
3. Adaptation strategies
Climatic changes both aggravate old issues and bring new threats to coastal zones.
Models predict that damages will increase if adaptation measures are not implemented.

Today, as in the past, experts and stakeholders most frequently resort to protective
measures against storms and sea-level-rise. The coast of Poland is protected by more than
200 kilometers of hard structures that began to be put in place in the 19th century. Similar
hard structures, as well as dunes, have been adopted along the coasts of Turkey, mostly
on the Black Sea side.

Given the scale of the climatic phenomena and the extent of the territory likely to be
affected, hard structures are not an economically viable solution. Besides, barriers are
known to modify local currents and sedimentation patterns with the result being a mere
shift of erosion problems elsewhere along the coast. In some cases protective structures
will still be necessary, for instance to defend important historical port cities in Croatia
(Dubrovnik, Split), or possibly for cultural sites like the ancient Greek cities of Phaselis
and Patara in Turkey. However, the consensus is that the climate change challenge should
be used as an opportunity to adopt a long-term strategic approach to coastal management;
this is reflected in some of the adaptation options described in Table 7.

Coastal areas have always been known as dynamic systems, shifting between different
states. However changes are now occurring more rapidly and are affected by events
characterized by a high level of uncertainty. As a result, we must prepare both for
projected changes for the unexpected. Adoption of an adaptive management approach is
crucial to deal with the uncertainty of complex climate change events. Here, adaptive
does not refer to reaction or preparation to climate change, but to a management
framework based on implementation, monitoring, and periodic reassessment of
adaptation measures; it requires that the measures against climate change have clearly
defined, measurable goals and carefully planned monitoring systems, so that the observed
failure or success will allow us to learn more about our changing environment and hone
the adaptation solutions (Box 2).

No matter which adaptation option is chosen, this management approach should underpin
the selection process in order for adaptation to be ultimately successful.

Box 2 Adaptive management

“Adaptive management is an approach used to guide intervention in the face of
uncertainty about the system. The main idea is that management actions are taken not
only to manage, but also explicitly to learn about the processes governing the system.
This new information is then used to improve understanding of the system and hence to
inform future management decisions. Monitoring is a key component. A plan for learning
is fundamental – just to say ‘oh that didn’t work, let’s try something else’ is not adaptive
management” (Shea 1998).

 3.1 The basics of adaptation: Protect – Accommodate – Retreat
 Climate change affects coastal areas through a combination of hazards. As such, adaptation to
 inundations originating from sea-level-rise and storm surges is based on three general strategies
 (Klein et al. 2001, Nicholls and Klein 2005):

 1. Protect – reduce the likelihood of the hazard
 2. Accommodate – reduce the impact of the hazard event
 3. Retreat – reduce exposure by moving away from the source of the hazard.

Table 8 Three strategies (a combination of policy and technological options) for adaptation to SLR and storm surges
 Protect                                 Accommodate                             Retreat
 •    Dikes, levees, floodwalls          •   Emergency planning                  •   Increase or establish retreat
 •    Seawalls, bulkheads                •   Insurance                               zones
 •    Groynes                            •   Modification of buildings to        •   Relocate threatened buildings
 •    Floodgates and tidal barriers          cope with floods (strengthen        •   Phase out or ban development
 •    Detached breakwaters                   and lift)                               in areas susceptible to flooding
 •    Periodic beach nourishment         •   Improved drainage                   •   Rolling easements, erosion
 •    Wetland restoration                •   Strict regulation in hazard zones       control easements
 •    Afforestation                      •   Modification of land use            •   Upland buffers
 •    Wooden walls                           planning
 •    Stone walls

 Similar policy and technological options are also adopted to cope with river floods caused by
 extreme rainfall events in the catchment upstream of a coastal area (Table 7). Possible
 adaptation measures include: increasing public awareness of possible floods, maintaining flood
 forecasting and warning systems, and reinstating floodplains through appropriate spatial
 planning.

 Protection measures are also being studied to cope with the issue of seawater infiltration in
 coastal aquifers. This phenomenon is the first impact of sea-level-rise and affects the
 socioeconomic system by contaminating water resources necessary for agricultural practices and
 household use.

 3.1.1 Accommodate, Retreat, and Revised Spatial Planning

 The adaptation measures in Table 7 reduce coastal vulnerability by reducing the sensitivity of the
 system (either natural or socioeconomic) to climatic events (see Figure 4). Some of the options
 improve the resilience of the system by counteracting the effect of other external stressors that
 tend to increase the sensitivity to climate change20 (Figure 5). Albania and Georgia, for instance,
 should enforce Accommodate and Retreat measures based on rolling easements and Revised
 Territorial Planning (Box 3) to tackle the unregulated (and at times illegal) coastal development

 20
   E.g. overexploitation of resources, pollution, decreasing freshwater availability, sediment starvation, unregulated
 urbanization



                                                                                                                    41
of housing and tourism infrastructure which increases the risk of damages to material assets (i.e.
it increases the sensitivity of the socioeconomic system to sea-level-rise and storm surges).

Box 3 Easements, setbacks, and zoning

Erosion easements

Erosion easements, defined as "legal agreements between a landowner and a land trust or the government agency
that restricts development in erosion-prone areas," can be designed to:

  •      prohibit any type of development or control the size and/or density of structures,
  •      prevent shoreline hardening activities and/or specify what type of shoreline stabilization can be used,
  •      and prohibit the cutting of natural vegetation along the shoreline or restrict erosive activities.

In order to effectively protect property and coasts, easements can be coordinated at the regional scale so that all the
properties over a large segment of coast have the same rules applied to them.

Rolling easements

These agreements are placed on a shoreline property to prevent the owner from holding back the sea. All other
activities are allowed; there are no restrictions on building on the property. If the sea advances, the easement "rolls
back" landwards. This is designed mainly to protect wetlands. Being aware that the property is susceptible to
erosion, the owners have an incentive to build smaller mobile structures, easy to relocate. This, along with a
prohibition on containing the sea, allows wetlands and coastal habitats to migrate naturally inland.

In the US, easements are voluntary, and land owners that choose to place an easement on their property receive a
property tax break. This makes them more appealing than other regulatory approaches. On the other hand, they are
difficult to enforce and not as effective as setback lines and zoning overlays.

State mandated setback regulations

Construction setback regulations mandate that development must be a certain distance from the water. These,
however, require good scientific data; they should be based on erosion data that is often difficult to get. Setback
lines in South Carolina are re-assessed every eight to ten years. At times, establishing new lines means that the state
will need to compensate owners for their unbuildable property.

Zoning and erosion overlays

These strategies rely on state planning to limit development in erosion or flood prone areas, to minimize damages to
property, and to eliminate the construction of defense structures. They can also contain rules for set-back lines and
prevent clearing of native vegetation. However the government must have the capacity to regulate these measures;
they require accurate data on areas at risk of erosion and flood, and may result in expropriation if development is
already present.

A reassessment of flood management will also be necessary in areas at risk of subsidence,
particularly deltas and alluvial plains (e.g. Neretva in Croatia and Danube in Romania). These
areas are especially vulnerable to SLR and storm surges because they are usually densely



                                                                                                                     42
populated, characterized by fast economic development, and at the same time they are the
meeting point of saltwater and riverine freshwater (hence more exposed to floods).

In these areas flood management should be linked with spatial planning and integrated water
resources management (Box 4). Adaptation to inundation from extreme rainfall events, sea-
level-rise, or a combination of the two needs to take into consideration the component of local
subsidence. In deltaic areas this phenomenon can far outweigh climate change as the main cause
of inundation, and it is often aggravated by the abstraction of groundwater for production
activities and household use. The problem can be tackled by creating incentives for people and
businesses to move to other areas of the coast, where their operations and water needs are
deemed less likely to affect subsidence. Ideally, spatial planning and integrated water resources
management should guide such changes, and should be applied at the watershed scale to
effectively protect material assets while at the same time regulating the quality and quantity of
water reaching the coastal zones.

 Box 4 Spatial planning in Jakarta

                                          Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, experienced several floods of the
                                          downtown area in 2007, with two major inundations in January and
                                          November. Analysis of hydrological, geological, and sea-level-rise
                                          data shows that subsidence is the principal cause. The city is
                                          sinking mainly due to water abstraction from underground. The
                                          sinking rate is much higher than any increase in sea-level-rise (from
                                          2007 to 2025 predicted increase in sea-level-rise is 4 to 6 cmand
                                          predicted subsidence is 40 to 60 cm). Subsidence is also enhancing
                                          the sensitivity to storm surges and periods of high tides. While
                                          immediate measures like dredging of canals and barriers are
                                          necessary, the long time solution consists in scaling up the
                                          intervention, moving from flood management to water resources
                                          management to urban and territory planning. In order to control the
                                          subsidence process, water abstraction must be regulated. One
                                          solution proposed to the city by external advisors and experts from
                                          the Dutch Institute for Delta Applied Research is to reduce water
                                          abstraction in the most sensitive areas of the city by modifying
                                          spatial planning and pushing businesses and residents out of these
                                          areas, thereby shifting the demand for water away from the areas at
                                          greatest risk of flooding.

Spatial planning at the watershed scale has been adopted in the Netherlands as a critical strategy
to cope with the threats of climate change and increased river flow (Box 5). The strategy, known
as “living with floods” or “room for the river”, hinges on general revision of zoning and on
setting aside areas to be flooded, in case of inundations due to extreme precipitation and river
overtopping. The advantage of such a policy is that floods are controlled by being directed to
areas designed to withstand such events. This is accomplished either by leaving these lands to
nature, or by strictly limiting the type of allowed activities and enforcing precise building codes.
While this strategy is, in the long-term, the most sound from a socioeconomic and environmental



                                                                                                                  43
point of view, it must be recognized that it requires vast investments in the short-term and the
advantages can be seen only over long periods. It follows that this strategy has economic sense
mainly for areas where exposure and sensitivity are very high, and where the population affected
and the value of natural and material assets are very large.

Box 5 Living with floods in the Netherlands

The government of the Netherlands, which has expertise in flood management, has integrated protective measures
(dykes and barriers) with the use of “resilience strategies.” These are based on the definition of risk associated with
flooding (either from rivers, sea, or a combination of the two) as determined by the likelihood of a flood multiplied
by the damage caused by it. Building higher dykes (strategy of resistance) is a very costly strategy when factoring
the costs associated with a possible failure in protection (Vis et al. 2003). The sense of security provided by higher
and stronger dykes promotes more investments in the vicinity of the defense structures. This, in combination with
the rise in sea level outside the dykes makes a possible breach and flooding event all the more catastrophic. The
strategy of resilience is based on reducing the risk of damages (living with floods) by trying to minimize the
likelihood of a flood event and by allowing only certain areas to be flooded. The advantage is that the inundation is
controlled, by being directed in zones that have been prepared for these occurrences through spatial planning and
building codes.


3.2 Adaptation for the fishery sector
In the ECA basins, in particular in the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas, rising sea temperatures in
combination with modifications in run-off due to changes in precipitation may impact the
productivity of fisheries (see Table 4). The best adaptation option is to tackle those stresses other
than climate change that increase the sensitivity of fisheries to climate change by negatively
affecting fish stocks; overfishing, spread of exotic species, organic and inorganic pollutants
leading to eutrophication are the factors that in the last decades have contributed to a drastic
reduction in productivity of the fishery sector in these three basins. Given the nature of ECA sea
basins, these results can be obtained only through a concerted international effort including the
countries that are part of the drainage basins. In this respect the GEF transboundary project for
the Danube has already obtained results in reducing the input of nutrients in the Black Sea, and
the GEF Baltic Sea regional project is proceeding toward the realization of an integrated
management of the basin.

3.3 Issues with the development of adaptation options
A strategic coastal management for climate change should be based on the following:

1. Development in coastal zones and in flood-risk zones needs to take into account climate
   change impacts, and as a result requires long-term planning in:
      a. Development objectives
      b. Transports and utilities
      c. Energy sector
      d. General land use regulations and spatial planning
2. Regional and national scale policies must be transferred down to the local level,
   empowering local authorities and giving them mandate for the implementation of long-term
   practical adaptation measures.
3. The strategies need to take into consideration the full set of options:
   Protect/Accommodate/Retreat.

Inclusion of options other than Protect will require difficult decisions and create some tension
between stakeholders. In this respect it is necessary to recognize the local stakeholders as:

1. Directly affected categories: land and home owners, fishermen, etc.
2. Local and central government decision makers for coastal management (usually they also
   deal with development control and land use planning)
3. Public and private organizations (e.g. nature conservation and others).

The first group is likely to resist major planning changes that may affect their possessions. In this
case information and education on the short-term and long-term impacts is critical, but it can be
implemented only if there is a concerted effort from national and local authorities.

The implementation of successful measures will require “public inclusion, negotiation, integrate
planning and implementation”, along with necessary legislative changes that will need to
underpin modification in spatial planning and land use, and allow for “compensation and
acquisition of property in erosion and flood risk zones” (Few et al. 2004). Such a process is
difficult and lengthy, which increases general vulnerability and makes the climate change threat
even more challenging.




                                                                                                   45
4. Adaptive capacity

4.1 Adaptive capacity in the context of coastal areas
Klein et al. (2001) define adaptation to climate change in coastal areas as a policy process
organized in a series of steps involving consultation, decisions, and technical applications21
(Figure 11):

 1.   Information – awareness (includes data gathering for vulnerability assessment)
 2.   Planning design
 3.   Implementation
 4.   Monitoring and evaluation.

This framework reminds policy makers and scientists that adaptation is part of a broader policy
process, and identifies obstacles and opportunities (i.e. costs and benefits) for adaptation.




Figure 11 Framework for planned adaptation. Source: Klein et al. 2001.

The adaptation process starts with raising awareness of policy makers and the general public
about the possible impacts of climate change, and gathering knowledge on the vulnerability of
the coastal areas. The planning and choice of adaptation measures is influenced both by policy
criteria (cost effectiveness, environmental sustainability, cultural compatibility, and social
acceptability) and by coastal development objectives (Klein et al. 2001). Once the selected
measures are implemented their monitoring and evaluation refines coastal management.


21
   This model draws on the long-standing experience of countries like the Netherlands and Japan in dealing with
climatic variability.



                                                                                                                  46
Adaptive capacity in the context of coastal areas can be defined as the capacity of the different
actors identified in Table 7 (central government, local authorities, private enterprises, and the
public-at-large) to drive and carry on the different phases of the adaptation process at a pace that
is adequate to the rate of climatic changes. It is this capacity, rather than the mere availability of
adaptation measures, that determines the vulnerability to climate change (in combination with
exposure and sensitivity).

4.1.1 Awareness and education on coastal climate change is not adequate

Awareness and knowledge about the climate threat and about possible solutions is the first step
in the adaptation process, and the basic condition for the development of an adequate adaptive
capacity. In order to plan, implement, and respond promptly to adaptation measures, awareness
must be equally rooted in experts of the socioeconomic and scientific disciplines, in government
agencies, and in the public-at-large. The main aspects of awareness are:

1. Awareness of the different components of climatic exposure in coastal areas
2. Awareness of how the exposures affect coastal areas, the modifications induced and how
   these areas respond (naturally, e.g. coastal dynamics)
3. Knowledge of how climatic stresses and non-climatic stresses interact and compound their
   effects.

According to Tol et al. (2008), in the Black Sea and Mediterranean basin, awareness is limited to
a few academics, and no knowledge has efficiently permeated the institutional levels in charge of
spatial planning and coastal management. Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Turkey, and Croatia (but
also Italy, Spain, and others) have low awareness of the implications of climatic change on
coastal areas, and currently have no plan for adaptation (Box 6). In the Baltic Sea, Estonia and
Lithuania have low climate change awareness, and there vulnerability refers mainly to coastal
ecosystems, while their socioeconomic systems have low overall sensitivity. Poland, on the
other hand, has started a national coastal plan that includes analysis of SLR (Tol et al. 2008).

In general, the level of education and interest in the effects of climate change is low. The
reasons for this are varied, but they are generally the result of current social, economic, and
political challenges faced by the countries in the aforementioned basins, and their current focus
on short-term issues.

Box 6 Adaptive capacity in Turkey

The main impediment to the development of adaptive capacity in Turkey is the very low awareness of coastal
dynamics and climatic impacts, both in the institutions and among the public. Despite the plan by the Ministry of
Environment to create a Department for Environmental Impact Assessment, no governmental body is presently
dealing with the future consequences of sea-level-rise and other climatic events on coastal areas (Karaca and
Nicholls 2008). Both a cause and a result of this condition is the lack of specific data and of appropriate
methodologies to analyze impacts. However, part of the problem is also in the coastal protection law, which defines
sea level as unchanging. A long-term coastal management plan is missing, and coastal issues are not a national
priority unless they entail investments and infrastructures for the tourism industry. A result of this situation is the
lack of consideration for increasing sea-level-rise and other environmental changes during the recent expansion of
coastal infrastructure, both ports and protection works (Karaca and Nicholls 2008).


4.2 The way forward – Finding and analyzing the factors affecting adaptive
capacity in ECA
Awareness and education are the conditio sine qua non for effective adaptation. The question
remains, however, of what is the status of the other elements/dimensions of adaptive capacity if
we assume that adequate awareness is attained.

Identifying the dimensions of adaptive capacity is a complex task. It is particularly so for coastal
areas because of their geographical and multi-sectored nature. A first analysis of adaptive
capacity can be obtained by using country-level indicators of resource endowments, but these
seldom capture all dimensions, including effective strengths and weaknesses. For instance, the
weight of institutions and social networks in determining the level of adaptive capacity may be
very different from place to place (Brooks et al. 2005). To further complicate the picture, coastal
areas are often simultaneously under control of regional, national and international authorities.

4.2.1 General questions –Indicators for adaptive capacity

Presently, some questions can be posed to identify the elements of adaptive capacity. Given that
these elements must refer to the actors mentioned previously (central government, local
authorities, private sector, public-at-large), some questions will address general dimensions
(education, governance), while others will be specific for coastal areas and their impacts. The
questions, taken from Tol et al. (2008), Yohe and Tol (2002), and Adger et al. (2007), are
outlined below:

    1. Awareness and education on the consequences of SLR and possible adaptations
           a. Is the knowledge available both to institutions and the public? I.e. are the relevant
               people informed?
           b. Are skilled and trained personnel available?
    2. Technological options entailing knowledge in engineering, natural sciences, planning,
       etc., and a good level of communication and exchange between levels of governance and
       between neighboring countries
           a. Does the society have the technical means to act?



                                                                                                                     48
   3. How is the governance quality at central, regional, and local levels?
   4. Does the central government have the ability to modify legal framework and implement
      changes at the local scale, whether it is for Integrated Coastal Zone Management or
      planning?
          a. What is the quality of knowledge dissemination and communication between
              different institutional levels? This indicates that the society has the structure and
              network to facilitate action on climate change.
   5. Resources and their distribution
          a. Are there economic means to be able to implement adaptation measures and to do
              it in a timely fashion?
   6. What is the state of human capital, including education?
   7. What is the state of social capital, including property rights (intimately linked with
      quality of governance)?
   8. How accessible are risk spreading mechanisms (i.e. insurance, etc.)?
   9. What is the state of social infrastructures and equity?

It is important to clarify a subtle but important aspect of adaptive capacity. In order for adaptive
capacity to be adequate, each element must be present to a “satisfactory” level. In other words,
no element can fully substitute for another. Better education is not a substitute for economic
means, and technological options is not a substitute for governance (Tol et al. 2008).

4.2.2 Insight into the current state of adaptive capacity in ECA

Taking as an example the water sector in ECA sub-regions, Table 9 provides insight into a range
of conditions that may currently help or hinder the development of adaptive capacity in local
authorities and central government agencies. The table focuses on those aspects of water
management that also affect adaptation strategies in coastal areas.

For what concerns issues of transboundary nature, like the impact of climate change on fisheries,
adaptive capacity is adequate in the Baltic Sea, mainly due to the history of collaboration
between countries and to the current GEF regional project addressing coastal zone management.
In the Black Sea, capacity is low. Fisheries have collapsed in the last decades probably due to
overfishing, pollution, and the spread of the exotic species Mnemiopsis leidyi. However, the lack
of a uniformly accepted method to monitor fish stocks and the ensuing poor data availability
means that there is no single accepted scientific result on the causes of the collapse, which makes
it harder to frame a strategy of adaptation. The GEF has worked at developing a convention for
the management of fisheries in the Black Sea, but the progress between parties halted when
Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU. The move subjected the two countries to the Common
fishery policy, but Brussels does not have good knowledge of the status of the fisheries in the
Black Sea, and at present the situation is stalled (Ivan Zadavsky GEF Staff, personal
communication).

In the Black Sea, the only basin currently having good transboundary management and
collaboration between countries is the Danube watershed. The International Commission for the



                                                                                                   49
Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) could therefore have the capacity to deal with the future
climate change threats. In terms of control of pollution (as an adaptation strategy), the
Commission for the Protection of the Black Sea Against Pollution (2007) is presently struggling,
and has limited capacity to monitor and intervene (Ivan Zadavsky GEF Staff, personal
communication).

In the Caspian Sea, the level of management and collaboration is represented mainly by the
Framework Convention for the Caspian marine environment. 2006 marked a Conference of
affiliated parties. Collaboration is well established, but there is concern about future successful
implementation of the 4 protocols under preparation: (1) EIA transboundary, (2) Biodiversity,
(3) land base sources of pollution, (4) Mutual aid in case of oil spills from shipping (Amy Evans
ECA Staff, personal communication).

4.3 Constraints to developing adaptive capacity
In order to optimize adaptation to climate change in coastal areas we need to work on the
spatial and temporal scales of action:

     A. Spatial Scale: a water basin approach is needed to tackle sustainably all the various
        factors affecting coasts, originated by climate change or acting in synergy with it.
        However, one needs to be concerned about the mismatch between the broad
        geographical scale (region, watershed, basin, etc.) at which the adaptation strategy
        is planned, and the local spatial scale at which decision-making for coastal
        management must be translated into action (Few et al. 2004).
     B. Temporal scale: the time horizon of local coastal planning is often very short and
        unsuitable to include considerations of climate change and adaptation strategies.

4.3.1 The spatial scale issue

Strategic coastal management planning is developed principally at the regional and
national scale. Policies then need to be transmitted down to local authorities, along with a
clear mandate empowering them to adopt a long-term planning strategy that takes climate
change into consideration. For this transition to happen, institutional capacity needs to be
built both at the national and local scales. This is one of the main challenges that has been
hampering the successful implementation of national and supra-national strategies, for
instance integrated coastal management (Few et al. 2004).

4.3.2 The temporal scale issue

At the local government level there are several constraints to strategic long-term
planning:

     1.   Resources constraints – financial and human
     2.   Limited mandate of the local planning departments
     3.   Lack of detailed data on future long-term exposure of the area
     4.   Technical ability to interpret these projections correctly.

The knowledge and information limitation (number 3 above) originates from the
uncertainty surrounding the local magnitude of climate change exposure, and the local
sensitivity of the coasts to climatic hazards. The best solution is to first identify all the
currently known sources of coastal vulnerability, and then design measures to tackle
these issues within an adaptive23 management framework. In order to do this, decision
support tools can be useful, as they guide decision-making in the face of uncertainty.



23
  Here, adaptive is meant in the traditional sense of a set of actions that are designed with two goals in
mind: to bring results based on our current knowledge of the system, and to improve the knowledge of
how the system works, thereby continuously improving and perfecting the measures of response to climate
change.

                                                                                                        52
At the same time, it is necessary to develop a system of scenario projections at the local
scale, so that, starting with particularly sensitive areas24, one knows what the likely
exposure will be and how sensitive the “natural protection” (geological features of the
coast) is. As noted before, none of this can be achieved without general awareness of the
threat of climate change on behalf of planners, decision makers, coastal managers, and
the general public (Klein et al. 2001).

4.3.3 The uncertainty issue

General uncertainty and the other limitations represent a disincentive for local authorities
to embrace long-term planning, and instead reinforce the allocation of resources toward
short-term matters.

Uncertainty also complicates the dialogue between decision-makers, private stakeholders,
property owners, and the public-at-large. This is especially true when the long-term
adaptation measures entail losses of property. In a related matter, it should be kept in
mind that in many instances the general public is averse to long-term thinking, and may
be unable to put in perspective the proposed solutions. Finally, the “political momentum”
toward development that runs contrary to the call for long-term planning and
modification of coastal management strategy should not be underestimated.




24
  Sensitive areas may be those with higher interests in terms of biodiversity conservation, urbanization,
industry, agriculture, or other activities in place (including tourism).

                                                                                                            53
5. Conclusions
Overall, the coastal areas of ECA basins are vulnerable to climate change. This is mainly
a reflection of poor awareness and knowledge of climate change. While some studies
have been conducted to determine the risk (exposure x sensitivity) of SLR for various
countries, and despite the interest over technical adaptation options, little progress has
been made in developing adaptive capacity (Tol et al. 2008).

The World Bank can have an important role in disseminating knowledge, building
adaptive capacity at the institutional level, and facilitating dialogue between stakeholders
by clarifying the trade-offs and risks associated with scenarios of sea-level-rise and
climate change. The goal of adaptation is to reduce the vulnerability of a system, but this
effort must be integrated within the broader strategy of sustainable development.
Adaptation, particularly anticipatory adaptation, must be justified through a balance of
costs (damages from climate change) and benefits resulting from the implementation of
adaptation measures. The paramount goal is to maintain welfare over time; therefore
adaptation is not a measure to be adopted at all costs. In some cases, vulnerability
assessment may reveal that the best adaptation is no-adaptation (“wait and see” option).
In other cases, major investments may be immediately needed to protect critically
valuable assets, while in others still, conditions may allow to stretch investments over
long time periods. As also stated by Tol et al. (2008), these decisions should be taken
within the broader context of multiple stresses affecting the ECA coasts.

Ideally, the whole adaptation process should be undertaken as part of Integrated Coastal
Zone Management and/or Integrated River Basin Management frameworks. An
Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) process could provide the framework to
perform vulnerability assessment, guide awareness-raising, build adaptive capacity, and
select the appropriate adaptation measures.

Several of the coastal adaptation measures recommended by experts are part of the
assortment of interventions ordinarily associated with ICZM. Generation and
enforcement of zoning schemes, interventions to control erosion, and the development of
alternative employment are part of the ICZM arsenal; additionally, they can support those
adjustments in spatial planning (protect, accommodate, retreat) that are the center of
coastal adaptation.

ICZM can also focus on fostering adaptive capacity in two ways: firstly, by empowering
local authorities and developing their resources to embark in a long-term planning effort
that includes adaptation strategies (addressing the “temporal scale and spatial scale”
issues mentioned in section 4.3), and secondly, by strengthening community organization
and promotion of awareness of climate change, both critical to the success of warning
systems, which are another important piece of a successful adaptation strategy.

Similarly to ICZM, Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM) has the characteristics
to implement adaptation measures to control climate change events affecting coastal
areas by targeting issues along watershed. An IRBM project can tackle river planning,


                                                                                          54
water resources management, and flood control measures to control the quantity, seasonal
pulses, and quality of water reaching the coasts, while taking into consideration the
different uses and stakeholders’ needs (agriculture, industry, urban needs).

In ECA, an IRBM to control emission from the Danube has resulted in the reduction of
nutrient inputs into the Black Sea. On the other hand, examples of successful ICZM
projects are more difficult to find (SDN week 2008; World Bank 2003). Because of the
low availability of successful experiences in this area, and considering the uncertainty
associated with climatic predictions, a two pronged intervention could be proposed:

   1. A process should be initiated to strengthen ICZM plans or kick-start such projects
      where they are missing.
   2. Local-scale projects should be implemented to address adaptation needs at a
      smaller scale; this is based on the idea that small positive outcomes may build
      consensus among institutions and the public for the need of a wider approach
      managed through an ICZM.

In both cases, what is urgently needed is an improvement in vulnerability assessment
capabilities. Sensitivity of the coastal environment should be investigated by way of sea-
level-rise projections, matched with coastal topographical details, in particular shore
types (sand, rocky, etc.) and elevation. In addition, to appraise sensitivity of
socioeconomic systems, more precise data should be collected on the socioeconomic
relevance of coastal areas. A measure of the overall vulnerability of coasts could then be
obtained by overlaying environmental and socioeconomic data with the help of GIS:
   • Sea-level-rise projections and coastal topographical and geologic features to
       provide information on flooding areas based on IPCC climate change scenarios
   • Infrastructures (housing, tourism, energy, and transport)
   • Land use (agriculture, forestry, etc.)
   • Population density
   • Location of sources of pollution and other stressors.
