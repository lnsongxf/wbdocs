     Executive summary

This study was organized with the support of the Ministry of Economy and the World Bank. The Cost
of Doing Business study is carried out annually since 2002.
Survey timeframe
The data collection period is from September to November 2016. The survey study covered the
registration, construction, foreign trade, purchasing of equipment - in the last three years, the judiciary
environment - in the last two years and for the remaining areas - the last year or the time of
questioning.
Method
The interviews were carried out by trained personnel, guided by a structured questionnaire approved
by CEP experts. Managers were asked questions in face-to-face interviews set up at their business
offices.
Businesses have been randomly selected from the total number of companies in Moldova, currently
functioning.
The data was analysed using the SPSS software. To ensure the representativeness of the obtained
results, the high dispersion series outliers were removed. In some cases the median was used to
distinguish the central tendency.
Indicators were calculated by overall country, region, type and size of business. The report contains
only relations bearing some sort of relevance. Average indicators with values displaying very large
dispersions due to the low number of respondents were not included in the report.
Sample
The sample covers 630 companies, excluding agricultural enterprises, individual enterprises and
banking institutions. The sample does not contain enterprises located on the left bank of Nistru river.
Representativeness has been verified by four criteria: legal form, number of employees, field of
activity and geographic location.
More than 70% of the surveyed businesses were located in Chisinau. Most entities (91%) are limited
liability companies. Companies employing more than 10 people accounted for 80% of the total.
General time indicator
The general time indicator is an overall estimate of state's involvement in the activity of businesses, as
perceived by business managers at the time of questioning. In 2016 the indicator fell from 10,4% to
7,9%, the lowest level registered throughout 2002-2016.
Registration
The amount of time required to register a company has reached the minimum of the last five years -
7,2 days or 5 days quicker compared to 2015. The amount of time required to amend registrations in
the incorporation documents has also decreased. The duration also includes the post-registration
operations. Registration with the State Registration Chamber takes on average 4 days.
The filing fees to amend the registration documents have increased in the last year.

Constructions
28% of all respondents have moved to new premises during the last three years. Around 10% of them
or nearly 3% of the total have built the premises. Four out of five companies consulted planning
offices for coordination, obtaining permissions and support in releasing the premises into use. Thus,
only 0,6% of the surveyed companies were faced with the need to obtain authorizations on their own.
One in seven respondents have released the self built premises without approved project
documentation. Half of them stated that they had acted in this way because they believed the penalties
are lower than the cost to obtain the authorizations. One third have not applied for the approval of
project documentation and obtaining the construction authorizations because they lacked the necessary
time to carry out all procedures.
Licensing
In 2016 the share of companies that had a license at the time of questioning has decreased from 47 to
43%. The average number of licenses per company has also depicted a downward trend - from 1,4 to
1,1 licenses per company.
The time and costs to obtain a license remained essentially unchanged. The share of respondents who
paid informal payments continues to increase - 18%.
Authorizations
Almost two thirds of Moldovan enterprises fall under the Law on domestic trade. Most of them
complied with the new changes in legislation and submitted notifications to local public authorities.
The preparation and sumbission of the notification took 5,7 days. Managers spent around 3 hours for
this purpose.
Certification of equipment
Just over 1% of respondents had to obtain certificates to start using the equipment. The regulation on
purchase and placing into service of equipment is rarely practiced and therefore its effect has not been
quantified in this study.
Import
Certification of imported goods saw a notable decline: from 9,7 to 6,2 days for one certification
procedure. The certficate cost 202 USD to obtain.
One custom procedure took on average 2,7 days to complete (the same as in 2012). Related costs
increased to 287 USD.
Export
Procedures required for an export transaction took an average 1,9 days - a slight decrease compared to
last year. Procedures cost 172 USD.
Certification of goods and services
One company in six certify their goods.
Almost 73% of them, or 11% of total certify batches of goods. The certification took on average 7,6
days, a slight decrease compared to 2012. Costs have also slightly decreased to 46 USD.

          Costul reglementării de stat a activității întreprinderilor

Just over 4% of the surveyed companies have certified batch manufactured goods. The certificate was
obtained in 10,3 days and cost 84 USD.
Sanitary operating permits
One third of respondents had to obtain sanitary certificates. Their share is expected to decrease
considerably following the amendments to Law 153 of 01 July 2016. The sanitary certificate is
obtained in 7,3 days, 1,7 days fewer compared to 2015. The total cost is 71 USD.
Sanitary certification of goods
One respondent in ten had to obtain sanitary certificates. A sanitary certificate is obtained in 6 days
and costs around 59 USD.
Inspections
As a result of the moratorium imposed by the State on inspections, the share of companies verified in
2016 has decreased significantly. The frequency of inspections has also decreased almost twice. The
total amount of time spent by inpectors with a company has decreased from 7,6 to 5 hours.
The share of companies that were fined has also decreased more than twice. On the other hand, the
share of companies that paid bribes during the inspections carried out by certain institutions has
increased compared to last year.
Only 6% believe that businesses are almost always treated equally before the law, compared to 74%
who claim the opposite.
Taxes
Due to the transition to electronic filing, accountants spend nearly two times less time to prepare and
submit the reports to state bodies. One in four companies face difficulties in calculating and reporting
the income tax. Records of other types of taxes is simpler.
Price regulation
The share of companies subjected to price regulation has declined continuously since 2010. Only 10%
of managers said that the state interferes with their company’s product pricing. The sales volume at
regulated prices was 3,5%.
Regulation of labour relations
About 5% of respondents said they had staff surplus. Overall, regulation of labour relations does not
pose major problems. However, one in five companies mentioned having difficulties in laying off
surplus employees.
Contract monitoring
In about 5% of cases the state intervened in the process of contract signing. With small deviations, this
share was seen at the same level over the past twelve years.
Judiciary system
Around 21% of respondents had to settle some disputes over the past two years. Most of them were
lawsuits against other companies.

Companies usually take to the courts to settle conflicts, as noted by 64% respondents. In 27% cases,
companies have resorted to various unofficial, however legal methods. Only 8% respondents used
illegal methods to solve conflicts (14%) in 2015).
Almost half of the companies who filed a lawsuit were satisfied with the decision.
Phytosanitary certification
The phytosanitary certification has a much smaller involvement compared to sanitary or compliance
certificates. Only 6% of respondents had to obtain phytosanitary certificates. The process took 2 days,
entailing a cost of 37 USD. Both indicators remained at the previous year level. It is worth mentioning
that farm households were excluded from the sample, which could have increased the share of
companies affected by the respective regulatory field.

     Purpose of the study

The main purpose of this study is to monitor the business environment and assess the impact state
policies and the regulatory requirements have on businesses operating in Moldova. The project was
carried out based on the following goals:
        Provide the State of the Republic of Moldova and the national and international institutions
         with quantitative data on the cost incurred by businesses to comply with state regulations.
        Provide support to the State of Moldova on quality policy analysis with a view to implement
         the necessary decisions to improve business and investment climates in Moldova.
        Assist the civil society institutions that make recommendations and need to monitor their
         impact.
        Establish a tool to monitor the changes in the business environment and the impact of the
         measures taken to reduce barriers and corruption in business.

Outlines
The main purpose of the study is to monitor the business environment and assess the impact of state
policies and of the regulatory requirements on businesses oprerating in the Republic of Moldova.
This goal is achieved by measuring and comparing over time the perception of entrepreneurs and
company managers on the costs they incur in order to comply with the imposed requirements through
various state regulations.
The method is based on the assumption that the decision to start and develop a business is based more
on managers' perception on costs rather than on actual expenditure incurred by them. If managers feel
less pressure in a certain regulatory domain, it is deemed as a positive fact, even if no improvements
have been made in the respective domain in recent years. Similarly, cases where state bodies have
undertaken improvements in a certain area, but the changes were not made known to companies or
were insufficiently "visible" to be referred to by managers, were deemed as a neutral fact.
Areas analyzed
In order to ensure the data comparability over time, both the the list of areas of regulation and the list
of questions in the questionnaire have not been substantially changed from the previous year. The
"Sanitary certification of goods" chapter was added, distinct from "Sanitary authorizations." Given the
recent amendments in the legislation, the chapter on "Operating permits" has been modified and a few
irrelevant questions have been eliminated.
Regulatory costs are analyzed on the following components, where applicable:

        taxes/fees established by state institutions;
        various legal payments to people outside the company or institutions, intended to facilitate the
         process of compliance with state regulations (lawyers, experts in various fields, acquaintances
         who have passed these procedures, etc.);
        payments for notary services required to comply with state regulations;
        transportation costs for travelling to the regulatory body or to collect the necessary documents
         (round trip);
        various "voluntary" contributions made under the pressure by state bodies to facilitate the
         process of obtaining documents;
        bribery and other unofficial payments to representatives of state bodies to facilitate regulatory
         procedures;
        amount of time spent by company employees to obtain the necessary documents;
        amount of time spent to obtain documents, from the time the procedure was initiated until the
         required document was obtained.

The overall perception is analyzed for each area of regulation in relation to changes in the easiness of
procedures compared to the previous year (more difficult/bad, the same, simpler/good). It also
analyzes, if necessary, on a scale of one to five, the impact of various impediments in the regulatory
area in question.

Selection of companies

To select businesses for interviewing a database was created comprising all companies functioning at
the time of questioning, excluding farming households, financial institutions and individual
enterprises. The database does not contain legal persons that do not carry out economic activities:
nongovernmental organizations, community associations, educational institutions, housing associations
and others. The selection of companies to be excluded was carried out based on CMEA codes. The
regulatory framework of these companies is specific and does not comply with the purpose of this
study.

Using the SPSS programme, a sample of 600 companies was randomly generated from the database
for the survey. Each company had equal chances to be selected. The sample was tested in terms of
representativeness, using four criteria: region (rayon), field of activity, legal & organizational form and
number of employees.

The sample structure was compared with the general population structure, from which it was extracted.
Cases where significant differences (of more than 1%) were seen between the share of general
collectivity and the sample, the "surplus" companies were removed from the general population. As a
result, another 20 companies were randomly selected from the "deficient" group of companies, using
the SPSS software. After verifying the structure of the sample with that of the collectivity, another 10
companies were selected using the above method.

In several instances, no representatives of the company could be found at the legal address. Using the
information found on the internet or the landline telephone numbers, interviewers travelled to the
premises where the activity itself was carried out. Businesses that could not be found at both addresses
were excluded from the sample. In some cases at the company premises could not be found any person
entitled to provide information or the representative refused to talk to the interviewers.

Companies that were removed from the sample were replaced by others, that were part of the same
group, according to the four criteria above.

Approximately 26% companies refused to be interviewed, other 41% were not found at the address.
Sample
The sample includes 630 businesses across the country except those located on the left bank of the
Nistru river. In order to make comparisons by regions, rayons were grouped into four regions: north,
centre, south and Chisinau.

Interviewing

The persons approved to conduct interviews were accepted only after completing special training.
Where possible, respondents were informed in advance about the interviewer's visit.

The interview was conducted with the first person in the company or his delegated representative. The
respondent was informed about the purpose of the survey. Respondents were interviewed in face-to-
face interviews, based on questionnaires structured by regulatory areas. In order to facilitate the
interviewing process and to avoid ambiguities in the interpretation of the text, the questions were set
up in the form that would be read to the respondent. In order to ease the process of interviewing, the
questionnaire contained references to different questions depending on the answer.

In order to prevent a distorted assessment of the manager perception, it was recommended, if possible,
that they avoid consulting the accounting records. Interviewers were instructed to avoid suggesting

answers or objecting to the answers provided by managers.
Checking the quality of data collection
In order to ensure the quality of data collection, about 10% of interviewed companies were randomly
contacted. Following a short discussion on the phone, it was be verified that:
    1. the interviewer has certainly discussed with the company official
    2. answers to several questions match those noted in the questionnaire.
Data processing

The statistical data obtained in the survey were analysed using the SPSS statistical program.

Before starting the calculation of indicators, the outliers in the database most likely to distort the
average values were removed. The threshold is decided upon by the expert that performs the analysis.
As a rule, the elimination of one data should not affect the average value of the series. In practice, the
response depends on the number of answers and the size of dispersion. If the resulted dispersion is too
high, the indicator average is not representative and it is removed from the analysis results.

The average values are calculated both within the sample and divided into groups, depending on the:
region, company size, type of activity and legal form. The report shall contain only results bearing
some kind of correlation. Often times, the dispersion drawn by the amount of payments is too high to
allow the calculation and the analysis of the average amount. However, it might prove useful to include
in the survey the data on the share of companies who made such payments. E.g. it is important to see
how the share of companies that made unofficial payments has changed. For areas where the number
of respondents is insignificant, only synthetic indices were calculated per country     .

The average data is calculated only for respondents who answered the corresponding question. For
example, the average transportation expenses are calculated only for respondents who mentioned
having incurred such expenses. The average total expenses represent the average component expenses,
weighted by the number of respondents who have undergone such expenditure.
The value of indicators included in the report are calculated in US dollars at a rate set by the National
Bank of Moldova during that period or, where applicable, at the time of questioning.
The following exchange rates set by the National Bank were used in the study:
2014                             - 14,04
2015                             - 18,82
January - October 2016           - 19,89

1.1 Regulatory environment – general considerations
On 01 January 2008 entered into effect Law no. 235 of 20 July 2006 on "Fundamental principles
governing entrepreneurial activity" (Guillotine II).
This law set out important principles aimed at reducing the burden of entrepreneurship administration:
    1. The tacit approval to start and run a business - where the public administration authority and/or
       other authorized regulatory and control institutions do not notify the applicant on the issue or
       renewal of the authorization/license within the deadline set by law.
    2. Control of entrepreneurial activities, except for financial and tax, has advisory status and can
       only occur in cases established by law.
    3. Costs of services and documentation issued by state authorities and other regulatory and
       supervisory institutions are set out by laws.
    4. Technical and sanitary terms, standards and similar documents are compulsory if set out by
       laws.
    5. Handling doubts of law enforcements in favour of the entrepreneur.
In order to amend and supplement the regulatory framework in compliance with Law no. 235, the
Parliament developed and approved Law no. 280-XVI of 14 December 2007 and Law no. 281-XVI of
14 December 2007.
Law no. 160 of 22 June 2011 on "Regulation through authorization of entrepreneurial activity" and
Law no. 162 of 22 July 2011 on “Amendment and supplement of certain legislative acts” establish the
Nomenclature of permissive documents, as well as sanctions against persons in key positions who
delay the release of permissions or request additional documentation that is not set out in the
Nomenclature (Guillotine II+).

1.4 General assessment of various business aspects
The biggest problems faced by companies in managing and operating their business were related to
taxes, business competition protection and obtaining authorizations.
The graph below shows how the regulatory areas have changed over the last four years in terms of
their impact on business environment.
Certification of goods and registration of companies are seemingly the least challenging procedures.

2 Registration procedure
2.1 Regulatory framework
The State Registration Chamber has the authority to register new businesses and amend the
incorporation documents. These procedures are regulated by Law no. 220-XVI of 19 October 2007
"On state registration of legal entities and individual entrepreneurs" (effective from 30 May 2008).
In order to officially register a business, the following documents are required:
         a) application for registration, compliant with the sample approved by the state registration
         body;
         b) decision on incorporation and incorporation documents of the legal person, according to its
         legal form, in two copies;
         c) a document confirming the payment of the registration fee.
To register their business with the state, foreign-funded legal entities are required to submit additional
documents:
         a) excerpt from the national register of investor's resident country;
         b) incorporation documents of the foreign legal entity.
According to Law 21 of 04 March 2016, procedures related to state registration are carried out using
the single window for state registration mechanism. The single window is a "mechanism whereby the
state registration body delivers to businesses and individual citizens, through a single point of delivery,
advice on legal formalities regarding the incorporation and registration of a legal person and of an
individual entrepreneur; verifies the name of the legal entity, produces the incorporation documents,
the state registration, publishes the information in the electronic newsletter; requests the necessary
information on registration from public authorities without involving the registrant; distributes the
elements contained in the Register of legal entities and individual entrepreneurs to relevant authorities
responsible for tax, statistical, medical and social records."
The state registration is carried out within one working day or, if it is a matter of priority, within four
hours and costs four times more expensive than the regular fee.
Registration of legal entities and amendments to the incorporation documents cost 1149 MDL. Other
services related to the state registration are rendered for the amount set by Law no. 220-XVI from 19
October 2007.
The State Registration Chamber is responsible for the tax, statistical, medical and social registration
(record) of the legal person by submitting electronically the data to relevant authorities. The Chamber
also notifies the legal person about the registration.
The Law no. 235 of 26 October 2012 has:

         introduced the concept of passive legal entity - a legal person that has operated following the
          registration, but did not submit tax reports in the last 12 months, as established by law;

         eliminated the need to submit the criminal record of the founders - foreign natural persons;

         eliminated the need to submit the authorization to relevant authorities where the legal person
          was set up by reorganization of a state enterprise, companies whose registered capital has a
          quota of government property, business unions, associations, holdings, transnational
          corporations, industrial-financial groups, financial institutions, educational institutions,
          museums, theaters, circuses, concert organizations, science and innovation organizations,
          health and balneo-sanatorial institutions.

with the State Registration Chamber, specifically the moment the SRC representative decided that the
documents comply with the laws. These figures do not cover the cases where companies have turned
to an intermediary.

institutions took less time – up to 1,7 hours.

2.3 Costs of registration procedures
Primary registration of a company with the State Registration Chamber cost owners around 83$. An
insignificant number of respondents mentioned payments to other institutions. The total cost was 99$.
The cost to amend the registration documents is aproximately the same. In the last three years,
managers have paid to the State Registration Chamber around 79$, plus another 15$ to register with
other institutions.
About a third of respondents mentioned they had made unofficial payments to ease the registration
process.

2.4 Perception of procedures
Respondents who registered or amended the incorporation documents during the last three years were
asked to assess the problems they encountered by scoring from 1 to 5, where 1 - no issues and 5 -
major issues. The table below illustrates the assessment of business registration issues.

The data represent the opinion of respondents that have registered or made changes to the
incorporation documents over three years: the survey period and two previous years.
One in six respondents voiced discontent with the need to make informal payments to the State
Registration Chamber. (see Table 5 and Figure 5). The share of respondents dissatisfied with the
excessive costs of registration procedures has increased. Althought costs have increased, the
registration procedures have not been simplified.

2.5 Summary of analysis
The required amount of time to register a company is 7,2 days. The indicator comprises registration
with the SRC, as well as other government bodies (see Table 6). Compared with previous periods, the
indicator has improved significantly.
Amendments to the incorporation documents take around 6,0 days to complete with the State
Registration Chamber. This time indicator has returned to its level of 2012-2013.
About half of respondents have resorted to using intermediaries to carry out registration procedures.

3 Constructions

3.1 Regulatory framework
The operations carried out by legal and natural persons in constructions are regulated by Law no. 721-
XII of 2 February 1996 on Quality in Constructions. The law refers to new constructions and
upgrading works, modifications, transformations, repairs and strengthening.
According to the amendments introduced by Law no.153 of 30 July 2015, a construction may
commence only after the project has been verified by project verifiers certified with relevant
authorized institutions.
According to Law no. 721-XIII 02 February 1996 there were approved two Government Decisions on
25 June 1996: no. 360 on State Supervision of Quality in Constructions and Government Decision no.
361 on Construction Quality Assurance.
Decision no. 360 approves three regulations aimed at quality control in constructions:
      The regulation establishes ways to exercise government control on quality in constructions;
      Regulation of Construction Inspection Agency;
      Regulation on the supervision of the use of public investments in constructions.
Decision no. 361 approves the Regulation on verification of projects and carrying out of constructions.
It also approves the technical expertise of the projects and constructions. The Regulation stipulates the
procedures for verification and technical expertise of the project as well as verification techniques of
the construction process.
The final approval is governed by Regulation on clearance of constructions and related facilities,
approved 23 May 1996 by Government Decision no. 285. The Regulation stipulates that the investor
must submit to the acceptance commission the opinion of fire safety and sanitation services,
Department of Environmental Protection and other control bodies accompanied by an opinion on the
actual completion of the work.
The main responsibilities in placing the construction into service following the final approval are
stipulated in the Regulation on monitoring the construction's performance, interventions over time and
post-use of construction, approved 24 April 1997 by Government Decision no. 382.
Law no. 835/1996 "On urban and spatial planning principles" of 17 May 1996 exhaustively establishes
the procedure on the issue of planning certificate and construction authorization:
        Planning certificates and construction authorizations are issued by local administration
         authorities. The application is accompanied by documents provided by the regulations
         governing the procedure for issuance of planning certificate and of the construction
         authorization. The request of other documents is prohibited.
        The local administration authority decides on the issue of the planning certificate and of the
         construction authorization or their refusal within 15 days from the filing date. The applicant is
         notified about the decision on the issue of the planning certificate and of the constructions
         authorization not later than the day following the decision date.
        If the public administration authority remains silent for the time prescribed by law, the
         planning certificate and the construction authorization will be deemed granted. If the applicant
         does not receive a written notification on the reasons for the registration denial and/or for the

          Costul reglementării de stat a activității întreprinderilor

         rejection of the application for authorization/planning certificate, the construction may
         commence.
The deadlines for issuing planning certificates and building or dissolution authorizations, as well as
payments incurred for these are set forth in Law no. 163 of 09 july 2010 regarding the authorization of
construction works. The costs for the issue of a planning certificate/informative planning certificate are
established annually by the decision of the local council. The cost cannot exceed 50 lei. Costs for a
building/demolition authorization cannot exceed 100 lei and is also established annually by the local
council decision. Extending the validity period of the planning certificate/construction/demolition
authorization requires no additional payment.
The main provisions contained in the regulation on constructions are:
        The use of land plots and planning can be performed only after planning certificate has been
         obtained.
        Construction works are performed only according to a plan developed either by an authorized
         natural or legal person.
        Constructions can commence only following the issue of the building authorization.
        The quality of constructions of any use, regardless of their type of ownership and source of
         funding, as well as construction works, reconstructions, upgrading and major repairs,
         manufacture of construction materials and items are subject to government control.
        The Government Construction Inspection carries out the quality of construction verifications in
         all stages of the construction (planning, design, authorization, construction progress,
         performance, post-use, decisive phases and manufacture of building materials and items).

3.2 Costs and time required to obtain construction authorizations
According to the survey, 28% of the interviewed companies have moved into new premises in the past
three years. About 10% of them had built these spaces, 18% have repaired or adjusted them, while
72% used them without making any changes. These indicators have remained generally unchanged
compared to the previous survey period.
Four out of five respondents turned to design companies to
obtain coordination and permissions to commence the works.
The number of businesses that build on their own has decreased            Companies located in Chisinau have
                                                                          moved more often to new or recently
considerably in recent years. Given the small size of the sub-            repaired spaces (30%), compared to
sample, an analysis is impossible to make:                                those located in the rest of the country

In order to obtain relevant data on the cost and amount of time
required to obtain construction authorizations, we recommend that a survey be conducted among a
minimum of 100 units, covering only companies that have built new spaces.
Obtaining permits for readjustment of premises took on average 16,8 days. Managers spent about 8,9
hours on this process.

The relatively small number of respondents that carrried out construction works and the various types
of expertise that depend on the complexity of construction have led to a high dispersion of results.
After the repairs have been completed, the surveyed companies had spent 11 hours to obtain all
authorizations required to place into service the renovated spaces. The total amount of time spent on
procedures was 19 days.

3.3 Perception of procedures
Most respondents stated that they did not notice any changes, for good or for worse, in the construction
sector. Only 3% said that the procedures were simplified (Figure 10).

Around 14% of respondents released into service premises without obtaining the necessary
authorizations to begin construction. Half of them claimed that they did not get an authorization to
start the construction since penalties are lower than compliance costs.

Respondents who started using premises in the last three years were asked to assess the issues related
to obtaining construction permits by scoring from 1 to 5, where 1 - no issues and 5 - major issues.
As shown in Table 9, there are no specific issues relating to obtaining authorizations. The share of
those who have experienced difficulties is much higher than in other regulatory areas. The reluctance
to mention the challenges they face suggests that entrepreneurs are generally dissatisfied with the
regulatory framework in constructions.

3.4 Summary of analysis
Given the low percentage of respondents who built new premises or have renovated existing ones, we
can not confirm any increasing or decreasing trend in the amount of time or costs required to obtain
authorizations. (see Table 10).

4 Licensing

4.1 Regulatory framework
The licensing system in Moldova is regulated by framework Law no. 451-XV of 30 July 2001 on
Regulation through Licensing of Entrepreneurship, substantially amended by Law no. 281 of 14
December 2007.
According to Law no. 451/2001, obtaining a license is compulsory in carrying out 48 types of business
activities. These licenses are issued by the following licensing bodies:
        Licensing Chamber (30 activities);
        National Bank of Moldova (4 activities);
        National Commission of Financial Market (5 activities);
        National Energy Regulatory Agency (6 activities);
        National Regulatory Agency for Electronic Communications and Information Technology (2
         activities);
        Broadcasting Coordination Council (1 activity).

Law no. 281/2007 of 20 June 2008 introduced the notions of:
        tacit approval – a license is deemed granted or renewed if the licensing authority does not
         notify the applicant within the set time limits;
        single window– procedure whereby the licensing authority verifies the authenticity of the
         information presented by the applicant/licensee without involving him/her in the process.

Documents required to obtain a license
To obtain a license, the company files a default application with the concerned authority, containing:
     a) general information on business;
     b) type of activity;
     c) the applicant signs an affidavit to conduct the type of activity for which the license was
requested and for the authenticity of the submitted documents.

In addition to the application for license, the following documentation is being attached:
      a) a copy of the certificate of state registration of the enterprise or organization;
      b) additional documents as provided by legislative acts regulating the licensed type of activity
for which the license is requested.
The request of documents other than those contained in this article is prohibited.
The data in the documents and the information submitted is checked through the single window
procedure.
The application for the license issue/renewal and the documents attached are recorded into the register.
A copy of the register is sent (handed) to the license applicant, indicating the application date,
authenticated by signature of the licensing authority.

          Licensing
    33
          Costul reglementării de stat a activității întreprinderilor

Issue of license or rejection of the application for obtaining a license
The licensing authority decides on the issue/renewal or rejection of the application based on the
application and the documents attached, within a maximum of 5 working days from the registration
date.
If the application for obtaining a license is rejected, the applicant may file a second application after
removing the causes that led to rejection.
The license shall be deemed granted if the licensing authority does not notify the applicant within the
terms provided by law. If the deadline set to notify the applicant on the refusal or rejection of the
licensing application or on its approval expires, the applicant may start to operate the business s/he
requested the license for, provided there was no written notice on the refusal/rejection grounds.
Tacit approval procedure applies to all licenses except for those issued by regulatory authorities in the
financial sector (banking and non-banking), in businesses trading firearms, ammunition and
explosives.

License fees
The standard license fee is 3 250 MDL.

License validity period
Most often, licenses are issued for a period of 5 years. In other cases, licenses are issued for one, three
or eight years. The validity of licenses for activities that do not fall under the jurisdiction of the
Licensing Chamber is established by laws governing the respective license activity.
Law no. 26 of 13 March 2014 has introduced the e-licensing procedure. This allows the applicant, via
a web interface, to send online applications of issue/renewal or requests to reissue a license. The notice
of approval or rejection of the application is also received electronically.

4.2 Number of licenses
Nearly half (43%) of the surveyed companies had a license at the time of questioning. In 8% of these
cases the companies had two or more licenses. The average
number of licenses per company is 1,1.
Both the share of companies that have a license and the
number of licenses per company have decreased in the last

4.5 Summary of analysis
Neither the amount of time nor the cost to obtain a license have changed over the past year (Table 13).
The licensing activity has diminshed its scope compared to last year: fewer businesses are required to
have a license to operate. Additionally, the number of licenses per company has decreased.
In the last two years, the tendency to make unofficial payments has become a concern.

5 Obtaining authorizations

5.1 Overall regulatory framework
The notion of authorization includes: authorizations, permits, certificates, clearances, approvals,
coordinations, patents, certificates of qualification issued by public administration authorities or
relevant regulatory and control institutions.
This chapter reviews the trade authorizations issued under Law no. 231 of 23 September 2010 on
Domestic Trade. Law no. 153 of 01 July 2016 has been amended to establish that trade authorizations
are no longer required. Companies carrying out trade activities now have to send a notification on the
initiation of a trade activity. The notification to initiate a trade activity is submitted separately for each
business unit and/or place of sale through an appointment with the local public administration
authority or the online informational resource on trade.
However, given that the respective amendments took effect later during our period of analysis, the
report includes both the data on obtaining an authorization
and the data on notifying the relevant authorities.

trade activity.                                                                 Industry (77%) and Trade (70%).

To obtain an authorization, managers spent on average 7,2 hours. The whole process to obtain the
authorization took 12,9 days.
It took considerably less time to prepare and submit a notification - 5,7 days. Managers spent only 3,1
hours for this purpose.

5.3 Perception of the notification process
Businesses that had to submit a notification with local authorities on their trade activity were asked to
assess the process compared to the previous year, when they needed to obtain authorizations. The
answers are presented in Figure 16.

More than half of respondents did not feel any improvements set out in the Law no 153 of 01 July
2016. About one third said that the notification process is simpler than obtaining authorizations. It
should be mentioned that the process is new and was unknown during the study period (October-
November 2016), both for companies and for public employees.
Respondents who obtained authorizations were asked to assess the difficulties posed by these
procedures by scoring from 1 to 5, where 1 - no difficulties and 5 - major difficulties. The evaluation
results are shown in Figure 17.
It is important to note that none of the respondents mentioned having encountered major problems to
any question. Still, around 19% believe that the procedure is rather difficult. One in ten respondents
believe they spent too much time preparing and submitting the notification. Nearly 13% complained
about having to make unofficial payments upon the submission of the notification.

5.4 Summary of analysis
Over the past years, the procedures regulating the trade activities have improved. Improvements have
particularly been observed during the last year, once the authorizations have been eliminated.
The amount of time required to submit a notification on trade activities has halved and it takes less
time to obtain. It is important to note that the notification does not need to be renewed along with the

About 40% of all respondents have purchased equipment over the last three years. One third of them

7.1 Regulatory framework
General provisions on customs procedures are included in the Customs Code of the Republic of
Moldova, approved by Law no. 1149-XIV of 20 July 2000, reissued on 1 January 2007.
All import and export procedures can be operated only after their duly registration with the Customs
Service in the Republic of Moldova.
The Customs Code establishes the rights and obligations of the customs broker, as well as the
situations where the license of a customs broker may be withdrawn.
The customs broker is not responsible for:
  a) failure to comply with customs destination terms appointed by the person passing goods and/or
vehicles;
  b) violation of rules on labeling goods with excise stamps;
  c) performing foreign exchange operations related to the transit of goods and/or means of transport
across the customs border of the Republic of Moldova;
  d) other actions s/he is not culpable of.
Repatriation of funds is also covered by import-export operations regulated area. Even if not directly
related to customs procedures, it is a requirement imposed by Law, which affects the import-export
activity.
The Law no. 1466-XIII of 29 January 1998 on "Regulation of repatriation of money funds, goods and
services originating from foreign economic transactions" refers to the notion of "repatriation of money
funds". Repatriation of money funds is the collection of money from non-resident businesses, within a
set time limit, of the money funds related to exports of goods, provision of services/works to non-
residents. The term also comprises other foreign operations and transactions in accounts opened with
authorized banks in the Republic of Moldova. The amount of funds must be shown in the customs
declaration, while the costs of services and works - in the confirming documents (contracts, deeds of
works performed or services rendered, invoice).
Businesses that sell predominantly to foreign companies face another procedure – the recovery of
VAT.
The refund of value added tax is regulated by Government Decision no. 93 of 01 February 2013. The
company has the right to choose the method of repayment: extinction of tax liability by offsetting
and/or money refund.
The tax authority is obliged to adopt the decision on the procedure for the refund, relying on the risk
criteria stipulated in the Decision. The decision must be taken within 3 working days from the date of
the application for refund was filed.
The tax authority initiates the thematic inspection following the filing of application on behalf of the
taxable subject. Applicants who meet the following four conditions are exempt from verification:

    1) subject of taxation has been active for at least two years;

    41
          Costul reglementării de stat a activității întreprinderilor

    2) subject of taxation was granted refunding of VAT previously at least twice and the last VAT
       refund took place more than one year earlier;

    3) the last thematic verification on the VAT refunding revealed that the amount of refunded VAT,
       confirmed by the tax authority, corresponds to the amount declared by the payer;

    4) during the last tax verification the amounts of taxes, duties, compulsory social insurance
       contributions and health insurance premiums did not exceed 1% of the total deliveries made
       during the verified fiscal periods.

The VAT is refunded within 45 days out of which 37 days are spent on verifications and decision
making and 8 days - on the actual refund.

7.2 Import transactions
About 17% of respondents carried out import operations over
the past three years. On average, an importer performs 9,9         The highest shares of companies that

respondents are bothered by the current level of corruption in customs. Around 36% complained about
the impartial attitude of the customs authorities towards the economic entities. Nearly a third of

duties is inappropriate.

7.3 Export transactions
Only 2,5% of respondents carried out export operations in the past three years. The number has
steadily declined in recent years due to the decrease in exports to CIS countries.
Customs compliance on export take 1,9 days, less time compared to the previous period.
Companies were charged 172 USD for the whole customs process. The high dispersion caused by the
low number of respondents makes it risky to detect a trend against the data obtained in the previous
years.
All exporters stated that the situation in export has not changed compared to last year.

7.4 Summary of analysis
The export customs compliance process has slightly decreased over the past year, unlike the importing
clearing process, which increased from 1,5 to 2,7 days. (see Table 16).
The customs compliance costs on import-export have increased in 2016. However, we can not speak of
a decreasing or increasing tendency given the:

       which led to an insufficient number of observations to

8 Certification of goods

8.1 Regulatory framework
The certification of goods is governed by the following laws:
        Law no. 20 of 04 March 2016 on Standardization;
        Law no. 420-XVI of 22 December 2006 on Technical regulation activity, substantially
         amended by Law no. 186 of 22 July 2016;
        Law No. 235 of 1 December 2011 on Accreditation and Compliance assessment activities;
        Law No. 78-XV of 18 March 2004 on Food goods.

The Standards Institute in Moldova is the national institution responsible for standardization in the
Republic of Moldova. The Institute creates technical standardization committees. These committees
develop moldovan standards which are approved by Standards Institute in Moldova. Moldovan
standards are approved or adopted by decision of the Standards Institute in Moldova.
The decision to use national standards is voluntary. Only then do they become mandatory (through a
legislative act which makes direct reference to this standard), when they involve public concerns such
as protection of life and health, security of people and environment protection, consumer protection.
The use of standards is also mandatory for parties that report compliance with the indicated standard
through a contract, trademark, declaration, certificate or any other form.
Law no. 235 of 01 December 2011 sets out the regulated areas. In the regulated areas covered by the
EU harmonization legislation, the national technical regulations transpose this legislation.

8.2 Certification costs

documents take around 5 hours.
The certification of mass manufactured goods take longer - 10 days. Paperwork takes the same amount
of time - around 5 hours.
The certification of mass manufactured goods cost around 84 USD, certification of individual batches
of goods costs less - 46 USD.

According to the data in Table 18, it can be noted that official payments account for the largest share in
total payments related to the certification process. A large share of companies that certified mass
manufactured goods admitted to making unofficial payments, similar to last year.

The values obtained in this study have a high degree of dispersion. The central tendency for costs was
determined based on the median, not the arithmetic average.
On average, a company certifies batches of goods 4,4 times per year.
Mass manufactured goods are certified less often - 2,2 times per year. The average period of validity of
mass manufactured goods certificates is 12 months

8.3 Perception of the certification process
Over the past year respondents noted minor changes in the certification process.

Companies do not perceive the process of certification of goods as being complicated. About 16% of
respondents find it difficult to meet the standard requirements in effect. Nearly 10% think that the time
spent on the certification process is too long.

8.4 Summary of analysis
About 16% of respondents were obliged to certify their goods. This indicator has not changed over the
last four years. In 2016 it took less time to certify both individual batches of goods and mass
manufacturing goods (see Table 20).

9.1 Regulatory framework
The state sanitary and epidemiological regulation is governed by Law no. 10-XVI of 03 February 2009
on State supervision of public health. Businesses that carry out activities that may have an impact on
public health are subject to sanitary operating permits.

permits. Their share has been continuously decreasing over the
past five years and is expected to drop considerably as a result
of the amendments brought in by Law no. 153 of 01 July 2016.
                                                                                         Sanitary operating permits are most

11.1 Regulatory framework
According to Law no. 131 of 08 June 2012 On state supervision of entrepreneurial activity,
substantially amended by Law no. 230 of 23 September 2016, "the only authorities/public institutions
that have the right to initiate and carry out an inspection are set out in the Annex to this Law, within
appropriate limits." The law expressly prohibits "the overlapping inspection areas between the
inspection bodies."
The inspecting authority does not have the right to initiate an inspection if the inspecting authority has
the necessary information ascertaining the law compliance or if the information can be obtained from
other inspection and/or supervision bodies, from official records or any other available sources, as well
as if all the other means to establish the law compliance were exhausted except for the state inspection.
The authorized institution does not have the right to inspect a period longer than 3 years of a business
activity preceding the start date of the inspection.
Scheduled inspections carried out during the first 3 years from the state registration date of the person
engaged in entrepreneurial activities have advisory status and will not result in sanctions or restrictive
measures, except for cases where very serious violations of the law are identified.
A single inspection body does not have the right to carry out scheduled inspections more than once in a
calendar year of the same person or object if the person owns several distinct objects, placed separately
from the headquarters and other objects. If there is substantial change in the inspection methodology
based on new hazard criteria, the representatives are entitled to carry out inspections before twelve
months have elapsed.

11.2 Number and duration of inspections
As a result of the moratorium on inspections established by state authorities, the average number of
visits to a business was reduced significantly, almost twice, to 2,0 visits per company per year. These
numbers do no include the checks by Police on vehicles. The
overall amount of time spent by inspectors with a company has
dropped from 7,6 to 5,0 hours. The average number and                    Less often subjected to tax inspetions:

There are no significant differences between the share of inspections carried out in Chisinau and in the
rest of the country.
38% of respondents who own a means of transport claimed that the Traffic Police have stopped their
vehicle without any legal reason, in order to verify the legality of documents or cargo. Their share has
not changes compared to last year.

11.3 Expenses incurred folowing the inspections
Companies are fined most often by the Tax Inspectorate - around 10% of total number of companies or
32% of the surveyed companies. One in five visits of sanitary-epidemiological services ended with a
fine. One in six companies were fined following the visit of Labour Inspection, Local Authorities,
Police and Fire Department.
Most often, companies pay bribes following the inspections carried out by local authorities (one in
three respondents). In one case out of four, drivers of company vehicles have paid bribes when they
were stopped by traffic police. In one case out of five, bribes are paid to representatives of labour
inspection, licensing bodies, tax inspectorate and sanitary-epidimiologic service.

There were no indications of bribes paid to environmental inspection bodies, price monitoring and
standard monitoring bodies. The share of those who pay bribes to the police has decreased.

11.4 Perception of number of inspections and difficulties
Companies' perception of how the number of inspections has changed confirms the above data on their
significant decline in 2016. Most companies revealed that the number of inspections has diminished
compared to previous year. Only in 6% of cases the number of inspections has increased compared to
the previous year.

Only 6% of respondents believe that businesses are treated equally by the law. Their share has
diminished alarmingly compared to the figures revealed in the previous survey - 19% of respondents in
2015. Another 40% believe that the equality of companies is only partially insured within the legal
system.

About 40% respondents believe that the law is applied selectively, depending on the attitude of public
figures. Another 27% partially agree with that statement (see Table 28).

16% of respondents stated that most visits were "scheduled and legally justified". Around 13,5%
underwent inspections after factual events were observed that were to be verified. Nearly 20%
complained that inspectors visited them with the purpose of soliciting bribes or "voluntary
contributions". Around 12% believe they were inspected and intimidated to favor their competitors.

The declining share of respondents claiming that inspections were justified and fair may be caused by
the considerable decrease of these types of inspections. The
increasing percentage of respondents who assert the
opposite, citing various abusive reasons, is not necessarily       The decreasing number of inspections
indicative of an overall growth of the number of abusive           compared to the previous year was

As a result of the moratorium on state inspections established by the Government, particularly by
approving a period during which the inspections were practically prohibited, the number of visits to
companies dropped considerably in 2016. Nearly all state institutions reported a decreasing share of
verified companies, along with a lower number of visits per company.

12 Taxes

12.1 Regulatory framework
The tax system in Moldova is regulated by several laws and regulations. The key document is,
however, the Tax Code approved on 24.04.1997 and amended thereafter. Currently it comprises nine
titles:
    1.   General provisions
    2.   Income tax
    3.   Value added tax
    4.   Excises
    5.   Fiscal administration                                                    By regions, companies located in the

Over 70 percent of respondent companies employ full-time
accountants to calculate and pay all taxes in due time (see
Table 34). The share of those keeping their accounts on their
own practically did not change in recent years. About 7% of companies with full-time accountants also
hire part-time accountants.

percentage points lower than in 2015.
About 31% the profit obtained in 2015 by respondent companies was reinvested in 2016. The share

An impressive share of companies switched to electronic form of submitting declarations. In many
cases, the report is taken directly from the accounting software and then forwarded electronically to the
state body. The undertaken reforms have reduced considerably the amount of time spent to prepare and
submit the report to the state bodies (see Table 35).

12.4 Summary of analysis
In the last year the accountants spent significantly less time on preparation and submission of reports
to state bodies. In the last two years the average number of taxes paid by companies was reduced from
7,5 in 2014 to 5,6 in 2016. Also, the average number of full time accountants per company has slightly
decreased.

13 Price regulation

13.1 Regulatory framework
Government Decision no. 774 of 20 June 2016 on "the pricing of socially important goods" is the main
document governing price regulation. In most cases the products can be sold at free prices. Pursuant to
this Decision, only a small number of food goods are currently sold at regulated prices.
The government keeps the right to regulate the prices for socially important domestic and imported
goods that are marketed with a trade margin not exceeding 20 percent. Exceptions were set for bread
and knot-shaped bread, sold with a trade margin not exceeding 10%.
Socially important products, both imported as well as domestic, which have undergone processing by
trading units, are marketed with a trade margin not exceeding 40% of the total purchase price/delivery
price.
If the characteristics of the goods were not changed, even if having undergone some type of
processing, the seller will not be deemed as a manufacturer.
Regardless of the number of units involved in the supply chain, trade margin's final size should not
exceed the limit set from the purchase price/delivery price.



13.2 The extent of goverment's intervention in price setting
In less than 10% of cases companies said that the government
intervenes in setting prices for their goods. In all cases
respondents were selling both at regulated and at free prices.                     Most of the companies that trade goods

issuing a limit on trade margins (see Table 39).

13.4 Summary of analysis
In the last years, the share of companies selling at regulated prices has been steadily decreasing. In
2016, around 3,5% of total sales were carried out at regulated prices.
In most cases, the state intervenes in companies' pricing by issuing a limit on trade margins.

14 Regulation of labor relations

14.1 Regulatory framework
The main legislative acts governing labour relations are:

        Labour Code of the Republic of Moldova (Law no. 154-XV of 28 March 2003);
        Law no. 847-XV of 14 February 2002 on Remuneration;
        Government Decision no. 743 of 11 June 2002 "On salaries of employees in financially
         autonomous units";
        Government Decision no. 152 of 19 February 2004 "On the compensation quantum bonus for
         work in adverse conditions";

        Government Decision no. 165 of 9 March 2010 "On the minimum guaranteed salary quantum
         in the real sector".

According to the amendments to Labour Code introduced by Law 254 of 09 December 2011, the
employer is obliged to provide employees with a nominal access permit at the workplace. In his turn,
the employee is required to carry at all times the nominal access permit provided by the employer. The
employer must approve the staff structure within the first month of starting to do business, and further
- in the first month of every calendar year. Within 2 months from the date the staff lists were approved,
the employer must submit (in writing or electronically), except for central and local public authorities,
a copy to the territorial labour inspectorate under whose jurisdiction the business is located.

One of the questions of the survey asked about the interference of public employees in the business
activity to promote their personal interests. In only 3% of cases the managers stated that public
employees interfered in the activity of the company. The share is three times lower compared to last
year.
In 1/3 of the cases the company was the initiator.
A third of the companies aimed at by officials mentioned that the involvement decreased over the
previous year.

courts, according to Law no. 225-XV of 30 may 2003 on the Code of Civil Procedure or through
arbitration courts, according to Law no. 23 of 22 February 2008 on Arbitration.
Disputes with government authorities are regulated by "Law on Administrative Contentious" (no. 793-

Around 48% of companies that turned to the courts were satisfied, another 30% - were not satisfied.
On average, respondents rated their satisfaction at 3,15 points on a scale from 1 to 5, which would
result in a 54% level of satisfaction. In 2016 both indicators have improved, both the share of
companies that filed a lawsuit and the share of satisfied companies.

17.4 Summary of analysis
During the last two years, about 21% of the interviewed companies had to settle disputes (with
partners, clients or state authorities). In two thirds of cases they have filed a lawsuit.

18 Phytosanitary certification

18.1 Regulatory framework
The phytosanitary regulation is regulated by Law no.228 of 23 September 2010 “on plant protecti on
and phytosanitary quarantine.”
If the importing countries impose such a requirement, the phytosanitary control body shall issue
phytosanitary certificates The phytosanitary certificate shall be issued to the exporter by the
subdivision of the phytosanitary inspection body under whose jurisdiction the goods subject to
quarantine are produced. In order to obtain the phytosanitary certificate, the exporter shall submit, at
least 48 hours prior to shipment, a series of documents:

    a) application requesting a phytosanitary certificate;

    b) certificate on the use of phytosanitary products, at the request of the importing country;

    c) phytosanitary certificate of the country of origin;

    d) copy of fiscal invoice or cargo shipping invoice.


The validity of phytosanitary certificate is 14 days from the issue date. If the inspection establishes that
phytosanitary requirements have been observed, instead of phytosanitary certificate, a phytosanitary
passport is issued to ensure the free movement of imported plants and plant products.

18.2 Obtaining phytosanitary authorizations (certificates and permits)
Nearly 6% of respondents had to obtain phytosanitary
authorizations. On average, companies pass this procedure 3,4
times per year.                                                          9,3% of the companies in the Industry

Only 3% of respondents encountered difficulties in obtaining phytosanitary authorizations. Overall, the
process does not pose significant problems. The most important impediments are the costs of obtaining
permits, both official and unofficial.

          Conclusions

          Costul reglementării de stat a activității întreprinderilor

     Conclusions

In 2016 the general time indicator saw an impressive decline of more than 20%. However, only 13%
of companies noted improvements in the business environment, compared to 27% who stated the
opposite.
Registration process
The registration process has slighlty improved. The required amount of time was reduced by 40%, the
amount of time needed to amend documents also dropped by 13%. Costs have essentially not changed
compared to last year.
Nearly 10 hours are spent to register a company and over 6 hours to amend the incorporation
documents. A good part of this time is spent waiting in line at the SRC.
A reduced number of respondents believe that the registration process is complicated.
Regulation in Constructions
The number of companies who build new premises on their own is steadily decreasing. Most of the
companies that build on their own turned to designing companies or other intermediaries to comply
with government requirements in constructions.
Thus, only three respondents had to obtain construction authorizations on their own.
The number of companies that changed the use of premises has increased. The amount of time
required to obtain relevant authorizations has slightly increased compared to last year.
Licensing
In 2016 the average number of licenses per company has decreased. Costs and time required to obtain
a license remained at the 2015 level.
The share of companies who paid bribes to obtain a license has increased to 18%. Still, only 10% of
respondents were bothered by this fact.
Only one company in six encounters difficulties in obtaining a license.
Obtaining trade authorizations
In 2016 the regulation process of trade activity saw important changes, with trade authorizations being
eliminated. The law provides that companies notify local public authorities that they started to do
business. However, given the poor informing in this area and the need to submit a notification of those
who already have an authorization, the perception is that authorizations were replaced by notifications,
"another type of authorization, though easier to obtain."
Only a third of respondents think that the notification is a simpler procedure than obtaining an
authorization, with 6% stating the opposite.
Regulation on equipment
Obtaining an authorization to start using the purchased equipment is an area with little impact on the
ease of doing business - less than 1% of respondent companies.

Regulation of imports
Both time and costs required to clear the imported goods through customs increased in 2016. One third
of respondents think that the clearance process has become more difficult.
Regulation of exports
Given that export companies shifted their focus on EU and other countries, generally to the detriment
of exports to CIS countries, the share of exporting companies has decreased substantially. Only 2,5 of
respondents carried out export operations in the last three years.
The amount of time spent on export clearance procedures varied insignificantly during 2010-2016.
Costs saw strong fluctuations cause by the high dispersion of values and the low number of
respondents.
Certification of goods
In the last year the certification of both individual batches and mass manufactured goods took less
time. In both cases costs have not changed essentially. One in six companies encounter difficulties in
meeting the certification requirements on goods.
Sanitary operating permits
The share of companies that applied for a sanitary authorization has decreased in the last five years to
34% in 2016. Both the time and costs have fluctuated in recent years without establishing, however,
any increasing or decreasing trend. Very few (9%) respondents mentioned having difficulties in
obtaining sanitary authorizations.
Sanitary certification
The share of companies that need sanitary certificates has declined significantly in recent years, to
34%. Current amendments in the legislation are estimated to trigger a further decrease in this share.
Both the time and costs were seen fluctuating in recent years, however, without establishing an
increasing or decreasing trend. Only 8% of companies encountered difficulties in obtaining sanitary
certificates.
Inspections
As a result of the moratorium on inspections, the number of inspected companies dropped
aproximately two times in 2016. The frequency of inspections has also decreased two times. Overall,
the amount of time spent by inspectors with a company has decreased from 7,6 to 5 hours per year.
More than half of respondents said that the number of inspections has declined. One in four
respondents believe that inspection procedures have improved.
Taxation system
The transition to electronic reporting has reduced approximately twofold the amount of time spent by
companies to prepare and submit tax-related reports.
Price regulation
The share of companies stating that their goods or services are subject to price regulation has shown a
downward trend since 2009. Only 3,5% of goods are sold at regulated prices.

Regulation of labour relations
Overall, the regulation of labour relations does not pose impediments to businesses. Nearly 20% of
companies mentioned that the staff reduction process is too complicated.
Execution of contracts
State's involvement in the conclusion and execution of contracts is a rare practice - 5% of the total. The
share of companies whose contracts were verified by state representatives has not changed over the
years 2005-2016.
Judiciary system
Nearly two thirds of companies that had to settle conflicts took the matter to court. The indicator has
increased considerably compared to last year, affected presumably by the increasing level of
satisfaction of companies that resolved their disputes in court: from 46 to 54%.
The share of companies that had to seek illegal methods to solve their problems decreased from 14 to
8%.
Phytosanitary certification
Only 6% of respondent companies had to obtain phytosanitary certificates. Both the duration and cost
of obtaining phytosanitary certificates remained at the last year level, with the two indicators being
usually lower than in other types of certificates.
None of respondents noticed improvements in the process of obtaining phytosanitary authorizations.
