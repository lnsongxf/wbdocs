      Technical and             •	 Have the biodiversity and ecosystem values to be offset been listed and described?
      Ecological Aspects        •	 Has the full mitigation hierarchy (first avoid, then minimize, then restore, and only
                                   then offset) been duly considered, with adequate documentation?
                                •	 Have potential offset sites and activities been screened against selected criteria
                                   (ecological, social, implementation feasibility)?
                                •	 Are there potential offset sites nearby which meet the desired criteria, or do you need
                                   to look into the wider landscape? If the ecological characteristics are not similar, can
                                   you trade-up?
                                •	 How do the proposed offset sites fit in with national and regional conservation
                                   priorities?
                                •	 How do the proposed offset sites provide additionality?
                                •	 What conservation interventions will be required for the offset to achieve No Net Loss
                                   or otherwise succeed?
                                •	 For proposed restoration offsets, is there demonstrated success for these types of
                                   habitats?
                                •	 Which outcome indicators will be monitored?

      Land Tenure,              •	 Who legally owns, who claims ownership or use rights, and who effectively controls
      Social, and Political        all the parcels of land comprising the proposed biodiversity offset area, as well as the
      Aspects                      corresponding water rights?
                                •	 Do local residents (individuals or communities) own, occupy, or otherwise use the
                                   proposed offset sites?
                                •	 Are local residents adequately engaged in the biodiversity offset planning process?
                                •	 What changes in land or natural resource use (if any) will be needed for the
                                   biodiversity offset to succeed? How will those changes be implemented?
                                •	 If access to natural resources will be restricted more than at present, are the
                                   livelihood restoration measures (including alternative livelihoods) proposed for or by

                                •	 Is there sufficient political support for the planned offset activities? If legislative
                                   (congressional or parliamentary) approval is required (such as to create a new
                                   protected area), can this realistically be achieved when needed?
                                •	 Are there other social or political risks (such as security and conflict issues) that could
                                   prevent effective implementation?

      Long-term                 •	 Are there any legal requirements in place that dictate a particular methodology be
      Protection and               followed for designing or implementing the offset?
      Legal Aspects             •	 How long is the proposed offset site expected to be legally protected or otherwise
                                   secure?
                                •	 Will the offset be part of a protected area system or managed independently?
                                •	 In the case of private (individual or community) ownership of the offset area,
                                   what types of conservation instruments will be used to ensure or promote long-

Financial Aspects    •	 Have the up-front investment costs been adequately budgeted, with an agreed
                        funding source? (These costs may include land acquisition, physical demarcation,
                        protected area infrastructure and other small civil works, vehicles, office and field
                        equipment, staff training, consultancies including Management Plan preparation,
                        etc.)
                     •	 Will there be adequate funding of recurrent protection, management, and
                        monitoring costs (including salaries, fuel, supplies, and spare parts) over the long
                        term? Through what mechanisms?

Human Resources      •	 What human resources are needed to plan and implement the biodiversity offset,
                        including long-term management and monitoring?
                     •	 How much and what kinds of training will be required?

Partnerships         •	 Which organizations have been, or should be, engaged as partners to support offset
                        planning or implementation?
                     •	 Are people from local communities (adults or students) willing and able to participate
                        in the protection, management, or monitoring of the offset area and its biodiversity?

Stakeholder          •	 Have the interested and potentially affected stakeholders been adequately
Engagement              identified?
                     •	 Have timely communications and an open and regular dialogue been maintained
                        with local communities or other key stakeholders?
                     •	 Have interested stakeholders been provided opportunities to engage throughout
                        the biodiversity offsetting process, including site selection, offset design, no-net-loss
                        calculations, implementation, and monitoring?
                     •	 Has a stakeholder complaint and feedback mechanism been defined (where
                        warranted)?
                     •	 Do a significant number of local residents or other stakeholders object to key
                        aspects of the proposed offset plans? If so, how will these objections be effectively
                        addressed?

Case Study: Liberia Nimba Western Range Iron Ore
Project Overview
ArcelorMittal (AML) is mining iron ore in Nimba
County, northern Liberia, close to the Guinea
border, where extraction commenced in
2011. Mining operations are focused on three
mountains (Tokadeh, Gangra and Yuelliton)
in the scattered Western Range of the Nimba
Mountains. Ore is transported by rail 243 km
to the coast where it is shipped from the port
of Buchanan. ArcelorMittal rehabilitated an
existing but dilapidated rail line as well as the
Buchanan port and material handling facilities
with little expansion of the existing footprint.
Thus, land clearance for Phase 1 of the project
(2011–2015) focused around the mine and
resulted in the loss of up to 500 ha of agriculture
and forest, including moist evergreen forest.
Phase 2 (planned for 2015–2026 but delayed
due to a downturn in iron ore prices) is expected
to result in the loss of a further 700 ha of forest,
including 225 ha of lowland evergreen forest.
ArcelorMittal owns 85% and wholly funds its            Liberia's East Nimba Nature Reserve is receiving

Case Study: Madagascar Ambatovy Minerals
Project Overview
The Ambatovy Joint Venture is a large-scale
nickel and cobalt mining and processing opera-
tion in central eastern Madagascar. The mine is
close to Moramanga, 80 km east of the capital
Antananarivo, and is linked by a 220 km pipeline
to the processing plant at Toamasina on the east
coast. Ore is extracted from two pits, mixed with
water to create slurry and then transferred by
gravity flow to the coastal processing plant. The
mine site footprint is approximately 2,000 ha,
including 1,800 ha of intact and degraded nat-
ural habitats. The processing plant footprint is
320 ha but the site was previously degraded and
does not involve significant impacts on biodiver-
sity. The most significant impacts to biodiversity
are at the mine and upper pipeline areas. The        Ambatovy is a large-scale nickel and cobalt mining and
expected useful life of the mine is 29 years.        processing operation in central eastern Madagascar.

Case Study: Cameroon Lom Pangar Hydropower
Project Overview
The objective of the Cameroon Lom Pangar
Hydropower Project is to store water in the wet
season and to release it in the dry season by
building a regulating dam on the Lom River,
four km downstream of the confluence with
the Pangar River. These are tributaries of the
Sanaga River, the largest river in Cameroon. The
dam will reduce water flows by 20% in the wet
season and increase them in the driest month
from 210 m3/sec to 900m3/sec. By creating more
consistent dry season water flows, the Lom
Pangar Dam will enable the downstream devel-
opment of up to 6,000 MW of hydropower in the
medium to long term, including for the expan-
sion of aluminium smelters. It will also enable
a 120 MW increase in power generation from
two existing downstream hydropower plants.
The Project includes its own 30 MW hydropower
