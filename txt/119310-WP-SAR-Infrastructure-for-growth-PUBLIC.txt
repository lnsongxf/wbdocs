1.3 AREAS OF
    TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Several sub-themes are being funded under each thematic pillar along with cross-cutting issues. These are
detailed below along with the tasks funded under each area.



1 - REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
In addition to cross border integration, activities that address connectivity to lagging regions and communi-
ties, between key rural and urban regions and that focus on regional economic development around trunk
infrastructure are supported.




                                                                                                          7
INTEGRATING LAGGING REGIONS - These are often crucial for economic integration and reducing
conflict and fragility in the region. Several of these underdeveloped areas can be found on the borders of
countries in the region. These include the NE region in Sri Lanka, the NER in India, and the Chittagong Hill
tract in Bangladesh, among others. These regions are integral to cross-border trade. Cross border disputes
and conflicts play a major role in the lack of integration within the region. Connecting lagging regions to the
mainstream economy is also key to inclusive growth. See Highlight 4 The Challenge of Regional Integration in
Post Conflict Lagging Border Regions for details of work funded under this sub-theme.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT - Regional economic development lays the foundation for
national, regional and international economic integration. It is a process by which public, private and peo-
ple (NGOs and CBOs etc.) partners (PPPP) come together to maximize the economic assets of a region.
There are several such potential growth corridors along trunk infrastructure in the countries in South Asia. This
includes the proposed Inclusive Economic Development Zone around the Eastern Dedicated Freight Cor-
ridor (DFC) in India. The DFC has the potential of connecting to the Trans-Asian highway, which is planned to
link the South and East Asia regions.

RURAL-URBAN CONNECTIVITY - Peri-urban regions at the crossroads of localization and globalization
drive much of the growth and trade in emerging economies. They are at the forefront of the economic,
social and built environmental change that leads to integration. Businesses relocate to these regions due to
lower land and production costs and due to the proximity to markets, trade and transportation hubs. The de-
velopment of these growth areas has been haphazard in South Asia. Well designed connectivity and urban-
rural integration in these regions can promote greater trade and integration by linking together market towns
and their hinterland, where economic production takes place.



2 - CLIMATE CHANGE
Within this broad theme, the window is funding activities focused on clean and renewable energy, and leading to
improvements in energy efficiency. Reducing the impact of cities on climate change, improving access to green
finance, development of climate smart strategies and climate resilient infrastructure delivery are other sub-themes.

CLEAN ENERGY AND RENEWABLES - Strategies to lower emissions by diversifying into cleaner energy
sources are crucial to SAR. India, the largest energy consumer in the region, is not well endowed with cleaner
fuels (1). The hydropower potential in the country while large is not enough to meet future energy needs
that are fuelled by rapid growth. There is potential for importing hydropower from Nepal and wind power
from Sri Lanka, but challenges are rife in trans-boundary energy trade. There is considerable scope to expand
renewable energy through hydropower in India, Nepal, and Pakistan, and natural gas in Bangladesh. Solar
and wind power are two other green energy sources that have great potential in the region.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY - It can translate into reduction of costs, greater productivity and reduction in GHG
emissions. Cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities exist across the entire chain of energy production, dis-
tribution, and consumption in all South Asian countries. Governments have a key role to play in specifying and
imposing energy efficiency standards, coming up with incentives and certification programs for industry and utili-
ties, and improving the regulatory environment for PPPs. This neglected area can yield quick wins at a low cost.

CITIES AND CLIMATE CHANGE - Cities, the engines of growth as the region transitions to services-
led growth, are also major contributors to GHG emissions. South Asia is undergoing rapid and unplanned
urbanization and its cities consistently rank at the bottom of global livability surveys. Rapid urbanization is
accompanied by growing demand for transportation, energy, water supply and sanitation and increased
generation of wastewater and solid waste contributing to the growth in GHG emissions. There are untapped
opportunities for South Asia’s cities to enhance densification and simultaneously improve services and quality
of life while reducing the GHG footprint.

of India, Integrated Energy Policy).

CLIMATE SMART DEVELOPMENT AND GREEN GROWTH - Countries in South Asia will be increasingly
challenged to develop and implement climate smart development strategies (low carbon, low water, low
energy, and green growth), taking into account the impacts of climate change on development outcomes.
There is considerable scope to develop national, state, city, and sectoral strategies and action plans for cli-
mate smart and sustainable green growth in South Asia.

GREEN FINANCE - Green finance is fundamental to the investments needed for green technologies and
green growth. It requires tapping into, international and domestic, public and private financial flows through
a variety of instruments besides carbon finance. Competitive, profit-oriented private initiatives are essential
for getting to least cost options for climate mitigation and adaptation. Public policy will play a crucial dual
role in growing this sector: by establishing regulatory and incentive frameworks to catalyze private invest-
ment and by generating public resources for needs not addressed by private flows.

INTEGRATING ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION CONSIDERATIONS INTO INFRASTRUCTURE -
New infrastructure can be made climate resilient by ensuring that an asset is located, designed, built and
operated with the current and future climate in mind. Existing infrastructure can be made climate proof by
ensuring that maintenance regimes incorporate resilience to the impacts of climate change over an asset’s
lifetime. Achieving more climate resilient infrastructure requires that impacts of climate change be a key
consideration in the way infrastructure is planned, designed, built and maintained.



3 - CROSS CUTTING THEMES
Several crosscutting themes are essential to achieving optimal and sustainable results under the main pillars.
Sector governance and reforms are fundamental to overcoming the institutional and governance deficit in
South Asia. Social inclusion, gender equity and access are essential to ensure inclusive growth and achieve-
ment of the MDGs. Social accountability along with voice and participation can enable beneficiaries and
civil society groups to engage with policymakers and to make service providers more responsive to con-
sumer needs. South Asia has a recurring motif of fragility and conflict both intra and cross border that affects
development outcomes and requires substantial investment in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of infra-
structure. This calls for a light footprint and for development partners to play the role of honest brokers. Infra-
structure connectivity in fragile environments also requires a good understanding of the political economy
to develop sustainable models of service delivery. Mobilizing private investment and creating an enabling
environment for private actors is crucial for closing the financial and service delivery gaps and for achieving
lasting outcomes.

Environmental and social safeguards provide important benchmarks for performance for both public and
private sectors. Safeguard policies allow the potentially adverse environmental and social impacts of invest-
ments to be identified, minimized, and mitigated. The region lacks the expertise needed to design and imple-
ment safeguard policies, and for capacity building especially through South-South cooperation.

The IFG window has so far funded five tasks for $1.67 million. Proposals are being evaluated for the next phase
of funding. Of the activities funded, two come under the regional integration, and one can be classified un-
der the climate change theme. Two other tasks support the cross-cutting themes. These are briefly described
below. Diagram 5 indicates the key themes and the projects funded for the IFG window.

                HIGHLIGHT
        THE CHALLENGE OF REGIONAL
       INTEGRATION IN POST CONFLICT
         LAGGING BORDER REGIONS
     Conflict is endemic in South Asia. Conflict in border areas is persistent due to the ne-
     glect of these areas that are remote. One such highly sensitive geo-political region is
     the North East Region (NER) of India, comprising seven states called the seven sisters.
     Six of the seven states have seen armed conflict and rumblings are still heard from time
     to time. This is an area of strategic importance that borders five countries -Bhutan, Ban-
     gladesh, China, Nepal and Myanmar - and stretches across the eastern foothills of the
     Himalayas. The bordering areas in Bangladesh and Myanmar have also seen conflict
     with rebels often taking refuge across borders. The slow pace of industrialization and lim-
     ited opportunities for productive economic activities have led to a distressed economy
     and an alarmingly high rate of youth unemployment of 14%, despite high rates of lit-
     eracy. This frustration of the youth provides fuel for insurgencies. Agriculture remains the
     backbone of the economy, contributing close to 26% of the regional GDP and employ-
     ing over 75% of the population, with agricultural workers being predominantly women.

     However, the region is well endowed with natural resources. Its energy reserves include
     more than 40% of the hydropower potential, 37% of estimated petroleum reserves and
     15% of natural gas reserves of India. This puts the NER at the center of the energy secu-
     rity and trade equation for India and for South Asia. In addition, with significant deposits
     of mineral reserves like limestone, clay and iron ore, the region could be one of the
     economic drivers of SAR’s economy. NER is also emerging as an important gateway
     for trade with Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, South-west China and further east.
     The area is of great strategic importance and GoI has acknowledged this with its ”Look-
     ing East” policy which focuses on development of the region and on energy trade with
     Bangladesh. The Bank plans to support the development of the transmission and distri-
     bution grid in six states with lending of $1.5 billion. GoI will support electricity generation.
     Given the complexities of infrastructure delivery in NER the IFG window is funding key
     work that will improve the design of the project and ensure sustainable regional integra-
     tion and trade. This includes key diagnostics of the utilities, a study of gender impacts,
     and of the political economy of energy delivery in this post conflict region, PPP options
     and the development of a communication strategy. The assessment of the utilities that
     has been completed points to poor institutional frameworks and low capacity as the
     key challenges to be overcome for sustainable energy security and trade in the region.

1.5 PRELIMINARY
    RESULTS
IFG newest window in the PFSA UTF was set up in June 2012. The five tasks funded are still under implementa-
tion. There are however interim results available from two of the tasks funded.

NE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT - Government of India has initiated a program to
strengthen the inter-state and intra-state transmission and sub-transmission infrastructure in the region as a
part of its wider efforts to develop the energy resources in the NER for electricity trade within and outside
the region, and to expand and strengthen transmission systems and make possible last mile connectivity
to households. GoI has sought Bank support for investments in the intra-state transmission and distribution
network and for institutional reforms and capacity building initiatives across the 6 states of Assam, Manipur,
Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland. Assessments of the utilities in all six states were carried out to
identify the key challenges to institutional reform and capacity and the institutional strengthening interven-
tions needed in each state. Diagnostic assessments of all six states in the NER have been completed. These
have revealed weak institutions and low capacity as the key challenge in all six state power institutions and
systems.

REGIONAL STUDY ON ENERGY SECURITY AND TRADE - Inception workshops were held in Delhi,
Kathmandu, Islamabad, and Dhaka, along with meetings with a variety of stakeholders including govern-
ment advisors, regulators, power market players, and organizations. Besides this discussions have been held
with AusAID, ADB, USAID and the SARC secretariat and energy office. AusAID staff attended the regional
workshop in Delhi and the consultations that followed. The common view expressed was that the study was
valuable and timely. Participants highlighted a number of domestic policy challenges that had to be ad-
dressed to meet growing demand and for regional energy trade. The strengths and weaknesses of the two
broad approaches to regionalization were discussed: a more incremental model in which bilateral projects
build up to multilateral cooperation, and a framework model by which consultations towards a broader re-
gional approach are initiated. Consultants are in the process of being hired for the analytical work. Based on
the consultations undertaken, advisors with experience and insight into national issues in each country and
also regional issues are being selected. Workshops are to follow in Afghanistan, Bhutan and Sri Lanka shortly.
