Executive Summary



I.	 One of the Russian Federation's key strategic development objectives for the ICT sector is to
leverage high technology and innovation to strengthen a modern, well diversified economy. Many
governments around the world view broadband as the foundational infrastructure that can drive
social and economic development. Russia is no exception: broadband development is listed among
the priorities of the Russian Government1. Relative to OECD comparators, Russia has set one of
the most ambitious broadband targets, considering the country’s geographic size and fairly low-
population density. Russia plans to make 100 Mbps, or Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB), available to 80
percent of Russian residents by 2018, with the ultimate goal of providing accessible and affordable
broadband to 95 percent of households by 2020. Making this communication infrastructure acces-
sible to the broader middle class, as well as to those in the lower 40 percent income bracket, could
potentially advance economic prosperity.

II.	 Broadband is of strategic importance to Russia's social and economic development due to its
impact on job creation and productivity. In particular, broadband is essential for further leveraging
software and IT engineering jobs, which are already well-established in Russia, and for bringing
job opportunities to remote and isolated geographic areas. Furthermore, the availability of high-
speed internet is the key to increased competitiveness in business, and particularly to innovation in
manufacturing. Finally, broadband facilitates Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and is considered
one of the pillars of “smart” and sustainable infrastructure, such as smart electric grids and intel-
ligent transportation systems. Therefore, broadband is a critical part of the general infrastructure
modernization pursued by the Russian Government.

III.	This paper has three main objectives: (a) it benchmarks Russia’s broadband performance in-
dicators to identify progress towards the broadband development goals and areas needing policy
attention; (b) it reviews the broadband market structure and regulatory environment to identify
priority areas for reform; and (c) it outlines a policy agenda aimed at adding impetus to the scale-up
of Russia’s broadband infrastructure in all aspects of broadband service performance, such as access,
quality, and affordability.

    dependent on a number of demand-side issues, such as rolling out digital literacy programs, promoting local digital
    content and software, increasing publication and reuse of open data, crowdsourcing and citizen participation, improving
    e-government services, etc. While we do not cover these issues in this note due to the constraints of its scope, we are fully
    cognizant of their importance. Discussion of these and other related issues as well as analytical work is a big part of the World

pensive investment, there is a much higher price to pay for not investing – that is, a loss of economic
competitiveness.

16.	 Analysis of the digital divide shows that the main areas experiencing underdevelopment of
broadband access in Russia are rural settlements, as well as subjects of the Russian Federation
with a low level of social and economic development. In this regard, further accelerated develop-
ment of broadband infrastructure is possible only within the framework of the state program that
will combine regulatory measures to stimulate the development of broadband access in small towns
and rural areas with various mechanisms of financial support for the deployment of broadband in-
frastructure in areas of low or negative return (from the universal service fund, federal and regional
budgets).

Federal Agency for State Property Management) together with the state-owned Vnesheconombank
holds more than 48 percent of shares, about 22 percent of shares being controlled by Rostelecom di-
rectly or via its subsidiary Mobitel Ltd, and the rest being owned by other shareholders or is floating
stock. In other words, the state has a major influence on the development of the market, especially
considering that the majority shareholder of TransTelecom (TTK), closest market player to Rostele-
com in the fixed broadband market, is the state-run Russian Railways. TTK claims to have a total of
20 international gateways with additional connections to Mongolia, Poland, the Baltic states and the
CIS countries. The company rents its backbone to such players as Vimpelcom and MTS.

III.	Current infrastructure sharing framework would benefit from:                                        nificantly benefit from adapting this experience. Particularly beneficial could be alignment
       •	 Increased transparency of the infrastructure available for utilization from the utility        in areas of the provision of LLU and Bitstream access, including definition of the wholesale
       companies. The development or provision of consolidated access to existing digital infra-         products, formulation of the requirements for the reference access offer, provision of access
       structure maps would increase awareness by, and subsequently utilization by, the telecom          and maintenance; and regulation of the prices for access and related products, including,
       operators of the utility assets available and their geographical location, which will foster      but not limited to backhaul and co-locations;
       infrastructure use in the deployment of communications lines;
                                                                                                         •	 Allowing greater flexibility in the formulation and adjustment of LLU and Bitstream ac-
       •	 Publicly available advance reference offers, i.e. template legal agreements, to share infra-   cess rules by the overseeing agency. As in the case of infrastructure sharing, it is suggested
       structure assets. Such advance offers would enable a more efficient infrastructure sharing        to keep the main principle guiding SMP regime on the level of the primary legislation,
       process. Requirements for the composition, amendment and publication of such offers               while keeping more detailed technical implementation of the market analysis and require-

       Communications and Mass Media;

       •	 Encourage a zero-level dispute resolution procedure at the Federal Antitrust Agency
       (before the first instance court litigation). At the moment, a dispute may be placed be-
       fore both the court and the Federal Antitrust Agency at the discretion of the claiming
       party. For the development of consistent case law, it is advisable that, at the early stages
       of implementation of infrastructure sharing, all disputes would go through a mandatory
       zero-level dispute resolution procedure at the specialized public agency. This measure will
       also remove the burden from the courts of dealing with highly specific technical issues, e.g.
       determination of technical conditions to provide infrastructure sharing, calculation of the
       infrastructure sharing costs, etc.;

       •	 Greater elaboration of the methodology to be applied to calculate infrastructure sharing
       costs and price composition. International experience proves that determination of the
       prices for infrastructure sharing is the main source of disputes. It is therefore advisable to
       establish in advance an approach for dealing with cost calculation disputes;

       •	 Extension of the infrastructure sharing obligation to telecom operators. The experience
       of other countries maintaining infrastructure sharing frameworks demonstrates that shar-
       ing of the existing passive telecom infrastructure (e.g. ducts, dark fiber, etc.) is the first
       choice for operators due to number of reasons, including the readiness of this infrastruc-
       ture for telecom – related deployments.

IV.	 Formulation of the LLU and Bitstream Access framework would benefit from:
       •	 Establishment of the Significant Market Power (SMP) regulatory regime, including a
       market analysis procedure for wholesale broadband markets. LLU and Bitstream access
       are asymmetric obligations aimed to level the playing field between incumbent operators
       and alternative market players through the promotion of further investment by the latter
       and more efficient use of the last mile infrastructure by the former. The SMP regime is
       required to allow the imposition of such obligations upon evidence of competition failure
       in the relevant market(s);

       •	 Adoption of the best regulatory practices in the area of LLU and Bitstream access imple-
       mentation. The EU has developed a sufficiently rich regulatory experience in the area of
       SMP regulation, including LLU and Bitstream access. The Russian telecom market may sig-
