evaluation. The baseline survey of the impact evaluation was conducted in Peru          at the household and
(2008), Senegal (2009), and Vietnam (2009) (Chase and Do 2010; Galiani and
Orsola-Vidal 2010; Orsola-Vidal and Yusuf 2011). Information regarding the

data collection methods for the baseline surveys can be found in the country-           methods of data collection:

of the treatment arms has been established in the country-specific reports.

Handwashing was measured at the household and individual levels using the
methods of data collection described above: rapid observations, self-reports, and
structured observations (Ram 2013). Key indicators of handwashing behavior are
described by the level and method of data collection in Table 1. In all three coun-
tries, both rapid observations and self-reports were obtained among all house-
holds included in the overall baseline surveys.

Structured observations were carried out in a subset of households included in
the baseline survey in Peru and Senegal. Structured observations were not carried
out in the Vietnam baseline survey. Observations for individual-level data col-
lection were carried out among primary caregivers of children. In Peru, observa-
tions began between 6:30 and 9:30 a.m., and lasted 4 to 5 hours. Self-report and
structured observation data are used to describe individual handwashing behavior
at critical times. The following critical times for handwashing behavior were of
interest in these analyses: after fecal contact, before food preparation, before eat-
ing and before feeding a child.

2.1 Data Analysis
This section describes the various measures of handwashing collected using rapid
observations, self-reports, and structured observations.

Presence of soap anywhere in the home
The indicator is defined as the presence of at least one type of soap observed by
the enumerator anywhere in the home.

Following observations of handwashing places, enumerators asked the household
respondent to show soap typically used for washing hands, irrespective of where
it was located in the home. All households that allowed observation of soap any-
where in the home are included in this analysis.

Presence of soap anywhere in the home
Observation of soap anywhere in the home was possible in 3,658 Peru house-           households in each country
holds, 1,373 Senegal households, and 3,129 Vietnam households (Table 2). At
least one type of soap for washing hands was observed in the majority of house-
                                                                                     had soap and water together
holds in all three countries, but was nearly universal in Vietnam (97 percent). In   at two handwashing places.
contrast, 82 percent of Peru households and 59 percent of Senegal households
had at least one type of soap for washing hands somewhere in the home. The
most common type of soap observed was powder soap in Vietnam (83 percent)
and Peru (60 percent), and multipurpose bar soap in Senegal (47 percent).

Number of handwashing places, and presence of soap and water in
those places
The number of handwashing places present in each household was tallied based
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined above and in Table 2. Because re-
spondents were asked about handwashing places specifically used after defecation
and before food preparation, the maximum number of handwashing places pos-
sible was two. In Peru, among 3,448 households, 8 percent had no handwashing
place, 61 percent had only one place, and 31 percent had two places. In Senegal,
among 1,513 households, 45 percent had no handwashing place, 32 percent had
only one place, and 23 percent had two places. In Vietnam, among 3,143 house-
holds, 11 percent had no handwashing place, 58 percent had only one place, and
31 percent had two places.

The availability of soap and water at one or more handwashing places in 3,448
households in Peru, 1,513 households in Senegal, and 3,143 households in Viet-
nam was examined. Soap was present at only one handwashing place in 55 per-
cent of Vietnam households and 51 percent of Peru households, in contrast to
23 percent of Senegal households. Soap was present in two handwashing places
in a minority of households in all three countries: Peru (18 percent), Senegal
(15 percent), and Vietnam (29 percent). Whereas soap was not present at any
handwashing place in 63 percent of Senegal households, this was true of only
17 percent of Vietnam households and 32 percent of Peru households. Water
was present at one handwashing place in 58 percent of Peru households, 28 per-
cent of Senegal households, and 57 percent of Vietnam households. Water was
present at two handwashing places in 23 percent of Peru households, 15 per-
cent of Senegal households, and 30 percent of Vietnam households. Soap and
water together were present at one handwashing place in the majority of Vietnam
(53 percent) and Peru (46 percent) households, in contrast to 21 percent of Sen-
egal households. Only a minority of households in each country had soap and
water together at two handwashing places. Soap and water together were present
in two handwashing places in 15 percent of Peru households, 13 percent of Sen-
egal households, and 27 percent of Vietnam households.

with soap at each of these critical times, but it is possible that the critical time did
not occur (for example, they may not have had to feed a child themselves).

The proportion of respondents indicating that washing with soap is the best way
to clean hands was nearly identical in the three countries: Peru (85 percent), Sen-
egal (88 percent), and Vietnam (86 percent).

Enumerators rated the cleanliness of caregivers’ nails, palms, and fingerpads. Rat-
ings among caregivers in Senegal and Vietnam were similar to each other but
dissimilar to ratings among Peru caregivers. In Peru, enumerators indicated the
presence of visible dirt under nails (26 percent), on palms (19 percent), and on
fingerpads (19 percent). Visible dirt was much less commonly recorded in Sen-
egal: nails (10 percent), palms (4 percent), and fingerpads (4 percent). Similar to
Senegal, in Vietnam, visible dirt was recorded for 5 percent of nails, 2 percent
of palms, and 2 percent of fingerpads. Hand cleanliness was categorized on a
three-point scale based on the observations of nails, palms, and fingerpads. If all
three aspects of the hand were recorded as “clean,” overall hand cleanliness was
rated “clean.” If at least one aspect of the hands was recorded as having “visible
dirt,” overall hand cleanliness was rated as “very unclean.” All others were rated
as “somewhat unclean.” Hands were rated as “clean” in 42 percent of Peru care-
givers, 71 percent of Senegal caregivers, and 63 percent of Vietnam caregivers.
Hands were rated as “very unclean” in 24 percent of Peru caregivers, 7 percent of
Senegal caregivers, and 4 percent of Vietnam caregivers. It should be noted that
ratings of cleanliness on one aspect of the hand were significantly correlated with
ratings of cleanliness on another aspect of the hand. For example, in Senegal,
palm cleanliness ratings were highly correlated with fingerpad cleanliness (R =
0.92, p < 0.0001); palm cleanliness ratings were also significantly correlated with
fingernail cleanliness ratings, although the strength of the correlation was some-
what lower (R = 0.67, p < 0.0001). Similar findings were noted for both Peru and
Vietnam (data not shown).

IV.               Discussion

The baseline surveys for Global Scaling Up Handwashing in Peru, Senegal, and
Vietnam indicate a substantial potential and need to improve handwashing be-
havior in all three Scaling Up countries. Based on the authors’ experience and
that of others engaged in measuring handwashing (Ram 2013; Biran et al. 2008;
Ram et al. 2010) several measures of handwashing behavior were employed to de-
scribe related but distinct constructs. These constructs describing the Focus, Op-
portunity, and Ability domains of the FOAM framework (Coombes and Devine
2010) include the availability of materials required for handwashing, behavior at
critical times for handwashing, and cleanliness of hands. The various measures
paint relatively consistent pictures of the state of handwashing within each proj-
ect country, with the greatest opportunity to improve handwashing behavior in
Senegal, but also robust potential to do so in both Peru and Vietnam.

In Senegal, only a minority of households were found to have a fixed handwash-
ing place near toileting and food preparation areas, and soap was available any-
where in the home in only about 60 percent of households. Moreover, small
minorities of Senegal households observed were found to have washed hands with
soap at least once after fecal contact and before food preparation. Even in Peru,
fewer than half of households under structured observation were found to wash
hands with soap after fecal contact, and far fewer did so before food preparation.
Washing hands with soap, or even with water alone, at these two critical times
(after defecation and before food preparation) has been associated with reduced
diarrhea risk (Luby et al. 2010). These findings indicate the substantial need to
improve handwashing at critical times in both Senegal and Peru.

There may be several explanations for the low frequency of handwashing with
soap at critical times in the Scaling Up countries. It was common in Senegal not
to have a specific place to wash hands, even after defecation. In both Peru and
Vietnam, the handwashing place was more than 10 feet away from the toilet facil-
ity in a third of households. The presence of a fixed handwashing place, particu-
larly inside or in close proximity to the toilet facility, may provide a useful visual
cue to stimulate handwashing behavior. In particular, such visual cues may be
critical to the development of handwashing habits, described by Curtis as “auto-
mated behaviors produced by cues, often as part of a routine” (Curtis et al. 2009).
In high-income countries, hand hygiene in healthcare settings was believed to be
hampered because clinicians were forced to walk away from patient care areas in
order to access sinks for handwashing with soap. The placement of waterless hand
sanitizer dispensers in large-volume in-patient care areas has led to improvements
in hand hygiene behavior by providing the visual cue and by improving access to
the necessary materials (Luby and Halder 2008; CDC 2002).

     The presence of a fixed                             Even if a fixed handwashing location exists, soap and water for washing hands
                                                         must be present in order to allow the behavior to occur. The presence of water at
     handwashing place,                                  a fixed handwashing place has been found to be independently associated with
                                                         reduced respiratory illness risk in a low-income urban setting (Luby and Hal-
     particularly inside or in                           der 2008). A number of observational studies demonstrate lower risk of diar-
     close proximity to the toilet                       rhea among households with soap observed anywhere in the home, compared
                                                         to households without soap (DuBois et al. 2006; Peterson et al. 1998). An in-
     facility, may provide a useful                      vestigation in western Kenya also found that the presence of soap in the home
                                                         is associated with a lower risk of respiratory illness (Kamm et al. 2011). Unlike
     visual cue to stimulate                             Vietnam, where most households were found to have soap and water present
                                                         at a post-defecation handwashing place, far lower proportions of households in
     handwashing behavior.
                                                         Peru and Senegal were found to have soap and water at that place. Water was
                                                         more commonly present at either fixed handwashing location than was soap. It
                                                         is notable that large proportions of households that designated places for wash-
                                                         ing hands after defecation and before food preparation kept both soap and water
                                                         at those locations. This suggests that the practice of designating a handwashing
                                                         location may contribute to building a handwashing habit at these critical times.

                                                         before food preparation, awareness of the importance or at least the social desir-
                                                         ability of handwashing appears to be greater for washing hands after fecal contact
                                                         than before food preparation. Recent work from Bangladesh suggests that hand-
                                                         washing with soap before food preparation is associated with a decreased risk of
                                                         child diarrhea (Luby et al. 2011), indicating the importance of increasing aware-
                                                         ness around handwashing at this critical time.

                                                         Self-reported handwashing behavior has been found repeatedly to overestimate
                                                         observed handwashing behavior (Biran et al. 2008; Manun’Ebo et al. 1997;
                                                         Stanton et al. 1987). Here too, this phenomenon was found, with 62 percent
                                                         of Peru caregivers reporting having washed hands at least once following fecal
                                                         contact during the day preceding intervention; in contrast, during structured
                                                         observation, only 40 percent of Peru caregivers observed at a fecal contact event
                                                         washed hands with soap. In Senegal, although the observed and reported fre-
                                                         quencies of handwashing after fecal contact were similar, they differed somewhat
                                                         with respect to food preparation. Even behavior during structured observation is
                                                         probably subject to reactivity based on the presence of the observer (Ram et al.
                                                         2010). Self-report and behavior displayed during observation are likely subject
                                                         to the respondent’s awareness of social norms around handwashing behavior, as
                                                         observed in high- and low-income settings (Ram et al. 2010; Pedersen et al. 1986;
                                                         Drankiewicz and Dundes 2003; Munger and Harris 1989). Awareness of a social

                                                         observer, may be useful to improve that behavior. For example, the Community-
