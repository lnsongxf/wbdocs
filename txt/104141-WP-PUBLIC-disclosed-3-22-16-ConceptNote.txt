The purpose of this learning product 1 is to deepen the understanding of factors that drive the
effectiveness of World Bank efforts for improving the financial sustainability of the electricity
sector in client countries. The report is based mainly on existing IEG sector and project level
evaluations on the subject -- specifically Development Policy Operations and Specific Investment
Loans with financial covenants, and/or financial sustainability components -- supplemented by a
targeted literature survey.

Background and Context

1.       About 1.1 billion people around the world, mostly poor, lack access to electricity, holding
them back from the potential for human development and quality of life that can result from such
connectivity. In Sub-Saharan Africa alone there are over 600 million people without electricity 2,
and this figure may rise significantly if the pace of new electricity connections remains at the
average rate experienced during the ten year period 2005-2014, and population growth is taken
into account. 3 Against this background, the World Bank Group has joined the United Nations in
the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative, which seeks to achieve universal access to
energy by 2030, along with improving energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. This
initiative is reinforced by the Sustainable Development Goal 7 – “ensure access to affordable,
reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” – and the WBG’s goals of reducing extreme
poverty and increasing shared prosperity.

2.     Maintaining the financial viability of the electricity sector is essential for the provision of
adequate and reliable electricity services, regardless of whether the service delivery agents are
under public or private ownership. Financial viability entails the ability to generate sufficient
income to meet operating payments and debt commitments, and to allow for growth while also
maintaining service standards. Several World Bank government clients regulate electricity
services and set retail tariffs below full cost recovery (operating costs and capital costs), citing
concern about the affordability of service for the poor, and often without provision of adequate
and timely subsidies from the Government to cover the financing gaps of the service providers..
Inadequate revenues limit the ability to make needed investments on a timely basis for access
expansion (generation, transmission, and distribution) and to support required operations

maintenance. In time, these factors lead to the progressive deterioration of service reliability and
performance efficiency, including technical and nontechnical losses, extended service restoration
times after outages, chronic power supply inadequacy from insufficient generation capacity, and
downgraded performance of existing generation plants. Clearly, political economy and fiscal
limitations play a key role in determining level of tariffs and subsides.

3.      The “Directions Paper” 4 (2013) for the Energy Sector highlights the WBG’s support for
ensuring efficient, financially sound sectoral performance and its contribution to equitable
economic development. It states that the WBG will help address underpricing, revenue under-
collections, protection offered to inefficient parastatal energy monopolies, large technical and
commercial losses, and weak regulatory frameworks and capacity.


World Bank Support for financial viability of the electricity sector

5.     World Bank (IBRD and IDA) support for the financial sustainability at the sector level
has been delivered primarily through development policy operations (DPOs), and financial
covenants accompanying investment lending through Specific Investment Loans (SILs),
supplemented by analytical and advisory activities. These interventions relate mainly to grid-
based electricity. Off-grid electrification has gradually increased in importance in the last two
decades, and several models of service delivery have been employed, outside of the electricity
grid. The financial viability of off-grid electricity services is covered in a separate learning
product being prepared by IEG during FY16. 5

6.      DPOs provide quick-disbursing budget support to governments for achieving specific
policy and institutional reforms – typically drawn from the government’s reform program – that
are considered critical to achieving sustainable improvements in the sector’s financial
performance. All DPOs require prior actions, which are reform measures to be fulfilled by the
government before the operation is approved and the funds disbursed. Prior actions in support of
sector reforms tend to focus on the adoption of cost-recovery tariffs, payments collection, and
reduction of commercial losses, cost rationalization, and government subsidy transfers. The use
of legal covenants for tariff-setting, though once prevalent, are much less frequently used now.
The use of financial covenants in investment lending is generally restricted to standard financial
ratios and payments collection and loss reduction.

7.      The World Bank funded 28 DPOs in 13 countries during FY2000–2016 that addressed
the electricity sector alone or in combination with other sectors. They represented total
commitments of $6.6 billion, of which $5 billion was for actions related to the electricity sector.

Most of the DPOs were in high- and universal-access countries. Only three DPOs were in low-
access countries, accounting for $87 million in commitments for the electricity sector. Seventeen
of the DPOs belonged to programmatic series of two or more sequenced operations, and the rest
were one-off interventions. (See Annex 1 for the list of DPOs) In most DPOs, financial viability
or sustainability of the electricity sector (or national utility) was explicitly included as a
development objective, but almost all DPOs contained key performance indicators related to
sector financial performance. 6

9.       In the past, under many Bank-funded investment projects, particularly those implemented
in the 1990s and early 2000s, the typical approach was to combine specific investment lending
with sector reform conditionality, including measures intended to improve financial performance
(tariff adjustment, payment collections, commercialization, privatization, etc.). The use of this
approach has declined considerably since then. The main reasons are that the binding of
investments and policy reforms did not have a generally good record in supporting sustainable
performance-enhancing reforms for a variety of reasons, including a lack of strong government
political commitment to address the underpricing of power or rampant nonpayment. Also, policy
and investment activities often operate on such different timelines, and with different
stakeholders, that it may be unwieldy to bind them together too closely. However, there are
some significant instances of projects approved in the last 10-15 years that have attempted to
combine specific investment lending with elements of sector reform relating to financial
sustainability. Among these are the Kazakhstan Electricity Transmission Rehabilitation Project
(P065414: FY2000-2009), the Senegal Electricity Sector Efficiency Project (P073477: FY2005-
11), and the Vietnam System Efficiency Improvement, Equitization, and Renewable Energy
Project (P066396; FY2002-2013)

Rationale for the Learning Product
10.     The IEG Evaluation of the World Bank Group’s Support for Electricity Access (2015) 7
recognized financial viability of the electricity sector as one of the key drivers of performance
towards universal electricity access, implying that countries that have transitioned to
High/Universal access 8 from Low/Medium access levels, ensured the financial sustainability of
power companies through a variety of means including the adoption of rational electricity tariffs
and well-designed subsidy policies. In its Results Framework for Electricity Access, financial
viability is indicated as one of the main intermediate sector outcomes affecting adequate and
reliable access. (Figure 1). The related evaluation question posed was to what extent has the
WBG been effective in supporting a viable electricity sector in client countries through lending,
policy support, and advice.

11.     Against this background, an in-depth examination of the financial sustainability aspect
from a more focused perspective by stocktaking of evaluative lessons and findings on what
works or has not in specific country and institutional contexts, is expected to be of considerable
value informing both strategy and operations going forward for the WBG to support client
countries in moving towards financially sustainable electricity sectors.


Learning Product Objective and Methodology
12.     The purpose of this learning product is to inform World Bank strategy and operations in
their support to client countries for improving the financial sustainability of their electricity
sectors.

13.     The findings and lessons relate to the following issues that have been raised collectively
in the IEG sector and project-level evaluations:

       •     To what extent has the World Bank in its country partnership strategies, identified
             issues and strategies for supporting the financial viability of the electricity sector in
             client countries?
       •     To what extent do DPOs and SILs adequately identify and address the drivers of poor
             sector finances including political economy aspects?


                                                            4
       •   To what extent have DPOs been effective in supporting client countries in improving
           the financial sustainability of their electricity sectors? In what manner have the
           design features of the DPOs (programmatic; stand-alone etc.) influenced the
           outcomes of the operations.
       •   To what extent have components in SILs, including financial covenants. been
           effective in improving financial sustainability.
       •   To what extent improvements in financial viability as a result of WB support have
           been sustained following loan/credit closures.

14.     The learning product will draw upon IEG evaluations of (DPOs) and SILs with
components that aim to support financial sustainability at the sector level, or related financial
covenants, approved and completed during the period FY2000-2016, covering ICR reviews,
Project Performance Assessment Reports (Annex 2), and sector evaluations. The study will
draw upon and update the detailed background information and analysis compiled for IEG’s
recent evaluation of the World Bank Group’s Support for Electricity Access (2015). The study
will also include a literature review, incorporating findings from the WBG’s research papers,
publications and other economic and sector work including non-lending technical assistance
reports; as well as relevant literature from development partners, donors and academic journals
on financial sustainability issues in the electricity sector. Relevant examples will be elaborated to
present success factors considering the specificity and political economy situation of the
countries involved. Portfolio analysis will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the World
Bank operations (IDA and IBRD) on financial sustainability. In addition, financial performance
of national utilities in 40 countries, to the extent possible, will be assessed during 2000-2015 in
order to see how their financial performance evolved over time. Findings from previous IEG
assessments on DPOs will also be drawn upon where relevant.

15.     Members of the IEG team for this study will meet with representative staff and
management of the Energy & Extractives GP working on financial sustainability issues in the
electricity sector, to confirm the findings and lessons. The study draft will be sent for comments
and discussed with the GP before being finalized and submitted to the Board’s Committee on
Development Effectiveness (CODE).

16.    Quality Assurance and Peer Review. Quality Assurance of the concept paper will be
handled internally through the IEG Methods Advisor, Department Heads, and IEG Management.
The concept paper will be peer reviewed by Sheoli Pargal, Lead Energy Economist, and Sunil
Mathrani, Senior Energy Specialist, who together bring strong research and operational
experience the electricity sector. They are also requested to peer review the final learning
product.

Dissemination
17.     The main audience for this learning product is the Global Practice for Energy and
Extractives. Energy practices in other multilateral development banks and bilateral donors may
also find this to be of interest to their own activities in the electricity sector. After the standard
process of review and comments from the Bank management, the learning product will be
disclosed as per regular procedure. IEG will actively engage with the Bank management in
internalizing the lessons and findings from the final report. The report will be disseminated
through the IEG website, and through presentations at appropriate forums.
