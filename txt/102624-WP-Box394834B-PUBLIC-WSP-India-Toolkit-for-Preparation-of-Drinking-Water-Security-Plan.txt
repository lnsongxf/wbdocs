                                                 Foreword

The Government of India along with the States and Union Territories has been focussing on ensuring safe
drinking water supply to the rural communities from 1972-73 onwards through various national rural drinking
water supply programmes. Being a vast and diverse country, India is facing many challenges in ensuring reliable
and safe drinking water on a sustainable basis.

The Government of India—subscribing to the statement—‘It is difficult to manage what is not measured’,
has been developing its Drinking Water Security Plan with an inventory of drinking water resources, systems,
institutional arrangements, energy charges, sanitation aspects, etc., in an integrated participatory way under its
pilot project National Drinking Water Security Pilot Project (NDWSPP).

There is a need for a holistic and participatory planning approach, with clear guidance on institutional roles and
responsibilities and financing to address issues on sustainability.

Gram Panchayats and Village Water and Sanitation Committees need to prepare Drinking Water Security
Plans which address source sustainability, water quality (both bacteriological and chemical), operation and
maintenance issues, as well as provisions for replacement and expansion.

This Toolkit has been prepared for use by support agencies, field level engineers, Gram Panchayat secretaries,
Panchayat development officers, etc., who can facilitate the preparation of drinking water security plans using
the necessary tools, techniques and templates to ensure that a systematic, step-by-step approach is adopted
throughout the process.

This document, Toolkit for the Preparation of a Drinking Water Security Plan, has been prepared in
association with the Water and Sanitation Program with inputs from the user community, Gram Panchayats,
State Nodal Officers and Support Organisations.

We acknowledge the inputs provided by Nodal Officers, Support Organisations and Gram Panchayat functionaries.
I wish to place on record our appreciation for associating with us and bringing out this Toolkit.

3.2.3 VWSC Formation/Strengthening (Activity Code 3)




  The VWSC is a standing committee of the GP responsible for planning, implementation, O&M and
  management of the village DWSP. The VWSC is responsible for:
  a Collecting household contributions and user fees
  a Opening and managing a bank account
  a Preparing the annual budget and recommendations for user fee charges
  a Encouraging people to be vigilant about not wasting water and keeping water clean
  a Ensuring professional support for hand pump caretakers and piped water supply operators.
  It is important to check whether a VWSC has already been set up in the habitations under
  earlier programmes.
  In the event that a VWSC exists and is active, it is a good idea to invite its members to participate
  in the water security programme. If it is not active, focus on the possibilities of reviving it. If a VWSC
  has never been established, consider setting one up under the aegis of the Gram Sabha.

     3.2.4 Participatory Rural Appraisal (Activity Code C-4)




       What is Participatory Rural Appraisal?
       Appraisal: The first stage in any project, to elicit information about the problems, needs and
       potential in a project area.

       Participatory: People’s involvement in the process—a “bottom-up” approach requiring good
       communication skills and attitudes by project staff.

       Rural: The techniques can, in fact, be used in any situation, whether rural or urban.

       The PRA tool is a technique for enabling local communities to conduct their own analysis and to plan
       and take appropriate action. The PRA involves project staff learning about the village together with
       the villagers themselves. The aim of the PRA is to help strengthen the capacity of villagers to plan,
       make decisions and to take action towards improving their own situation.

       The PRA materials suggested for preparing the DWSP are:
       a A social map
       a A water resource map
       a A water timeline (historical map)
       a Seasonality information (water availability and diseases)
       a CLTS




     3.2.4.1 Social Mapping (Activity Code C-4.1)




       Social mapping is a PRA tool used to present information on village layout, infrastructure,
       demography, ethno-linguistic groups, etc.
       After completing the social mapping, a more detailed survey and Focussed Group Discussion (FGD)
       could also take place to follow up on specific thematic areas, such as population, water demand,
       sanitation, health, education, etc.

     Box 3.1. Social Map—A Dynamic Monitoring Tool

       Map on Cloth and Bindi Method
       In most cases, the social map is transferred onto brown or white paper and retained in the
       corresponding village file kept by the SO/NGO and will soon be forgotten.


       It is, therefore, important to transfer the social map onto white cloth (A3 size) to ensure its durability
       and usefulness as a monitoring aid. A social map on cloth could be used subsequently at VWSC
       meetings for discussions. Using different coloured bindis to denote household status is a useful aid
       to monitoring.

3.2.4.2 Water Resource Mapping (Activity Code C-4.2)




  The village water resource map is a tool to help us learn about the community and its water
  resource base.

  A need exists to understand and value traditional management and livelihood systems, indigenous
  technologies, and the ways in which people feel, see, think and act in the project area, and their
  reasons for doing so. The main aim should be to focus on relationships rather than on any single
  event, feature or activity. This enhances participation and the generation of information and ideas.

  The village map is a good tool to begin with. It is easy and fun for the villagers to make. It helps
  initiate discussion among community members and with the facilitating team. The map can
  display water sites and sources, agricultural plots (locations and crop varieties), soil types, slopes,
  elevations, woodland, grazing areas, etc.

3.2.4.3: Timeline (Activity Code C-4.3)




   A chronology of events referring to the evolution of the village, agricultural practices, availability of
   water and fluctuations in the groundwater table is prepared based on the consultation process.

   The timeline is a list of key events, changes and landmarks in the past, presented in chronological
   order. This is often a useful way of putting an individual’s or community’s history into perspective by
   identifying the broad framework of events which shaped its past.

   It is a way of charting trends, showing how past events led to present situations and illustrating
   recurring themes. A timeline is constructed by looking back over a given period and mapping critical
   events to do with water and agriculture. This provides an opportunity to discuss who was present at
   that particular time, what happened and why, what were the factors that contributed to the event. In
   addition, can key trends be observed? What are they? Which key trends can be expected to recur in
   the future?

3.2.4.5 Community-Led Total Sanitation (Activity Code C-4.5)




  CLTS is an innovative methodology for mobilising communities to eliminate open defecation
  (OD) completely.
  Communities are encouraged with the help of a facilitator to conduct their own appraisal and
  analysis of OD and take action themselves to become ODF.
  CLTS focusses on the behavioural changes needed to ensure real and sustainable
  improvement: investing in community mobilisation instead of hardware, and shifting the focus
  from toilet construction for individual households to the creation of ODF villages.
  By raising awareness that, when even a minority of inhabitants continues to defecate in the
  open, everyone is at risk of disease, CLTS triggers the community’s desire for collective
  behaviour change, spurs people into action and encourages innovation, mutual support and
  appropriate local solutions, thus leading to greater ownership and sustainability.

     3.2.5 Water Transect—Walk from Source to Users (Activity Code C-5)




        The Water Transect, involving a walk from source to users, is a tool for onsite assessment of the
        water source, relevant equipment, O&M of facilities and monitoring compliance with the public
        water system.
        The Source to User Water Transect also provides an opportunity to educate community members
        about water safety at the water source, transport main, reservoir and in the distribution system.
        It is a technique that records visible faults and deficiencies that could lead to the pollution of
        drinking water. It combines physical observation and reference to the checklists.
        Involving women in the Water Transect may throw light on some new issues that have never
        been considered previously.

     3.2.6 Establishment of Rain Gauge Station (Activity Code C-6)




        Rain is a Primary Source of Water
        Since rainfall, the number of rainy days and the duration of rain occurrence vary from GP to GP
        (or rather village to village), each GP needs to acquire knowledge about its own rainfall pattern.

        After the rainy season, heavy rainfall is rare. Rainwater is retained in nature by vegetation, soil,
        and underground water pore spaces inside rocks and decomposed rock.

        Although rainfall may occur only for few days a year, the biological world sustains the whole
        year. Modern agricultural practices have radically changed the traditional way of life in the
        villages and the choice of crops, horticulture, livestock rearing. etc., can be reformulated at
        GP/village level to ensure water availability throughout the year.

        The water security plan is primarily based on GP/village-specific rainfall data corresponding to
        the year for which water budget estimates are carried out. It is therefore appropriate to establish
        a GP-level rain gauge station.

        The rain gauge stations are non-automatic and VWSC members, GP functionaries and
        volunteers need to be trained in the use of rainfall recording devices.

        At least one rain gauge station needs to be established per GP project.

     Electric Measuring Tape
     Electric measuring tapes typically consist of a
     pair of insulated wires whose exposed ends
     are separated by an air gap in an electrode and
     contain a source of power in the circuit such as
     flashlight batteries. When the electrode comes
     into contact with the water surface, a current
     flows through the tape circuit indicated by an
     ammeter-needle deflection, a light and/or an
     audible signal.

     The “hold” depth against the reference point
     on the well is read directly from the tape as
     depth to water. Because the tape medium
     might be easily bent and the weight is often
     less than that used on steel tapes, electric tapes
     are considered less accurate. The tape can be
     calibrated against a steel tape, and if several
     electric tapes are used in a study, they should all
     be calibrated against a steel reference tape.

     All the brands work on the same principle, with
     a liquid-sensitive probe. When the probe comes
     in contact with water or liquid, the electronic
     circuit is completed and a ‘beep’ is generated,
     indicating contact.

     The following procedure is recommended:
     1. The time elapsed since last pumping is noted.
     2. The water-level indicator (WLI) is opened and
        checked to see if functional.
     3. If the WLI is functional, the probe with the
        measuring cable is slowly lowered into
        the well.
     4. Lowering is stopped once the ‘beep’
        is heard.
     5. The measuring cable is slightly lifted and
        jerked, before lowering it again.
     6. The jerking and lowering is repeated twice or
        thrice to ensure that the exact still water level
        is represented.
     7. The reading on the measuring cable is noted.         9. Just before the power is switched off or 	
     8. Subsequently the well is pumped                         expected to be cut, the pumping water level is
        continuously for at least two hours.                    noted, by repeating the above steps.

     3.2.8 Water Budget (Activity Code C-8)




        A water budget is a tool for understanding and accounting for the movement and uses of water
        on, through and below the earth’s surface.

        The budget should take into account the following questions:

        a	   Where is the water? Where are the hydrologic elements located in the watershed?

        a	   How does the water move between these hydrologic elements? What are the pathways
             through which water travels?

        a	   Where are water users located and how much water are they using?

        a	   What are the trends? Are water levels declining, increasing or constant?

        Water budget (WB) = Total water available (A) – Total water demand (B)

        The water budget estimates provide a useful understanding of the demand for drinking
        water in the GP/block compared to total water demand. The results of the water budget
        estimate will not make a difference in the water supply situation unless they are properly
        understood and followed up by the required changes in water use practices.

3.2.8.1 Assessment of Water Availability
The primary source of water is rainfall.

The estimation of total rainfall received over the entire area is based on the total area and total
rainwater received over that area. The amount of rainwater will be stored on the surface in ponds,
lakes and reservoirs and some of it as groundwater.

The water availability in the project area should       recharge. Both the village’s and agricultural areas
be assessed based on the ground and surface             must be computed to arrive at the total annual
water available.                                        groundwater recharge, estimated according to:

     In areas where irrigation demand exceeds availability and affects the drinking water supply, suitable
     corrective measures in crop choice and seasons for specific crops need to be developed on a participatory
     basis, involving all the stakeholders in order to enforce this on an annual basis through social regulation.

b. Domestic water demand
Domestic water demand consists of water for human and livestock consumption, and maintenance.
The demand from local institutions such as schools, Anganwadis (including water for sanitary facilities),
Primary Health Centres (PHCs), market places, offices and public places, also needs to be taken
into account.

c. Industrial and/or other water demand
Water demands by industries, livelihood enterprises such as dhobi ghat, tanning, fibre extraction, pottery,
etc., and for other needs (e.g., cremation grounds) within the village limits, need to be assessed to
quantify the village water demand.

Type                                                    Standard Unit
Human consumption (includes drinking water,             55 litres per capita per day (lpcd) (assuming 50%
domestic use)                                           population has house connection with
                                                        70 lpcd and others with 40 lpcd)
Livestock (includes buffaloes, cows and oxen)           30 litres per day (lpd)
Small ruminants (goats, sheep, etc.)                    20 lpd
Schools and Anganwadis                                  10 lpd
Offices, markets and public places                      5,000 to 10,000 lpd depending
                                                        upon activities
Total domestic water demand per day will be the sum total of the above. This will be multiplied
by 365 days to arrive at the annual water demand.

Total water demand of the village per annum = Domestic + Irrigation + Other water needs

Projected water balance

Water balance can be further analysed based on the available water versus total water demand.

     3.2.9 Women’s Meeting (Activity Code C-9)




        Women’s SHGs are increasingly seeking a more vibrant role in village programmes and are
        participating more in village development activities. All SHGs of a habitation generally come
        together as a village-level organisation or federation. This provides an opportunity for involving
        women in village development activities. Women’s inputs for developing a DWSP are crucial,
        given that women are the undisputed managers of domestic water. Following the village survey
        and water demand assessment, it is vital to share the survey and water supply/demand result in
        the village with women’s groups. This will also help to obtain the necessary inputs.

        Women’s meetings to update the water budget may be organised as a separate meeting or form
        part of their monthly meeting. Water demand, water security issues, distribution of water supply
        to all areas and issues such as user charges and their collection should be discussed.

     3.2.11 Cross Visit (Activity Code C-11)




        The cross visit is an important part of the project in which the team gets an opportunity to
        observe and learn from other communities’ development activities. Exposure visits also help
        considerably to boost skills. This cross visit programme aims to enhance participants’ knowledge
        through exposure to the best DWSP practices. Cross visits are organised so that people living
        in one place can visit another location to observe and learn by direct interaction from another
        community’s relevant activities outside their own community. Participating communities may be
        located quite near one another (within the district) or some way off (in another district).

     4.1 Implementation Stage




        Implementation and monitoring are important components of the DWSP. The roles of users/
        primary stakeholders are usually limited to the planning stage and implementation agencies
        take over the physical implementation of the plan with limited/no community participation during
        actual physical implementation. This can hamper the efforts of the support agencies/BRCs
        during the planning stage from empowering the respective GP and VWSC.

        Therefore, it is vitally important to ensure that the participating GP/VWSC is involved at the
        implementation stage either through direct involvement or through the various implementation
        and monitoring sensitisation programmes.



     As envisaged in the concept note, the roles and responsibilities of the relevant agencies are as shown
     in Table 4.1.

4.1.3 Operation and Maintenance (Activity Code I-3)




   The sustainability of small piped water supply systems in rural areas is critical for securing improved
   service delivery over the long term. The main emphasis of the GoI’s NRDWP is therefore on
   source and system sustainability. Source sustainability depends on various factors. However, water
   conservation is one of the important aspects of source sustainability. System sustainability relies on
   adequate O&M, in both technical and financial terms.

   Any project intervention to achieve a DWSP is incomplete without addressing the issue of Non
   Revenue Water (NRW). This is water that has been produced and “lost” before it reaches the
   customer. Losses can be ‘real’ (leaks, which are occasionally referred to as physical losses) or
   ‘apparent’ (e.g., through theft or metering inaccuracies). High levels of NRW are detrimental to
   the financial viability of water utilities, as well as to the quality of the water itself. NRW is typically
   measured as the volume of water ‘lost’ as a share of net water produced.

   As observed in the concept note, “it is difficult to manage what is not measured”. In most rural
   drinking water systems, water is not measured or metered, leading to loss of water and revenue,
   and thus affecting source and financial sustainability.

   Drinking water security programmes should aim to measure the amount of water supplied and
   design an appropriate programme to conserve drinking water.

                is proposed for dealing with rural drinking
                water supply in future years. The sector’s
                human and financial requirements, including
                for O&M, are likely to increase significantly
                against a background of increasing and broad
                concern regarding the O&M of the existing
                infrastructure. Unless these problems are
                addressed, it is likely that the significant
                future investments proposed in the sector
                will be at risk. There is a case, therefore, for
                exploring alternative O&M options that can
                ensure appropriate and timely preventive and
                corrective O&M by using dedicated, qualified
                staff at reasonable cost. Such alternatives,
                particularly mobilised through non-state
                providers, are already being considered in
                some states and the experiences to date are
                described in this document.

l	How does the water move between these hydrologic elements? What are the pathways
  through which the water travels?
l	Where are water users located and how much water are they using?
l	Future trends? Are water levels declining, increasing or remaining constant? The
  supply/demand gap should be clearly emphasised.
