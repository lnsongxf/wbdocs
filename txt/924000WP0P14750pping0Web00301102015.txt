EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


WEATHER RISK IN AGRICULTURE:
OCCURRENCE, IMPACTS, AND
VULNERABILITY
Productivity in the agricultural sector is inherently dependent on weather, such as
variations in rainfall and temperature. As a result, weather risk events can cause losses
in yield and production that translate into economic losses for producers, as well as
other sector stakeholders that depend on income from agricultural trade, transport,
processing, or export. Extreme temperatures, ﬂoods, droughts, hailstorm, and wind-
storms are just a few examples of weather risk events that cause major economic
losses. In developing countries, weather risk is especially signiﬁcant due to the impor-
tance of the agricultural sector in the overall economy and its contribution to house-
hold food security. Up to 90 percent of the population in many developing countries
relies on agriculture for a living, since the sector is the primary source of income,
employment, and food. Absent eﬀective risk management strategies, weather shocks
to agriculture in these countries have far-reaching eﬀects on wellbeing, development,
and poverty reduction.

Developing countries also tend to be more vulnerable to weather risks owing to
factors that constrain stakeholders’ abilities to manage risk. Since households and
companies involved in agriculture typically operate with a low level of assets and
lack access to well-developed insurance and credit markets, their risk management
strategies are limited compared with stakeholders in developed countries. An addi-
tional constraint is that weather risk occurrence tends to aﬀect households and
businesses in the same community, minimizing the eﬀectiveness of traditional cop-
ing mechanisms, such as loans or gifts from family members, on which rural com-
munities rely.

At the same time, the predicted impacts of climate change have only increased the
importance of eﬀectively managing weather risk. As a result of global warming,
extreme weather events are expected to become more frequent and more intense.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
The increasing variety of publications related to practical geospatial applications to ana-
lyze weather risks to the agricultural sector is currently overwhelming development prac-
titioners as to their nature and suitability for the purpose of informing agricultural risk
management decisions. This document strategically presents a variety of mapping tech-
niques for agricultural risk management and illustrates the application of these techniques
for informing public and private sector development strategies. The target group is devel-
opment practitioners that need to start incorporating these techniques into their analytical
framework to assess weather risks to investment projects. As with all guides, this document
is not comprehensive and does not intend to be, but it illustrates in a simpliﬁed way a num-
ber of current applications that are generally accepted for providing geo-referenced risk
information in the agricultural sector. Many of the example techniques are designed to be
cost eﬀective, automatable, scalable, and ﬂexible to support a variety of assessments and
decision-making frameworks. It is hoped that this introduction to risk mapping in agricul-
ture will illustrate a representative array of applications used today in various countries.

Making agricultural risk maps would be relatively simpler if reliable historical databases
of yields (spatially distributed) were available, as well as the causes of losses, and applied
management practices. Unfortunately, these databases are usually not available, relia-
ble, or suﬃciently comprehensive in developing countries. In addition, adaptation, miti-
gation, and management practices vary widely by geography and in response to stress.
Therefore, in order to estimate yields, the usual approach is yield simulation through
crop models, which try to emulate the response of the crop to climatological, man-
agement, and edaphological conditions (in short, how soils inﬂuence land use). Crop
models can reproduce the vulnerabilities of crops to hazards of interest, which usually
requires additional information like vulnerability functions. One additional challenge
is that for crops, unlike infrastructure (for example, buildings, homes, bridges), the vul-
nerability is a function of the crop stage. Therefore, robust agricultural risk mapping
requires an extensive range of simulations of diﬀerent crops, stages, and hazards, as
well as management responses, which at times can become very complex and laborious.

Risk management analyses can be classiﬁed by their target time horizon so it seems
also natural to classify agricultural mapping techniques by this criterion as well. Risk

AGROMETEOROLOGY AND MAPPING

AGROMETEOROLOGY
It is important to diﬀerentiate between the two central concepts of weather and cli-
mate. Weather refers to the atmospheric short-term conditions (hours, days, or weeks)
in a given place. Climate, on the other hand, refers to the expected conditions of the
weather. Climate is usually estimated as the average value of a given meteorologi-
cal variable (for example, precipitation, temperature). The weather is studied by the
meteorology, while the climate, by the climatology.

The factors that condition the climate in a given place include:
   1. Latitude
   2. Altitude
   3. Continentality
   4. Topography
   5. Vegetation
   6. Land and water distribution
   7. Soil type
   8. Sea currents

The climate and weather largely inﬂuence crop systems and their yields. Climate plays
a critical role in the determination of the more appropriate zones for agricultural
development. The three most important elements from the point of view of crop
development are: light, temperature, and precipitation. Additional variables such as
wind, hurricanes, and hail can be crucial in speciﬁc areas. Such elements, along with
carbon dioxide and oxygen, integrate the climatic and weather factors that drive agri-
cultural yield, and that are practically outside human control (excluding irrigation
accessibility). Additional factors that inﬂuence crop yields but that can be managed by
humans include: crop selection, farming practices, soil fertility, irrigation systems, and
control of plagues and diseases.

Agrometeorology is deﬁned as the science that investigates the relevant meteoro-
logical, bioclimatologic and hydrological conditions for the processes and elements

CHAPTER THREE
DATABASES AND CROP MODELS
If spatial databases of climate, yield, and the causes of losses were readily avail-
able, perhaps map-making for risk management would be a more straightforward
task. However, most developing countries lack reliable, consistent, or suﬃciently
extensive databases suitable for risk analysis. Therefore, risk analysis in these regions
relies partially in databases proxies and surveys. Yields, for example, have to be esti-
mated using crop models. In those cases, the issue of ﬁnding yield data is traded for
an issue of simulation, calibration, and ﬁnding models and input data appropriate
for the simulation of yield and the impact of hazards. Solving these issues is not an
easy task. Most developing countries, for example, do not have reliable, shareable,
and appropriate soil and climate databases suitable for crop models. However, there
is growing experience in the use of climate data proxies (for example, satellites and
reanalysis). Additionally, there are also national and global eﬀorts underway to map
agro-ecological resources. This information can be used along with crop models to
estimate yields for agricultural risk analysis. In this section, we describe public and
globally available climate, topography, and soil databases, as well as crop models.
Although the discussion is focused on proxies, it is important to understand that
developing countries may have useful databases. For example, most countries have
a network of weather stations. These observations are usually more reliable than
proxies, and they should be used whenever possible. However, the local databases
usually have low coverage, a good portion of missing data, or poor quality, so their
application can be very limited unless they are combined with other sources of
information, like proxies.

WEATHER AND CLIMATE
There are several types of weather proxies. In this section, we provide examples
derived from the following types: satellite, reanalysis, interpolation, and objective
analysis. Satellite proxies rely on observations from space, while reanalysis is based on
Numerical Weather Prediction Models (NWPM). Interpolation relies on observation,
while objective analysis combines a proxy (for example, satellites) with observation.

HISTORICAL ANALYSES
This section reviews risk-mapping analyses based on historical weather observations.
These mapping techniques usually target risk identiﬁcation and, ultimately, assess-
ment. Within this category, we include: climatologies, hazard and risk maps, climate
regionalizations and agro-ecological zoning. Climatologies are deﬁned as the expected
value of the weather for a given period and region. They are usually estimated as the
average value in the last 30 years. An annual climatology of precipitation, for example,
is the average annual cumulative precipitation for the last 30 years. There are also
climatologies associated with temperatures and other meteorological variables. Clima-
tologies are useful to have for a general idea of the climate in a given region, as they
oﬀer a snapshot of what has usually happened in the past 30 years or so.

Hazard and risk maps are similar to climatologies because they are also based on
historical information. However, in the case of hazard and risk maps, they usually try
to quantify intensity, probability of occurrence, or expected losses, while climatologies
are only an expression of the expected value of a given meteorological variable.

CLIMATOLOGIES
GLOBAL CLIMATOLOGIES FROM THE
CLIMATE RESEARCH UNIT
The Climate Research Unit (CRU) has developed climatologies at pixel sizes of 0.5°
(~55 km) and 10’ (~18 km). The dataset contains eight mean monthly and annual val-
ues of precipitation (1961–1990), wet-day frequency, temperature, diurnal temperature
range, relative humidity, sunshine duration, ground frost frequency and wind speed. The
dataset is created through the interpolation of station means. The data are available
through the International Water Management Institute World Water and Climate Atlas
(http://www.iwmi.org) and the Climatic Research Unit (http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk).
Figure 4.1 shows the world’s climatology of annual precipitation at the highest resolution.


NATIONAL CLIMATOLOGIES BASED ON GRIDDED DATASETS
Based on the gridded datasets developed using objective analysis techniques and
applied by the World Bank (see page 11), climatologies can be obtained averaging

with databases collected locally so the analysis is devel-

available. Besides, the World Bank has used a secondary
predictor from atmospheric models. These methodologies
are compared with independent sources. An additional
advantage over CRU, for example, is that these climatolo-
gies usually correspond to the average of the last 30 years
(for example, 1979–2009) while the latest climatologies
from CRU run from 1961–1990 so there is a signiﬁcant
delay in the update of these climatologies.

CHAPTER FIVE
DIAGNOSTIC AND FORECASTING ANALYSES
There are numerous mapping techniques for diagnostic and forecasting purposes.
Diagnostic techniques are designed to provide a technical description of the current
risk situation and its causes. Forecasts, on the other hand, predict potential risk events
based on the study and analysis of pertinent observations and simulations. They have
been included together in this chapter given that (1) many diagnostic techniques are
used to make decisions in the near future, (2) applied agrometeorological forecasting
techniques are still scarce, and (3) as the products become more sophisticated, the line
between diagnostic and forecast products becomes thinner. The mapping techniques
include, for example: monitors, outlooks, watches, warnings, and forecasts, which are
formally issued in bulletins. Monitors are based on continuous or periodic measure-
ments of existing, changing, agrometeorological conditions. Outlooks, watches and
warnings are issued to indicate the probability of a hazardous event. Their diﬀerence
is the likeliness that the event will occur. Outlooks have low certainty; watches, higher
certainty; and warnings, the highest. These techniques aim to provide information in
advance so stakeholders can prepare for hazardous events.

On the other hand, there are forecasts, which are the most likely prediction. In atmos-
pheric sciences, forecasts are classiﬁed in short- (up to 48 hours ahead), medium- (up
to 7 days), and long-term (more than seven days). Forecasts are classiﬁed in this way
partially because of the technical challenges associated with each lead time. Further-
more, as the lead time increases, the uncertainty increases. Short- and medium-range
forecasts can be particularly valuable for frosts and pests, for example, because risk
mitigation activities can be implemented to reduce losses. Seasonal (long-term) fore-
casts of precipitation, with lead times of a few months, can be particularly useful for
events such as drought. These forecasts usually indicate the probabilities of climate
anomalies of variables like precipitation and temperature (that is, probabilities of hav-
ing higher than usual precipitation). Finally, with Anthropogenic Climate Change,
additional analyses (scenarios), which have lead times of decades, have been broadly
developed. Such scenarios are a description of a possible future state for a given base-
line condition (for example, rate of emissions of greenhouse gases). Usually, a set of
scenarios is developed to reﬂect the range of uncertainty in projections.

CHAPTER SIX
AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES
Agro-ecological zoning divides an area of land into smaller units, which have simi-
lar characteristics related to land suitability, potential production, and environmental
impact (FAO/IIASA 1991). An agro-ecological zone (AEZ) is a mapping unit deﬁned
in terms of climate, soil, landform, and land cover with a speciﬁc range of potential
and constraints for land use. The FAO Agro-ecological Zones Project (FAO 1978–81)
was an early exercise in land evaluation at a continental scale. Results of the FAO AEZ
project include land suitability, potential production, and population support capacity
for 117 developing nations.

Agro-ecological zoning provides an assessment of the following issues:
   1. Distribution of land with diﬀerent potentials and constrains
   2. Response to improvements in inputs and management
   3. Balance between population demand and land availability
   4. Land use recommendations

In terms of land use recommendations, they beneﬁt from policy formulations that
include:
     1. Speciﬁc extension support
     2. Speciﬁc inputs and relief programs
     3. Established research priorities
     4. Deﬁned development programs

The regionalization process depends on the information available, modeling capabilities,
and objectives. Therefore, the methodologies applied regionally can have diﬀerences.
However, in this section, we attempt to list and describe the common stages and order

WORLD BANK CASE OF STUDY: AGRO-
ECOLOGICAL ZONING IN MOZAMBIQUE9

OBJECTIVES
The overarching aim of this project was to develop initial analysis and mapping
products to begin to build a framework for addressing agricultural risks from adverse
weather and climate variability. A central goal was to identify crop risks from weather
and map vulnerability.

The technical objectives were:
   1. Map climate and agroclimate zones
   2. Characterize crop suitability for major cash and food crops
   3. Assess crop vulnerability to weather conditions
   4. Carry out a ﬁeld campaign to integrate calibration information

METHODOLOGY
The methodology is, in general terms, in agreement with the general steps described in
chapter 6. The following tasks were performed: (1) mapped climatic and agro-climatic
zones based on remote sensing and geographic methods, (2) compiled agronomic and
bioclimate datasets for use with Geographic Information Science (GISc) and biogeo-
chemical modeling to generate crop suitability indices, (3) modeled yields of major
cash and food crops using climate scenarios to generate crop vulnerability indices and
risk maps, and (4) carried out ﬁeld validation and surveys and iteratively utilized feed-
back to improve the precision of the crop risk maps.

COMPILATION OF LAND RESOURCES
Satellite-observed rainfall and temperature data were obtained and analyzed to map
spatiotemporal trends and homogenous weather and agroclimate zones. Precipitation

CHAPTER EIGHT
CONCLUSIONS
As stated at the introduction to this document, agro-ecological zoning and, conse-
quently, weather risk mapping are becoming increasingly useful techniques in the
design of agricultural risk management strategies, and in guiding informed invest-
ment decisions. However, the proliferation of diﬀerent applications and the attendant
degree of sophistication are making it increasingly diﬃcult for development practi-
tioners to keep abreast of current developments. This overview of agriculture risk
mapping techniques aims to serve as an illustrative introduction of the current state of
knowledge and practice.

There are an increasing number of approaches and models to design risk mappings
in agriculture. These are becoming rather complex, given the challenges in modeling
the behavior of living plants as they are submitted to various weather conditions. Suc-
cess in achieving accurate results largely depends on the quality of the data used, the
predicting ability of the models, and the chosen time horizon. Scientists and organiza-
tions are undertaking serious eﬀorts to improve the predictability of the applications,
hopefully leading to a rapid evolution of such applications in the near future.

This document oﬀers a deliberately circumscribed illustration of the various methods
that are available, as well as the sources of data that can be used with some degree
of conﬁdence, and those products that are highly valuable for the purposes they were
designed to serve. The picture that emerges is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully it
captures the array of applications in the agricultural sector.

The authors hope that this document will help those development practitioners inter-
ested in this subject become familiar with the technical aspects involved in the design
of these products, and their potential practical uses.

EXAMPLE OF TERMS OF REFERENCE
FOR AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES

INTRODUCTION
These terms of reference detail the objectives, scope of work, and products for hiring
a consulting ﬁrm (the Firm) to conduct a risk mapping assessment of the agricultural
sector. The ﬁndings of the tasks detailed here will serve as inputs for the Government
of Mozambique (GOM) for the structuring of a risk management strategy to protect
small farmers. Findings of this exercise will also be used by the donor community to
identify possible areas of development investment opportunities to promote agricul-
tural productivity.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
The Agricultural Risk Management Team (ARMT) of the Agriculture and Rural
Development Department (ARD) of the World Bank has agreed with the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) of Mozambique to provide technical assistance in various aspects
related to agriculture risk management. The technical assistance that the World Bank
is planning to provide to the MOA needs to serve as the basis for the government and
private sectors to identify and put in place measures to start managing agricultural
risks in a more informed manner and under an agreed framework.

The Agricultural Census 2008 (TIA 2008) shows that farmers face production risks
related to ﬂoods, droughts, cyclones, and wild animals, and it provides some dimen-
sion of importance for various agricultural regions. It does not, however, delve into the
details to specify those risks by crops. A recent risk assessment on the cotton supply
chain also revealed that pest and diseases are important risks facing smallholder farm-
ing in the country. Despite the recognized importance of identiﬁed production risks,
preliminary discussions with various stakeholders in the agricultural sector revealed
that there is hardly any technical analysis done in risk identiﬁcation and risk exposure
in agriculture, nor any systematic attempt at quantifying the losses produced by the
occurrences of those risks. This situation makes it diﬃcult for the authorities and even
the private sector to begin introducing appropriate risk management practices.

FOR GRIDDED ANALYSES OF
METEOROLOGICAL VARIABLES

BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION
OF THE CONSULTANCY
Guided by their technical experience the Consultant must (1) assess the feasibility and
(2) create a gridded (that is, mesh-based) product of rainfall, maximum and mini-
mum temperature, potential evapotranspiration (Hargreaves), and relative humidity
in Nicaragua that could be used by the local insurance industry there to develop an
index-based weather insurance market for agriculture.

The objective of such a product would be to enable better risk mapping and greater
access to risk transfer products in areas with inadequate weather infrastructure. The
Consultant should assess the feasibility of creating the data grid to address these spe-
ciﬁc needs, outlining the steps that would be required to produce such a product if
considered feasible. The methodology to assess this feasibility and ultimately to create
such a product should be based, but not limited to, the methodology already used
to develop a gridded climatological database for index-based insurance purposes in
Mexico (Cressman 1959).

The consultant will assess the feasibility of creating gridded weather data products in
Nicaragua (a feasibility study has already been developed for Guatemala and Hon-
duras) based on a blend of existing station data and existing gridded data products
(for example, NARR, NOAA’s Climate Prediction Centre datasets, the NCEP/NCAR
Reanalysis) to support the weather station-based data observations, and on the perfor-
mance of a quality control process to weather datasets. The Consultant must describe
the steps that would be required to perform a quality control process and to identify
valid records for Nicaragua weather datasets. The methodology to be applied for the
detection of discrepancies on climate datasets and a consistent weather datasets, based
