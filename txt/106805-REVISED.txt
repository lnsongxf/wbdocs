Executive summary

Introduction

Addressing the need for fecal sludge management (FSM) from on-site sanitation systems is critical
to improving sanitation in poor urban settlements. A preliminary review of the status of FSM in 12
cities, using secondary data, adopted certain diagnostic tools and proposed that others be
developed further (Peal et al, 2014). This study has since been built on by further World Bank work
using extensive primary data from five cities (Balikpapan, Dhaka, Hawassa, Lima and Santa Cruz).
Using the field data, a series of diagnostic and decision-support tools have been developed to
guide FSM intervention options in the context of the economic and political economy reality.

This report describes diagnostic and decision-support tools to guide the improvement of FSM
services. It also advises how to use them, with links to a number of other resources. Related
documents include (i) a summary report on the tools, and experiences of using them in the context
of five city case studies, and (ii) the data collection protocols and instruments and (iii) terms of
reference.

The tools and guidelines and how they fit together

The table below summarises the tools and their objectives, as well as further related tools which
play an important role but were not developed as part of this initiative. The figure on the next page
sets out how they fit together.

Key audiences for the outputs of these tools are government decision-makers, development banks,
utilities and municipal authorities. Various toolkits already exist (e.g. Sanitation 21 and Strategic
Sanitation Approach) to help decision-makers identify actions to take at city level. However, most

                                                                                                                      ii

existing tools do not focus specifically on FSM or address political economy aspects. They also
tend to focus around municipal and community action, with limited acknowledgement that tackling
the problems will require substantial external support, from other levels of government as well as
under project-type arrangements. The tools set out here take these factors into account, and aim to
help stakeholders consider how to develop urban sanitation services that manage all fecal waste
rather than only that which is discharged to sewers.

Diagram of how the tools fit together

These tools are primarily intended for carrying out a sanitation situation diagnosis and the
preliminary selection of intervention options, bringing a focus to each part of the sanitation service
chain. They will be particularly useful at the project identification and preparation stage. However,
much of the data collected will also be useful later in the design of interventions. While some of
the tools are specific to FSM, others are applicable to urban sanitation as a whole, as explained
below.

The diagram below shows how the various tools fit together. Everything stems from the fecal waste
flow diagram, with each tool providing further information. All tools provide information to help
guide the assessment of intervention options. Most of these tools actually apply to urban sanitation
overall, but the focus of this report is on FSM.

1          Introduction

 1.1         About this report
This document provides the background to the diagnostic tools, decision-support tools and
program design guidelines, as part of a package to support the improvement of fecal sludge
management (FSM) services. It is part of a World Bank Economic and Sector Work (ESW) entitled
‘Fecal Sludge Management: Diagnostics for Service Delivery in Poor Urban Areas’. This work is
funded by the World Bank Water and Sanitation Programme (WSP). The tools and diagnostics are
based on field work carried out in the five cities of Balikpapan, Dhaka, Hawassa, Lima and Santa
Cruz.

Consultants for the project are Oxford Policy Management (OPM) in partnership with the Water,
Engineering and Development Centre (WEDC) at Loughborough University. The overall objective
of this assignment is: “to work with the World Bank WSP urban sanitation team to develop the
methodology, design, develop survey instruments and undertake analysis of data collected from
five field case studies (linked to World Bank operations projects), refine diagnostic tools and
develop decision-support tools and guidelines for the development of improved FSM services.”
Specific objectives of this report are listed in the next section. The scope includes the need to
consider city-wide septage services and the systematic inclusion of poor urban communities.


 1.2         Rationale and objectives
It is common for poor people living in urban areas of many low-income countries to either use on-
site sanitation facilities or defecate in the open. Even when improved on-site options are used to
contain feces, in many cities only limited services exist for collection, transport and disposal or
treatment of the resulting fecal sludge. Resource recovery through end-use of fecal sludge is rare.
The service delivery gaps within and between stages of the sanitation service chain become more
apparent as sanitation coverage increases in poor urban areas. Failure to ensure strong links
throughout the service chain results in untreated fecal sludge (FS) contaminating the environment,
with serious implications for public health.

Despite this, there are very few tools and guidelines to help city planners navigate complex FSM
situations, despite increasing demand for them. This study builds on existing frameworks and tools,
in particular the City Service Delivery Assessment scorecard, Fecal Waste Flow Diagram (Shit
Flow Diagram, SFD), and the Economics of Sanitation Initiative toolkit. Some of these were
developed in a preliminary review in 12 cities, using secondary data (WSP, 2012). Development of
the tools and guidelines was based on primary data collection in five cities, supported by
interaction with city stakeholders. Acknowledging the difficulty of reforming FSM services in cities,
and political economy questions around FSM are explicitly included as part of the overall analysis.
The aim is to produce tools and guidelines that are based on real-life examples related, where
possible, to ongoing World Bank operations, with a focus on practicality.

The approach adopted acknowledges that city-wide solutions aiming to deliver decent sanitation to
the city as a whole are required, while also emphasising that solutions for poor urban areas must
not be left out of implementation plans. Primary data collection under this project was developed to
follow this principle, and the analysis and the outputs of the tools flow from that.

The specific objectives of this “tools and guidelines report” are:

        Present the diagnostic tools, decision-support tools and program design guidelines


                                                                                                         1
Tools and guidelines for fecal sludge management                                       Version: draft final


        Explain how to use them, giving city examples from primary data collection.

        Identify policy recommendations for enhanced FSM service delivery as part of developing
         urban sanitation services.

2            Overview of the tools and why they are required

    2.1        Why tools are required
Decision-makers involved with city sanitation services include national and local governments,
local and development banks, utilities and municipal authorities. Where mandates are clear these
decision-makers are often responsible for planning improvements to urban sanitation which are
challenging, particularly in low-income areas – be they formal or informal. Various approaches and
frameworks already exist to help city decision-makers identify actions to take at city level and these
include: the Strategic Sanitation Approach (SSA), Sanitation 21 and Community-Led Urban
Environmental Sanitation (CLUES).1

However, these sanitation planning approaches do not focus specifically on fecal sludge
management or address the capacity and political economy aspects of the challenge. They also
target municipal and community action, with limited acknowledgement that where the sanitation
problems are greatest it may be hardest to make a significant impact without substantial external
support, probably under a project arrangement involving consulting resources. The tools and
guidelines presented here aim to fill an important gap by taking these factors into account. With
their intuitive meaning, they can help stakeholders consider how to ensure comprehensive urban
sanitation services, avoiding the tendency to focus only on conventional, often sewered, solutions.

The tools set out in this report are to be used for diagnosis and preliminary options selection, along
the whole sanitation service chain (outlined in Figure 1 below), especially for the project
identification and preparation stage. However, much of the data collected at this stage will be
applied in the later design of the interventions. Some of the tools are specific to FSM, others are
applicable to urban sanitation as a whole. This is further explained below.

As explained in the introduction, the overall focus is on analysis which is city-wide and poor-
inclusive. This approach aims to acknowledge that city-wide solutions serving the entire population
are required, while also emphasising that solutions for poor urban areas must be included in
implementation plans. This principle is followed in all the tools and guidelines. Therefore, while the
focus of this project is on FSM, most of these tools are applicable to urban sanitation overall.

In Figure 2 below, the fecal waste flow diagram (or ‘shit flow diagram’, SFD) is shown to be the
starting point, with each subsequent tool providing further information on a different aspect. Each is
linked to one of three elements of program design (enabling environment, technical design and
prioritisation), while the outputs of all tools provide inputs to the implementation options
assessment framework. A smaller version of Figure 2 is included at the beginning of each chapter,
with the specific tool being explained question indicated in colour.

From the Fecal Waste Flow Diagram (SFD, 1) there are three ‘streams’ of information required for
program design. The first relates to institutions and financing (to inform enabling environment
interventions), the second to sludge and wastewater volumes and characteristics (to inform
technical interventions) and the third to spatial data and costs to inform prioritization of
interventions. Information and analysis under all three ‘streams’ should inform a comprehensive
approach to program design.

For the enabling environment stream, the City Service Delivery Assessment (CSDA, 2) assesses
the quality of processes affecting service delivery, intermediate and resulting service outcomes
along the sanitation service chain and diagnoses the main impediments within the current enabling
environment to supporting the development, expansion and sustainability of FSM services. The
PFC/PEA (Prognosis for Change/Political Economy Analysis, 3) is strongly linked to the CSDA,
identifying the interests and incentives that could block or delay action, and possible entry points
for overcoming them. In addition, the FSM costing tool supports the analysis of different models
for who should pay, which must be proposed with an understanding of the political economy (3)
and current financing context. This then feeds into the Service Delivery Action Framework, which
suggests appropriate non-technical (or “soft”) interventions for improving FSM, as a function of the
status of the enabling environment. Finally, technical intervention options can be assessed (5).

 2.3         Intended audience and how the tools should be used
The reports in the Table 1 above are tailored to the intended audiences and distinguish between (i)
users of the outputs of the tools (e.g. diagrams and tables), (ii) users of the tools themselves (e.g.
questionnaires and spreadsheets).

Key intended audiences for the outputs of the tools are government decision-makers, international
development agencies, utilities and municipal authorities. In the case where the tools are applied
to a particular city, the outputs produced will be of interest to those responsible for, or working to
enhance, sanitation services in that particular city. The tools themselves will be used by
consultants and sanitation specialists in stakeholder institutions to produce the outputs. In more
detail:

        Users of the tools: evidence-based project design work is typically outsourced to
         consultants or carried out in-house by city stakeholders or staff of development financing
         institutions. The intended users of these tools are therefore consultants or in-house staff
         with the appropriate expertise, capacity and means to apply the tools in a participatory
         manner. The results and recommendations are then intended to be discussed with their
         clients or managers as the principal output.

        Users of the tool outputs: The reported results and recommendations need to appeal to,
         and be used by decision-makers working in government, utilities, municipal authorities and
         international development agencies. The outputs of applying the tools are therefore
         designed to be visual, clear and accessible to people with technical and non-technical
         backgrounds. The outputs would typically be used in project or program concept,
         preparation and design documents.

While the Summary Report is designed for users of the outputs, the audience of this report (“Tools
and Guidelines”) is for users of the tools themselves. Therefore, together with the Data Collection
Instruments (and generic Terms of Reference) this report provides more detail and a “how to”
guide.

3          Fecal waste flow diagram

    3.1      Introduction and objectives
A Fecal Waste Flow Diagram (‘shit flow’ diagram, or SFD) is a
credible visualisation of how fecal waste (consisting of both
fecal sludge and wastewater) flows along the sanitation
service chain for a given population (e.g. city-wide, informal
settlements). The aim of an SFD is to give a compelling visual
summary of a city’s sanitation chain, specifically showing at
which stages problems need to be solved. The graphic to the
right indicates where the SFD fits on the tools diagram
(Figure 2).

The proportions of households using different sanitation options are identified according to where
the waste discharges (e.g. sewer, on-site containment etc.). The number of households is a proxy
for the amount of fecal pollution, and is used rather than the actual volume of sewage or fecal
sludge, as it is the contributing population that determines the potential pathogen load. It does not
estimate the public health risk, as this depends not only on pollution levels, but also the degree of
human exposure to the pollution. At each stage of the chain, the SFD shows the proportion of fecal
waste that is effectively managed and ineffectively managed. This means that where fecal waste is
deemed to be:

         Effectively managed from one stage of the chain to the next (for example, where
          wastewater from cistern flush toilets is effectively transported through sewers to a
          designated treatment site, or fecal sludge is transported by a tanker to a designated
          disposal site), the SFD shows the flow of fecal waste continuing along the chain – and the
          arrow representing that flow of fecal waste to the next stage remains green;

         Not effectively managed from one stage of the chain to the next (for example, where
          wastewater leaks from sewers before reaching a designated treatment site, or fecal sludge
          is dumped into the environment or drainage channels), then the SFD shows the fecal waste
          “dropping out” of the service chain – and the arrow representing that flow of fecal waste
          turns brown.

The proportion of fecal waste that is effectively managed all the way to the end of the service chain
is indicated as “safely managed”, with the remaining proportion that has dropped -out of the chain
deemed “unsafely managed”. The primary destination of that “unsafe” fecal waste is indicated (e.g.
receiving waters, general environment, drains, etc.). 2


    3.2      Methods and data sources
Data sources used to develop SFDs can include household surveys, key informant interviews,
secondary literature, and measurements at treatment facilities. Examples of SFDs from the five
case studies in this project are provided below, with city-specific methods discussed in more detail



2
 It is acknowledged that FS may pass from irrigation canals into other water bodies, e.g. rivers, but the diagram focuses
on the primary destination. It was beyond the scope of this study to be able to track the pathways of sludge beyond the
household, e.g. which canals did it pass through and where was its eventual destination.


                                                                                                                          7
Tools and guidelines for fecal sludge management                                                          Version: draft final


there. In general, a pragmatic combination of data sources based on expert judgement is required,
because data availability and available funds for new data collection will vary across cities.

Most SFDs so far (including those in the 12-city study, WSP, 2012) were undertaken using
secondary data and expert estimates. This project is amongst the first to use primary household
survey data and field-based observations to construct SFDs. A group of urban sanitation experts
funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) is currently ‘rolling-out’ the use of SFDs,
making SFD examples and guidance available for use by others.3

The more reliable the underlying data, and the greater confidence decision-makers have in that
data, the more likely they are to act on the basis of what it shows. There is therefore a relationship
between SFD accuracy and credibility. However, an SFD primarily aims to give an overview of the
situation. While there is a minimum level of evidence for advocacy and engagement, debates over
one or two percentage points are not required provided the underlying data is mostly sound.


    3.3      Examples from primary data collection in five cities
As explained in the introduction, the project followed the overall principle of analysis of being city-
wide and poor-inclusive. This approach acknowledges that solutions serving the entire city are
required, while also emphasising that specific solutions for poor urban areas must be included in
implementation plans. Primary data collection followed this principle and two SFDs were developed
for each city representing (i) the city-wide situation, and (ii) the situation in low-income areas4. A
detailed description of the methodology is provided in Annex A. Here it can be summarised that, in
most cities, there were two sub-sample areas (denoted A and B) with a total of 720 households
interviewed:

         Sub-sample A was representative of the city as a whole (360 households)
         Sub-sample B focused on poor urban areas, without any attempt to be statistically
          representative (360 households)

The aim of sub-sample A was to get city-representative estimates at minimum cost and minimum
administrative burden. Therefore, it has a relatively small sample size, for example compared to
what would be necessary for studies with different objectives (e.g. an evaluation aiming to attribute
impact to an intervention). The aim of sub-sample B was to get a picture of the character of low-
income areas, since it would be too difficult to get an accurate sampling frame (meaning an
understanding of the geography of the entire ‘low-income population’ from which to sample).

Figures 3 and 4 show examples of fecal waste flow diagrams for Lima, Peru. The first represents a
city-wide picture, while the second represents informal settlements in the city (designated as
“slums” for ease of reference). What is clear from the city-wide SFD (Figure 3) is that 48% of FS in
Lima is not effectively managed, although city wide 95% of fecal waste is removed from the
immediate domestic and residential environment. However, although 92% of households have a
sewer connection, almost 30% of wastewater does not make it to the treatment plant due to
leakages in the system. Also of the wastewater which makes it to the treatment plant just over
70% is actually treated. The other point of note is that when pits are abandoned (when full), they
are considered to be effectively managed if the pit/tank was lined, and ineffectively managed if it

 The terms “slum”, “informal settlement” or “low -income area” are variously used in different cities depending on the
national context and have a similar meaning.

was unlined. Only 7% of households city-wide use an on-site sanitation (OSS) system which is
“emptiable”.5

 A containment option is “emptiable” if involves a pits or septic tanks which can be emptied. However, emptiable options
can also be connected to drains through an overflow, so as to avoid the need for emptying. What is emptiable may or
may not be emptied. It is common in some cities (e.g. Dhaka) for toilets to be connected to drains with no intermediate
containment – this is designated as non-emptiable.


                                                                                                                          9

Figure 4           Fecal Waste Flow Diagram for Lima – slums, based on household survey




Considering next the SFD for the slum sample (Figure 4), the picture is completely different
because there are no sewers in the slums. The vast majority of households (96%) have an unlined
pit, nearly all of which are covered unsafely and abandoned when full. Of the few that are emptied,
the faecal sludge is disposed of unsafely nearby, or dumped illegally if transported further afield. A
further 3% have toilets which discharge straight to drains or open ground, and only 1% have a
properly constructed containment facility from which the sludge is safely removed, transported and
treated. Overall then, 1% of FS in slums in Lima is effectively managed. As illustrated in this case,
the situation in slums is much worse than the city-wide picture, with far more fecal waste going
directly into the local area, especially via unlined pits which leak. This should help inform
development of poor-inclusive intervention options, for example improvements to on-site
containment and pit emptying services.

It is useful to also consider a second city example which brings a different perspective, but with the
same division into a city-wide picture and a slum-specific picture. On the next page, SFDs for
Dhaka, Bangladesh are shown.

The main difference between Dhaka and Lima is that in Dhaka the city-wide picture similar to the
slums, except the slum situation is even worse. The sewer system in Dhaka is almost completely
dysfunctional (and non-existent in slums) and households (67% city-wide, 90% in slums) use a
toilet which is directly or indirectly connected to the drainage system.

 3.4         Using the Fecal Waste Flow Diagram
The SFD is the starting point of any analysis. It helps set the scene for identifying the scale of the
problem and explaining it in terms of the sanitation service chain. Analysis in other tools is then
linked to that, in particular:

                                                                                                         11
Tools and guidelines for fecal sludge management                                         Version: draft final


        City Service Delivery Assessment – this identifies weaknesses in operationalizing the
         service chain which delivers the outcomes as shown in the SFD

        Public Health Risk Assessment – risk-based approaches (e.g. SaniPATH) identify which
         areas of the sanitation chain are of highest risk to public health.

        Quantification and characterisation – while the SFD is designed in terms of proportions
         of households, deriving as it does from household survey data primarily, it is implies
         volumes. The relationship between numbers of households and volumes of FS is not
         simple, as discussed below.

        Intervention options assessment – the twin SFDs are also the starting point for
         intervention options assessment, as any sensible analysis should begin from an
         understanding of the problem, its scale and nature.

A Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) funded study is making examples of SFDs and
guidance on how to produce them available to a global audience via the SuSanA website. More
details are available at http://www.susana.org/en/sfd.

In conclusion, the aim of an SFD is to give a compelling visual summary of a city’s sanitation chain,
specifically showing the general nature and relative extent of the problems at each stage. Box 1
provides further examples to illustrate what the SFD is and is not. Of itself, an SFD does not tell the
viewer what should actually be done, or how different problems along the chain should be
prioritised. This requires informed analysis of the underlying data and results, as explained in
following sections of this report.

Box 1              What the SFD is and is not


The SFD is:
    A tool for engineers, planners and decision-makers
    Based on contributing populations and an indication of where their excreta goes
    A representation of public health hazard
    An effective communications and advocacy tool
    An overview from which to develop sanitation priorities

The SFD is not:
    Based on actual volumes/mass – these are determined by other related factors
    A representation of public health risk (risk = hazard x behaviour)
    A precise scientific analytical tool

4          City Service Delivery Assessment

 4.1         Introduction and objectives
The City Service Delivery Assessment (CSDA) for FSM is a
tool for diagnosing the main impediments to service delivery
based on objective criteria, and to visualise them in a
colour-coded scorecard. The process and CSDA output
answers overarching questions about the quality of the
current enabling environment, the extent of FSM service
development and the commitment to FSM service
sustainability. The graphic to the right indicates where the
CSDA fits on the overall tools diagram (Figure 2).

The CSDA provides a structured assessment, based on
responding to the same questions on FSM service
performance through all stages of the service chain, across the five cities so as to be objective and
allow comparison. The current format is adapted from the draft used in the FSM 12-city study
(WSP, 2013), which was developed from WSP’s Water Supply and Sanitation Country Status
Overviews (WSP, 2010). The resulting CSDA scorecard shows areas of strength and weakness for
FSM in a city and helps identify priority areas for action, e.g. establishing plans and associated
budgets to improve FSM services, or focusing on developing poor-inclusive technical interventions.

The CSDA process does not, however, explain why the current situation prevails, or identify
potential obstacles to progress. This is why the CSDA should be undertaken in an iterative process
which also takes into account the political economy of FSM in that city. A Prognosis for Change
(PFC) assessment (see section 5) supports an explanation of why the CSDA looks like it does.

The process of developing the CSDA is important and requires key stakeholders to discuss all
stages of the sanitation service chain and use the evidence about the current situation to agree
appropriate scores. Figure 7 summarises this interlinked process, starting with stakeholder
mapping. Once priority areas in the CSDA have been identified, a PFC assessment is undertaken.
This then informs the intervention options assessment, so they are considered in the context of the
city’s political economy realities.

 4.2         Methods and data sources
The CSDA aims to be objective and transparent, so the analysis is clear and stakeholders can
engage with it and update it over time as the situation improves. It is primarily an evidence based
qualitative analysis, based on a review of key documents and interviews with stakeholders at the
city level presented in an intuitive and well-structured way. As noted above, an initial stakeholder
mapping exercise is necessary to ensure interviews are targeted to those best placed to inform
and to generate unbiased scoring.

The CSDA analysis and output is arranged around three broad pillars: enabling services,
developing services, and sustaining services. This is illustrated in Table 2 below, alongside the key
question associated with each area, and the indicators used.

There are several questions beneath each of the nine overall indicators in Table 2 above. For each
question, there are objective criteria to define a score of 0 (poor), 0.5 (developing) or 1 (good).
Each question is scored for each step of the service chain, from containment to disposal. An
example is given in Table 3 below, for the first question under the “policy” indicator. 21 questions
were used in the field studies, but these have been reduced to 17 for the recommended tool, in
light of the experience gained.

Once all the questions are scored for all steps in the service chain, the scores are aggregated into
a city scorecard, by summing together the scores for each indicator (policy, planning etc.) and for
each step of the service chain. The overall scores for each indicator are out of 3 (more detail is
provided in Annex A). Example CSDA outputs are shown in the next section.

                                                                                                                                                        14

As can be seen for Balikpapan, some policies exist and services are available to some extent (e.g.
trucks emptying to a sludge treatment plant). The main areas of weakness along the chain (though
there are others) are in the realm of planning, budgeting and outputs. Scoring for the latter is
mainly related to the lack of capacity of service providers to meet demand, and the quality of
services sufficient to protect against risks. It is also useful to look at each column of the CSDA,
which represents a particular step in the service chain. In Balikpapan, treatment and disposal are
clearly weaknesses.

For Dhaka, however, it is clear that there are problems along the whole chain on most components
of the CSDA. The only ‘yellow’ scores are for policy and planning around containment, since there
is a relatively clear policy framework for use of latrines and almost universal access to latrines.
Action is therefore required along the whole sanitation chain across all areas.

It is possible to use the CSDAs above to identify areas of action for the city, if not specific actions
themselves. In Balikpapan, getting together city plans and budgets for FSM seems to be a priority
across the chain and a focus on treatment in general seems to be required across all three CSDA
pillars. The Intervention Options chapter and then the Program Design guidelines help identify how
to structure action, including in Dhaka where there are weaknesses across the whole chain and at
first glance it may seem hard to know where to start.

5          Prognosis for Change / Political Economy Analysis

 5.1         Introduction and objectives
The Prognosis for Change (PFC) assessment aims to
understand three things:

        how key formal and informal institutions function,
        what incentives those institutions provide to
         stakeholders, and
        how the formal or informal power those
         stakeholders have exerts influence.
It also considers the implications of the findings for effective
engagement with the problem by those wanting to improve the situation. The aim of the PFC is to
make interventions more likely to succeed, by ensuring they are taking the underlying political
economy of the city into account.

A PFC assessment is close to a political economy analysis (PEA), but with an important distinction.
To be most useful to the commissioning agency, PEA should be a “warts and all” analysis which
could be damaging if publicly available. In some countries, even using the phrase “political
economy” can close doors. Therefore, the important distinction is that a PFC addresses delicat e
topics more sensitively, such that the analysis can be shared with all stakeholders.

The PFC could be thought of as an abridged PEA with most sensitive parts removed. However, it
is more logical to think about it the other way around, as in this report, where there is an “internal”
PEA annex to the “external” PFC. Furthermore, as set out in section ¡Error! No se encuentra el
origen de la referencia. in the context of the CSDA, the PFC should be undertaken as part of the
iterative process shown in Figure 7. The CSDA does not explain why the current situation prevails
or identify potential obstacles to progress – this is the job of the PFC. The three key concepts
involved in the PFC are summarised in Figure 10.

Figure 10          Three key concepts in PFC assessment




Firstly, it should first consider how “institutions” function where institutions are defined as “the rules
and norms governing human interaction”, rather than a narrower definition of organisations.
Institutions can be formal, such as codified laws – one example might be a by-law about where FS



                                                                                                            17
Tools and guidelines for fecal sludge management                                        Version: draft final


can be legally dumped. More importantly, institutions also can be informal, such as social norms.
For example, prevailing attitudes towards reusing FS in agriculture are an informal institution.

Secondly, a PFC considers the incentives which institutions provide to stakeholders. A stakeholder
is any individual or group with an interest in the outcome of a policy. Some examples of relevant
stakeholders may include (but are certainly not limited to) sludge truck companies, the City
Council, or slum-dwellers. Stakeholders can be defined broadly or narrowly as required by the
breadth and depth of the analysis. For example, the earlier three stakeholder examples could be
narrowed to recent entrants to sludge truck market, the planning department of the city council, or
female slum-dwellers. This would allow more nuanced analysis rather than taking whole
organisations as homogenous.

Finally, a PFC considers how stakeholders exert influence. Here, influence is defined as the formal
or informal power to cause something or to prevent it from happening. In FSM, it might be worth
considering city council by-laws on FS. A city council may have formal legal power, but if all their
by-laws are openly flouted by service providers without fear of punishment, then their influence is
very low by that measure. However, they may have informal power to influence FSM in other ways,
for example in the ways their employees act when they find a blocked sewer pipe.

In addition, as set out in the tools diagram (Figure 2) it is important to understand that the PFC /
PEA is strongly linked to a financing dimension. The availability of finance, and the mechanisms
through which it is distributed, have a profound impact on what actually happens. Finally, as noted
earlier, to be practically useful a PFC assessment should consider the implications of the findings
for effective engagement in a reform or change process.


 5.2         Methods and data sources
Given its purpose as an external-facing PEA, it is unsurprising that a PFC essentially uses PEA
methods. These methods have undergone rapid development in recent years. In the sanitation
sector, key PEA studies include a multi-country study carried out by World Bank-WSP with OPM
(WSP, 2010) and a series of papers by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI, 2013). In
addition, SANDEC’s recent FSM book includes a chapter on stakeholder analysis, which is one
key PEA methodology (Strande et al., 2014).

Undertaking a PFC is primarily a qualitative exercise. In terms of data sources, it relies on targeted
key informant interviews (KIIs) with stakeholders or focus group discussions (FGDs), alongside
secondary data in the form of key sector documents, reports and studies. A PFC requires an
analytical structure in order to be clearly communicated. Specific PEA tools can be used to support
this, but there are a large number of such tools available. Many are contained in a World Bank
sourcebook (Holland, 2007), with the most useful being stakeholder mapping, stakeholder analysis
and process mapping. More detail on key tools and methods themselves, and how to use them, is
provided in Annex A. They are best demonstrated with city examples, which follow in the next
section.


 5.3         Examples from primary data collection in five cities

5.3.1      Stakeholder responsibility mapping

As set out above, the focus of PFC is on how institutions function, the incentives which those
institutions provide to stakeholders, and how those stakeholders exert influence. It is therefore
important to understand who those stakeholders are, alongside their formal and informal roles. A


                                                                                                         18

useful tool to do this is institutional responsibility mapping. As set out in Figure 7, a mapping would
already have taken place as part of the CSDA process. The next stage here is to take that further
and analyse the formal role of each stakeholder, and how things look in reality. Background
information is provided in Annex A, but an abridged example for Lima is provided below.
Stakeholders have been categorised by sector (e.g. national or local government, private, etc.),
and both their formal and actual responsibilities (‘the reality’) in FSM in Lima are described. A final
column summarises some of the main challenges faced. Further analysis continues below the
table.

The main messages of Table 4 are the following:

        At both national and local levels, no responsibilities for FSM have been clearly designated
         across stakeholders, which discourages the development of FSM services. Sector
         planning, and thus, public budgets are unlikely to encompass FSM if no stakeholder can be
         held accountable for investments and results. Indeed, budget allocations are primarily
         directed to the expansion of the sewerage network and treatment facilities.

        Moreover, given the current segmentation of the sanitation sector across different
         institutions (as shown in Table 4), a clear designation of responsibilities is needed (as is the
         case for sewerage). Several key informants emphasised that sector or national
         development plans that encompass FSM cannot be developed without a prior definition and
         allocation of competencies. Further evidence from KIIs also suggests that, although there
         seems to be no political opposition to the development of FSM, there is also no political
         drive to carry it forwards. This is partly driven by the persistent demand for sewerage (and
         piped water) by slum dwellers, which drives political campaigns and sanitation policy more
         broadly, as well as the lack of actual commitment and actions by government.

        Poor households in peri-urban Lima face significant financial restrictions to pay for the FSM
         services currently offered. The usual practice of digging new pits once the ones in use fill
         up has allowed for the maintenance of the current status quo. However, limited space, land
         tenure issues and health hazards and risks, as well as delays in getting access to
         sewerage (which can take between 8 to 10 years), is encouraging people to explore other
         alternatives, as is the case of the urine-diverting facilities offered by X-Runner.

Overall, as shown in the CSDA scorecard for Lima (see above), the whole sanitation chain needs
to be formally enabled, developed and sustained. Even if current legal frameworks for solid waste
management service providers allow for the inclusion of FSM service providers, there is an urgent
need to explicitly include FSM within urban development plans and budgets. Without a proper
distribution and designation of responsibilities for FSM, to which stakeholders are held
accountable, it will not be possible to establish FSM services and develop a strong FSM market.
There are no obvious incentives for stakeholders to undertake FSM activities, and they cannot be
expected to independently take this venture forwards.

5.3.2      Process mapping

The section presents another tool, using an example from Dhaka. It is helpful to consider the
ongoing problem of poor FSM in Dhaka in two dimensions. The first dimension is static, that is, the
way households and businesses are dealing with their FS at present. At present millions of people
in Dhaka have their latrine outflow directly or indirectly connected to some kind of drain. The
second dimension is dynamic – the city is changing rapidly, both spatially (e.g. more high-rise
buildings, slums transferring to periphery) and demographically (population growth and inward
migration).

In terms of policy, the static problem requires a response which could be implemented slowly over
time – for example, there are ways of persuading or obliging households to disconnect their toilets
from the drains. The dynamic problem, however, requires engagement in areas that are more the
domain of urban planning than sanitation policy and practice. If property developers are to be
prevented from connecting the wastewater outflow of new buildings to the drains, they must be
compelled to build proper septic tanks which are not connected to drains. As new migrants to

Tools and guidelines for fecal sludge management                                                           Version: draft final


Dhaka arrive, and as existing households upgrade their living conditions, they must have sanitation
options open to them offer the potential of effective FSM.

It is possible to illustrate the first aspect of the dynamic problem by using a tool called process
mapping. This aims to understand the interaction of formal and informal “moments” in a process,
and to identify entry points for engagement. It is important to identify the roles of stakeholders in a
process, how and where they exert influence over the process, and the incentives they face in the
informal system.

The process for constructing a new building in Dhaka is shown in Figure 11 below. The central
column shows the formal process which is supposed to be followed by the property developer,
RAJUK (the capital development authority) and the occupants of the eventual building. The third
column, however, shows elements of the informal process, i.e. what really happens. For example,
RAJUK is supposed to consult the Dhaka City Corporations and DWASA (the utility) about services
to be provided (e.g. water supply, sewerage, drainage, solid waste etc.) when a new building is
constructed. However, this may be limited to only the bare minimum (e.g. water) or RAJUK may
sometimes simply expect services to be provided. Another example would be that the developer is
supposed to construct septic tanks (and leach pits) which be easily accessed for desludging, but in
reality they connect these to the drains. There is also some anecdotal evidence of developers
constructing ‘sham’ facilities to fool or placate overworked RAJUK inspectors.

In terms of entry points, there are two ways in which the formal process could be improved so as to
make it less likely that the informal process is followed. Firstly, process for planning applications
could be tightened up, so that the DCCs and DWASA have greater scrutiny of what is going on.
This would not necessarily be easy to implement, and would bring new problems (e.g.
time/inclination of staff to engage, desire to slow down development due to red tape, etc.). In any
case, the relevant DCC and DWASA staff involved in the planning process would need time to

                                                                                                                            21
Tools and guidelines for fecal sludge management                                        Version: draft final


engage. A second entry point could be at the inspection stage. If RAJUK’s inspectors were better
resourced, or if their incentives were better aligned towards preventing unscrupulous property
developers from connecting to the drains, then this could improve the situation.

5.3.3      Stakeholder influence analysis

This section presents another tool called stakeholder influence analysis, using an example from
Dhaka. When considering reform options, it is crucial to consider how stakeholders might respond,
e.g. who would be supportive, who would oppose – in other words, their interest, or whether they
stand to gain or lose from any change. With a limited amount of time and effort to put into
preparing the ground and working with different stakeholders, it would be wise to use that time
efficiently and target it at the right people. Therefore, information about stakeholders’ interests is
not enough. It must be used in combination with an analysis of their relative influence. It is not
worth spending as much time on people who oppose the reform but have no power, as with those
who oppose it but have decisive power to prevent it from happening.

Interest and influence can be scored and mapped onto a stakeholder matrix, as in Figure 12 below.
In this matrix, the question of whether each stakeholder would support or oppose a move towards
better containment and emptying practices in Dhaka is considered, i.e. a move towards preventing
the connection of toilets to drains and an associated spike in demand for emptying services sooner
or later. Next, their relative influence to cause or prevent such a change is considered. Each
stakeholder is scored on a scale from -10 to +10 on both axes.

Figure 12          Stakeholder matrix for ‘moving to better containment and emptying practices’




Stakeholder matrices can help start a conversation about stakeholder engagement in reform
processes. It has inherent limitations (e.g. it is not possible to be sure about how different
stakeholders would respond, these stakeholder groups are not homogenous etc.), but nonetheless
provides a basis for discussion amongst reform proponents, even if the matrix is discarded. From
Figure 12, it might be suggested that there are quite a lot of influential stakeholders who would be

                                                                                                         22
Tools and guidelines for fecal sludge management                                      Version: draft final


supportive of FSM reform, under the right conditions. This could be contributing to the fact that
reforms are now beginning to take place.

It is worth considering some specific examples to illustrate Figure 12. For example, the Dhaka City
Corporations would stand to gain in terms of a smaller load being placed on their small-bore
drainage system, which might be expected to become blocked less often as a result. If FSM reform
creates more work for them, in terms of the new responsibilities they are only beginning to realise
they have (see Dhaka case study report), then this might make them less enthusiastic. Overall,
then, they are scored as being cautiously in favour. Also, as the key local government stakeholder,
they have relatively high influence over the decision.

Informal sweepers (manual latrine emptiers) are in a similar situation. Stopping latrines being
connected to drains would work well for them in the short term, in the sense that they would get
more business pit emptying. However, they may also be wary of market developments which
would enable mechanical truck emptiers to break into their market in the medium term. However,
sweepers have relatively little influence over FSM reform. They can affect the day-to-day situation
on the ground. For example, there is anecdotal evidence that sweepers have interfered with the
ability of mechanical operators to empty pits, but they are not an influential constituency on the
whole. It is also worth noting that many of them are DCC employees, who carry out private
emptying work on the side.

Households and property developers, on the other hand, might be expected to oppose reforms, as
they do not perceive the societal damage costs of inaction, but only the personal costs they would
bear from a change to the situation. Both would stand to face higher costs, households from having
to adapt their toilet facility and eventually pay emptying fees, and property developers from having
to spend more on proper septic tanks and appropriate access to them. Both are likely to be
influential, households in terms of public opinion, and developers in terms of their political
connections.

6          Service Delivery Action Framework

 6.1         Introduction and objectives
A fecal waste flow diagram represents a response to the
planning question “Where are we now?”. From this, the a
set of proposed solutions (intervention options) and
associated actions respond to the question “Where do we
want to get to?”. This section explains how to identify a set
of actions as the initial step in responding to the question
“How do we want to get there?”. The process is focused on
the institutional requirements to achieve effective service
delivery.

When considered carefully, the outputs of all diagnostic and decision-support tools provide
comprehensive information, informing a further process of detailed design towards an FSM
improvement and investment program. A strong data set and well-informed evidence base ensure
that decisions for achieving enhanced service standards are more firmly based, recognised and
acknowledged by the key stakeholders, as intervention options and program design guidelines will
be responding to what people recognise as happening within the city. The process essentially
results in a set of recommended actions, in relation to the enabling environment, necessary to
deliver desired results.


 6.2         Methods and data sources
Together, the output from the CSDA and PFC diagnostic tools identifies barriers to progress for
FSM services, framed around three aspects of the enabling environment: enabling, developing and
sustaining. Overcoming these identified barriers will need action taking that addresses non-
technical components of the enabling environment (such as policy and planning, institutional
arrangements, capacity and financing), as well as technical responses. The ‘Program Design’
process is essentially about identifying a set of recommended actions in relation to the enabling
environment.

For actions to be effective, recommended interventions must respond to how well developed the
enabling environment currently is. The Service Delivery Action Framework (CSDAF) is therefore a
way to conceptualise the range of non-technical, ‘institutional’ interventions that may be most
appropriate for a given city, depending on the status of FSM service development as identified
using the diagnostic tools. Actions are grouped according to the current status of the enabling
environment, with three stages of development identified as Basic, Intermediate or Consolidating.

A set of recommended actions is shown in Table 5 that follows. These actions have been
developed from good practice and informed by the experience of the authors in relation to the
enabling environment for urban sanitation (see the References and Bibliography section for
details). They are presented as an Action Framework in the sense that they are tailored to how well
developed the enabling environment currently is, with a view to strengthening it. As the actions
account for the current realities of the city, they must be recognised as essentially sequential and
should be viewed as dynamic; that is, actions start with from the Basic stage before moving
towards the Intermediate, then the Consolidating stages. If a city is identified to already be
delivering FSM services from one of these stages, the resulting set of actions would be taken from
the ‘next stage’. Actions are therefore informed by the current realities experienced on the ground

and highlight where best to focus attention for that aspect of the enabling environment, in order to
improve services.

This is illustrated by way of an example of an CSDAF for Dhaka in Figure 13 that follows Table 5. It
serves to highlight where the actions for each element of the enabling environment are considered
to be best located, informed by the extent to which actions have already been achieved in the city.
Actions to consider are shown within the shaded boxes with a bold outline, as             ‘Action’
shown.
The actions are also strongly influenced by the recognition that public health is likely to be at
greatest risk where FSM services are least developed. Basic actions therefore focus more strongly
on protecting public health, while actions within an already developed enabling environment can
include those giving more emphasis to protecting the environment, ensuring effective treatment of
fecal sludge and establishing options for fecal sludge re-use.

 6.3         Guidelines for action
The Service Delivery Action Framework provides a way to identify the range of ‘institutional’
actions that may be appropriate for any city, depending on the current status of FSM service
development. The actions are grouped according to the how well developed each element of the
enabling environment is considered to be. Identifying the most appropriate actions for a particular
city recognises that the steps are essentially sequential for any of the actions points – i.e. starting
with the basic actions before moving towards intermediate, then consolidating actions. Thus, if a
city has already addressed the basic actions, the intermediate actions may be the ones to focus on
for that particular element.

As a city progresses through these stages, actions shift from being mainly about identifying,
reviewing or building awareness of services, through to actions that are more about establishing,
strengthening and promoting commitment to services, and on towards actions that are about
strengthening, consolidating and expanding engagement to achieve a more sustainable range of
enhanced services. The actions also move from prioritising public health protection (which may
include developing temporary measures), to ensuring the protection of the environment and
looking at the potential for the re-use of fecal sludge end products.

The actions proposed are therefore considered to be most appropriate to the current situation –
indicating a “trajectory of change” as the enabling environment develop s and strengthens.
Identifying how developed each of the components of the enabling environment is and therefore
which actions to take next, must be informed by the result of the City Service Delivery Assessment
(CSDA) and Prognosis for Change (PFC) process (Figure 7). A resulting Program Design will
therefore be built up through a process of discussion around the CSDA/PFC outputs in relation to
the Service Delivery Action Framework.

Examples of how this might look for Dhaka city is shown in Figure 13 and for low-income, informal
settlements in Lima is shown in Figure 14 that follow. The figures illustrate where the actions for
each element of the enabling environment are considered to be best located, informed by the
extent to which actions have already been achieved in the city.

Dhaka city’s CSDA scorecard highlighted that progress in the enabling environment is limited to
developing policy around containment and establishing an institutional framework for FSM more
generally. A focus on intermediate action is needed in relation to these areas, but basic action
remains the priority in all other areas, including planning, budgeting, promotion and capacity

This process should recognise that actions will need to be implemented through systematic,
strategic and pragmatic steps, if they are to be ‘actionable’. The result will be a matrix of actions for
the city, with a range of actions targeted at national, city and user level. These in turn can be
considered in more detail to inform project and program planning and implementation. Essentially
then, the Action Framework helps prioritise where attention needs to be given in developing the
details for planning and implementation.

Actions are recommended in the highlighted areas: being focused at either the Intermediate level
of action (in relation to Policy and Institutional arrangements), or the Basic level of action (in
relation to Planning, Capacity and Financing.

Making actions context-specific and localised

A further step in the process will be to take the actions from each of the highlighted areas and
translate them into objectives, targets and indicators that respond to the specific context of the
given city – at the scale (e.g. city-wide, or focused on specific locations) to enable detailed
planning. This step must not be overlooked and requires a significant commitment of time,
resources and skills to achieve effective results.

7          Intervention options assessment framework

 7.1         Introduction and objectives
As indicated in Figure 2, Intervention Options for developing and
improving FSM services requires an pre-existing assessment of
various aspects (including fecal waste flows, sludge volumes etc.).
The intended result is a set of recommended intervention options
and actions that can support the ultimate aim of fully developed,
effective FSM services. Only when all aspects are considered
together for a given city will the proposed options and actions be
both directly informed by the current state of service delivery and
prioritised in such a way as to identify realistic, achievable and sustainable objectives and
outcomes.

To achieve this requires further assessment of the outputs from the Diagnostic Tools; notably the
fecal waste flow diagram (SFD) in relation to technical aspects of current levels of service delivery
through the service chain, and the City Service Delivery Assessment (CSDA) and Prognosis for
Change (PFC) in relation to the enabling environment. Evidence from the use of other tools
(related to identifying levels of public health risk, financing and economics, and fecal sludge
quantification and characterisation) can help when selecting what actions to take.


 7.2         Assessing Technical Intervention Options: methods and data
             sources
The starting point to assessing appropriate Technical Intervention Options for a city is the fecal
waste flow diagram (SFD), as informed analysis must begin with an understanding of the current
problem, its nature and scale. The assessment focuses around where fecal waste flows are shown
to be ineffectively managed – that is, the point at which the flow ‘drops out’ of the service chain.
This assessment is done for each sanitation type in the diagram (e.g. sewer, on-site storage
emptied, on-site straight to drain), with the most significant problems put into a table showing
problems against the stages of the service chain. Technical Intervention Options to respond to the
specific problems can then be proposed and added to the table. Assessing the problems and
identifying options to solve them must be informed by knowledge and expertise of good sanitation
and fecal sludge management practice, as well as experience of potential technical solutions that
are appropriate to the various stages of the service chain. Publications, including the
SANDEC/EAWAG’s Fecal Sludge Management and Compendium of Sanitation Systems and
Technologies books, are valuable to support this process. Technical intervention options must also
be based on an understanding of the predominant characteristics of fecal sludge in the city, as well
as an understanding of how much of it there is to manage. This is essential to avoid inappropriate
technical options being proposed. The work by SANDEC/EAWAG on fecal sludge quantification
and characterisation (FAQ) will be particularly valuable here. The References and Bibliography
section has further details.

As a technical option is proposed at any given stage in the service chain, it is essential to consider
the implications of applying this intervention for other stages of the same chain, so that
interventions help to develop a fully-functioning service chain from containment through to eventual
disposal or re-use of fecal sludge. So, for example, if a proposed technical intervention relates to
introducing or extending the services of private providers who empty fecal sludge from on-site
containment systems, those providers will need to have the appropriate means to transport the
fecal sludge (using mechanised or manual-powered transport equipment) to suitable disposal

                                                                                                         31

locations – which may be in the form of local FS transfer stations, receiving stations at FS
treatment sites, or a safely managed disposal site. Key publications to support the identification of
‘linked-up’ technical options through the service chain are included in the References and
Bibliography.


    7.3      Examples from primary data collection in five cities
Dhaka city

Figure 15 below shows the city-wide fecal waste flow diagram for Dhaka. Where fecal sludge and
wastewater ‘drop out’ of the service chain, examples of the most significant problems for each
sanitation type are highlighted.

                                            containment




Backed by knowledge of the evidence used to generate the city-wide SFD for Dhaka, an
assessment of the current status highlights the key problems of both fecal sludge and wastewater
management services. These relate to the poor functionality of the existing sewer network, poor
quality fecal sludge emptying services, a lack of fecal sludge being contained in on-site pits and
septic tanks and a proportion of fecal sludge discharging directly into the environment where no
on-site containment exists at the household. 7

From this starting point, the table of technical intervention options can be built up. For these
intervention options and proposed solutions to be realistic and workable requires a good
understanding of the city context, as well as insight into any recent, current and imminent
interventions, studies, pilot projects and research activities affecting sanitation services in the city
that can be taken into account. The potential solutions should be developed and agreed with

7
  The SFD for a purposive sample of slums in Dhaka showed similar problems resulting from ineffectively managed fecal
sludge management services (there being no connectivity to sewers identified in the slum sample). The dominant
problem identified was zero on-site containment and fecal sludge discharging directly into drains.

The full set of technical intervention options for Dhaka city (in the full city report) highlights how
technical interventions to develop effective FSM services will be most varied and complex at the
stages of containment, emptying and transport of fecal sludge, while treatment, disposal and end-
use options are likely to coalesce into similar interventions. So, while there may be multiple
systems and problems identified at the household level, common solutions may be more
appropriate at certain stages of the service chain.

                              discharging to the environment




Taking the fecal waste flow diagram for the low-income, unsewered settlements of Lima (Figure 4)
and the data used to develop it, the key problems associated with FSM services can be identified
as relating to the poor functionality of the existing sewer network, poor quality fecal sludge
emptying services, a lack of fecal sludge being contained in on-site pits/tanks and a proportion of
fecal sludge discharging directly into the environment where no on-site containment exists at the
household.

From this starting point, the table of intervention options is built up. Table 7   shows          a
selection of the Intervention Options identified for low-income, unsewered settlements in Lima city.
It shows one intervention option at each step of the service chain for each system type.


Technical intervention options and the enabling environment

The resulting set of technical intervention options proposed for any city must next be considered in
relation to the design of a FSM or sanitation program that will address the enabling environment
affecting current and future services. How to do this, using the results of the CSDA and PFC, is
explained in the following section addressing Program design guidelines.

    8.1      Integrated design approach for fecal sludge treatment
In low-income countries, regulations affecting fecal sludge often do not exist, or are not enforced,
which makes defining performance goals for fecal sludge management extremely challenging.
Most sanitation infrastructure projects are designed to overly-stringent performance goals, but end
up not performing as intended and frequently failing. While over-designing wastes money and
resources, under-designing does not provide adequate protection of human and environmental
health. Technologies designed for the purpose of resource recovery can be used to define required
and appropriate performance goals, including increased financial flows to offset costs in the service
chain. The technologies can also provide an incentive for efficient and effective collection and
transport service delivery arrangements and the operation of optimized treatment plants, as they
function on the basis of meeting a market demand.

SANDEC at Eawag is currently developing a series of tools to support an integrated approach to
designing fecal sludge treatment. The tools will be based on field experience in fecal sludge
management and address five core arears with the following objectives:

    Market Driven Approach: to aid selection of treated end-products with the greatest potential for
     market volume and growth;
    Evaluate collection and transport service delivery and the siting of treatment plants;
    Optimized treatment technologies for resource recovery: to optimize existing treatment
     technologies for increased volumetric capacity or reduced footprint of the treatment plant;
    Faecal sludge quantification and characterization: to reasonably estimate the characteristics
     and quantities of fecal sludge on a city-wide scale, or an appropriate scale to suit the intended
     treatment plant; and
    Laboratory methods: to prepare reliable and replicable standard methods for laboratory
     analysis of fecal sludge.

    8.2      SANDEC FSM Book
Faecal Sludge Management: Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation is the first book
dedicated to faecal sludge management. It compiles the current state of knowledge of this rapidly
evolving field and presents an integrated approach that includes technology, management and
planning. It addresses the planning and organization of the entire faecal sludge management
service chain, from the collection and transport of sludge and treatment options, to the final end
use or disposal of treated sludge.

In addition to providing fundamentals and an overview of technologies, the book goes into details
of operational, institutional and financial aspects, and provides guidance on how to plan a city-level
faecal sludge management project with the involvement of all the stakeholders.

 8.1         Urban Sanitation Status Index
The Urban Sanitation Status Index (USSI) is a tool based on the sanitation service chain that
visualizes sanitation status at neighbourhood level, which is usually the lowest administrative unit
within a city. However, it can also be used at district or city level. It is based on 15 qualitative
indicators assessed via household surveys and key informant interviews, using similar data to
those required for the tools described elsewhere in this document, but also including very basic
data on solid waste and drainage, which are important complementary aspects of sanitation in its
narrow sense of excreta management.

The 15 base indicators are aggregated into 9 numerical indicators and then into 4 components
(see table below) based on the sanitation service chain – (i) containment; (ii) emptying and
transport; (iii) treatment and disposal; and (iv) complementary services (solid waste and drainage).
These can be mapped by neighbourhood to give a sense of where the service chain is failing most
severely (see

Figure 17). They can also be aggregated into the overall USSI using the analytic hierarchy
process, whereby sanitation experts familiar with the area under study provide relative rankings of
pairs of the numerical variables which are aggregated and used to generate a weighted geometric
mean of all the variables.

 8.2         Public Health Risk Assessment
The principal rationale for improving sanitation    Figure 18    Relationship between open
is to improve public health. Statistical analysis                defecation and stunting
(see Figure 18) shows that stunting, which
aggregates many of the effects of poor
sanitation, is closely correlated with levels of
open defecation, and more so in densely
populated urban areas rather than in rural
areas. Many other studies show that improving
sanitation reduces diarrheal disease, although
a precise causative relationship is hard to pin
down.

Public health risk has two major components –
hazard, or the levels of fecal contamination
along various pathways from faces to mouth;
and exposure, or the frequency and extent of
contact with each contamination pathway.

Hazard may be estimated from measurements of fecal pollution in the environment, or by taking
the SFD a stage further by consideration of microbiological decay along the various pathways.
Exposure is much more difficult to estimate but may involve individual and group surveys,
observation, key informant interviews, GPS mapping etc. Various initiatives are in progress, and
may eventually be developed to a stage where they can help to pinpoint priority public health risks
in specific areas of the city which can then be targeted with specific interventions.




                                                                                                      39

Various approaches are being developed, mostly by academic institutions. The most advanced is
SaniPATH, developed by Emory University, USA, which guides the user through a comprehensive
environmental microbiological sampling and analysis process, and links this with behavioral
observations and discussions. However, the tool is not quite ready for routine use as yet, and is
being further developed to make it easier to apply. The University of North Carolina, USA, is
developing an analysis of the return of fecal pollution to the environment, which focuses more on
hazard than risk (= hazard x exposure) since exposure is hard to measure. This initiative is at an
early stage, so it is not very clear in which direction it might develop. University College London,
UK, was involved in the SPLASH program, of which one sub-project further developed community-
based risk assessment tools which are more subjective, but incorporate exposure issues through
working directly with the target populations. Much thinking is going into this area, and we are in
touch with all of the above-mentioned groups. It may be realistic to hope for easily usable tools
within the next 2-3 years. For now, we need to follow developments and assist in getting the
various ideas field-tested.


    8.3      SFD promotion initiative
Based on the Fecal Waste Flow Diagram (Shit Flow Diagram, or SFD) developed by World Bank-
WSP, institutions active in the field of excreta management convened in June 2014 to further
develop the SFD, which clearly shows how excreta is or is not contained as it moves along multiple
pathways from defecation to disposal or end-use, and is presented together with the City Service
Delivery Assessment tool. This joint initiative is managed under the umbrella of the Sustainable
Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) and funded by BMGF since September 2014.9

BMGF’s first grant kick-started a process of developing tools and mechanisms for the easy
production of standardized SFDs, backed by a description of information sources and the enabling
environment in the city concerned. The approach is being tested in 50 cities in Africa, Asia and
Latin America and the results disseminated via the SuSanA website. The aim is to promote better
understanding of excreta management by demonstrating the power of the SFD to summarize and
present what happens to excreta in cities. The SFD is an advocacy and decision-support tool that
has the potential to shift the focus of attention, money and activities towards more effective and
inclusive urban sanitation and more efficient investments.

Annex A               How to use the tools – methodology of the five city
                      study

A.1      Introduction
This Annex summarises key aspects of the methodology for the five city case studies, as an
indication of how to use the tools. For these case studies, primary data was collected so as to (i)
inform ongoing WB operations, (ii) inform the development and refinement of the FSM tools in this
report through field testing.

The OPM / WEDC team developed a Research Framework (RF) structured around WSP’s planned
project components (as shown in Table 9 below), also considering possible data collection
instruments (e.g. household survey, key informant interviews). The RF comprised research
questions and sub-questions aligned along the sanitation chain. The sub-questions were in turn
allocated to the data collection instruments which could answer those questions. This logical
approach ensured that no questions were asked which could not be answered.

The next step was to develop the data collection instruments, based on the questions allocated to
them. Research protocols for each of the instruments, as well as the instrument formats
themselves, were also developed. There were six main instruments, four quantitative and two
qualitative, as set out in Table 10 below.

Links to the data collection instruments are in Annex B, as are the detailed research protocols. The
remainder of this section summarises the methodology for each of the tools referred to in the body
of this report. In other words, it explains how the diagnostics and decision-support tools draw on
primary and secondary data.

A.2                    Fecal waste flow diagram
For this analysis, several key indicators from the household survey were used. In particular, data
from the following household survey questions was used:11

                    A. “What kind of toilet facility do members of your household usually use? ”

                    B. “Where do the contents of this toilet empty to?”

                    C. “What did you do when the pit or septic tank filled-up last time?”

                    D. “What was [the fecal sludge] emptied into?”

  Numbers for each City study to be detailed in the ToRs for data collection for that City
11
  Full response categories for these questions are included in the survey questionnaire. In particular, it should be noted
that the response categories to question B varied across countries. In Dhaka, for example, they were: (i) Directly to piped
sewer system, (ii) Septic tank connected to "piped sewer system", (iii) Septic tank with no outlet, (iv) lined pit with no
outlet, (v) septic tank connected to drain, (vi) lined pit with overflow to drain/elsewhere, (vii) unlined pit, (viii) directly to
sea, lake or river, (ix) directly to drain/ditch


                                                                                                                                             44
Tools and guidelines for fecal sludge management                                         Version: draft final


Of these, question ‘B’ is one of the most crucial for the construction of the SFD. It should be noted
that the household’s response is taken as given. It was not possible to confirm responses by
observation since enumerators were selected for a background in social research and not
sanitation, so could not easily understand the ‘below ground’ components . It was however felt that
they could be trained to observe ‘above -ground’ components, so observation of slab, water seal,
superstructure, etc. was carried out in all households where permission was given.

Given that ‘B’ is based on household response, possible sources of bias include the household not
knowing the true answer, or knowing it but answering differently for fear of being identified as
practicing illegal behaviour (e.g. pits/tanks connected to drains). The former is certainly likely, the
latter does not seem to be an issue given the vast majority of households who willingly disclosed
illegal behaviour.

To analyse this data, an SFD matrix is created, as shown in Figure 19 below. It shows which data
sources are used and how they are analysed into levels of effective / ineffective management of
fecal waste through the stages of the service chain – with results in the next section.

First, the household survey data on use of infrastructure (questions (A) and (B) above) is used to
allocate households to five categories shown in the column marked (1) in the figure below:

    (i)       “Sewered (off site centralised or decentralised)” – toilets connected to sewers (not
              OSS)
    (ii)      “On-site storage – emptiable” – OSS toilets (involving pits or tanks) which can be
              emptied. However, they can also be connected to drains through an overflow, to avoid
              the need for emptying. These toilets are emptiable but may or may not be emptied.
    (iii)     “On-site storage - single-use / pit sealed” – OSS toilets where pits or tanks are
              sealed and/or abandoned once full. These toilets are emptiable but never emptied.
    (iv)      “On-site non-storage - straight to drain/similar” – OSS toilets which connect to
              drains or open water bodies (e.g. hanging latrine, or latrine with a pipe connecting the
              pan directly into a drain). These toilets are therefore non-emptiable.
    (v)       “Open defecation” – self-explanatory

The question of emptiability is key. Category (ii) above is denoted as emptiable, meaning that this
containment option involves a pit or tank which fills with FS. In Dhaka, many such pits/tanks are
also connected to drains through a variety of means (e.g. overflow pipe). This means that while
they are emptiable they are not in fact emptied as often as would be expected, or even at all.
Between the two extremes of a closed system and a system which never fills up, there is a
spectrum of scenarios. For example, some pits/tanks may have an overflow to the drain but may
still require emptying if they become blocked.

The data from questions (A) and (B) at the beginning of this section are allocated in column (2)
below (a key shows the meaning of the colour-coding of cells by data source). Next, the
proportions for each of the stages of the chain are allocated. As can be seen from the emptying
column, marked (3), a certain proportion of the population’s FS which makes it to that stage is
emptied by a service provider, and the rest is not emptied (e.g. overflows to drains). This is
estimated by dividing the number of households which reported emptying their pit (question (C)
above), by the number of households using emptiable technologies (questions (B) above). This
section has given a brief overview of where the data underlying the SFDs comes from. Since the

A.3           City Service Delivery Assessment
Most of the methodology for the CSDA was already presented in section 4.2 of this report. Here,
therefore, only the matrix of questions and criteria is shown (Table 12 on the next page), as well as
the maximum scores per component (Table 11 below). It is important to note that the CSDA tool
was shortened for this report based on findings from the five cities. Therefore the CSDA
scorecards in the full city reports are based on more questions per CSDA component than the

  The impression given by the SFD therefore involves assumptions that (i) each person produces the same amount of
FS, and (ii) pit accumulation rates are constant across the city. This is an approximation but the most pragmatic
approach in the context of uncertainty around FS volumes. This study is primarily about identifying the broader picture of
where the management of FS is or isn’t effective, not what volumes are being managed or mismanaged.

A.4      Prognosis for Change
Process for gathering data for political economy analysis
The following process is intended to guide the data collection for political economy analysis of
FSM. Individual question guides will need to be developed to support data collection for each
process. The information from the question guides will provide data to complete the following
mappings and analysis.

Responsibilities for FSM: Institutional mapping
Data for this should come from a broad range of sources: interviews with government and service
provider stakeholders; interviews with key informants; policy documents and other relevant FSM
service delivery guidelines. Steps to be followed are:

        Identify which actors have formal institutional responsibilities for particular aspects of FSM
         (e.g. containment, emptying and transport) as well as local FSM policy and strategy.
        Categorise these within broader groupings – e.g. national government ministries; local
         government agencies; private sector;
        For each actor, indicate whether they have formal responsibilities for particular aspects of
         FSM in the following table. This should be the formal responsibilities they have, not what
         actually happens in practice.

Stakeholder analysis and mapping
Stakeholder analysis aims to identify stakeholder characteristics, their interests and motivations,
and the nature and degree of their influence on existing or future issues, policies, reforms,
interventions or programme decisions.

A political economy analysis needs to help understand the reasons behind good or poor outcomes
in the question area and therefore needs to go beyond a simple identification and/or categorisation
of stakeholders and actors. We need to understand the institutional, political and governance
arrangements and capabilities that shape stakeholders’ relationships and behaviour in relation to
FSM.

        As a first step, draw up a list of relevant stakeholders. These can be organised into
         specific categories, for example government (national and sub-national), private sector,
         semi-private actors, civil society, community members, NGOs (national and international),
         or global actors. Keeping these main broad categories in mind as the list is drawn up will
         help ensure all are covered appropriately. But there might also be other relevant categories
         or sub-categories that would be useful for particular issues or sectors (e.g. illegal actors,
         media).
             o It is important to remember that none of these categories are homogenous. Within
                 government, there will be actors with different levels, types and forms of power. The
                 same is true within civil society, the private sector and communities (e.g. a key
                 issue, for instance, is that women and men will have different levels of power within
                 all these categories). The different levels, types and forms of power that particular
                 groups or individuals have will contribute to how agendas, conflicts, agreements and
                 disagreements within and across these categories are played out. Political economy
                 analysis needs to highlight these different power relations.
             o It is therefore important to break down stakeholders sufficiently in order to
                 understand potentially different and competing interests and influence within
                 broader stakeholder groups. It is important that the analysis unpacks broad terms

                                                                                                                                         51
Tools and guidelines for fecal sludge management                                                           Version: draft final


                  such as ‘government’, ‘civil society’, ‘community’ or ‘private sector’ and identifies
                  relevant actors (individuals as well as groups or organisations) within these.
                  Breaking down stakeholders helps move the analysis beyond the superficial to an
                  in-depth and nuanced understanding of interests and influence.
             o This also means gender and social analysis should form an integral part of each
                  stakeholder analysis in order to help break down broad categories of stakeholders
                  more appropriately. For example, rather than assume all people living within an
                  urban poor informal settlement all have the same interests in regards to FSM, and
                  the same level of power and influence, the analysis needs to look deeper and
                  consider whether there are different stakes or interests and levels of influence
                  between different groups and individuals: for instance, young mothers versus older
                  men (and how these may be created and/or maintained by gender and social
                  norms). It is easy (and often quick) to undertake an initial stakeholder analysis. The
                  challenge, but at the same time an important feature, of PEA is to go further and
                  understand details about incentives, motivations and reasons behind the influence
                  of some.
        Use the template below to present a stakeholder analysis. The standard headings are often
         just influence and interest, but others have been added here and can be useful for FSM
         policy and programming decisions.
             o Data for this will come from a broad range of sources: interviews with government
                  and service provider stakeholders; interviews with key informants; focus group
                  discussions with relevant stakeholders; FSM policy documents and other relevant
                  FSM service delivery guidelines; other relevant literature.

One way to ensure the stakeholder analysis goes beyond a superficial analysis is to also map
stakeholders onto a matrix. A stakeholder interest or power matrix typically maps two variables that
describe a stakeholder’s interests in and influence / power over a particular issue, “problem” or
policy. These are the two standard variables but if useful, a third dimension could also be added by
using different sized circles for each stakeholder (e.g. to represent a stakeholder’s importance 13,
for instance).

The position of each stakeholder on the map conveys important information (how supportive and
influential a particular stakeholder is) and can show a more nuanced positioning than the table
above (e.g. slight differences can be seen more easily when shown graphically rather than
described simply in text, although the positioning and differences also need to be explained).

The process of placing each stakeholder can be done by the team conducting the PEA based on
their analysis of data they have gathered. It can also be done with the help of selected key
informants, or as part of a focus group discussion, and the two can be compared. When done in a
more participatory manner it is the process and discussion around placing each stakeholder that
can produce the most interesting insights – i.e. understanding why particular stakeholders are
positioned where they are relative to each other, and what that means in terms of how change
occurs or can occur.

Even when done by the team alone, the process of placing stakeholders helps deepen the analysis
beyond the simple mapping above – it encourages the team to think about why they are placing
each stakeholder in a particular place and relative to another, and to justify this internally. This may
even lead to a revision of the mapping and initial analysis.

The following questions are useful starting points in order to guide a discussion:

        What is the interest of each stakeholder in the issue, and what is it based on? Why does a
         specific stakeholder have a particular interest in the issue?
        What is the formal and/or informal basis of power and influence of a specific actor?
        Why does a specific stakeholder have little or significant influence over the issue? How
         does this compare to other actors?

  Importance in this case means the priority given to satisfying or addressing the needs and interests of a particular
stakeholder from the perspective of an FSM intervention or project.

Process mapping
A useful tool to provide more depth to the institutional analysis, while at the same time
understanding certain processes, can be a process map. Process mapping illustrates the network
of flows of decision making, resources or information. It is a comprehensive flow diagram that can
be used to identify bottlenecks and constraints and to analyse opportunities for changing
processes to make them more efficient and effective. In PEA, process mapping can help
understand how both formal and informal institutions affect the implementation or functioning of
different processes, showing how processes are intended to work but also how they actually work
in practice (e.g. as a result of institutional pressures and/or support). Process mapping is a very
flexible tool and one can map everything from the budget process, acquiring a planning
permission, obtaining a driver’s license, or informal flows of money in specific organisations.

Steps in process mapping
The following steps (adapted from Holland, 2007) outline a general approach to mapping an
existing process (the “as-is” process). It can be adapted to suit the particular PEA objectives and
questions, and the local context.

        First, it’s important to be clear about the process (or processes) to be mapped. This should
         clearly be directly related to the PEA objectives, focus and questions, but might have been
         identified beforehand (particularly if the process is a central focus of the PEA) or through
         the analysis of foundational factors or stakeholders (i.e. it might have arisen as an
         important process to understand more only during the on-going analysis).
        Once the process has been identified, it’s important to define the objectives of the mapp ing
         more clearly too. Objectives could include, for example, understanding how the budget
         process works in a decentralised context; identifying opportunities for process
         improvement; identifying and resolving blockages or restrictions; understanding and
         reducing risks; or identifying entry points for engagement. Being clear about these will help
         ensure that the right level of detail is known. This could range from broad organisational
         levels to the fine details of a work process.
        Once the objectives are clear, the starting and end points of the process can be defined
         (essentially the ‘boundaries’). This helps avoid the process map moving beyond what is

                                                                                                          54

         needed. Move through from the start point, identifying key steps or activities in the process
         as you go.
        The data or information needed to complete a process map can come from three main
         sources: self-generation by teams or individuals, interviews and focus group discussions,
         and observation. In practice, this will depend on the process itself, the PEA objectives and
         questions, but most information will probably come from the first two sources. In some
         cases, a review of manuals or policies and procedures will also help, particularly in
         identifying the formal process as it is meant to be.


Individual interviews with people directly and indirectly involved in the process will provide useful
information for creating the map. Group interviews with a number of people (a sample or all)
involved in the process can also increase the participation of different stakeholders in the actual
mapping. When interviewing people involved in the process, ensure that they understand the
objectives of the mapping and how it will be used.

It might also be necessary and beneficial to ask questions of people involved in the process about
their experiences with the process (such as problems they have had), areas they think can be
improved, how the process might vary, if and how the process is done differently by different
people, any unnecessary steps they perceive, and so forth. These responses will help identify
areas of the process that might need improvement. Involve as many process stakeholders in the
analysis as possible to get a wide range of perspectives. It is important to understand why a
process is not operating as intended if improvements are to be made.

Process maps can use different symbols to show what occurs in a process. This can help in
understanding what particular people do, or what particular activities are, for instance. However, it
is sensible to keep the number of different symbols in a map as low as possible to prevent
confusion. Process maps can become very complex, very quickly. Develop rough drafts and revise
them often as the map develops. Sticky notes or cards can also be useful when developing the
map – stick the notes on a large sheet of paper or whiteboard and move them around (or throw
them away) as the map develops.

Use concise sentences for each step in the process to show what is happening, where it is
happening, when it is happening, who is doing it, how long it is taking, how it is being done, and
why it is being done. This information will come from the sources discussed above. However, if
there is missing information then systematically asking these questions can also help show any
knowledge gaps, which can then be filled by gathering further information from relevant people or
sources.

Good analysis is key for a process map to be useful. Depending on the PEA objectives and focus
questions, the following questions will help develop and analyse a process map:

        What are the main steps and/or activities in the process? Who designed these steps /
         activities and who is implementing them? Who else is involved in each step / activity?
        Which areas are working as the process was intended, and which are not? What are the
         repercussions? Why are they not working as intended (this might bring in a range of
         information related to foundational factors and stakeholder analysis)?
        Are there any wide separations of decision making from process implementation?
        Is there shared responsibility for steps among several people?
        Are there excessive control points (for example, many layers of approval), and what
         implications does this have? Who controls the process and what are their interests?
        What value does each activity or step add?
        Who benefits (for example, which stakeholders)?

                                                                                                           55

        Could any steps be combined, run in parallel rather than serial, completed faster, or
         eliminated? Why aren’t they?
        What linkages are there between different steps?


Taking into account this analysis, the map can be adjusted to incorporate any new information.
This can be done on an iterative basis as needed, but it is useful to document any alterations are
fully so that it is clear who made the changes and when they were made.

Annex B                       Data collection instruments and TORs

The Data Collection Instruments (with associated protocols) and TORs are separate documents.
The various data collection instruments and the research methods associated with them are
summarized in the table below.

The TORs should be adapted to a given city context, depending on which tools are planned to be
used and the focus of the work. The consultants would need to be provided with the protocols and
data collection instruments (once adapted). These are summarized in the table below.
