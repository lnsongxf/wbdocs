organizations in the developing countries are our first clients

  the project as the result of new learnings or newly articulated
  priorities, but having clearly defined and agreed upon targets
  prior to initiating activities will help manage expectations
  and support clear communication between project partners
  and stakeholders.

  Further, it is important to recognize that open data projects
  are fundamentally about affecting behavior and relationships.
  Meaningful change related institutional and individual
  interaction with risk information is a significant undertaking.
  Too often, interventions in this space take the form of short,
  discrete activities without a broader vision or operational theory
  of change. Sustained engagement is required for open data
  projects to achieve success.

    Example: OpenDRI Analysis Tool
  ///                                   ///




  The OpenDRI analysis tool provides a common reference
  methodology and guidelines for implementation of OpenDRI
  projects. After the initial engagement with government’s DRM
  experts through which project goals and user needs are defined,
  a typical next step is an in-depth assessment of technological
  capacity and data availability. This guide provides templates
  for conducting IT assessments interviews with stakeholders,
  as well as reference data models to understand potential gaps
  in existing risk related datasets. A report is then generated
  describing the status of available resources with respect
  to desired implementation, offering options for proposed
  investments needed to achieve project goals. The OpenDRI
  analysis tool finally provides clear practical guidelines and
  checklists for developing efficient Geonode projects through
  which risk related data is aggregated, managed and shared.

and practices of the global open data movement to bear on the challenges of reducing vulnerability to
natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. OpenDRI has been active in over 35 countries around
the world in efforts to improve the sharing, collection, and communication of risk information.
