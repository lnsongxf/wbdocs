Key Features
 STRUCTURE


 The Results Matrix provides an overview and aggregated results of the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund
 (ARTF) portfolio. Reading from left to right the Matrix lays out the planning hierarchy and links between the
 Afghan National Priority Programs (NPPs) and the ARTF portfolio. Reading from right to left the Matrix provides
 the implementation progress and flow: from inputs (ARTF financing and projects) to milestones/outputs to
 outcomes and indicators.


 CONTENT


 ARTF outcomes, indicators, milestones and outputs have been defined in line with the individual results
 frameworks in each of the ARTF projects as well as the Incentive Program and Recurrent Cost financing. Some
 of the indicators, milestones and outputs may relate to a single ARTF project (if it is the only project in that
 area) to a group of ARTF projects which contribute to that specific element (e.g. “roads rehabilitated” will
 aggregate data from both the rural roads projects as well as from NSP). The Results Matrix does not include all
 available indicators for all ARTF financed projects. All projects financed by ARTF have individual detailed results
 frameworks, which are accessible on the ARTF website. While the Results Matrix does not currently report results
 at the sector level, this is an area that will be further explored as part of future work on results tracking and
 reporting under the ARTF.


 UPDATES


 The ARTF Results Matrix is updated twice a year and made available at the ARTF website. Once a year it is
 included in the published ARTF Scorecard under Pillar II. The reported progress data relates to the latest available
 data provided by all the ARTF projects at the time of the update. Progress data for some of the milestones,
 outputs and outcome indicators might not change from one reporting period to another due to either a different
 data collection schedule or due to implementation pace of related activities.


 LINKAGES


 The output and outcome results of the ARTF portfolio are in the Matrix linked to the National Priority Programs
 (NPPs) and their defined objectives. NPP output/indicators are not included here as few of the NPP results
 frameworks are fully developed. As these mature the indicators can be added to the ARTF Results Matrix. It should
 be noted, however, that Government and the respective line ministries will be responsible for tracking progress
 under the NPP indicators and results frameworks. While the ARTF feeds into the indicators agreed under the
 Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF), these indicators are not included in this Results Matrix as they
 are not linked directly to outputs/outcomes of the ARTF portfolio. Select process oriented TMAF indicators will
 instead be captured under Pillar IV in the ARTF Results Management Framework as they are key to measuring the
 organizational effectiveness of the trust fund.

     RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS

     PROGRESS AS OF JANUARY 2015

     •	 PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS: In the last reporting period, NSP reached $1.5 billion in total amount of block
        grants disbursed directly to Community Development Councils (CDCs) to finance priority infrastructure
        projects in the communities. The number of qualified teachers reached 190,936 up from 27,000 in 2008.
        This is an increase of 607%.

     •	 DIRECT BENEFICIARIES UNDER ARTF PROJECTS1: The approximate current number of beneficiaries of the
        ARTF is 8.1 million people for all the projects2 (except NSP), with 38% of female beneficiaries. The NSP
        is currently reaching 27.4 million beneficiaries, of which 48.5% are female.

     •	 ACCESS TO SERVICES: The following table provides a snapshot of the number of beneficiaries under the
        ARTF program with access to services including basic services and livelihoods and jobs. The results are
        based on output/outcomes of individual projects but are aggregated when possible. Please find more
        detailed information in the full Matrix below.

1 The same beneficiaries could be reached with different services; aggregation is therefore not always accurate and while efforts are made to avoid double counting it cannot
entirely be ruled out.
2 Please note, not all projects are able to count the number of beneficiaries. Rural Roads, power projects, health and governance are therefore not included in this count.

16 Due to the monitoring set-up of the health program (third party monitoring managed by Ministry of Public Health) covering the entire country the outcome indicators under health are not only attribut-
able to ARTF financed interventions. However, since ARTF is key contribution, which will increase only under the new SEHAT, these outcome indicators are still included here.
17 Since 2004 the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has shown remarkable improvement in the quality of care in Afghanistan. In 2010 MoPH revised the content of the BSC as well as its benchmarks resulting in
a different and lower score. Therefore, from 2011 the score will not be comparable with previous years.
18 Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) has in the past used an indicator on BPHS coverage, showing contractual coverage, percentage of population living in districts which have service providers to deliver
the BPHS. Recently, however, MoPH has discontinued the use of this indicator as it does not capture outreach and mobile services to remote and isolated parts of the country. It also does not capture the
fact that people may have physical access to health facilities, but may still not make use the services. MoPH therefore uses instead the utilization indicator, which is expressed in form of number of consul-
tation per person per year.
19 Budget execution rates of the budget are assumed to remain constant.

delivery of Basic Package of Health Services throughout the
country. The BSC provides a framework to efficiently look at several
key areas or domains of the health sector. Each domain is made up
of several indicators that provide information about performance
in that domain. Provincial results are color coded and for each
indicator upper and lower benchmarks have been defined based on
the performance found across the provinces in Afghanistan. This
