Abstract
This paper examines the quality of the policy intent with respect to the school-based management
system in Burkina Faso. It discusses the difference between policy intent and policy
implementation; focusing on the functionality of school councils and their synergies with
decentralization and assessment policies to achieve better learning results. A new policy diagnostic
tool, developed and revised by the World Bank and its partners including JICA was adapted to the
context of Burkina Faso. This tool is based on international evidence of good practice collected
under the System Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) program, relating to the policy
domain of School Autonomy and Accountability (SAA). First, for the quality of policy intent, those
policies that concentrate on the roles of school councils are assessed as advanced, and as emerging
directions on school autonomy through decentralization to communes of operational budget
management and teacher deployment, while policies on standardized student assessments are said
to be advanced on their frequency of use. Differences among stakeholders in the degree of policy
implementation were found using survey data collected in 2013 from various level actors, including
rural school directors, school councils, and local administrations. Regarding school councils, called
COGES (Comités de Gestion des Etablissements Scolaires), these differences are on whether such
councils exist and on how functional they are. The degree of functionality, as measured by
community and parental voluntary contributions to schools, is significantly associated with
variables relating to implementation of procedures in COGES, such as organizing a general
assembly and the Federation of COGES, while controlling for other community contexts. The level
of functionality of COGES significantly explains the observed differences in the quality of
education services and learning achievements in Burkina Faso. Moreover, the use of student
assessments is also positively related to learning achievement. The indicator representing the
common views of stakeholders on decentralization also shows a significantly positive association
with the functionality of the COGES system, and the availability of supplementary lessons. These
findings suggest that strengthening policy implementation within participatory COGES, along with
decentralization and the use of assessment tools, is important for better learning results.

Section 1: Introduction

Despite the remarkable worldwide progress towards universal primary education, more than

60 million primary school aged children do not attend school, and if we include those children

who are at school but do not acquire the basics, and those children who dropout before

reaching Grade 4, this number increases to 250 million (UNESCO 2014). At the World

Education Forum 2015, the international community committed to providing meaningful

education opportunities for out-of-school children, as well as to quality of education and to

improving learning outcomes. 1

        School-based management (SBM) is a popular domain of education policies that has

been addressed by governments and development partners to improve school participation and

learning. SBM is seen as a way to decentralize decision making power in education from the

central government to the school level (Caldwell 2005; Barrera, Fasih, and Patrinos 2009), and

the school can be represented by any combination of school directors, teachers, parents, other

community members, and students. Decentralization is expected to encourage demand for a

higher quality of schooling, ensure schools reflect local voices and priorities, and then bring

better education outcomes and beneficiary satisfaction. In practice, SBM has been introduced

in various forms and it has had a variable impact on education results.

        As an effort to systematically learn from good practices, and to benchmark these when

helping a country assess its SBM system and identify areas for improvement, the World Bank

and its partners have prepared analytical tools on school autonomy and accountability (SAA).

SAA is one of the policy domains for which analytical instruments have been developed and

tested under the program called the Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER),

which is an initiative to produce comparative data and knowledge on education policies and

institutions (Rogers and Demas 2013; Demas and Arcia 2015). Overall, the SABER program

first focused on benchmarking the quality of policy. Then, it began to more explicitly address

the gap between policy intent and policy implementation, especially for developing countries

where institutional capacities are known to be generally weak. This was a response to the

feedback from stakeholders, including the government officials of pilot countries.

        Burkina Faso, our case country in this paper, is a pilot country for SABER-SAA and a

developing country that aims to use SBM to improve education results. Despite remarkable

progress, 2 the country’s primary completion rate was only 58% in 2012 3, and more than 70%

of children of primary school age did not reach Grade 4, or achieve a minimum learning

standard in reading (UNESCO 2014, 193). The two series of regional learning assessments

(PASEC) indicate a significant decline between 1996 and 2006 in the level of student

achievement for Mathematics at Grade 2, and this decline may be due to the way school

participation has evolved (CONFEMEN 2009). Issues of both access and quality of learning

have been more prominent in rural than urban areas Vachon 2007; Chiche et al. 2010; Lewin

and Sabates 2011). The country’s education strategy (Program for Strategic Development of

Basic Education: PDSEB 2012-2021) tackles these challenges by seeking to achieve the

objectives of Education for All by 2021 (MOE 2012a). One of the five main (basic) principles

of the implementation of the PDSEB is democratic governance of the education system based

on the principles of decentralization, devolution and community participation (DEP/MOE

2013). This is also part of a larger movement concerning decentralization for Burkina Faso

that has been on-going since the 1990s. 4

        The objective of this paper is to examine the policy intent with respect to SBM and

SAA in Burkina Faso, and the difference between policy intent and policy implementation. Its

  According to the Burkina Faso Ministry of Education (2013, December), the Ten-Year Plan for the
Development of Basic Education (PDDEB) implemented between 2001 and 2010 has greatly improved
primary school enrollment. For example, between 2001 and 2010 the Gross Intake Rate (GIR) rose from
47.4 to 85.8%, the Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) from 45.9 to 74.8%, the Primary Completion Rate
(TAP) from 27.4 to 45.9%, and the success rate for gaining the Certificate of Primary Education (CEP)
from 62.3 to 65.9%.

purpose is to highlight which gaps it may be important to close in order to improve education

service delivery and results in rural primary public schools. Built on the World Bank

SABER-SAA diagnostic tool, we developed a complementary tool - a set of questionnaires to

collect detailed information on policies, their implementation, and contexts. These

complementary rubrics were used in 2013 to interview education officers, school directors,

and school councils. The opinions of these people were collected and their administrative

records documented.

        In Section 2 the paper explains the SABER-based analytical framework. Section 3

analyzes the policy intent, which updates and details what the World Bank’s SABER-SAA

assessment found in 2011-2012. Section 4 explains the descriptive statistics of policy

implementation, and presents the empirical analyses. Lastly, Section 5 discusses the

implications for policy reforms and policy monitoring mechanisms.



Section 2: Analytical Framework

2.1 A framework for assessing the SBM system for better education results

To assess the quality of the SBM system (its policy intent), this paper adopts the framework

for what matters most in school autonomy and accountability (SAA) with respect to better

education results. The framework and analytical tools for SAA were prepared by the World

Bank in collaboration with JICA and other partners under the SABER program, according to

global best practice and empirical evidence (see Demas and Arcia 2015 for details).

        The SABER-SAA framework seeks to identify what combination of school

management practices is important for successful education outcomes (Figure 1). As Arcia et

al (2014) point out, while such management practices are still under study, the lessons learned

in the last 30 years indicate that combining managerial autonomy, assessing students learning,

and being accountable to parents and other stakeholders tends to produce good school

performance and increased learning (Bruns, Filmer, and Patrinos 2011). School management


                                              4
under autonomy (with decision-making authority over their operations) may give an important

role to the School Council (e.g. Parent-Teacher Associations), which can include represents of

parents and communities. Although accountability was not initially linked with school

autonomy, in the mid-1990s the concept of autonomy with accountability became increasingly

important (Demas and Arcia 2015). The results from PISA also suggest that combination of

autonomy and accountability tend to be associated with better student performance (OECD

2011). The experience of high-performing countries on PISA, for example, show that

education systems in which schools have more autonomy over resource allocation and those

that publish test results perform better than schools with less autonomy.

        The SABER-SAA framework is detailed as a set of policy goals and action indicators

to be used to benchmark SBM systems or policies on school autonomy and accountability to

ensure better school performance (Table 1). Five policy goal indicators are specified as below

on the basis of empirical evidence from various countries (see Bruns, Filmer, and Patrinos

2011 for a review of the literature, and Demas and Arcia 2015 for summary evidence on each

policy goal identified by SABER-SAA), along with cautions over differences in country

contexts, including the level of capacity of local stakeholders, that can affect how SAA

reforms work:

z   Policy Goal 1, “school autonomy in budget planning and management,” is assessed
    against the degree of local and school authority over school budgets or funds that may
    lead to better incorporation of the interests of local stakeholders and parents, and
    improvements in operational efficiency;
z   Policy Goal 2, “school autonomy in personnel management,” is assessed against the
    degree of local and school authority over personnel appointments and deployment;
z   Policy Goal 3, “the role of school councils in school governance,” is assessed against the
    degree of the participation of school councils (or PTAs) in school finance and activities,
    and how these have been organized to foster a better understanding of their roles and the
    execution of their roles in a transparent and inclusive manner;
z   Policy Goal 4, “school and student assessment, “ is measured against policies that ensure
    regular measurement of student progress as a key precondition for ensuring accountability,
    and against the routine use and sharing of assessment results among various levels of
    stakeholders to reflect and make pedagogical, operational, and personnel adjustments for
    the purpose of improving student performance; and
z   Policy Goal 5, “school accountability”, is assessed by analyzing the way in which
    stakeholders receive comprehensive information on their schools, and how far the school



                                               5
     complies with its own regulations.



2.2 A framework for assessing both policy intent and policy implementation

Education outcomes depend not only on the quality of the policies themselves and the

institutional framework within which they operate, but also on whether those policies and

frameworks are implemented effectively at the local and school level (Rogers and Demas 2013,

11). As Figure 2 illustrates, SABER attempts to address “what lies between an education

system’s inputs (the monetary and other resources that go into it) and its outcomes (such as

years of education completed and learning acquired by students)”, which is often a “black

box”. The elements of this approach can be conceptually categorized into three sets (Rogers

and Demas 2013, 4). The first concerns the quality of policies and institutions, and the second

concerns the quality of policy implementation. Both of these are assumed to have major

influences on the third set (the quality of education delivered), which in turn affects student

learning outcomes.

        We applied the conceptual framework of the SABER result chain to our analysis of the

relationship between policy intent and policy implementation, and to the relationship between

better policy implementation and education results. We also added another set of elements on

the means and contexts that can support policy implementation in terms of each actor’s

leadership, organizational characteristics, and community characteristics. Then, by reviewing

the SABER-SAA policy implementation rubrics 5 and the existing tools of other school and

administration surveys, the research team developed a range of complementary tools: a set of

questionnaires for sub-national (regional, provincial, district, and commutes) and school-level

actors in Burkina Faso (discussed further in Section 4).



5
  The World Bank team conducted an assessment of policy implementation on school autonomy and
accountability for Thailand (Arcia et al. 2014). They used an instrument that asked school directors to
choose one of four scaled options for each sub-indicator (using the 2011 version of the SABER-SAA
rubrics).

Section 3: Quality of Policy Intent

3.1 Methodology

As discussed in Section 2, we adapted the SABER-SAA framework and tools to assess the

quality of SBM systems and policies on SAA in Burkina Faso. We collected laws, decrees,

policy documents, and manuals from relevant central ministries of Burkina Faso in 2013 to

update the information used for the previous SABER-SAA policy assessment that was

conducted in 2011 6. The information was analyzed and scored using a rubric for each of

corresponding policy goals and actions 7 (see Annex 1c for the detailed rubrics). This rubric

allows for country policies scored by each individual policy action to be assigned to one of

four levels of development: 1 (latent), 2 (emerging), 3 (established), or 4 (advanced).

        As in the 2011 assessment, we focused on primary education, 8 which is overseen by

the Ministry of National Education and Literacy (MOE). The MOE coordinates with the

Ministry of Administration and Decentralization in charge of decentralization of educational

resources to communes. MOE also coordinates with the sub-national or de-concentrated

offices in 13 regions, 45 provinces, and more than 350 districts. That is, there are regional

education offices (REO), provincial education offices (PEO), and district education offices

(DEO). Thus, we defined the terms of “sub-national” or “local” authorities as the

  The results were published in 2012 (World Bank 2012). See also Annex 1a for the results.
7
  The SABER-SAA policy rubrics were modified by the World Bank in 2013 to reflect various
countries’ needs for benchmarking according to feedback from data collection in various countries,
including Burkina Faso. The five policy goals are the same in the 2011 and 2013 versions of the World
Bank’s SABER-SAA tools, while some policy actions (or sub-indicators) were added and revised for
the 2013 version (as explained in the presentation of the World Bank, Burkina Faso in December 2013).
Annex 1c includes remarks on revisions of the instruments of SABER-SAA. For the update of 2013,
the research team first used the previous tool (2011 version) with additional elements focusing on the
role of school councils, as the team originally saw from in-country feedback seminars that the 2011
rubric had some limitations when addressing this aspect. Meanwhile, the Bank team revised the rubrics
for the 2013 version, including more on school councils, and thus the research team adjusted the study
results to this 2013 version of the World Bank SAA. However, our data cannot adequately cover some
other revised elements, and these are not included in Figure 3.

  The formal education system is on a 6-4-3 format for primary, lower and upper secondary education.

de-concentrated offices or the communes as in the 2011 assessment. Regarding school councils,

while the 2011 assessment defined these as being the APE (“Association des Parents d’Elèves”,

parents associations in French), we defined them as being the COGES (Comités de Gestion

des Etablissements Scolaires, or school management committees in French) in the 2013

assessment to reflect the government’s regulations 9 and the new official guidelines on

COGES, approved in 2013. 10



3.2 Quality of policy intent

Figure 3 provides a snapshot of both the 2011 and 2013 assessment results of the quality of

policy intent calculated by the policy goal indicators of each year’s SABER-SAA rubrics, and

presents the detailed results by sub-indicator for 2013. The figure shows the scores from 1 to 4

for each indicator.

            Overall, the scores on policy goal indicators increased between 2011 and 2013. In

particular, a major change over the two years is observed in respect of Policy Goal 3 on the

roles of school councils (SC), with the scores appearing to be high for 2013. In that year, the

government authorized a new nationwide guideline for SCs, and this guideline justifies a high

score on the policy sub-indicators of 3D, 3E, and 3F (score 4 or 3). The descriptions of

corresponding rubrics on these policy sub-indicators for 2013 are as follows (see Annex 1b for

details):

z    There are “formal institutions, manuals, and mandates for organizing volunteers to plan,

     implement, and evaluate activities” for 3D (score 4);

10
   COGES was recognized as the school administration and management body by a 2008 decree, with
the expectation that it would strengthen the management of basic education through local communities’
closer involvement (MEBA 2007). To make the new policy work, JICA has provided technical
assistance through a project called PACOGES since 2009 (JICA 2012b), learning lessons from the
successful nationwide scale-up of COGES in Niger (Honda and Kato 2013). PACOGES has assisted the
Government of Burkina Faso in developing the manuals for COGES organization and functions,
training stakeholders, and monitoring progress in pilot regions (originally 2, and then 4 regions) (JICA
2012b, 2013). Reflecting these pilot experiences, the manual was revised and authorized by the
government as a nationwide official guideline in 2013.



                                                   8
z    there are “provisions for regularly scheduled elections of SC members and defined term

     limits” for 3F (score 4), “(SC has) legal authority to voice an opinion and legal oversight

     on some learning inputs to the classroom” for 3E (score 3); and

z   “(SC has) legal standing as an organization, and legal authority to have a voice, but no

    legal oversight authority on budget issues” for 3B (score 3).


        The guidelines give instructions on how individual COGES are to prepare and

implement school action plans and prepare financial and progress reports. There are no

regulatory restrictions on the scope of financing sources or expenditure items, except for the

basic salary of teachers (or contracting full time teachers). They also define the democratic

organizational structure: the COGES would have two types of members, the first type being

decided by regulation and includes the mayor or her alternate, the president of APE, the

president of AME (mother association), the school director, the teachers’ representative, other

NGO’s representatives, and a union representative. The second type of members are those who

belong to the executive board, which is composed of elected members (president, treasurer,

public communication officer, and girls’ education officer), and the school director who is by

right the secretary general. Elected members are elected by secret ballot every 3 years at a

general assembly (GA). The GA is the supreme body of the COGES, and is composed of all

community members and people related to the school. The GA is in charge of identifying and

prioritizing a school’s issues, assigning direct priority to actions, validating the yearly school

action plan, and adopting the budget of the annual action plan.

        Also, at the commune level all schools COGES are federated in a structure presided

over by the mayor called the CCC (Coordination Communale des COGES), whose role is to

reinforce the involvement of local authorities in the management of the education system (see

Figure 4 for organizational structures). Through this structure, the COGES have a direct access

to the mayor and can weigh in on the local authorities’ decisions that impact them. Thus, each




                                                9
COGES has a voice in the planning and preparation of non-salary items, either directly in the

school action plan or through the CCC at municipal level. When those items fall under their

action plan, they also have final responsibility for their preparation and implementation.

However when those items fall under other budgets, the mayor has the final responsibility

(thus score 2 for sub-indicator 3A). For personnel management however, there is no legal right

or voice in teacher appointments and removals (thus score 1 for sub-indicator of 3C).

        For Policy Goals 1 and 2 on school autonomy in the management of budgets and

personnel, Figure 3 indicates that there are variations among the policy action sub-indicators.

That is, policy scores depend on areas of responsibilities, some of which are decentralized as

described below:

z    Legal management authority over the operational budget 11 is at the municipal level,

     according to the 2009 decree 12 on transferring government resources for primary

     education to communes 13 (justifying score 2 for Policy Action 1A);

z    The 2009 decree on decentralization would allow regional or municipal governments

     (communes) to deploy teachers within their jurisdiction (justifying score 3 for Policy

     Action 2A); and




11
   The definition of an operational budget in the SABER SAA data collection tool set is: “The budget
transferred through the government channels for the day-to-day operation of schools, excluding salaries
for teachers and non-teaching staff, and capital costs like school construction. Parental and community
contributions as well as other government expenditure lines can be considered as additional funds.”

   The transfer of competences to communes is progressive (art 5 law 0055-2004). The transfer of
competences regarding health, pre-schooling, basic education, alphabetization, youth, culture and sports
must have been effective in 2005 at the latest for urban communes (art 76), and three years after the
creation of the elected municipal council for rural communes (art 77). Since every commune in Burkina
Faso participated in the 2006 election, then all communes (rural or urban) should theoretically have
those competences from 2010 on. The 2009 decree and the associated governmental letters (arrêté)
transfer funds for school materials (not including production of textbooks), utilities, renovation of
buildings, and so on.

           For Policy Action 1D on the legal authority to raise additional funds for the school, the

score is “latent” if this is to be done by the school as an institution, while it is “advanced” if it

is to be done by the COGES for the school. A COGES can “raise additional funds from any

source.” According to the 2007 law, 14 all types of fees (e.g. registration fee) during

compulsory education are abolished. Yet, voluntary participation by community to cooperate

with the government or local government is admitted.

           In regard to school grant programs, which would transfer funds directly to the account

of an individual school or school level committee for their operational plans, the Burkinabe

education system does not yet have such program in place. A pilot program that transfers to

school councils a grant fund specific for canteen operation is however being experimented

with (MOE 2012ab). For Policy Action 1E on collaborative budget planning, the score is also

“latent”, as “budgetary decisions are made at the national and sub-national levels.” Even

though COGES can influence commune budgets through their commune level federation

presided over by the mayor (CCC) (MOE 2013, 80-81), there is no obligation for the

commune or the national budget to take COGES plans into account.

           For Policy Goal 4 on assessment, Figure 3 shows that scores are high for the existence

of student assessments (Policy Action 4C), as various student assessments exist, such as the

graduation exam, provincial standardized assessment for several grades by trimester,

semi-annual national assessment, and a regional assessment called PASEC (see Table 2). Yet,

for the creation of school assessments for making school policy adjustments (pedagogical,

operational, and personnel), the central level policy intent is still emerging. This policy intends

to share the results with regions, but it is not clear whether the intent is to disseminate the

results to schools with recommendations for improvement (Policy Action 4D). Policy Actions

4A and 4B on school assessments, their frequency, and their use have been established (score

3). School assessments are done at least yearly by the inspectors of the DEO, using a standard

form for their assessment. On school assessment, the school director is to be given the school

assessment report by the DEO, together with any recommendations for pedagogical and

operational adjustments. However, those are not required to be shared with the public.



Section 4: Quality of Policy Implementation

4.1 Methodology

(a)   Data sources

The quality of policy intent at the central level was assessed in the previous section, here we

investigate the current status of policy implementation at the Meso and school levels, and

identify any differences compared to the initial policy intent. From April to May 2013, we

conducted questionnaire-based interview surveys with the various levels of education actors,

including school directors, presidents of school councils and parental associations, the

representatives of mayoral offices, and those of the district education offices, provinces and

regions in Burkina Faso. 15

        Our procedures in the selection of samples at each level were as follows. First, among


15
    At first, 3 schools that had students in 6th grade were randomly selected in each commune, using the
list of schools available from MOE. Then the team adjusted the number of schools per commune based
on the total number of schools in the area (the team also identified a few additional schools that could
be replaced with the sample schools per commune during the field survey as needed). However, largely
because MOE provided the survey team with the contact information of school directors and
administration officers and the survey team called them before the survey, most of the pre-identified
sample schools were reachable during the visits. The survey reports do not indicate cases where
respondent declined to answer. This research focused on rural areas, which have larger educational
challenges as compared with urban areas, and the share of rural schools is more than 80% in our sample
regions (see PADECO Co Ltd (2014) for details of data used in sampling). We sampled only public
schools, which also account for 80% or more of the total schools in the sample regions. We focused
only on public schools partly because the policy context is different between public and private schools,
and the 2011 World Bank’s SABER-SAA assessment and its tools also focus on public schools. For
SABER, there is a policy domain for engaging the private sector, and the policy assessment for Burkina
Faso is being done, but the results are not yet available (as of 2014).



                                                   12
the 14 regions of the country, four regions were selected in collaboration with Ministry of

Education officers, based on their share of rural population, their share of public primary

schools, the existence of JICA technical assistance on their school councils, the levels of

learning results, access, and other socioeconomic indicators such as poverty incidence and

population density, as well the security situation. The four regions selected consisted of two

regions supported by PACOGES 1, the Central Plateau and Central East regions, and two

others, the Central West and South West regions (see Figure 5). Second, all of the 14

provincial education offices (PEO) under those four regional education offices (REO) were

selected, and 70% of the communes of each of those provinces were randomly chosen. As a

result, 93 district education offices (DEO) for 90 rural communes (mayoral offices) were

selected. 16 Finally, we sampled 303 public schools in total, by randomly selecting schools that

had students in Grade 6 in each commune. About 12% of the public schools (or 18% of the

public schools with students in Grade 6) in the targeted regions were covered.

        While the contents of the questionnaires were different depending on each level of

actor, we asked common types of questions: (i) the implementation status of policies and

official procedures focusing on the policy action indicators relevant to each actor among the

SABER-SAA policy rubrics; (ii) the policy contexts and capacities of each actor in terms of

leadership, budgetary and organizational characteristics, and community characteristics; and

(iii) the actual status and perception of services delivered and their educational outcomes. 17

        The datasets of all actors were merged into one whose basic unit of analysis is the

school. In addition, we utilized the MOE’s annual school statistics database, 18 especially the

data on the number of students and textbooks per school. In the next section we overview the

16
   In a few cases, two DEOs oversee different schools under the same commune.

(2014).
18
   MOE collects basic statistics from all primary schools at the beginning of every school year, using
the questionnaire (called “ENQUÊTE ANNUELLE”) covering basic school information. MOE also
publishes reports, called “national education statistics” (ANNUAIRE STATISTIQUE DE
L’EDUCATION NATIONAL). For each of these, the research team received the raw data by school
from the MOE.

status of policy implementation, means of support, education service delivery, and learning

outcomes, using the merged dataset of our survey and MOE’s database.

(b) Two analytical steps

Using the datasets explained above, we examine the following questions about the

relationships between policy intent and policy implementation, and between better policy

implementation and education results, according to the framework of the SABER result chain

explained in Section 2:


(1) What gaps exist between policy intent and implementation? How does policy

    implementation differ within the country?

(2) What can be the means for better implementation? Which policy implementation appears

    to be more important for a better service delivery? Is better implementation related to

    better student learning results and other education outcomes? Which policy

    implementation appears to be important to have better results?


        For the first set of questions, we prepared descriptive statistics based on the variables

that would enable us to measure the differences between policy intent and implementation and

the degree of implementation among stakeholders such as schools, COGEs and communes. As

we assumed that the policy goal that has improved over the past years more than others (Policy

Goal 3) might show a large difference between policy intent and implementation, and we are

also interested in the role of school councils, we first present the results relating to this policy

goal. After reviewing these descriptive statistics, we discuss the statistical models required to

further analyze the second set of questions (see also Section 4.3.1).




                                                14
4.2 The difference between policy intent and policy implementation

(a) Policy implementation on the role of the School Council

To what extent has the policy on COGES been implemented? First of all, we find that all the

sample schools in the two PACOGES regions have a COGES, while there is no COGES

actively functioning in the other 2 regions. Next, focusing on the two PACOGES regions, we

outline the degree of policy implementation on COGES and the differences among schools

(Table 3). For community participation Policy Action 3D, although almost all of the COGES

have a plan of action, differences appear in terms of the target, the scope of funding sources,

the presence of the progress report or financial report, the number of activities, the amount of

the monetary contribution they mobilized, and the implementation rates of their action plans.

The average number of activities in the action plan is six, and the types of activities also vary,

while many action plans include construction of classrooms, learning materials, mock exams,

supplementary lessons (provided by teachers at schools on the days/hours outside

regular/normal school schedules), and school meals. 73% of school directors responded that

the COGES make progress reports while the rest did not (see Figure 6 for an example). While

the amount of contribution from COGES and APE to school activities also varies by school,

the mean is 391,206 CFA (about 800 USD), or about 7000 CFA per student in Grade 6. For

about half of the COGES (or schools with COGES), the financing source is not only parents

but other community members or the communes. The implementation rate of the plan also

differs, and 58% of schools implemented more than half of what they had planned.

        More than 90% of COGESs elected their president and treasurers as intended in the

guidelines relating to Policy Action 3F on transparency in community participation.

Interestingly, a majority of schools also elected the president of their APE (who is also a board

member of the COGES). COGES presidents were mostly elected within the last three years

(2009-2011), and hold the evidence of their investiture (the minutes of general assembly that

elected COGES members). For the year of the survey 2012/13, most COGES also held a


                                               15
general assembly at least once and responded that they had prepared a plan in the GA in a

participatory way, although some 20% had not held a GA yet. More than 90% of COGEs have

at least one female COGE board member as intended by the policy.

        One interesting area related to the role of COGES is collaborative budget planning

(Policy Action 1E). While the government budget cycle does not yet require communes to

review the COGES action plan in the process, some SDs perceived that their plans were used

by the commune or district education offices. This could be a good sign of the increasing voice

of communities in regular government budget via SC. The proportion is higher for COGES

than for APE, so as expected COGES can enhance the voice of parents and communities

through an increasing institutional involvement.

        To strengthen communications among the COGES in each district, and the linkage

between COGES and mayoral offices, there is a new policy to organize CCC or federation of

COGES. 61% of SDs answered that a union (federation) of COGES or APE exists in their

district. It should also be noted that there are differences among stakeholders in the perception

or awareness about the presence of these federations. However, even when district education

offices responded affirmatively on the presence of such federations, the same district’s

mayoral office or school directors might not necessarily respond that it is present. This may be

because the federation is newly established or that it does not have an active relation with the

school level stakeholders and/or with mayoral offices, and thus its presence is not well known.

        For the general capacity of stakeholders which could also affect policy implementation,

the differences identified among stakeholders include, for example, the level of education of

school directors and COGES presidents, and their work experiences (Annex 2).

(b) Policy implementation on autonomy

How does policy implementation differ from the policy intent according the opinions of

stakeholders? Table 4 compares the answers of school directors, the DEO, and communes to




                                               16
the questions on who has responsibilities for the management of operational budget of

non-textbook materials, and for teacher deployment (Policy Goals 1A and 2A, respectively). In

Burkina Faso, the authority for these issues is supposed to be decentralized to mayoral offices.

While the majority of such offices chose themselves, 37% or 60% of SDs or district education

offices chose “mayoral offices,” respectively.

        These variables represent the perceptions of stakeholders, and thus the differences

could affect the understanding and degree of collaboration among them under the policy intent

to gradually transfer responsibilities to communes; a policy allowing responsibilities to be

shared between the central ministry, regional, provincial, and district offices, and communes.

For example, a local newspaper related how a mayor complained about what he perceived to

be a district education office that did not respect his office as he, the mayor, has the final

authority on teachers’ deployment to primary schools in the commune, and was thus entitled to

ignore education office proposals as well as teachers’ protests. 19

(c) Policy implementation on the dissemination of assessment results

Table 5 shows whether schools received the results of student assessment examinations, and

how they used these results. It corresponds to Policy Goal 4. As confirmed in the previous

section, Burkina Faso has student assessment systems, and the results are supposed to be

shared with regional education offices, but the question is whether they are disseminated to

school level as well.

        Considering the national graduation examination (CEP) that students take at the end of

Grade 6, about one-third of SDs responded that they had received both results and

recommendations, and 60% of the DEOs responded that their schools had received

recommendations. These responses reflect an implementation status that goes beyond the

                                                 17
policy intent. The policy intent is not clearly set for the central ministry in relation to

analyzing the CEP results, or making recommendations for pedagogical and operational

adjustments at school level; however, this does not prevent sub-national offices doing so. As a

technical constraint, the central ministry does not have a CEP database at school level. The

data is for each DEO or province. Thus, the ministry cannot analyze the CEP results along

with other school-level data collected in accordance with its mandates, such as annual school

statistics and the teacher database.

        For provincial standardized assessments, which are often conducted per trimester, the

pattern is similar. About one-third of SDs responded that schools have received

recommendations, and 60% of DEOs responded that schools have responded to these.

However, regarding the national learning assessment survey (EAS), which is conducted every

two years and targets students of two grades in nationwide representative sample schools

(round 400 schools), a large proportion of SDs did not receive the results, and they do not

appear to know anything about this survey. Thus, if the country improves its way of analyzing

and disseminating results to schools and communities, it may also help individual COGES to

discuss and be more functional in terms of learning achievement.

        On the use of the results of examinations, some schools responded they receive the

results with recommendations to be used for pedagogical and operational changes, while

others receive the results only. This difference represents to some extent regional or provincial

efforts, and a new guideline has been developed to clarify the procedure. 20




4.3 Better policy implementation and education results

In the previous two sections, we reviewed the condition of policy implementation and

educational contexts in Burkina Faso. This section examines policy implementation on school

autonomy, accountability, and participation econometrically, focusing on the roles of school

councils and their linkage to other actors. Based on the analytical framework of the SABER

result chain presented in Section 2, we conducted three analyses: (1) on what variables might

explain differences in the degree of policy implementation regarding school councils; (2) on

how policy implementation is related to quality and quantity of educational services; and (3)

on how policy implementation is associated with the learning outcomes of students.

        The first analysis is to examine the factors that explain the differences in the degree of

policy implementation on school councils, in terms of the functionality of the COGES. As the

dependent variable, we mainly adopt the amount of COGES and APE financing contribution

per student of Grade 6 (“SC contributions” hereafter), along with other measures of the degree

of policy implementation. Considering that in Burkina Faso, public schools with school

councils have full autonomy and accountability in relation to these funds, this variable was

assumed to be a representative indicator of the degree of implementation of policies relating to

SAA when focusing on the role of school councils.

        The explanatory variables were prepared from the categories below, by considering the

results of descriptive statistics and correlation data (see Table 6 for the list of variables):


z Variables on the implementation of intended procedures of COGES (Policy Goal 3). These

    include dummy variables on holding the participatory general assembly, and on having

    more than 25% of parents participating in the last general assembly meeting;

z Variables related to policy implementation on autonomy, decentralization, and assessment

    (Policy Goals 1, 2 and 4), such as category variables on DEO having a common view with

    communes on the implementation of responsibilities over teacher deployment and

    purchase of non-textbook materials (an indicator for school autonomy having the decision

    making closer to school with decentralized authority, communes), and on school directors




                                                  19
    using the CEP results to make pedagogical, operational, and personnel adjustments for

    school (an indicator how assessment results are being used); and

z Other than these variables, we controlled for variables covering the supporting means

    related to COGES, such as the frequency of meetings between the DEO and COGES

    representatives, the existence of a union of COGES or APE, and the holding of teacher

    information sessions by mayoral offices. Variables on other supporting means, such as the

    education level and experience of leaderships (of school directors, presidents of COGES,

    and DEO chief officers), and variables describing non-policy contexts, such as the

    proportion of poor families, and the percentage of parents who speak French, were also

    included.


        We regressed the variable of SC financing contributions on these explanatory variables

by using Tobit models. This was because 15% of school directors answered that there had been

zero amount of financial contributions; that is, SC contributions are left-censored at zero,

which causes the coefficients of OLS estimation to be biased and inconsistent. We used a

Probit model for the regression of the dummy variable on the implementation, and an OLS

model for the regression of the number of activities.

        The second analysis was to examine how policy implementation leads to changes in

the quality and quantity of educational services. The dependent variables are: the total hours of

supplementary lessons in March 2013, the dummy variables covering whether more than half

of Grade 6 students study per day at home by one hour or more, and the amount of distributed

textbooks (see Annex 2b for descriptive statistics). Shortages of textbooks and learning hours

remain important issues for primary education in Burkina Faso (JICA 2011a; Frolich and

Michaelowa 2011). These variables on education services are also assumed to be sensitive to

the degree of policy implementation by the COGES, through their participatory voice and

financial contributions. Thus, key explanatory variables concern policy implementation by the




                                               20
COGES, decentralized autonomy for communes, and the use of assessment results. We

controlled for variables relating to supporting means, to policy contexts that could be more

relevant depending on each dependent variable, and non-policy characteristics. Considering

the characteristics of the dependent variables, we used a Tobit model for the regression

analyses of distributed textbooks and hours of supplementary lessons, because these two

variables are left-censored at zero. We also use a Probit model to model the duration of

homework.

        The third analysis is to examine the effect of policy implementation on learning

outcomes, measured by the pass rate of the CEP exam at the end of Grade 6. The key

explanatory variables are seen as the policy implementation by the COGES, measured as the

SC’s contribution, which in turn is assumed to have a significant association with the pass rate

of the CEP exam. As for the second analysis above, we also controlled for variables relating to

supporting means and non-policy contexts here. With regard to policy contexts, we included

other variables such as the student to teacher ratio and the qualification of teachers, which are

assumed to be less sensitive to COGES activity in the current situation in Burkina Faso, since

the hiring of contract teachers is not to be done by the COGES. Since the pass rate of the CEP

exam is censored from both sides at zero and 100%, we adopted a two-limit Tobit model.

        In all the regression models in this section, we utilized the samples from the two

PACOGES regions, and controlled the fixed effects for the six provinces of those two regions

where deconcentrated education offices are responsible for primary education administration.

We note that the standard errors are clustered at the commune (town) level, which is the

decentralized authority for primary education.



4.3.2   Estimation results

(a) What explains differences in policy implementation on school councils?

As Table 7 shows, SC contributions per Grade 6 student are significantly associated with all



                                                 21
key indicators of the implementation of the SAA policies, even after controlling for the

contexts of schools (such as the education and experience of the school director, the COGES

presidents and the DEO head), and of the communities.

        On the intended procedures of the COGES, variables regarding their participation in

school activities and their transparency, such as holding participatory general assemblies,

having a participation rate of more than 25% of the parents in these general assemblies, and

whether non-parent community members are also included in the assemblies (in addition to

parents), have a positive relation with SC contributions. Setting the improvement of the CEP

pass rate as the target for COGES action plans is significantly related to higher levels of SC

contributions.

        Moreover, we found that the SC linkages to the other actors at sub-national level is as

important as anticipated. The frequency of the meetings between the DEO and COGES

representatives has a significant association with this situation. The existence of the union of

COGES or APE is significantly positively correlated to SC contributions. The union of

COGES is led by the mayor of the district, and thus the presence of the COGES union implies

that communes have more information about the schools. As anticipated, a school whose

commune office responded that they have the information on teachers tend to receive more

contributions from the SC. Thus, these results imply that sufficient information sharing

between SC and sub-national actors is essential for better policy implementation by SCs.

        Further, better implementation of decentralized autonomy, as measured by the extent

to which the DEO shares a common view with the commune (mayoral office) regarding the

implementation of the commune’s roles, is also significantly related to the amount of SC

contributions. Since the mayor or their representative sits on the COGES board, a better

implementation of decentralization should affect how functional the COGES are.

        Better utilization of assessment results is also positively correlated to SC contributions.

A school where the director uses the CEP results with recommendations for pedagogical,



                                               22
operational, and personnel changes, tends to have more contributions from the SC. However,

as the majority of school directors receive information about the graduation exams, at least

about the number of students who took and passed it, differences can arise from the way they

review the results and how that knowledge is transformed into solutions and changes.

        Table 8 shows the regression results for SC contribution per Grade 6 student when

including the above-discussed explanatory variables in the model. In order to examine the

effect of each explanatory variable on the COGES, we added each of them to the regression

equation one by one (Table 7), and then together (Table 8). The results show that the variables

having significant coefficients include those relating to the general assembly, to views on the

role of communes, and those relating to the union of COGES or APE.

        Table 8 also gives the regression results for the other dependent variables that might

capture differences in the degree of functionality of the COGES; including total financing

contributions (not divided by the number of students), and whether the implementation rate of

the action plan is more than 50 percent in columns 2 and 3, respectively. As expected, most

coefficients of the explanatory variables on COGES organizational transparency and

participatory roles are estimated to be positive, but a few become statistically insignificant

when compared with the estimation results in column 1.

        The analyses indicate that the SC contribution per Grade 6 student, which exhibits

more continuity in its variation, can be a more representative indicator. While the

implementation rate of their action plan is also important in monitoring the capacity of each

COGES, it might have a mixed implication. For example, a COGES which prepared an

ambitious plan of activities and implemented only half of it may have eventually implemented

a similar degree of activities per student, when compared to another COGES which

implemented 100% of a more modest plan.




                                              23
(b) How does policy implementation link to more textbooks and learning hours?

As shown in Table 9, SC contributions are significant in almost all the regression results of

using the hours of supplementary lessons, study hours at home, and the number of textbooks

per student, as dependent variables. A better implementation of SC policies can be related to

higher levels of motivation, the commitment of households and schools to the time of learning

by children through supplementary lessons, as well as to studying at home. The table also

shows that the results do not change when each model is estimated without the two variables

relating to assessment and decentralization.

        The total hours of supplementary lessons are also significantly related to a common

view on decentralized management between communes and district education offices (column

2). As assumed, decentralization to mayoral offices could reduce the distance between

authorities and beneficiaries such as parents and communities surrounding the schools, and

increase the incentives for schools to improve their services. The effect of school directors

having records of teacher absence and teachers submitting absence notices to communes tends

to be positive, but it is not statistically significant. Schools which are more accountable for

recording and reporting absences may be more likely to ensure the full implementation of

teaching hours through supplementary lessons.

        For home study hours, the variable of the student assessment utilization (CEP results)

indicates a significant and positive association, while the variable on representing

decentralization has a positive but not significant association (see columns 6 to 8 of Table 9).

In the case of textbooks, these two variables also tend to have a positive but not significant

association (see columns 10-12 and 14-16 in Table 9). The procurement of textbooks is

currently centralized, and thus it is not surprising to find a weak relationship of this with

decentralization, while community contributions ensure that the books reach the students. In

fact, SC contributions have a significant relationship with this variable, and the coefficient of

the variable on the receipt of textbooks signed by a school director along with the president of



                                               24
APE or COGES is positive, and tends to be significant.

        For the number of textbook(s) per student, we also found that those schools that had

been visited by a REO representative the previous year received significantly more textbooks.

Although our estimations controlled for provincial differences (fixed effects), the distance to

the PEO still varies within provinces. Given that the textbooks are first sent from the central

government to the REO, this factor may imply a logistical or transportation advantage to be

gained from receiving textbooks. Better information sharing with sub-national administrative

offices about the conditions and needs of schools could thus affect the delivery of educational

services.

(c) How does policy implementation link to better learning outcomes?

Table 10 shows that SC contributions are significantly associated with the pass rate in

graduation examinations, even controlling for the contexts of individual schools such as the

education and experience of the school director. The utilization of student assessment results

(CEP results) also has a significantly positive association with learning outcomes. The

common view on the implementation of commune roles also shows a positive association,

although the association becomes statistically insignificant when adding it into the model with

the other two variables relating to SAA (column 4). The association between SC contributions

and the use of student assessment results remains significant even when they are estimated

together.

        The model also controls for education quality variables, which are assumed to be less

affected by the role of COGES in the current country context, such as teacher-student ratio and

teacher qualification. However, the analysis showed that these relationships are not

statistically significant. Of the other possible relationships, the DEO chief’s experience in that

position and in working in educational organizations has a positive association with the pass

rate. This seems to reflect the important role of DEO inspectors in insuring education quality.




                                               25
        Regarding the variables for other non-policy elements, the pass rate is higher for the

schools where more parents speak French. The coefficients on the diversity of ethnicity, the

share of children from poor households, and the proportion of not enrolled children have a

negative association as expected, though this is not significant.

Section 5: Summary and Implications for Policies, Implementation, and Monitoring

This paper examined the implications for better learning in primary education in Burkina Faso

of the quality of policy intents and their implementation in SBM processes. Here, a new

analytical policy tool developed by the World Bank and its partners on the basis of evidence of

international good practice, the SABER-School Autonomy and Accountability (SAA) model,

was adapted to the Burkina Faso context.

        For the quality of policy intents, relevant official documents from 2013 were reviewed

in the light of the rubric indicators of the SABER-SAA, and scored on a scale of one to four.

Compared with the previous assessment carried out in 2011, the 2013 snapshot indicates that

Burkina Faso has improved the quality of its policy on the role of school councils in school

governance by officially approving the 2013 guidelines that specify the organization and

procedures of COGES for nationwide dissemination. Other than the use of a school councils’

own voluntary revenues, autonomy in budget or personnel management is decentralized not to

schools but to communes, except for teacher salaries, which are still centralized. As commune

representatives are also on COGES boards, this decentralization to communes can be

considered to be progress in raising the quality of policy on school autonomy. Regarding the

dissemination of student assessments, which is an important policy for school accountability

on learning results, the policy is advanced in relation to the frequency of standardized

assessment, but is as yet emerging in respect of its use in schools to drive pedagogical

changes.

        In the next stage, that of examining the quality of policy implementation, we used data




                                                26
collected in 2013 from various level actors in the four regions, including rural school directors,

SCs, and sub-national authorities. In summary, the survey data indicated that there are

differences between policy intent and implementation, as well as in the degree of policy

implementation. First, despite the 2008 decree that established COGES, the 2013 survey data

found COGES only in the regions supported by the technical assistance project (PACOGES),

and not in the other regions. Second, among established COGES there are also differences as

to whether and to what extent they are functional. The degree of functionality of COGES, as

measured by community and parental voluntary contributions to schools, is significantly

associated with the variables relating to the implementation of procedures in COGES, such as

the holding of a general assembly and organizing the federation of COGES while controlling

for the community context such as French-speaking ability, ethnic group composition, and so

on. These indicators of the functionality of COGES also significantly explain the differences

in delivered education services such as textbooks, supplementary lessons, and learning

achievement, while at the same time allowing policy makers to control for provincial and

community contexts, and for the education and experience of school leaders. In addition, the

indicator used to assess the differences in the use of student assessments is also positively

related to learning achievement, and the indicator of the common views of stakeholders on

decentralization shows a significant positive association with the functionality of COGES and

the availability of supplementary lessons.

        Our analyses confirm that, in the current context of rural Burkina Faso, enhancing the

policy implementation role of the COGES and the functions of participatory COGES, along

with an increase in their linkages with subnational administrations and the use of student

assessment information, is potentially important for better education services and learning

results. Overall, it is consistent with a basic assumption of SABER-SAA, which looks at the

quality of policies and their alignment regarding school councils, assessment, and autonomy,

to make a school-based management (SBM) system work for better education results.



                                               27
        More specifically, the implications for policies and implementation, taking into

consideration the findings of this paper and other relevant studies, have been spelt out for

Burkina Faso. With respect to further areas for study in this context, it should be noted though

that our statistical data have some limitations. First our data was limited to rural areas, mainly

came from two regions (6 provinces), and focused on schools which have Grade 6 students,

thus the results cannot be generalized nationwide or for schools that do not offer a full range of

grade levels. Second, our data are cross-sectional. Our analysis was limited to measuring the

degree of policy implementation among stakeholders to understand their associations with

other policy factors and better education results, while controlling for non-policy factors that

make potentially results biased, such as the social contexts surrounding schools. Finally, our

findings should not be interpreted as being causal because we did not conduct any

experimental design. Such an approach was not applicable to our purpose, which was to assess

both the intent and implementation of national policies.21

The implications for policies and implementation can be summarized as follows:

        Implication 1: Enhancing implementation of the procedures for functional COGES.

The importance for an established COGES22 to be “functional” should be emphasized as part

of the training and guidance to schools and communities with local authorities, as in the

government plans to conduct a series of nationwide training sessions over the next few years

21
   There exists an experimental impact evaluation study of the effect of COGEs conducted for one
province in the earlier phase (2009-2011) of piloting the COGES model (see Kozuka and Sawada 2014
for details). We conducted a joint seminar in Ouagadougou to present the results of both that impact
evaluation study and our study of SAA policy implementation as inputs to comprehensive discussions
among country stakeholders about policy implications.
22
   The main purpose of our research was to analyze the quality of implementation of policies and
procedures (not just the simple fact whether a COGES had been established or not), and our survey data
do not allow analysis of the relationship between the establishment of a COGES and education results,
since the existence of COGES depends on the region and there is no difference among schools within
the same region. However, there are a few other studies that indicate the significance of establishing a
COGES. For example, the impact evaluation in the first year of the PACOGES 1 (in 2010/11) found a
significantly lower repetition rate and better teacher attendance for the treatment schools (where a
COGES was established), as compared with the control schools (Kozuka and Sawada 2014). According
to the data from the 2012 standardized learning assessment (EAS), the mean test score is slightly higher
for schools with a COGES than for the others (statistics provided by DEP, MOE in February 2014).
Shibuya (2014) also showed the good progress made by the two PACOGES regions from 2008 to 2011
in regard to the trends of regional primary completion rates compared to the national averages.



                                                  28
(Government of Burkina Faso and JICA 2014). The issues and differences in the functionality

of a school council have been also pointed out by a few earlier studies, with the school council

defined as a Parental Association (PA). For example, the World Bank (2007) pointed out that

PAs were found to be unrepresentative of the community of parents, and dysfunctional in

terms of financial management, due to their structural weaknesses (they are civil organizations

subject to public control in theory but not in practice), insufficient capacity, and a lack of

accountability. CONFEMEN (2009) differentiated between active and inactive PAs, and found

a positive effect from an “active” PA in relation to 5th Grade student learning in the regression

analysis of the 2006/2007 PASEC scores. Although our survey data could not capture this, any

risk of competition between PAs and COGES (De Grauwe and Lugaz 2007) should be

mitigated by clarifying to parents, at a series of nationwide training sessions, the participatory

structure and roles of COGES and their wider range of stakeholders that are aiming at

improving the education results of local children.

        Implication 2: Enhancing implementation of decentralization to mayoral offices.

Our analysis indicated differences in the policy implementation of the autonomy decentralized

to communes, for example in terms of stakeholder opinions on who has the responsibility for

personnel management and the availability of school information.23 In districts where both the

mayoral office (decentralized authority) and the district education office (the deconcentrated

branches of the MOE) share the opinion that where the commune has the responsibility for

teacher deployment within the district, schools tend to have a more functional COGES. The

government has been taking measures to enhance the administration capacity of mayoral

offices, for example, gradually seconding staff from Education Ministry District Offices



23
   On the weak implementation of decentralization, Mahieu and Yilmaz (2010) also found that in
Burkina Faso, “local governments have a very low degree of discretionary power accompanied with
weak accountability towards citizens at all levels” (329), from their review of the literature and
qualitative interviews with local authorities and community members. Dafflon and Madies (2013) point
out the insufficient administrative and management capacity of commune secretary generals, and of the
government officials working for the communes.



                                                 29
(DEOs) to this level,24 and an administrative reform is also planned for the DEOs.25 It should

be important for the MOE’s COGES unit, as well as others, to be closely involved in the

progress of this transition and to help both DEOs and communes develop clear and shared

views of the division of their roles and collaboration. This would enable them to guide and

facilitate COGES and schools to be more functional in these roles.

        Implication 3: Improving the use of student assessments in both policy intent and

implementation for mobilizing the efforts of communities to work with schools toward better

learning goals. While national level policy does not clearly state or define the procedures on

how each school receives and uses student assessment information for its pedagogical,

operational, and personnel functions, some regional and provincial initiatives seem to exist and

go beyond policy intent.26 Our data also show that schools that, according to the school

director, have and use such assessment information, tend to receive larger contributions from

their COGES and APE, and this also relates to better learning results. The revision of the

COGES guidelines is intended to suggest that the improving of learning results should be a

target of COGES action plans, and it provides examples on how rural communities can better

understand the meaning of the pass rate of the CEP exam, as well as what solutions can be

discussed to improve these results at general assemblies. While it is important to strengthen

the capacity of COGES and schools to discuss student assessment results, there should also be

a need and operational role for the central ministry and its sub-national offices to improve the

management and provision of student assessment and school data, so that each school, COGES,

and district office can better analyze and use these data. School-level data on assessment

results (e.g. pass rates in the graduation exam), educational inputs, and community

participation should help and encourage schools and their stakeholders to cooperate with each

   The government and the World Bank are preparing a new program, the Public Sector Modernization
Program, which includes a sub-component on enhancing administrative deconcentration, and
decentralization for primary education among other proposals (World Bank 2014).

other and learn valuable lessons so that they can more easily develop solutions and implement

activities for quality improvement.

         Implication 4: Continuing the monitoring of policy implementation to assess the

opportunity to adjust policy intents and the means of supporting better implementation. As

the government plans various education reforms, there can be a change over the time in the

value of the indicators that can capture the differences among schools and local

administrations in the policy implementation of COGES systems, decentralization, and the use

of assessment. In this situation, their explanatory significance for education results may also

change. It should be useful to continue monitoring, in the next few years, the changes in the

values of key indicators and variables, and to assess the differences in policy implementation

that need to be tackled to achieve better learning goals. The data for such monitoring may

come from existing regular statistical surveys as well as administrative reporting, although

their instruments (e.g. the formats of reporting and of questionnaires) and the associated

management of information would require improvements in practice.27

         It should be also noted that there are policy actions whose effects have not been

analyzed in this paper. This was generally because the policy intent was assessed as latent,

and/or it was likely that there were few stakeholders that would go beyond the policy intent as


27
   For example, while the questionnaires for the MOE’s annual school survey and the semi-annual
learning survey include several questions about COGES and APE, there seems to be room to improve
the dissemination of the database for wider use, and the scope of variables to measure policy
implementation. Regarding administrative reporting, for example, although there are format for
reporting overall supervision visits to schools, the template could include a few more check points on
COGES. These might relate not only the availability of a school action plan, but also its functionality.
Meanwhile, the use of the template and the visits themselves should be enhanced. The use of
administrative reports as a means of sharing information with COGES is another important point: not
only for documents directly related to COGES, such as the summary of action plans and progress
reports, but also documents containing other school information. These can be useful for COGES and
local administrations in their quest to be more functional for better learning. For example, the report of
actual teaching hours was not often available in our sample schools or district offices, and only a few
district offices have compiled this information satisfactorily for each school within their district in order
to compare the performance of each school. If this kind of information were more available and shared
with mayoral offices and the Federation of COGES (CCC), it could improve the accountability of
schools and teachers, and each COGES may be able to participate more actively in the monitoring and
the solving of issues concerning teaching hours, and also learn from good practices from other schools
and COGES through the Federation, for example.



                                                     31
a result of existing pilot programs or their own initiatives. Such policy action areas include

decentralization of teacher salary management, selection of textbooks, and operational school

grants sent directly to the account of the school council. Given that there is room to improve

the degree of implementation of the current policies, as shown in this paper, the country may

want to first focus on implementation of the current policies, taking into consideration the

different local and school contexts, before moving further into decentralization. At the same

time it could start a discussion about the possibility of introducing those other actions in pilot

programs or, if these already exist, evaluate the outcomes for wider implementation.28




28
   Furthermore, increasing the autonomy of schools in personnel and budget management beyond the
current level of decentralization to municipalities may require caution in a country like Burkina Faso.
While the SABER policy rubrics do show a higher score if policies intend that schools or school
councils have such responsibilities, there could be different implications, depending on a countries’
development stage and the level of education. For example, Hanushek et al. (2011) suggest that
autonomy affects student achievement negatively in developing or low-performing countries, but
positively in developed and high-performing countries, based on a panel dataset from PISA tests
(2000-2009) for 15 year-old students in 42 countries. More evidence is expected as the new PISA for
Development is planned to be tailored more adequately for developing countries.

 Decentralization       In Burkina Faso’s context, decentralization is the transfer of power to an
                        elected authority. Only communes and regions are managed by an
                        elected authority

 Deconcentration        In Burkina Faso’s context, deconcentration is the transfer of power to
                        any lower level administrative authority (region, province, commune,
                        and so on) which still retains a hierarchical link with central authorities

SC          School Council. This term is used in the SABER-SAA tool and it is
            defined as an institutional body that may include parents, community
            members, teachers, and the school director. In some countries, it may be
            called a School Management Committee or School Board. Depending
            on the country context, a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) could also
            be regarded as an SC for the purpose of data collection and analysis
            (For definitions of terms used in the SABER-SAA, please also see the
            Glossary in the World Bank publication (2014), “Data Collection

Note: The scale ranges from 1 to 4 (from latent to advanced). While the five policy goals (key indicators) remained
the same between the 2011 and 2013 SABER SAA policy rubrics, the sub-indicators have seen some changes (see
Annex 1 for details). For example, the sub-indicators 5C to 5E are new additions in the 2013 policy rubrics, and
thus were not available at the time of the preparation of this research. Thus these are not included here. The school
council was defined as being the APE in 2011, and the COGES in 2013.

of variables: (1) % of schools meeting the description noted as a variable (i.e., mean of values of 1 or 0 in
percentage), and (2) variables with continuous values. The benchmark is provided in the bracket when the policy
intention is not a requirement but rather an option (e.g. number of activities that COGES can contribute to). The
total number of observations is 126.

preparation                   plan, or through the CCC at
                              municipal level. When those items
                              fall under their action plan, they also
                              have final responsibility. However
                              when those items fall under other
                              budgets, the Mayor has final the

                                 students' learning. The in-depth
                                 "Acquis Scolaires" tests are
                                 conducted every few years

***For 2A, the decentralization authority does not capture all dimensions of personnel management,
and the policy allows central and local authorities to share these responsibilities. Civil servant teachers
on either an open-end or term limited contact (a permanent or contract teacher), are recruited by the
central government (the MOE), but a primary school teacher is a regionally based job. This means a
primary school teacher can only be deployed within the region of his or her recruitment. All the tests
and exams for recruiting permanent or contract primary school teachers by the MOE are done at the
regional level (REO). A teacher can ask for a transfer outside the region, but this can be refused. Within
the region of a teacher’s recruitment, the REO will assign the teacher a first position. Once a teacher is
working in a school, any transfer of this teacher within the commune is decided by the mayor on a
proposal by the Chief of the DEO. This is decided in the “Deployment Commission” at the commune
level. Once a teacher is working in a school, any transfer of this teacher outside the commune is
overseen by either the PEO if the transfer is within a province, or by the REO if the transfer is outside
the province (and within the region). Any transfer between regions is done at Ministry level, and can
only be done if teachers request those transfers, since the job is a regionally based one. Eventual
primary school teachers recruited by a commune (civil servants recruited and paid by territorial
collectives (regions or communes), are called “territorial civil servants”), and they are deployed within
the commune on the sole decision of the mayor. In short, decentralization took away the power of
deployment within a commune from the Chief of the DEO, and gave it to the Mayor. However, the
mayor can only decide based on the proposal of the Chief of the DEO.

Annex 2a. Descriptive Statistics on Means and Contexts for Policy Implementation


What is the general capacity of stakeholders, such as leadership or the state of their facilities?
To answer this question, the conditions of the general capacity of stakeholders at all levels are
highlighted below. This capacity can be assumed to affect the policy implementation on
COGES (Table A1).

At the school level, school directors are the key persons. 95% of the school directors are
certified or principal teachers. However, 16% of school directors are also teachers and are thus
not full time managers. Looking at their highest level of education, 43% finished secondary
education and 35% have finished university. Also, 40% have received initial training as school
directors. Regarding their experience, school directors have worked at the same school for an
average of 4.6 years either as a director or as a teacher; 82% speak the main local language;
and 86% responded that they use a mobile phone to communicate with administrators.

On COGES, the mean age of the presidents of the COGES is 45.2 years, and they have held
their current position for an average of 2.3 years. 42% of COGES presidents have primary
education or above. As for APE, the presidents have held their current position for an average
of 5.5 years.

At the DEO (District Education Office), the head of the bureau is on average 47 years old,
and has been in that office for 5 years. 56% have a university education. Most of them have
experience in education, whether as school directors (87%), as teachers (95%), or as personnel
of other educational administrations (26%). 95% responded that they had received initial
training for this position, and 97% indicated that they use mobile phones to communicate with
school directors. 64% answered that they often meet with school councils' representatives
(COGES or CCC) to be informed about schools and students. Some of the sampled DEOs also
had reports on school visits (Figure A1), which had allowed them to check whether the school
action plan (COGES) and other administrative documents were actually available at the school
as they should be. In terms of basic services, 54% of the district education offices said that
they had a lighting system, although only 3% answered that they had running water and air
conditioner. None of the offices had cars, but 90% said they had motor bikes (2.0 on average).

Regarding PEO and REO, 71% of the schools are less than 50 km from the PEO, and 51% of
the schools had received a visit from the REO in the previous year.

At the Commune Office: The mean age of the Mayors is 51, and they have held their current
position for an average of 5 years. The Secretary General tends to be younger, with an average
age of 38 years and a mean of 3 years in their current position. The Mayor and the Secretary
General tend to have the highest education level. In 40% of the Communes, the mayor has
senior secondary education as their maximum education level, and 10% had junior secondary
education. 8% answered primary education only. As for the Secretary Generals, 30%
responded that they had senior secondary education, and 8% junior secondary.

About the Staff: commune staffing is mainly composed by permanent civil servants (with a
mean of 3 people), and each employs an average of 2 contract staff and 2 volunteering staff.
On office facilities, 83% of the communes have a lighting system. The most used vehicle is the
motorcycle, which all of the Communes reported having (on an average of 3.7 machines per
Commune), compared with 10% responding having 4WD vehicles, and 3% having light cars.
68% of the communes reported having information about the number of teachers for almost all
the public primary schools of their district.




                                               62
Demographic Context: Communes have an average population of 30,903 inhabitants and are
100% rural. On average, 64% of the population speaks Moore, while 14% speaks French. An
average of 35% of the population is literate. On community characteristics, 34% of the SDs
responded that more than 20% of the 6 year old children in surrounding communities are not
enrolled in school. About a half of the school directors responded that more than 10% of the
parents can speak French. 55% of the schools responded that more than 50% of the students
come from economically disadvantaged homes. 71% of SDs responded that the largest ethnic
group of parents contributes more than 90% of their students.

There are also other registries missing. Those that exist must be updated and those that don’t must

Annex 2b. Descriptive Statistics on Education Service Delivery and Results


How does quality of education differ among our sample rural schools? Here we present some
descriptive statistics on the quality of education service and learning results as shown in Table
A2.

Time of teaching and learning: In 2013 schools started instruction to all grades that school
year mostly in October (as reported by 98%). 55% started during the first week, while 93%
had started during the first 15 days of the month. On the frequency of teacher absences, 20%
of the school directors chose “often” or “very often”, 77% of them chose “sometime”, and the
rest “never”. 82% of the SDs responded that there were no strikes in the current or last school
year. 61% of SDs responded there are teacher absence records, while 29% submitted that the
record of teacher hours and the summary report was only available at a very few DEOs during
our survey (Figure A2). In 50% of the schools, teachers have to submit a request for leave to
the Commune office. On students, 93% of the school directors indicated that the school keeps
a record of the student’s attendance or absence in all classes. A mean of 11% of students were
absent from class one day or more in the last trimester at the CP2 level, while the proportion
was 9% in the case of CM2. In the last month (March 2013), 74% of schools provided
supplementary classes. On learning at home, 39% of SDs responded that more than half of
Grade 6 students study 60 minutes or more at home.

Materials of teaching and learning: With regard to textbooks, the policy intention is to
provide one textbook per student, but these are intended to be returned to schools after use. On
textbooks, 29% of the SDs responded that the shortage of instructional materials is an
important obstacle for the school's capacity to provide instruction. Central government
procures new textbooks every year based on the needs of schools, as estimated from the the
number of students and the number of textbooks in stock. Given that used books also stay at
the schools, the number of textbooks per student can be larger than one per student. For
example, the average number of textbooks per student is 1.03 for the science textbook for
Grade 6. However, only half of the sample schools (52%) have more than 1 book per student,
the rest have less than one book. Textbook delivery is one of the areas where communities and
parents often seek voluntary contributions. In fact, 76% of the schools have submitted
textbook receipts to the Ministry, and 70% of these show that an APE or representative has
signed those receipts along with school directors.

On other materials, between 70-72% of the SDs responded that all teachers have the MENA
teaching guide for Math (CP2 or CM2), while 74-75% indicated that all teachers have the
MENA teaching guide for French (both levels). 16% of the SDs responded that the shortage of
funds for supplies is a very important obstacle for a school's capacity to provide instruction.
91% of the SDs responded that all students have pencils, 92% said they had notebooks, and
82% said they had chalk and personal boards.

1. Finally, the most popular indicator of learning achievement for Burkina Faso primary
education, the pass rates of the graduation examination (CEP), was examined. For the targeted
areas, the pass rate was 64% for all students (this number is comparable to the national
average of 64% in 2011, according to the annual statistics from 2011-2012, 432), when the
CEP pass rate is defined as the ratio of the students who passed to the number of students who
attended the exam in 2012. The pass rates differ greatly among schools (Figure A3). For some
schools, the pass rates were lower than 40%, but it should be noted that only 68% of the SDs
submitted the results of the examination. Those that did recorded a higher mean pass rate than
the schools that did not submit the documents. As anticipated from these data show that the
repetition rate is much higher for grade 6 than for students in other grades.

Annex 3. Overview of Relevant Previous Statistics on APE and COGES in Burkina Faso

(1) Annual Education Survey Data (AES) from MOE/DEP

Overview of survey data: MOE collects basic statistics from all primary schools at the
beginning of every school year, using a questionnaire (called “ENQUÊTE ANNUELLE”)
covering basic school information. MOE also publishes national education statistics
(ANNUAIRE STATISTIQUE DE L’EDUCATION NATIONAL), which include statistical
tables by REO (region), and PEO (province). The relevant database is maintained in a format
that enables experts to generate data files, including data disaggregated by each school (or
each district, commune, province, or region) for each indicator.

Basic statistics on APE and COGES (see tables below):
z An APE was present at 99% of primary schools in all regions in 2012/13 (Table A3);
z A COGES was present at 32% of primary schools in 2012/13;
z The share of schools having a COGES has increased since 2009/10, and almost all
    schools have a COGES in the two regions supported by PACOGES 1 (Central East and
    Plateau Central). However, with the exception of Saher, other regions have a smaller
    percentage of their schools with COGES, at around 10% (Table A4).

(2) National Large-Scale Student Assessment: EAS

Overview of survey data: Burkina Faso has a national system review to assess student
learning achievement, called EAS (Enquête sur les Acquis Scolaires). It is conducted almost
every two years. The most relevant recent report is for the 2011/12 survey (DEP/MOE 2013)
while the next round was produced in 2013/14 (June 2014). This assessment is implemented at
nationally representative, sample primary schools, selected from all regions for two grades on
several subjects. The specifications regarding the numbers of sample schools and students,
target grades, and subjects change with the year of the survey.

The EAS has a questionnaire for school directors about school characteristics, including the
existence of COGES and APE and their activities. Therefore, it could be used in analyzing the
role of COGES as well as other factors to explain the level of student learning achievements
(Table A6).

Technical Annex 29: Administrative Documents collected during the Survey in Rural
Burkina Faso to Assess the Implementation of Education Policies

By Gaetan Moreau and Takako Yuki

This note has two objectives: First, to show a sample of documents that were used as evidence

in the evidence-based survey on policy implementation (Yuki et al. 2015). For details on the

types of documents and collection rates, see the Final Report for Commissioned Data

Collection and Analysis for the Research of the System Assessment and Benchmarking for

Learning Achievement and Equity: A Focus on School Management Systems (Research with

the SABER Program), submitted to the Japan International Cooperation Agency, March 2014

(PADECO 2014). And second, to illustrate how these existing documents can be used for the

tracking of several education policies. The relevant documents are textbook distribution

(Document 12), stationaries distribution (Document 2, 14), community participation

(Document 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 15, 16), and/or teaching hours (Documents 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16).

These documents show how information is handled at the lowest level (by school directors,

parental associations, school councils, and local education offices) in rural Burkina Faso,

before this information is gathered at the regional and then the central level. The process gives

an idea of the current administrative status and capacity in this area, and can be of interest for

public expenditure tracking surveys (PETS).

        This note is organized in three sections: a sample of documents collected during the

field survey at the district education office level (called CEB in Burkina Faso) is outlined in

Section 1; some documents obtained from school directors are shown in Section 2; and in

Section 3, along with a short description, we give the complete list of the documents collected

from school directors, school councils (COGES), parental associations (APE), and local

education offices (CEB) during the survey. The survey also collected similar documents from

central, regional, and provincial offices (DRENA and DPENA) and communes, but these are

not presented here as the focus is on the level closest to the ground.



Section 1. Examples of Administrative Documents collected at District Education Offices
(CEB)

Administrative documents collected at the CEB (Circonscription d’Education de Base) can be

classified into two types:



(1)   Documents that compile information disaggregated by school throughout the district; and

(2)   Documents whose information is not aggregated for the whole district, or concern only

      one school due to the nature of the document.



        While the formats of these documents are often pre-set by the central or regional levels,

it appears from the surveys that there is quite a variation on whether and how CEBs use the

forms and fill in the required information. Also, too often the collection of data means the

aggregation of these data (see Document 1, which aggregates Document 11 from different

schools), and this aggregation is done at every step up the chain, leaving the central level with

overall figures not suitable for proper monitoring and tracking.

(1) Documents listing each school on various types of information.

These documents include information such as the actual hours of teaching (compared to the

official teaching hours), the amount of materials each school received (signed by the school

director and APE), the number of textbooks available, and the number of classes and facilities.

Such information can be useful if shared with more stakeholders, for example with the

commune level Federation of School Councils (CCC). This disaggregated information per

school should also be available at the central level for proper monitoring of teaching hours,

and to identify leakage in public resources.

1. Actual
   Teaching
   Hours
   (Yearly)

Schools are listed
in the 1st column
(redacted), the total
of official hours in
the 2nd, the actual
number of hours
taught in the 3rd,
the difference
between the two in
the 4th, then the
reasons for missing
hours are split in 5
columns (sick
days, family
events, service
related, etc.), and
the last column is
the reason for extra
hours being
allocated.

2. Distribution
   of School
   Stationary
   Supplies

Schools are listed
in the 1st column,
and other columns
detail the number
of notebooks,
pencils, and so on,
available. Each
school’s total is
acknowledged by
the signature of the
school director and
of the APE/AME
(Parental
Association or
Mothers’
Association)

Schools are listed
from the 2nd
column, with the
number of students
who registered,
attended, and
passed the exam by
gender in the other
columns.




4. Action Plans
    of the
    COGES
  (One line per
     school)

For each school
(COGES), the
number of planned
activities,
implementation
status, planned
budgets, the funds
effectively raised,
and the ratio of the
latter two are
listed.

surrounding
environment
(APE, AME,

The comment
by the
inspector
highlights a
common
challenge that
rural schools
face:

“There is an
evident
disinterest by
the parents
with respect
to the
education of
their children.
Illiteracy is
one of the
reasons.”

Section 2. Examples of Administrative Documents collected from School Directors

Documents collected from school directors almost always concerned their own school.
However, when CEB have the material means to copy and distribute them all can benefit.


9. Record of
    Actual Teaching
    Hours
  (Weekly Report)

This is the standard
form school
directors use to keep
track of teachers’
attendance on a
weekly basis.

The number of
missed hours is split
by reason (sickness,
personal leave,
work reasons, and
so on).




10. Record of
    Actual
    Teaching
    Hours
    (Monthly
    Report)
This document is
the same data as #9
but for a whole
month, in this case
April 2013.
In this particular
example, the Grade
1 teacher did 58%
of their official
hours, Grade 2 did
91%, Grade 3 did
75%, Grade 4 did
68%, Grade 5 did
67% and Grade 6
did 97%.


                                         80
11. Record of
    Actual Teaching
    Hours
  (Yearly Report)

This document
gives the same data
as #9 and #10 but
for a whole year.

This school has
multi-level classes
(i.e. two grades into
one class) typical of
smaller schools. The
three classes exceed
the yearly official
hours (112%, 112%
and 119%
respectively)
through
supplementary
courses.




12. Receipt of
    Textbooks
    (Signed by
    APE)

This is the standard
template nationwide
for the receipt of
textbooks by the
school. It is signed
by 4 people: the
school director, the
person in charge of
materials at the
CEB, the head of
the CEB, and the
president of the
parental or mothers
association of the
school.




                        81
 13. Student Score
          Card
    (With signature
       of parents)

This is a typical
scorecard, here of
the second trimester.

All different
subjects are graded
on a scale of 10 or
20, the average is
out of 10 (in this
case 8/10), and the
rank of the student
in the class is given
(in this case, she is
first).

It is signed by the
teacher with an
observation, and
signed by the
parents.

As for many
French-speaking
countries, the
passing mark is the
average (i.e. 5 out
of 10), and the
maximum grade is
rarely achieved.




                        82
14. Stationary
    Receipt
    (Signed- among
    others - by the
    COGES
    president)

This receipt was
issued by the
commune, as they
are in charge of
school materials
procurement.

It lists the quantities
of the materials
received and it is
signed by the school
director, the
president of the
COGES, the person
in charge of
education at the
commune’s office,
and an inspector of
the provincial
education office
(DPEBA).




                          83
15. School Action
    Plan of COGES

This shows the
template used by
COGES for their
action plans, listing
the planned
activities (here, one
of the activities is to
organize
supplementary
classes), tasks,
period, cost (here
split into unit cost
and total cost),
funding source, and
person in charge.

Almost all COGES
action plans follow
this template but
very few are printed
like this one.




                          84
16. COGES
    Activity Report

This is a typical
COGES activity
report. It follows a
template but is
drawn by hand since
computers and
printers are still rare
at the school level.

Along with the list
of planned
activities,
information on
whether they were
carried out, the
planned budget, the
level of execution,
and the amount
effectively used.

One of the activities
in this example is
the organization of
supplementary
courses.




                          85
17. Back to School
    Day Statistical
    Report

This is a report
School Directors are
to fill out at the
beginning of the
school year. There
are different
templates.

This example shows
the section on the
school’s furniture
(tables, benches,
blackboards, etc.),
and the CEP and
JHS entrance
exams’ results of the
previous year.

Unlike documents collected at by the central level, at the local level most documents were
photographed by the surveyors. Very few were copied or given in an electronic format.

Bulletin de Note du 2nd           with detailed grades, it always has the same format
Trimestre de l’Année              throughout all regions, so this is probably a national template.
(pour un élève de CM2,            It lists grades in each subject (writing, dictation, history, etc.).
CM1 au cas échéant)               Subjects have different weights (they are scored out of 10
[School Report of the 2nd         points or out of 20 points). The total score (out of 160 points),
Trimester of the Year             the average (out of 10 points), and the rank of the student is

                                  x Sometimes the teacher writes a brief observation. As
                                    customary in a French speaking system, the observation is
                                    usually pretty strict and seems mostly based on the grades,
                                    not on the ranking (a good ranking with a low grade is not
                                    lauded)
                                  x There is no information other than the grades (learning
                                    achievement). No information is given on attendance on
                                    this document. However, anything can be addressed in the
                                    teacher’s observation (e.g. “Average work (is being lazy)).”
                                    We suspect that if a student has an attendance problem, it
                                    can be addressed in the observation
                                  x There are some other templates which seem to come from
                                    different documents – and are probably for school records,
