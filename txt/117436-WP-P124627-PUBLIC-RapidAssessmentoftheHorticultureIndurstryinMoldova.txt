BACKGROUND

1.       The Rapid Assessment of the Horticulture Sector in Moldova was conducted as part of the
Moldova Food Security Technical Assistance (TA), financed from the Global Food Crisis Response Program
(GFRP) trust fund (TF). The original aim of the TA was to inform the formulation of the government’s food
security strategy and the reform of related policies, with a view towards a paradigm shift from a self-
sufficiency and production volume oriented to a competitiveness-based agricultural policy framework.

2.      However, since the inception of the TA in 2009/10, there was a significant shift in Moldova’s
economic (and agricultural) policy paradigm. The current Government is committed to a closer
economic/trade integration with the European Union (EU), paralleled, to some extent, by the
approximation of European policies and institutions. The TA was hence restructured to better respond to
these evolving client needs, while remaining true to the goals and mandate of the GFRP.

3.      The policy dialogue in the agriculture sector with the Government of Moldova increasingly shifted
its focus towards ways to improve agri-food competitiveness and trade performance, and to reduce
foreign market vulnerabilities, all conducive to better food security outcomes in Moldova.

4.      Agri-food trade vulnerabilities were most recently exposed in the current regional geopolitical
context, which led the Russian Federation impose an import ban on key Moldovan agricultural products
(wines, meat products, fruit and vegetables) through 2013 and 2014. More than half of Moldova’s agri-
food exports go to CIS countries (predominantly Russia)1, and another third to the EU. Much higher levels
of agricultural subsidies in other markets, particularly in the EU, undermine the competitiveness of
Moldova’s agri-food products on both foreign and domestic markets. Furthermore, despite the recently
adopted Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with the EU and despite an increase of
the European import tariff rate quotas, the Moldovan products were not able to find immediate outlets
on the EU market. The main reasons stemmed from a lack of adaptation to or compliance with European
market quality and phytosanitary standards.

5.      The Rapid Assessment of the Horticulture Sector in Moldova, carried out between September
2014 and March 2015, serves a dual purpose: (i) provide an overview of the strengths as well as
weaknesses of the Moldovan horticulture sector, which constitutes a vital component of the country’s
agricultural economy and rural society, and (ii) explore opportunities for fruit and vegetables market and
product diversification, which could reduce some of the observed sector vulnerabilities.

  Prior to the trade bans approximately 30% of the country's wine exports (valued at USD 35.0 million), 93% of apple exports
(valued at USD 43.7 million) and 80% of plum exports (valued at USD 21.1) went to the Russian Federation.

                                                                                                                               5
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

6.      Horticulture has consistently been a critical sector for Moldova’s economic development . It is
the major industry in the country (more than a fifth of the country’s Gross Agricultural Output), and a
major employer a source of rural incomes (44% of all farmers grow fruit, and nearly all grow vegetables).
In recent years, it has secured important export markets and revenues (fresh fruit account for 20% of all
exports), and has supplied much of its own horticultural produce for local consumption. However, the
contribution of the fruit and vegetable sectors has been unequal. While fruit production (apples, plums
and grapes, in particular) has been the driving force of economic and export growth, vegetables have not
yet managed to gain sufficient market recognition and shares, neither domestically, nor internationally.
The low yields and poor quality of produce for the local market invites competition from imports, and
Moldova remains a net importer of vegetables.

7.       However, the sector is facing considerable vulnerabilities, mainly because of climate and
market vagaries. Fruit and vegetables production and yields remain highly susceptible to weather
extremes, as demonstrated by the severe droughts in 2007 and 2012. Hail, rain damage and frosts are
also frequently affecting horticulture production in Moldova. Market and price vulnerabilities have
manifested mostly in the form of market gluts and depressed prices, in favorable years, and have been
exacerbated by the continued dependence on a dominant export market. Russia remains the main trading
partner for the Moldovan fruits, mainly for apples, plums and grapes. The increasingly volatile geopolitical
in the region has translated into several bans on Moldova’s agriculture and horticulture exports in recent
years, which have severely disrupted the incomes of the Moldovan producers.

8.      Horticultural production in Moldova is characterized by the heterogeneity of farmers. For
example, there are about 450,000 farms that have fruit trees, but about 1,000 of them account for over
62% of the orchards whilst 440,000 farmers have less than 0.5ha. There are over 100 farmers with more
than a 100ha of orchards, and most of these also have larger areas field crops. Therefore, the wide range
of farm sizes mean that the farmers have different risk management strategies; the larger farmers look to
mitigate risk through crop diversification whilst the small-farmers tend to cope with risk by not investing
any resources in their orchards. Therefore, any interventions supporting horticultural producers should
recognize the heterogeneity of the farmers.

9.      The diversification of product range and (export) market is a natural path to explore, and this
report shows that opportunities do exist for Moldova's horticultural products. Walnuts are a well-
established crop and Moldova is already the second biggest supplier to the EU (after the USA). With
further investment and long-term planning, exports could be increased and higher added-value could
attained. Cherry exports are currently focused on CIS countries, but some could be re-directed towards
the EU with relatively modest investment and effort. More specifically:




                                                                                                          6
        -   The long-term profitability of both crops, but especially walnuts, looks very promising.
            However, only after a more detailed analysis we would be able to say this with total certainty,
            since the current yield potential and cost structures are estimates only.

        -   There seems to be a positive market demand for both crops, yet important differences exist.
            The demand for healthy and nutritious foods has generated interest for walnuts in many
            countries and because of its high unit value the transport costs to distant markets do not
            unduly undermine competitiveness. Cherries, on the other hand, are a lower value and
            perishable crop that faces stiff competition from Moldova's neighboring countries, many of
            which have already invested in cherry orchards.

        -   Being tree crops, both walnuts and cherries require capital investments over a longer period
            of time before they generated a positive annual margin. Financial capacity or constraints will
            thus play a key part in the development of new orchards. At present, these are probably most
            suited for larger farmers who are generating cash surpluses from other crops and can make
            investments in cherry and walnut orchards from retained earnings.

        -   Even though there are Government subsidies for planting both crops, they only cover a small
            portion of the establishment costs. Therefore, if export crops such as these are to be
            promoted, increasing the level of subsidies should be considered.

        -   Both cherries and walnut exports would be much more competitive if grown on larger farms .
            The cherries would be more attractive to buyers because their quality would be much more
            uniform and a large walnut plantation would justify an investment in cold storage and
            processing factory, which would make it easier to access the high priced retail markets.

        -   There is need for a better understanding of the best agronomic techniques to achieve the best
            yields and quality, especially for walnut production.

10.      There are also good opportunities from improving vegetable production and quality standards
for the local market. Most of the recommendations have focused on improving competitiveness and
opportunities for fruit production that is targeted for export markets, but there should also be efforts
made to improve vegetable production for the local market. Currently, the yields of vegetables for the
local market are low and the quality of the produce is, at best, variable. There are significant amounts of
vegetables imported due in part to the seasonality of local production, but the use of greenhouses and
poly tunnels could lengthen the season. The expected increased dominance of the supermarkets in food
retailing will also create opportunities for farmers, but to take advantage of these opportunities, it is
important that yields and quality improve and that the level of presentation and service are raised. If a
few of the better larger farmers growing vegetables decided to use world class technologies, they could
vastly improve yields and increase their domestic market shares. This should lead to cheaper and more
hygienic vegetables in the urban areas. Once improved yields and supermarket standards are achieved,
there might be some export opportunities to neighboring countries. The large area of irrigated land

                                                                                                         7
(15,000 ha), covering 10 irrigation systems, that is being rehabilitated by the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC) offers a good opportunity to increase vegetable production for the domestic market.

11.     In order to meet these potentials, the report outlines a number of specific actions that the
Government could consider, in addition to those already included in the current policy framework and
financed through dedicated programs. The latter include, for instance, the improvement of the food
quality and safety system, better organization and integration of value chain participants, improving
producers’ access to financing and insurance, and investments into modernization of farm and processing
equipment. Additionally, the current report advises the following:

       -   Conducting a comprehensive risk assessment, in order to map, measure, and propose a
           coherent set of instruments to address the constellation of risks that affect Moldova’s
           horticulture, in particular, and agriculture, more broadly. In this context will be important to
           establish, the appropriate mix of tools applicable to Moldova’s agricultural conditions
           (beyond e.g. insurance and investments in climate mitigation and adaptation), the adequate
           division of roles and risk sharing between the public and private sectors, as well as the
           appropriate targeting of these risk management instruments to the producers concerned.

       -   A deepening of the understanding of the horticultural value chain – especially of the market
           opportunities, potential profitability and Moldova’s competitive advantage for both fresh and
           processed produce. While many sectoral and sub-sectoral reviews exist, a great number of
           them do not fully analyze the costs of production, do not research the market properly, or fail
           to show how some natural endowment advantages (such as quality of soils and climate) could
           be converted into competitive advantage. Such analysis should also attempt include the
           benchmarking of production costs and subsidies with neighboring countries. Benchmarking
           could be useful to ensure that farmers are not disadvantaged in international markets as well
           as for attracting foreign investment in processing.

       -   Focus efforts on further improving the business and marketing management skills of the
           domestic producers. In this context, priority should be given to revamping agriculture
           education and modernizing its curriculum to meet contemporary business needs of the
           farmers and other stakeholders in the industry. Another approach could be to introduce a
           scheme for accelerated learning for selected university graduates, which would provide a
           combination of training programs in business with placements in companies offering practical
           management experience. Several international experiences (such as the model developed
           successfully in the UK by the horticultural industry and called Management Development
           Services Ltd) could serve as an example.

       -   Promoting innovation. It is recognized that the start-up and development costs of truly new
           and innovative enterprises in Moldova is expensive and difficult. An Innovation Fund,
           managed by MAFI, could be set up to provide matching grants and supplementary technical
           assistance to encourage companies to innovate. The Fund could finance the development of

                                                                                                         8
    new products or markets, the uptake of new technologies or processes, or the building of new
    strategic relations among the value chain actors.

-   Improving distribution of technological knowledge of crop production and marketing. The
    private sector, through e.g. an Association, should take the lead in deciding on what technical
    advice is required and how to get such information. MAFI could co-finance this, but, the
    government could play a greater role in ensuring that the advice remains publicly accessible
    in a “virtual” library. MAFI could further promote linkages between Association members and
    research scientists to perform and finance field trials to determine improved agronomic
    practices and make sure that the results are disseminated through open days etc.

-   Better understanding the coping strategies of the rural population and their incentives to
    accept work opportunities. This is an important dimension, particularly in the context of
    increasing difficulties producers face with accessing seasonal labor. This could be a serious
    impediment to further sector development and expansion, and clear analysis followed by
    policy measures to address rural labor market shortcomings might be warranted.




                                                                                                 9

                 I.            BRIEF OVERVIEW OF MOLDOVA'S HORTICULTURE

             I.1               OUTPUT, FARM STRUCTURE AND YIELDS

12.      Crop production occupies an important place in Moldova's agriculture, accounting for more
than two thirds of the total value of agricultural production. The value of crop production in 2013
amounted to US$879 million, while livestock products accounted for the remainder of the total Gross
Agricultural Output (GAO) of US$1.3 billion. Cereals and oilseeds occupy more than 70% of the total
utilized agricultural area (UAA) and represent more than 40% of total GAO. Around 20% of the UAA is
dedicated to fruit and vegetables which constituted (including grapes and potatoes) more than a fifth of
the total GAO in 2013. Horticulture is also a major source of rural employment; although often seasonal,
it remains a very important source of income for many of the smaller farmers.

13.      While the area allocated to horticulture has decreased over the last 20 years, it is now showing
signs of revival. Plantings of potatoes and vegetables have decreased by 58%, to about 66,000 ha in 2013
(Figure 1). The area under fruit cultivation has also declined by more than half, although it has stabilized
over the last seven years. Most of the decline in fruit plantings occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s. This
was driven by the market reorganization following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and subsequent loss
of traditional export outlets, and the transition to a market economy in Moldova. Since 2006, there has
been a slight upturn (10%) in area planted. The area planted with grapes decreased by 30% over the last
two decades and vineyards currently utilize 137,000 ha.2

2 Available data do not reveal whether the decline in horticultural plantings is due to restructuring of small or large farms, but
interviews with stakeholders in Moldova suggest that rationalization within the industry is occurring, whereby the larger and
more commercially-focused farms are taking over smaller farms.



                                                                                                                                                                              10
14.      The significant decline in the area utilized for horticultural production has, until recently, also
led to a sharp decrease in the output of fruit and vegetables. Fruit production has declined by more than
60%, from 1 million Metric Tons (MT) in 1993 to 419,000MT in 2013. Vegetable volume output has also
decreased by more than 60% during the same period, dropping from 777,000MT to 292,000 (Figure 2).
The decline in output is aligned with the trend in reduced UAA, suggesting that average yields have
remained reasonably stable over the last 20 years, despite the introduction of new varieties, better
agricultural inputs and an increase in average horticultural farm size (Figure 3).3 Even though Moldova's
mild climate and fertile soils are considered as favorable for horticultural production, yields remain
nevertheless susceptible to weather extremes as demonstrated by the droughts in 2007 and 2012 that
severely affected production.

15.     Unlike vegetables, fruit output has increased over the last five years, mainly due to the modest
increase in plantings noted earlier and an increase in yields. Overall production and yields have also
benefitted from investment in intensive and super-intensive orchards, undertaken both by the producers
themselves, as well as the Government of Moldova and donors. These investments are driven by the need
to remain competitive in international markets and by the determination to lower production risks
stemming from droughts, frost, hail, and rain damage.

3 It is worth noting that collecting reliable and representative data on agriculture is difficult, especially in countries where
agriculture is dominated by small-farmers and where Government resources to undertake comprehensive surveys are limited.
Therefore, yield data for Moldova should be used with caution.

16.     Fruit plantations occupy 122 thousand hectares, but only 74% of these are fruiting. Fruit
plantings are dominated by apples (60% of the total yielding areas) and stone fruits (31%) followed by
nuts (7%) and berries (1%). Apples and plums take up more than three quarters of the total yielding
surfaces, followed by nuts and peaches, each accounting for almost 7% of total yielding surfaces.
Vegetable production is significantly less prominent and occupied 4.4% of the total planted areas in
2013.Potatoes, green peas, gourds, cabbage and tomatoes are the main vegetable crops.

17.      Small farms dominate Moldova's agriculture, and vegetable production in particular; however,
fruit plantations are concentrated on the larger holdings. There are about 900,000 farms in Moldova
with an average size of 2.5ha. About 44% of farms have some fruit trees that are a source of income for
the farmers, but many of the trees on small farms are neglected. However, in terms of total area, the
majority of the orchards are concentrated on larger farms. In fact, more than 60% of the plantings are
held by less than thousand farmers (Table 1). The vast majority of farmers (97%) who have fruit trees have
less than 0.5ha of land, which is hardly a commercially viable unit. Most vegetable production is small-
scale. 70% of the area sown to vegetables comes from garden plots averaging 0.04ha. However, a few
larger operations exist (4,025, accounting for 1% of the total number of vegetable producers), who are
involved in field vegetable production on areas averaging 2.6ha.

18.      Average yields for fruits and vegetables in Moldova are low in comparison with those in its
European Union (EU) neighbors and even lower when compared to the EU15 averages (Figures 4-5).4
For example, Moldova's productivity in wine and table grapes production is comparable to some of the
new EU member states (Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and Slovakia), but lower than productivity in Moldova's
Eastern neighborhood (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus and Georgia) and well below the productivity of
more advanced wine-making countries like France, Italy and Spain. In the case of vegetables, average
yields are low when compared to EU15 countries and new EU member states, but comparable to regional
yields.

19.      However, they hide major differences between the commercial/corporate sector and the small-
farmer/peasant households. While the average yield for fruits and berries on a peasant farm is only 4,820
kg/ha, commercial agricultural enterprises register yields close to 7,000 kg/ha. Low yields pose a
significant mid- to long-term challenge, as international markets become increasingly competitive and
trade patterns change; they limit Moldova taking full advantage of its agricultural potential, and
maximizing its position and gains on the foreign markets.

20.       There are many reasons associated with low average yields: (i) small farm size, (ii) market
orientation; and (iii) value chain bottlenecks. As shown earlier, almost 30% of all fruit orchards are
cultivated by farms with less than 2ha of land that largely engage in subsistence farming. These holdings
have limited financial and knowledge capability to invest in technologies that would enhance their yields.
In addition, the markets in CIS countries generate sufficiently good returns at current productivity levels,
removing the incentives for improving yields further, as needed to supply to the much demanding and
competitive EU market. Marketing and distribution are also constraining factors to a more efficient
horticulture production. Numerous small farmers find it difficult to sell their crops outside open markets
that are located close to their farms. In 2012 for example, only a third of the total fruit marketed and a
fifth of the vegetables were bought by enterprises and organizations that collect and process agricultural
produce. In practice, farmers’ choices are thus limited and many remain forced to sell their harvest
individually, having little market power.

21.     Vegetable and fruits are grown in the Northern, Central and Southern region of Moldova, but
important differences in production and concentration exist. Overall, the North features the largest
areas planted with fruit and field vegetables (around 60% of total surface) and corresponding productions,
while the South is least endowed in terms of horticulture production (Figure 6). In terms of specific crops,
the North dominates vegetable production, the Center hosts most of the walnut and berries production,
while the South is more important in terms of grapes, peaches and nectarines production.

                  I.2          TRADE

22.      Moldova's positive agri-food trade balance is warranted largely by its exports of cereals, fresh
fruits and wine. In terms of horticulture, Moldova is a net exporter of fresh fruits, processed fruits and
processed vegetables, but a net importer of fresh vegetables (Figure 7). The value of fresh fruit exports
has grown consistently during the last two decades, and has in the past five years represented more than
20% of the value of total exports (around US$200 million a year, out of approximately US$1 billion). Unlike
in the case of vegetables, the balance of trade with fresh fruits has remained positive over the last decade.
The largest markets for Moldova's fresh fruit were CIS countries, 51%5 (mostly Russia, Belarus and
Ukraine) and EU countries, 42% (mostly France, Greece and Germany).

23.      The share of fresh fruit exports in total agri-food exports and the absolute value of fresh fruit
exports have grown considerably since between 1997 and 2013.The share of fresh fruit in total agri-food
exports was little above 5% in 1997, but has quadrupled since, reaching representing more than 20% in
2013. In terms of total value, growth has been equally impressive: from US$34 million in 1997 to US$200
million in 2013 (Figure 8).

24.     Apples and walnuts represented more than two thirds of all exported fresh fruits in 2011 (Figure
9).The value of all fresh fruit exports has doubled between 2007 and 2011, from around US$93 million to
US$187 million, and the combined value of apples and walnuts has nearly doubled as well, from roughly
US$70million to around US$129 million.6 The share of walnuts and apples had thus remained relatively
stable between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 75.7% in 2007 and 68.8% in 2011 (Table 2). More than two
thirds of walnut exports went to the EU15 countries in 2011, while apples and stone fruits were mostly
exported to CIS countries (largest shares to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus), with only modest quantities
destined to the EU markets (mostly Poland and Romania).

25.     Changing world and regional market conditions could affect, however, the outlook for
Moldova’s fresh fruit exports. Worldwide, there is a significant over-supply of apples: the global
production increased by about 10% in 2014, exacerbating the impact of the Russian ban on Moldova’s
apple sales. As a result, it would be sensible for Moldova to limit policy incentives for increased apple
production, and to focus more on improving the quality of the production from existing orchards. This is
even more important if one recognizes that Moldova is a niche player in the apple global market, and its
success will depend on the country’s ability to be able to capitalize on its distinctive taste to find those
niches where it can compete. As regards walnut producers, they have no difficulties selling their
production at present but, with new orchards coming on line in the next years, that situation may change.
With the domestic supply increasing, producers will need to be more proactive in participating in trade
shows, and getting prepared for a time when they may need new customers.

26.       On the side of imports, the share of imported tomatoes, peppers and eggplants amounted to
half of the total imports of fresh vegetables by 2011. Imports of vegetables have trebled between 2001
and 2013 in terms of value. Most of the imports of peppers, tomatoes and eggplants come from Turkey
and several EU countries (Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands). Lack of technical and business management
skills, reduced production areas and inadequate post-harvest infrastructure (collection, cooling, and
transport) are the underlying factors affecting domestic vegetable production and explaining the high
level of imports needed to satisfy domestic demand. .



        I.3     FOOD PRICES

27.     While food prices in Moldova have been on an upward trend in recent years, fruit and
vegetables were subject to great yearly variations (Figure 10). Between 2006 and 2014, food prices went
up by 60%, closely in line with the overall consumer price index (CPI). However, horticulture products saw
great annual price spikes and drops, reflecting the strong footprint of weather and market conditions. The
drought of 2007 resulted in a shortage of fruits and vegetables on the domestic market, as the water-
sensitive horticulture production of the country was severely affected, along with cereals. In contrast, the


                                                                                                         17
favorable weather in 2009 led to a spike in the domestic supply, and to a subsequent market glut. This
was especially evident for Moldovan vegetables, which are highly perishable and also face the most
significant marketing constraints, particularly on foreign markets. Finally, the price of nuts has been
steadily increasing, much faster than the average (food) prices, largely due to the development of a strong
foreign (mostly European) demand for nuts, exceeding current domestic supply capacity.

28.     Intra-year horticulture prices are more volatile than the average food prices (Figure 11). This
should not come as a surprise given the perishability and the seasonality of the production, as well as the
lack of capacity to extend the harvesting season and appropriate storage facilities. Prices are largely
affected by local supply, especially so in the case of vegetables; these obtain highest prices in the fourth
quarter (off-season) and the lowest in the second and third quarter (harvest).

            I.4           AGRI-FOOD PROCESSING

29.     The Moldovan agro-food processing industry remains one of the most important industrial
sectors, as it represented 42% of the total manufacturing output and employed more than 20,000
people in 2013.In turn, the processing industry for fruits and vegetables represented 4.5% of the total
food and beverages industry. Its 83 companies produced 35,000MT of canned fruits and vegetables and
approximately 50,000MT of juices in 2013.Processed fruits and vegetables are Moldova's second most
exported food product, surpassed only by wine. The total output of the fruit and vegetable processing
industry was valued at US$103 million in 2013, more than double of its value in 2006. However, limited
investment in modern technologies, lack of vertical and horizontal integration and slow adoption of food
safety and quality standards remain a challenge.

30.     After a sharp decline in early 2000s, the exports of processed horticulture products more than
doubled between 2001 and 2013, expanding from US$34 million to US$76 million (Figure 13). During
the same period, the imports of processed horticulture increased around ten-fold, from US$2.6 million to
US$26.3 million. CIS countries and the EU remain the main destinations for processed horticulture
products, whereby almost half of the total exports of canned fruits and vegetables go to the Russian
market alone. Despite a significant drop in 2007, the share of EU-bound exports has been increasing since,
displacing CIS markets as the historically largest export destination.

            II.      RISKS AND VULNERABILITIES OF MOLDOVAN HORTICULTURE

          II.1       BACKGROUND

31.     Risks and uncertainties are inherent characteristics of value chains.7 However, agricultural value
chains are exposed to a wider array of risks because of the impact of weather on production risks. In the
case of horticultural value chains, further layers of vulnerability are added by the perishability and
pronounced seasonality of products, both increasing a range of marketing risks. Three categories of risks
and vulnerabilities will be reviewed in the context of Moldovan horticulture:

                 (i) PRODUCTION RISKS ─ yields and quality of the products can be impacted by the vagaries of
                     weather. In the case of Moldova's horticulture, early and late season frosts can have
                     significantly negative impacts, in addition to droughts and sudden temperature
                     fluctuations. Biological pests can also impact yields and quality. However, in this case,
                     both proactive and reactive measures can be put in place.

                 (ii) MARKET RISKS ─ geographical distance between production and end-users, coupled with
                      the perishable nature of horticultural produce, introduces a considerable number of so-
                      called marketing risks. In addition, there are many exogenous issues that can impact
                      farmers' competitive position in export markets: e.g. use of subsidies, introduction of
                      tariffs or non-tariff barriers. One of the key issues when considering marketing risk is the
                      issue of "countervailing power"; in other words the importance of balancing market
                      power within the value chain. In the case of Moldova, the preponderance of small farmers
                      leaves them very vulnerable to the market power of buyers, which can override the
                      normal price setting mechanisms of supply and demand. This often leaves farmers as
                      price-takers with little ability to negotiate better terms.

                 (iii) MACRO RISKS ─ these are risks associated with political decisions which impact the unique
                       uncertainties of the food and agricultural sector; e.g. macroeconomic and trade decisions,
                       as well as regulatory policies.

32.      The most prominent type of risks associated with horticultural production at the time of writing
of this study were marketing risks stemming from Russia's ban on the imports of apples and plums from
Moldova. The vulnerability of Moldova's horticulture ─ especially of products destined for export ─ to
sudden changes in Russia's trade policy was therefore one of the main elements of the horticultural value
chain analysis. A high level of understanding exists at the Government level in Moldova that reliance on
exports of few horticultural products (e.g. apples, plums) makes the sector vulnerable. However, this

understanding is arguable not entirely shared by producers who continue to favor their traditional CIS
markets, because they remain mostly profitable.

33.      A common response to marketing risks associated with changes in trade policy in a specific
market is to target a different market. In order to do so efficiently, however, an analysis identifying
products with comparative advantage on target markets needs to be undertaken. This study has reviewed
a considerable amount of literature on horticultural value chains to assess the risks and vulnerabilities of
horticultural value chains in Moldova. In addition to using existing literature, the study has undertaken
three specific rapid value chains reviews: (i) fresh sweet cherry; (ii) walnut; and (iii) greenhouse vegetable
production (see Annexes 1-3). These were chosen because they have not been comprehensively analyzed
before, and because new marketing strategies are being developed for three different target markets:
neighboring EU countries, EU15 countries and the local market.8 The findings of this analysis and the
identification of vulnerabilities should provide valuable insights to the process of enhancing the
competitiveness of the horticulture sub-sector.

34.      The analysis looks at all three main types of risks outlined earlier: production, market and macro
risks. Production and marketing risks are further divided into endogenous and exogenous factors. It is
worth noting that there is obviously some overlapping between the different categories, since it is
impossible ─ in any value chain ─to entirely separate production from marketing risks, as well as
endogenous from exogenous risks. Inevitably, these are at certain points interlinked.

35.     Obtaining accurate agricultural data, especially for production levels and revenues, is often a
daunting task. Farmers often either do not know the size of their fields or are unwilling to divulge
production information or have specific reasons for misrepresenting their output. Therefore, the data on
absolute levels of agricultural output need to be treated with a degree of caution. Wherever possible,
formal agricultural data has been crosschecked during interviews with farmers and other stakeholders.

         II.2      PRODUCTION VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS

         Endogenous factors

36.      Figure 4 in Part I shows that the average yields of most horticultural crops in Moldova are low,
well below the EU average and those of the neighboring countries. Even though it is often assumed that
the soil and climate in Moldova are excellent for horticulture, there are a number of endogenous factors
that likely constrain average horticultural yields. There are farmers in Moldova ─ many of whom have
received support through donor projects ─ capable of achieving productivities comparable with best
international yields. Despite the fact that there are only a handful of these growers, they clearly
demonstrate that the yield potential in Moldova is good. However, the vast majority of small farmers have

8 More resources wouldbe required to produce a fully comprehensive value chain analysis for the three chosen products, but the
produced analyses nevertheless highlight major vulnerabilities that should be addressed for Moldova's horticultural industry to
remain competitive.

                                                                                                                            21
little incentive or capability to try and achieve world-class yields. The remainder of this sub-section looks
at individual endogenous factors affecting production risks: (i) quality of farm management; (ii) area under
cultivation; (iii) sub-optimal functioning of land markets; (iv) old technologies and farming techniques; (v)
inability to import newest varieties; (vi) limited availability and high cost of agro-inputs; as well as (vi)
labor shortages.

37.      Most often, the most important constraint to increasing yields is the competence of farm
management. The lack of competent management coupled with many production risks associated with
adverse climate events and the lack of perceived market opportunities to make a reliable profit all
contribute to the below average yields for most horticultural crops. Unless a farm commands sufficient
land resources to be able to create a diversified portfolio of crops, thus spread risk and create economies
of scale to obtain sufficient market power, it will likely generate insufficient returns to attract competent
management.

38.      The issue of management competence extends beyond the farms themselves to other parts of
the agriculture value chain. For example, if processing and/or export can generate high gains, these two
sub-sectors will attract better management that could in turn increase the potential of earnings for
farmers. In fact, the field visit revealed that processing factories in the walnut value chain have invested
in modern technology and have good management; the attractive margins obtained in the EU15 market
and its stability allows for employment of good management.
39.      The insufficient land area is a major disadvantage for small farmers, who become unable to
spread risks across different crops. During the field visits in Moldova, some very good and large producers
of apples (with 70ha and more of orchards) stated that it was the margins they earned from the field crops
that compensated losses associated with Russia's ban on apple imports from Moldova. In contrast, a much
smaller apple producer (approximately 10ha) interviewed for the purpose of this study was in extreme
financial despair because all his investment was in one single crop and he did not have sufficient land
resources to grow other crops in order to spread risks.

40.     Sub-optimal functioning of land markets can act as an impediment to better yields. Land
fragmentation is often assumed as an important endogenous factor ─ not entirely dependent on the
farmer alone ─ that constrains productivity. Many farmers in Moldova have a hectare or so of land and
the small size makes mechanization ─ except for very high-value crops ─ economically unviable, as small
farming area prevents economies of scale and greater revenue. Yet, the problem of land fragmentation in
practice is not necessarily the most important impediment in Moldova, at least not in the fruit sector. For
example, Table 1 in Part I shows that there are many farmers who have apple trees, but the majority of
the area of orchards is in the hands of very few farmers (62% of the apple orchards are operated by fewer
than 1,000 farmers). In addition, the field visits revealed that some of the large horticultural producers
also had hundreds of hectares of land devoted to field crops.9 However, land purchases require
considerable financial resources and landowners sometime renegade on contracts, demanding their land

9In fact, there are a number of walnut farms of over a 100ha. Among them is an old state farm that has been restructured as a
co-operative and commands 2,600ha of land which is managed centrally with only six shareholders.

                                                                                                                          22
back after they have been planted. Land and farm fragmentation is a more significant constraint, though,
in the vegetables sector, where the typical diversification of vegetables grown in kitchen gardens is not
always conducive to specialization and focus on higher yielding varieties and production techniques.

41.      The use of old technologies and farming techniques also result in lower yields. For example,
many farmers in Moldova grow old varieties that are planted too far apart, without irrigation or hail or
frost protection. At the same time, the cold storage capacity appears to be insufficient to spread
marketing. However, technologies for high-class production are available to mitigate some of the risks,
yet the lack of financial resources, insufficient economies of scale and management skills are preventing
Moldova's farmers from adopting new technologies and introducing new techniques. In other words,
often the potential margins from small-scale fruit production are not sufficiently attractive to stimulate
investment in world-class technologies, despite these being available.

42.      Furthermore, Moldova’s irrigation infrastructure is in poor condition and is a serious constraint
to the development of the agricultural and horticultural sector. Currently the Republic of Moldova has
144,600 ha of irrigated land (230,000 hectares in 1990). In total, there are 78 centralized irrigation systems
in the country, covering an area of 131,688ha. The irrigation systems had been operated for 35-50 years,
and now about 60% of them must be rehabilitated (affected pumps, electrical and control panels, basins,
pipes of water etc.). On average, it is estimated that only 10-20% of agricultural land may be irrigated.
Organizational changes, land parceling, privatization of the hydro technical heritage have caused losses
of integrity and complexity of hydrological systems, significantly reducing the volume of agricultural
production on irrigated land.

43.      A further oft-raised impediment for achieving better yields is the producer’s inability to import
the most modern varieties due to delays in regulatory progress. While this might be a problem restricting
yields and quality of the very best farmers, it is unlikely to be a major factor affecting average yields at
smaller farms. In the case of these farms, better farm management alone would bring important
improvements. Yet, a more open policy on varietal registration would allow for a more streamlined import
process of more disease- and pest-resistant varieties, which would in turn improve yields and quality,
while reducing production costs. Moldovan horticulture would certainly benefit from a more open policy
on registration of varieties, especially the larger farmers whose existing agricultural practices coupled with
the latest varieties would enable them to attain full yield potential. The opportunity to bring in new
varieties of seeds and seedlings that are not yet registered in the Moldova National Catalogue exists (there
is a procedure established by MAFI to allow import of limited volumes of unregistered plant varieties
based on written requests from seed dealers or farmers), even though the process is not fully transparent
and not widely used presently. A simpler solution would be for Moldova to adopt the EU Catalogue for
Plant Varieties.

44.     Similarly, the limited availability and high cost of agri-inputs is reported as an obstacle for
achieving higher yields. In this case, two arguments were often made during the field visit in Moldova.
On the one hand there is the argument that importers allegedly claim excessive margins, which increase
the cost of inputs. On the other hand, importers claim that the Moldova's small market size prevents the

                                                                                                           23
achievement of real economies of scale and that therefore their costs per unit imported are high. At the
same time, it is worth noting that there is no restriction on farmers ─ either individually or as a group ─
importing their own inputs, if they believe this would be cheaper. Yet, one farming group did claim that
import licenses were prohibitively expensive which could explain the perceived high costs of inputs. At
this stage no sufficient data is available to make any decisive conclusion. In order to understand whether
the costs of agro-inputs really are a competitive disadvantage, an international comparison would be
required, followed by a study evaluating whether any revealed price differences are associated with direct
import costs and duties.

45.      One of the key competitive advantages of Moldova's horticulture are low labor costs, yet many
of the larger-scale farmers report having problems recruiting sufficient labor, especially at harvest time.
This merits further attention. Despite the fact that Moldova's rural population mostly consists of small-
farmers with low incomes there is a shortage of labor to work on larger farms. This might be the result of
several factors: (i) the small-farmers' need to harvest their own crops during the same time as larger
farmers seek additional labor; (ii) wages offered might not be sufficiently attractive; and/or (iii) small-
farmers have other sources of income that make additional labor at larger farms unattractive. Certainly,
most likely agricultural employment would be more attractive for the rural population if it was offered as
year-round employment. Given the seasonality of horticulture this appears a difficult proposition, but
growing crops all the year round in greenhouses or producing crops that can be stored dry and processed
throughout the year (e.g. walnuts) is one possible avenue to address this dilemma. Alternatively, higher
wages could attract more labor to agricultural employment, yet further research would be needed to
study the impacts that the increase in current rural wage rates (MDL120-150/day or US$6.5-8.5/day)
would have on the competitiveness of Moldova's horticulture.

46.      The Moldovan agricultural sector is characterized by an aging population; it does not appear
sufficiently attractive for young people.10 In many other countries around the world, the average age of
farmers is increasing so Moldova is not unique, but it is important to recognize that unless farming
becomes more profitable, it will not be attractive to young farmers.

47.     In terms of endogenous factors, better farm management appears to be key. In fact,
horticultural productivity in Moldova already ranges from almost world-class in some of the larger
orchards to very poor productivity on many of the small-farms. The reduction in production risks would
require the targeting of those crops that generate sufficient margins that lead to higher investment
potential to create larger farms ─ with a diverse range of products ─ and to employ management with
better skills. In sum, improved farm management and productivity need to go hand in hand. The
knowledge and expertise for good yields and quality do exist in Moldova, but they are not applied on a
wide enough scale; it is expected that this could be reversed with better management skills. Outside

  The World Bank’s 2013 Public Expenditure Review (PER) has highlighted this lack of young e nergy in agriculture
as one of the main sector challenges and suggested to address this through the annual support fund for
agricultural producers (by introducing a new support measure for young farmers similar to the EU Common
Agricultural Policy, CAP).

                                                                                                                24
programs specifically managed by MAFI, other government initiatives targeted at (rural) enterprises (such
as the Organization for Small and Medium Enterprises) could also play a role towards this objective.



        Exogenous factors

48.     Despite the fact that Moldova's climate and soils are generally considered favorable to the
achievements of high yields and high quality produce, this is not always the case. Moldova's climate can
feature many adverse events, such as (i) spring frosts that damage flowers in fruit orchards, (ii) extreme
cold in winter that can damage walnut trees in certain locations, (iii) hail that can reduce the quality of
apples and plums, (iv) rain at harvest time can cause splitting of cherries and (v) early autumn frosts that
can damage un-harvested apples. The responses to most of them are known: the planting location of
walnut trees has to take into account weather conditions of the area, earlier-maturing varieties of apples
and plums could replace the existing ones, sprinklers can protect flowers from frost, while covers can
prevent hail and rain damage. In addition, irrigation can mitigate the effects of erratic rainfall patterns
that result in droughts.

49.      Mitigation systems to reach this potential require significant capital investment, and this comes
in short supply. Donor funds (such as from the World Bank, International Fund for Agricultural
Development, and more currently MCC and European Investment Bank) provide an important source of
finance for investment in agriculture. Yet, the availability of donor funds is limited, and it is not seen as
providing sufficient resources for the level of investments needed to modernize the country’s agricultural
sector; still, they have been making a valuable contribution to the market and product diversification, and
to the modernization of the horticultural sector.

50.      The availability of irrigation is also a vital ingredient of a competitive horticultural industry, and
this becomes more important with climate change. The irrigation potential on many Moldovan farms is
constrained by the quality of ground water. Therefore, the ex-Soviet irrigation schemes that are being
rehabilitated by MCC represent an opportunity to expand horticultural production. These schemes could
provide15,000 ha of irrigated land in 10 distinct schemes mainly along the Nistru and Prut Rivers. It is
therefore important that the efforts of the MCC are supported in their aim to attract farmers to develop
high-value agriculture in these schemes. However, even though this development provides a large are of
irrigated land, it is still necessary to improve the management capabilities of the farmers, identify market
opportunities and crops that can be grown profitably to ensure that the cost of the water and
management of the schemes can be financed. These irrigation schemes could provide an opportunity for
young farmers who have had the appropriate training to settle and grow high-value crops and earn an
attractive living.

51.     The remaining exogenous risks revolve around pests and diseases. Moldova's horticulture
appears to be less exposed to this kind of risks, as they are considered as either not significant or
controllable. During the field visit, producers expressed clearly that they believe was that marketing
problems associated with the Russia's 2014 ban pose much greater risks than pests and diseases.

                                                                                                            25
         II.3      MARKET VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS

52.     As noted earlier in Part I, Moldova's two most important horticultural exports are apples and
walnuts. In most years the country produces between 350,000MT to 400,000MT. Of these, between
180,000MT to 200,000MT are exported to Russia with the approximate cumulative value of US$58 million,
around 100,000MT are used to process apple juice and the rest is sold on the local market. In terms of
volume, the production of walnut kernels is lower, around 12,000MT to 14,000MT per year, but the value
of exports is higher, around US$71 million. Most of the exports go to EU countries, mainly EU15
countries.11

53.     Unsurprisingly, the discussion on marketing risks and vulnerabilities in 2014 was dominated by
Russia's ban on imports of apples and plums. The other CIS markets remained open for Moldova’s
exporters, yet these represent a significantly smaller share. Following negotiations between the
Government of Moldova and the EU for creating alternative market opportunities for producers affected
by the ban, Moldova's exporters were allowed a duty-free quota for apples of 40,000MT. This was
obviously not enough to compensate for the reduction in trade with Russia, but even more importantly,
the farmers and exporters were not able to take advantage of this ad-hoc arrangement because of quality
and/or packaging issues.

54.     The Russian import ban had a dramatic impact on exports of apples and plums (Table 3). Exports
of apples to CIS countries declined by 41% (from 193,000MT to 114,000MT), but the decrease in export
earnings was reduced by 50% (from US$47.6 million to US$24.0 million). Interestingly, according to
customs data presented in Table 3, the exports of apples to the EU between 2013 and 2014 actually halved
in terms of volume, despite the duty-free quota for apples of 40,000MT. However, table grape and plums
exports to the EU increased significantly during the same period.

55.     The Agricultural Competitiveness and Enterprise Development (ACED) project helped organize
a few consignments of apples from Moldova to Carrefour and other supermarkets in Romania in
October and November 2014.12These were reportedly well received and could represent the start of a
longer-lasting trading relationship, but there is a long way to go before the EU market becomes as big a
market opportunity for Moldovan apples as its historical trade has been to Russia and CIS countries. The
ACED project also assisted with the promotion and negotiation of a few smaller consignments of apples
to the Middle East, but most importantly, the success of grape exports to the EU (increasing from less
than 2,000MT in 2013 to almost 12,000MT in 2014) demonstrates that with some investment and better
management, Moldova's farmers can be competitive in the EU as well.

56.     Moldova currently produces just under 300,000MT of vegetables per year, down from just
under 800,000MT in the 1990s. The vast majority is sold in local markets; exports are confined to small
amounts being exported to neighboring countries. There are some small factories processing vegetables,
mainly tomatoes into puree and a few tinned products, nearly all of which are sold on the local market as
well.

57.    The biggest influence on the profitability of a business is the price it can achieve in the market
and therefore its ability to compete. At one level, Moldova is in a good position in that it has a range of

distinct market opportunities with different characteristics; some of which it can compete more easily in
than others. It has a small local market, constrained by low population, no expansion and slow economic
growth. In the case of horticulture, the local market also faces considerable competition from imports
from countries such as Turkey, Greece and Romania, especially at the beginning and end of Moldova's
season. These countries can compete in Moldova's domestic market because they have longer growing
seasons, economies of scale and/or higher yields: these factors offset extra transport costs.

58.     Traditionally, Moldova's fruit exports have targeted Russia and CIS countries, in particularly the
green (or "open") markets, which pay the lowest prices for what is generally regarded as the lowest
quality. Fruit exports have long dominated the horticultural sector and have arguably been very
profitable─ the main reason why there is in practice little incentive for farmers to change their marketing
strategy. As the report will emphasize later, Russia has occasionally imposed bans on horticultural
products from some of its neighboring countries, as was the case with Moldova in spring 2005, autumn
2013, as well as the most recent one in the summer 2014. These ad-hoc bans have been the main driver
behind the efforts of the Moldova's Government and the donor community to refocus the farmers’
marketing strategy towards the EU.

59.      Until now, the re-orientation of Moldova's exporters towards the EU has concentrated on the
neighboring EU countries and on more perishable products such as apples and stone fruit. However,
before significant exports to the EU can become reality, Moldova's famers and exporters will have to
adhere to high product quality standards and traceability, they will need to improve the quality of
packaging and, in some cases, adjust the grading specifications. A compelling argument can be made that
if Moldova's farmers meet the more stringent requirements demanded by the EU, they should also be
able to tap more demanding markets in Russia.

60.      In 2014, there was an oversupply of apples in many international markets. So in addition to the
Russian ban, the Moldovan apple exporters were also hit by poor prices in many other markets. The
landscape of the Russian market for Moldovan fruit and vegetables is evolving so the Moldovans need to
increase their efforts to develop new markets. Moldova is a niche player in the global apple market and it
needs to recognize this in development of future apple export strategies. The ACED project has assisted
apple producers to export trial shipments to Egypt and Bangladesh as well as establishing contact with an
Indian importer. The analysis of the financial returns of these exports will be interesting and might be
useful in determining future export strategies for Moldovan apples.

        Endogenous factors

61.      As noted earlier, Moldova's horticulture is characterized by a large number of small farmers and
a relatively few large-scale producers. Most small-farmers supply the local market during the harvesting
season and as the local market expands, they should be able to increase production to match new
demand. However, these farmers face challenges during the off-season periods, since most are unable to
raise sufficient capital to build greenhouses and thus extend the season to match demand. Those farmers


                                                                                                        28
with the resources to invest in greenhouses are able to supply the market for longer and there not only
spread revenue, but also take advantage of higher prices created by the market deficit.

62.      The small average farm size is an even bigger challenge in terms of export capacity. In fact, the
cost of aggregation incurred by small-farmers prior to exporting and the lack of post-harvest infrastructure
greatly reduce profitability. Whether this is because market intermediaries extract excessive margins or
simply because the transaction costs are high is debatable. As a rule though, smaller farmers export their
fruit through market intermediaries who purchase the fruit soon after harvest and deliver to Russia. The
price paid generally secures a positive margin to the farmer, but not much more. The returns are in most
cases therefore not sufficient to sustain investment in improved technologies.

63.     Larger farmers and some groups have started to invest in cold stores in order to retain at least
some of the fruit for a few months and take advantage of higher prices off-season (e.g. after Christmas).
Both the Government of Moldova and the donor community have supported the establishment of farmer
groups and cooperatives to build cold storage and grading sheds to take advantage of the rise in market
prices outside the main season.

64.     The concept of cooperative marketing is also gaining traction among smaller farmers, but joint
investment in post-harvest infrastructure and management skills required represent extra costs. It will
be interesting to review how these existing initiatives perform over time. A further challenge to
cooperative marketing of small-farmer horticulture is product variability. In other words, if fruit is grown
by a number of disparate farmers employing different management techniques at distinct sites, there will
inevitably be some natural variation. This is reflected in the story told by an international cherry buyer
during the field visit who stated that he encountered difficulties even in a country such as Turkey, with a
long tradition of cherry production: the variation in quality among small farmers ─ even in one
consignment ─ represented a serious problem for marketing.13

65.       Variability of quality is a major problem for the marketing of fruit from small farmers in the EU.
This is a challenge that the World Bank's Agricultural Competiveness Project is trying to address by helping
groups of farmers access international markets in the West.14 The Project aims to establish groups of five
to six farmers with a total at least 50ha of orchards (i.e. medium-sized operators). Once established, these
groups benefit from considerable amounts of Technical Assistance to prepare business plans, apply for
Government subsidies and train the management in production techniques and business skills. The




13 The buyer did note that purchases from associations of small-farmers in Italy and Spain involved less risk, but these were well-
established associations and the selection among farmers had already taken place. In addition, the farmers often held other jobs
and sometimes took holidays during harvest. Clearly, the crop was not their main source of income, but it was a useful extra
income.

Project also provides up to US$350,000 for equipment (including post-harvest infra-structure); all in all
this represents a major incentives for group formation.15

66.      However, the term 'quality' is hardly objective, as it covers a wide range of parameters, among
others: taste, appearance, and packaging. The taste of Moldova's produce is considered excellent, and
many people throughout the marketing chain confirm this. The real challenge is to turn taste into a major
marketing asset. The switch from current markets (Russia and CIS more broadly) to new markets within
the EU will not be that simple, as it may require an agronomic rethink: new varieties, different plant
populations and grading standards.16 In fact, many of the varieties that are presently grown were selected
specifically for the Russian market and might not match tastes in the EU. This comes in addition to the
need of adopting quality and food safety standards and traceability demanded by the major retailers (e.g.
GlobalG.A.P). Achieving these standards should not be overly difficult, but it does require additional
resources, training and determination. The Government of Moldova and numerous donor projects have
provided resources and Technical Assistance to farmers and processors to meet these internationally
required standards.

67.      The biggest challenge facing Moldova's horticulture is to achieve significant comparative
advantage, so as to be competitive in export markets other than Russia and other CIS countries. In the
EU it faces competition from many of its neighbors with similar climates and cost structures, and many of
them get better yields and higher subsidies. In order to expand and provide employment, the horticultural
industry needs to consider new products and seek new market opportunities. Public support ─ in terms
of policies and regulatory framework ─ helping the farmers achieve these aims will become only more
important with over time.

         Exogenous factors

68.     Problems in export markets were the key issue facing Moldova's horticultural industry in
2014.The horticultural production in Moldova is oriented towards the local market, with fruit exports
destined to Russia and CIS countries for sale in open markets. The local vegetable market is primarily
supplied by small farmers who adapt their output and produce to meet gradual evolution of customer

15 Since its establishment in 2012, the Project has helped establish eight groups: (i) five groups growing table grapes, with a
1,000MT contract to supply Romanian supermarkets; (ii) two apple/plum orchards; and (iii) an almond group. In total this should
benefit between 40 and 48 farmers, each of whom have in the order of 10 to 15ha of productive land. It will however not directly
impact small-farmers with less than 1ha of land, yet should provide employment opportunities for the nearby farming
households. The expectation is that, over time, a few of the better small farmers who have learnt the skills necessary to produce
good quality produce will really reap the marketing benefits of the group.
16 It is worth mentioning the success of Moldova’s wine industry, which has succeeded in moving away from its reliance on the

Russian market. This has largely been achieved by planting grape varieties and producing wines that were preferred in the EU, as
well as targeting other markets in the CIS. As a result, Moldova's wine industry today is much less dependent on Russia's imports
and sales to the EU have significantly increased. Just before the introduction of the ban in 2007, 60% of Moldova's wine was
exported to Russia. By the eve of the last embargo introduced in 2013 this had declined to 29%. However, even though the
reliance on the Russian market has decreased, 69% of wine exports (by value) were still destined for CIS countries in 2013. The
EU absorbed 19% of Moldova's wine exports in 2013, a hefty increase from 4% registered in 2005.

                                                                                                                              30
preferences. Local producers face competition from imports, primarily from Turkey, which gives
continuity of supply and keeps the prices relatively constant. The export market linkages were initially
developed during the Soviet era and have become well-established because all the actors in the value-
chain make an acceptable return on their investment. Whilst these traditional marketing strategies might
have worked satisfactorily in the past, nowadays both supplying the local market and exporting to Russia
face a number of challenges.

69.      On the local market, three main issues deserve attention: (i) the market's small size and lack of
growth; (ii) poor yields; and (iii) increase competition from abroad. The small size of the local market
and the lack of growth are tied to demographic challenges in the form of a slightly shrinking population
and the slow increase in purchasing power.17 As mentioned earlier in the report, poor yields and quality
achieved by Moldova's farmers are the consequence of a relatively poor level of technical and business
management. However, they are increasingly challenged by imports, as consumers start to demand better
quality and the retailers want better service from their suppliers.

70.      If few producers decide to invest in improved technology and top-quality management, they
could significantly improve yields, quality and presentation of vegetables, putting pressure on many
small-producers in the local market. An example of how a farm can dominate a country’s horticulture is
ZZ2 in South Africa which made a conscious decision to implement modern agronomic techniques to
achieve international yields and to establish quality standards in excess of the market’s demands (it
introduced GlobalG.A.P for the produce sold on the local open markets).18It also put in place a world-class
system of man-management and motivation of its workforce. Because of ZZ2's competitive pricing due to
high yields and quality standards, it became the preferred origin of tomatoes for both supermarkets and
open markets in South Africa. Supermarkets are gradually becoming a more dominant part of Moldova's
retail sector and they will likely start demanding both higher quality produce and improved service: this
could provide an interesting market opportunity for better organized farms.

71.      In terms of export markets, unpredictable trade relations with Russia represent a significant
challenge for Moldova's horticulture. In fact, Russia's occasional import bans are the single biggest
exogenous factor negatively affecting patterns of trade. The latest example dates back to July 2014 when
Russia imposed a temporary ban on certain fruits imported from Moldova: apples, plums, pears, quinces,
cherries, peaches, nectarines and sloes. The ban did not cover table grapes.19 Similar bans have been put
in place in the past, including a temporary ban on wine imports from Moldova in September 2013, just
prior to the summit where Moldova signed its Association Agreement with the EU.20



17
   The population of Moldova has decreased slightly over the last two decades, from 3.7 million inhabitants in 1993 to 3.6 million
in 2013.
18 More information about ZZ2 is available at http://www.zz2.biz/.

19 Russia’s Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary Services justified the ban on the basis of "systematic violations of internatio nal

and Russian phytosanitary requirements". Along with Moldova's, Russia also banned selected fruit imports from Poland.
20At the time of writing, Russia's Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary Services was reportedly in talks with Moldova's authorities,

following Moldova's National Food Safety Agency's guarantees that all its apples met Russia’s food safety regulations. (" Crunch

72.     In response to Russia's July 2014 ban, the EU agreed to allow 40,000MT of apples, 10,000MT of
grapes and 10,000MT of plums to be imported duty-free into the EU.21 However, even if Moldova was
able to utilize all of its apple quota, this would amount to 20% of its normal exports to Russia. In practical
terms and despite this ad-hoc EU measure, Russia's ban seriously hurt Moldova's horticultural industry,
because for the majority of the harvesting season there was virtually no export market for apples. At the
same time, the apple juice producers were not able to compensate producers with an attractive price,
because the world apple juice market was over supplied and world prices were low: they were therefore
only able to pay MDL0.05/kg (US$0.03/kg) of fruit. To this amount, Moldova's Government added a
subsidy of MDL0.15/kg (US$0.09/kg) to help recover some of the harvesting costs, but the processors'
purchasing price and the subsidy did not guarantee a sufficient margin to cover other direct costs of
producers, even before taking into account contributions towards overheads and debt repayment.

73.     Some Moldovan apples were sold to Ukraine or Belarus, re-packaged and then re-exported to
Russia. However, this likely amounted to a small portion of the crop and farmers had to accept lower
prices than they would have achieved under normal conditions on the Russian market, as extra
transactions were added to the marketing chain. As a result, in practice many of the apple producers had
no market for a significant portion of their crop during the 2014 harvest.

74.       Growers with access to cold stores were able to harvest their apples and store them, in the hope
that they could still export once Russia's ban would eventually be lifted. However, there is insufficient
capacity within Moldova to store all the apples. Additionally, the farmers undertake significant risk by
covering the costs of the harvest and storage without the guarantee that there will be a market to sell.
Still, those that were able to access (and afford) storage will be able to sell their crop when/if the ban is
lifted.

75.     Faced with unpredictability, Moldova's fruit exporters have started to look at alternative
markets. The main markets that have been investigated are within the EU and, to a lesser extent, the
Middle East. Within the EU, the main market that fresh fruit exporters have focused on ─ and in fact
exported to following the EU's temporary measures in 2014 ─have been Romania, mainly because of its
proximity and similarity in language and customs. They would undoubtedly be less competitive in EU
markets further afield.

76.      The entry into new markets, especially within the EU, is constrained by local specificities, as
well as quality and procedural issues. For example, supermarkets in Romania require different fruit
varieties than those in Russia: smaller in size, tightly graded and with GlobalG.A.P certification. This makes

it virtually impossible for growers to simply switch their marketing strategies as soon as they face an
unexpected trade barrier. Some farmers are gradually starting to change varieties and implement
GlobalG.A.P, but this is a long-term strategy and would be still leave them vulnerable to sudden Russia's
import bans. Yet another example of the difficulties faced in new markets is provided by the recent efforts
by growers and exporters in the Middle East. Following initial orders, they encountered problems in
getting packaging of the right size. Nevertheless, these initiatives demonstrate that it is possible to
diversify markets away from Russia, but change will take time and will come at a cost.22

77.     This report devoted most of its attention in the field of marketing to the apple industry, as this
was the sector most hurt by Russia's ban in 2014. However, it is worth noting that good progress has
been made with respect to export diversification of other fruit, in particular table grapes ─even though
these were not banned from the Russian market in 2014. In addition, the research for this report devoted
considerable attention to fresh cherries (Annex 1) and walnuts (Annex 2), both chosen because they had
interesting export opportunities in the EU. There are a number of lessons learnt from their value chain
analysis:

     (i) The long-term profitability of both crops, but especially walnuts, looked very promising. However,
         only after a more detailed analysis we would be able to say this with total certainty, since the
         current yield potential and cost structures are estimates only.

     (ii) There seems to be a positive market demand for both crops, yet important differences exist. The
          demand for healthy and nutritious foods has generated interest for walnuts in many countries
          and because of its high unit value the transport costs to distant markets do not unduly undermine
          competitiveness. Cherries, on the other hand, are a lower value and perishable crop that faces
          stiff competition from Moldova's neighboring countries, many of which have already invested in
          cherry orchards.

     (iii) Being tree crops, both walnuts and cherries require capital investments over a longer period of
           time before they generated a positive annual margin. Financial capacity or constraints will thus
           play a key part in the development of new orchards. At present, these are probably most suited
           for larger farmers who are generating cash surpluses from other crops and can make investments
           in cherry and walnut orchards from retained earnings.

     (iv) Even though there are Government subsidies for planting both crops, they only cover a small
          portion of the establishment costs. Therefore, if export crops such as these are to be promoted,
          increasing the level of subsidies should be considered.



22Some apple producers interviewed during the field visit clearly stated that they will continue exporting to Russia when/if the
ban was lifted. They regard the EU as purely a short-term opportunity. It is also worth noting that larger farmers whose orchards
were just one of their crops, emphasized that losses suffered on apple crops could be compensated by field crops or from profits
made from the previous year’s exports.

                                                                                                                              33
    (v) Both cherries and walnut exports would be much more competitive if grown on larger farms. The
        cherries would be more attractive to buyers because their quality would be much more uniform
        and a large walnut plantation would justify an investment in cold storage and processing factory,
        which would make it easier to access the high priced retail markets.

    (vi) There is need for a better understanding of the best agronomic techniques to achieve the best
         yields and quality, especially for walnut production.

78.      The analyses in Annex 1 and Annex 2 demonstrate that opportunities do exist for Moldova's
horticultural exports to diversify beyond Russia. Walnuts area well-established crop and Moldova is
already the second biggest supplier to the EU (after the USA). They are sold into many national markets,
but most go to France and Germany (although some of the exports to France are kernels from whole
walnuts imported originally from France for processing in Moldova and then re-exported). With further
investment and long-term planning, exports could be increased and higher added-value could attained.
Cherry exports are currently focused on CIS countries, but some could be re-directed towards the EU with
relatively modest investment and effort.

79.     Interestingly, the walnut exports from Moldova are based on the vast natural endowment with
walnut trees planted along roads during the Soviet era. These are harvested by the willing rural
population that cracks the nuts to remove the kernel. Established marketing chains aggregate nuts and
transport them to factories where they undergo quality control and packaging, and are eventually
exported. However, the exogenous market issue that appears to be preventing Moldova's walnuts to
access the highest-priced retail markets is the lack of traceability and the uncertainty about hygiene
standards. The buyers would clearly prefer to buy nuts that have been grown on a plantation and
processed in a factory where traceability and hygiene standards can be controlled and confirmed.
However, the harvesting and cracking obviously provide a useful extra income for the rural population
that would be at least partly displaced by the emergence of larger plantations and factories. The buyers
and/or exporters need to explore whether a higher purchasing price could be offered for the unshelled
nuts, and then transfer these to larger facilities where quality and hygiene standards can be monitored.

80.      Apple juice and some processed vegetables are two additional food products where Moldova
has created interesting export opportunities outside Russia and CIS countries. Apple juice is a widely
traded commodity and most Moldova's processors have well established marketing links. In fact, some of
the apple juice is even sold to China, the world’s biggest apple juice producer. The apple juice industry
uses sub-standard apples that can be bought at a low price. There are three major apple-processing
companies (Ohei-Vit JSC, Natur Bravo JSC and Alfa-Nistru JSC), which together process around 80% of the
apple juice in Moldova. In a normal year, about 90,000MT of apples are bought for processing and about
24,000MT of juice are exported. One of these companies has financed an expansion of its processing
capacity with a loan from its EU-based importer and is repaying it by supplying juice at a price based on
the local cost of apples with a mark-up to cover the cost of processing. This arrangement is an
exceptionally sound way of reducing marketing risk: it guarantees the processor a sales outlet and the
pricing formula takes care of the risks associated with the variability of prices paid to apple producers,

                                                                                                       34
which is the processor’s biggest direct cost. As for the exports of processed vegetables to then EU, there
are admittedly limited at the moment. However, one company (Fabrica de conserve din Calarasi JSC) has
developed a niche market opportunity by selling a range of processed vegetables and jams in Germany,
primarily targeting retailers who focus on local ethnic markets (Russian and CIS countries). Even though
the value of these exports might be small, they demonstrate that niche markets can be accessed.

         II.4     OTHER VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS

81.     To a large extent, production and marketing risks in the horticultural sector can be controlled
by the private sector. However, there are some other factors outside the domain of the private sector,
yet can have profound impacts. For example, besides systemic production risks related to adverse
weather events, and political risks associated with changes within the political system, changes in the
regulatory environment, armed conflicts, or trade restrictions are all major risks faced by economic actors.
Some of these macro risks affect the operating environment directly, some indirectly through production
and market issues. The remained of the section looks at specific groups of macro risks in Moldova and
outlines key challenges identified.

         Policy and institutional framework

82.      Since the end of the Soviet era, the funding of public sector research has not matched
expectations of the research community and has led to a contraction in research output. The resulting
inability to advise horticultural producers about the best techniques has been in part compensated for by
donor projects and technical advice from overseas consultants.23However, there is a deficiency of local
expertise within Moldova, while expertise from neighboring countries is not widely accessible.

83.      As in other sectors of the economy, innovation is good for horticultural industry as well. In fact,
the expansion and diversification into new products and markets would require more innovation than
there is at present. As innovation entails certain financial risks, small farmers and producers will most
likely abstain, but larger farmers and businesses could lead the way. They often employ better and more
entrepreneurial management and also generate enough profits from existing operations that they could
invest retained earnings in innovation. In addition, public sector can support innovation by setting up
incentives or special financial instruments. Many countries have tried to promote innovation by
establishing innovation funds that subsidize some of the costs associated with research and development
being undertaken by private companies.

84.     Like many of its neighboring countries, Moldova offers financial support that promotes
horticultural investment, for the expansion of planted areas, as well as for investments in equipment
and infrastructure. However, these subsidy schemes are sometimes difficult to understand and the

23One example is the already noted ACED project which has provided considerable assistance to the fresh cherry industry.
Another example can be taken from the walnut industry where experts from France and America were brought in to advise
producers and processor/exporters.

                                                                                                                     35
implementing authority often runs out of funds. Moreover, they are dwarfed by the levels of support that
are provided by EU member states – and in particular those countries that joined after 2004 (and are in
more direct competition with Moldova) – to their own agricultural producers. When positioning itself
against EU competitors, it will be important for Moldova to seek and exploit those market opportunities
that utilize its comparative and competitive advantages, without exposing its public support
vulnerabilities. The success of the Moldovan walnut sector demonstrates that such potential exists.

85.     One of the key challenges limiting the development of the horticultural sector is the low level
of management skills present in the industry. Moldova has a system of agricultural colleges that provide
agricultural education, but is in its present form performing sub-optimally for a number of reasons. First,
there are only six colleges and all of them are located outside Chisinau. They are not popular among
Moldova's youth, likely because agriculture is associated with backwardness and the perception that
agricultural education does not lead to high-income jobs. Second, the curricula of these colleges are
outdated and do not reflect the demands of modern agro-food industry that require more marketing and
business skills than this was the case in the past. Only one of these colleges focuses on horticulture (Taul
in Donduseni in the North of the country) and it also concentrates on technical aspects and not business
or marketing. Third, like universities, these colleges lack good interactions with the private sector; such
links are essential to spur innovation and transfer of knowledge as well as motivating students. The
agricultural university system is equally focused on relatively outdated technologies and devotes little
attention to modern business aspects of agriculture.

        Political risks

86.     The main political risk facing the horticultural industry is the question of Moldova's overall
geopolitical orientation. Should it seek prosperity by building on its historical ties to Russia and other CIS
countries, or should it attempt to integrate more with the EU? If a change in government leads to a change
in orientation, then Moldova will continue to face uncertainty. As noted earlier, much of the market risk
associated with trading with Russia stems from this dilemma.

        II.5     RISK EXPOSURE AND RESPONSES OF ACTORS ALONG THE HORTICULTURE VALUE CHAIN

87.     There are three broad types of risk management responses that businesses and organizations
along a value chain may adopt to address risk: (i) mitigation; (ii) transfer; and (iii) coping. The following
section provides an overview of these different types and then applies them to the various groups of
private agricultural stakeholders (farmers, aggregators, exporters, processors), as appropriate.

        Risk Mitigation

88.    Mitigation strategies are active strategies taken to reduce the likelihood of adverse events,
exposure and/or losses. Most commercially oriented farmers and organizations will use them to cope
with potential consequences of failure in the horticultural sector, although they are often medium- to


                                                                                                           36
longer-term solutions and can be expensive to implement (e.g. investments in on-farm infrastructure to
nullify the impact of adverse weather or diversified crops to spread market risks).

89.      FARMERS ─ A farmer's mitigation strategy will depend on the size of the farm. Larger farmers have
the resources (e.g. land area, finance and management skills) to grow a range of crops, so they are less
vulnerable to production or market failure of one of the crops. They can grow a range of horticultural
crops or even field crops and also have accumulated the retained earnings to invest in systems to prevent
adverse weather impacting them. Medium-sized horticultural farmers face more difficulties in spreading
production risks, because diversification automatically implies reduce areas for each crop, thus reducing
(or eliminating) the benefits of the economies of scale and their countervailing power. However, medium-
sized farmers can join an association or group to mitigate against some marketing risks, as well as access
to support for on-farm infrastructure (e.g. storage, technical assistance). Small-scale farmers all too often
do not have the resources needed to implement mitigation strategies. Instead, they keep their
expenditure on crop inputs to a minimum and if there is a production or market failure, they simply cope
with it.

90.      AGGREGATORS – Aggregators mitigate risks by retaining price flexibility (i.e. avoiding fixed price
contracts) and thus only paying farmers a price that is directly related to market price. Market
intelligence in their case is key, since an aggregator needs to minimize – to the extent possible – the risk
associated with a sudden market price change between the time they buy from the farmer and sell to the
next actor up the value chain. If there is a production failure, aggregators will have some overheads they
will not be able to cover, but they will try to keep these to a minimum by only investing in structures out
of retained earnings and employing as few permanent staff as possible. For this reason, aggregators tend
to hire buildings and transport.

91.      PROCESSORS – Processors are more vulnerable to production and marketing risk relative to
aggregators, because they usually have significant overheads associated with the factory equipment
and permanent staff. They are also more likely to have a market that will expect to be supplied with their
processed product and failure to meet these expectations can lead to significant reputational damage.
Processors rely on having a stable supply of cheap raw materials. Therefore, their risk mitigation strategy
is to either rely on purchasing byproducts or to purchase from larger farmers who are more reliable
suppliers. Some processors may even conclude contracts with farmers, but these tend to be for products
that are difficult to purchase on the open market– apart from these, contracts for perishable produce are
not a very successfully mitigation strategy. Some processors in Moldova have resorted to own production
as a mitigation strategy to guarantee their fruit and vegetable supplies. However, because of the
investment that is required and the exposure to production risks, processors prefer to avoid integration
down-stream.

92.     EXPORTERS – Exporters are similar to aggregators in that they mitigate against market risk by only
paying the producer, or aggregator, a price that they know that they can recover when they eventually
export the produce. However, production risk can be much more of a problem for exporters, especially
to those operating in more sophisticated markets. In fact, if there is a production failure and the exporter

                                                                                                          37
is not able to supply the market the difference between markets is quite stark For example, if the missing
produce was to be sold in the wholesale markets in Russia, there is only very limited reputation risk, as
the buyers will simply purchase from another source.24 On the other hand, failing to supply the much
more sophisticated EU supermarket trade has a much greater impact on an exporters' reputation and may
well lead to being excluded in future years. This is why exporters will lean towards larger farmers who
have the resources to invest in field infrastructure to mitigate against production failures.

         Risk Transfer

93.     Transfer strategies reduce the level of risk by transferring it ─ in part or entirely ─ to another
willing party, normally for a fee or premium. Commercial insurance and hedging are the best known
forms of risk transfer, but these solutions (i) are often limited in the scope of their applicability, or (ii) can
be prohibitively expensive for cash-strapped smaller-farmers, or (iii) could simply not be available,
especially in some of the poorer countries.

94.     FARMERS AND GOVERNMENT – The obvious transfer strategy for farmers is to insure their crops
against adverse weather. In turn the governments can provide financial support (or other incentives) to
make the insurance more attractive and/or affordable. In fact, this is what the Government of Moldova
does: it encourages farmers to purchase insurance by providing a 50% subsidy of crop insurance
premiums– a measure that can be especially useful for the medium-sized and large-scale farmers.

         Coping with Risks

95.     Coping strategies do not contain actions to reduce risks, but simply prepare the business or
organization to better absorb the consequences of failure. In practice, most businesses and organizations
develop active strategies to mitigate or transfer risks, very few simply cope because the potential damages
stemming from production and/or market failure are usually too large to be left unmitigated. The one
group that more often simply copes with risk are the small-farmers, due to their lack of resources.

96.     FARMERS – Many small-farmers without active risk management strategies take measures at the
household level to minimize the production or market risk to their income. A coping strategy of a small-
farmer would therefore often involve improved resilience to withstand failures by diversifying sources of
income (e.g. non-agricultural employment, remittances). Within the remit of public policy, coping
strategies help limiting the losses through the provision of social safety nets, buffer funds, or strategic
reserves. Coping strategies are really only effective as short-term solutions, while mitigation or transfer
strategies are more appropriate over a longer-term.




24In the particular case of Russia, it can even be argued that because of the regularity of import bans, the buyers are used to
some countries at times not supplying at all.

                                                                                                                            38
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

97.      Horticulture has consistently been a critical sector for Moldova’s economic development . It is
the major industry in the country generating revenue and the major employer. In recent years, it has
secured important export markets and revenues, and has supplied much of its own horticultural produce
for local consumption. However, the contribution of the fruit and vegetable sectors has been unequal.
While fruit production (apples, plums and grapes, in particular) has been the driving force of economic
and export growth, vegetables have not yet managed to gain sufficient market recognition and shares,
neither domestically, nor internationally. The low yields and poor quality of produce for the local market
invites competition from imports, and Moldova remains a net importer of vegetables.

98.     Moldova is endowed with good soils and a reasonable climate, which it made good use of during
the Soviet era, but if it wants to build on this tradition, it is important that some steps are taken to
provide a solid base from which the industry can regroup and push forwards to eventually become a
world-class horticultural power house. With the application of finance, technical expertise, management
and collaboration the necessary scale can be achieved to revitalize the industry. The scale itself brings
competitive advantage: it allows investment in research, market development, innovation, training and
value addition.

99.    The country needs a vibrant horticulture industry: there are many families that depend on it
and there are many more that could benefit from it. A flourishing industry will support thousands directly
and even more indirectly in servicing the industry:

        -   Moldova’s horticultural sector only has a significant base of large-scale farmers, possibly
            about a thousand or two, who have the scale to be able to compete on international markets,
            even if some of them are currently lacking in technical expertise and some on-farm infra-
            structure to diversify their market risks. What is important is that these larger farms have the
            land resources to grow a range of crops to spread the risks of market and crop failures.
            Additionally, these farmers have the opportunities to drive innovation, if they are given the
            correct support and motivation and become the power-house for driving forward the
            modernization of Moldovan horticulture.

        -   In turn, it employs at least 400,000 small farmers who contribute little to the formal trade in
            horticultural production, but are important contributors to the provision of fruit and
            vegetables at the village level. In its present state, the large-scale horticulture sector can
            compete in international markets, but the small-scale farmers lack resources, and
            importantly, the capabilities, to become major players in new market or crop development.
            Small-scale farmers on their own cannot sustain competition in the European markets for
            fresh produce; they cannot achieve the volumes and consistency of supply that the major
            distributors require. If Moldova is to achieve the vision of a flourishing horticultural industry
            that is resilient to risk, it must start with larger businesses that are profitable, sustainable and


                                                                                                             39
            able to respond effectively to challenges. Such larger operations can bring in the
            management, technology and know-how needed for developing the foundation of an
            industry. With that foundation, small-scale enterprises might develop niche opportunities.

        -   Besides the cadre of larger-farms, Moldova also has some horticultural processing industries
            that add value by producing shelled walnuts in retail packs for the EU market, internationally
            traded apple juice and preserved vegetables and jams for niche markets in Germany. These
            processing operations and the cadre of larger farms that are already engaged in exports do
            give the foundation for establishing a vibrant horticultural industry, but they need much more
            help if they are going to compete with Moldova’s nearby major horticultural power-houses
            (such as Poland, Turkey or Greece).

100. However, the sector is facing considerable uncertainty, mainly because of its climate and
market vulnerabilities. Fruit and vegetables production and yields remain highly susceptible to weather
extremes, as demonstrated by the severe droughts in 2007 and 2012. Hail, rain damage and frosts are
also frequently affecting horticulture production in Moldova. Market and price vulnerabilities have
manifested mostly in the form of market gluts, and subsequently depressed prices, in favorable years, and
have been exacerbated by the continued dependence on a major export market. Russia remains the main
trading partner for the main fruits produced in Moldova, which include apples, plums and grapes. The
increasingly volatile geopolitical in the region has translated into several bans on Moldova’s agriculture
and horticulture exports, which have severely disrupted the incomes of the Moldovan producers.

101. Despite considerable efforts, exports to alternative markets were not yet able to adequately
compensate for the lost market opportunity. For instance, following the 2014 Russia ban, Moldova
negotiated a 40,000MT duty-free quota for its apples to access the EU market. Still, this fell short of the
180,000MT to 200,000MT of apples that are typically exported to Russia every year. Yet, even more
importantly, the Moldovan farmers and exporters were not able to take advantage of this ad-hoc
arrangement because of quality and/or packaging issues. Many of the Moldovan products, while matching
the taste, quality and phytosanitary requirements on the Russian market, are not yet adapted to meet the
consumer and food safety demands on alternative markets such as the EU.

102.    The diversification of product range and (export) market is an obvious path to explore, and this
report shows that opportunities do exist for Moldova's horticultural exports to diversify beyond Russia.
Walnuts are a well-established crop and Moldova is already the second biggest supplier to the EU (after
the USA). With further investment and long-term planning, exports could be increased and higher added-
value could attained. Cherry exports are currently focused on CIS countries, but some could be re-directed
towards the EU with relatively modest investment and effort. More specifically:

        -   The long-term profitability of both crops, but especially walnuts, looks very promising.
            However, only after a more detailed analysis we would be able to say this with total certainty,
            since the current yield potential and cost structures are estimates only.


                                                                                                        40
        -   There seems to be a positive market demand for both crops, yet important differences exist.
            The demand for healthy and nutritious foods has generated interest for walnuts in many
            countries and because of its high unit value the transport costs to distant markets do not
            unduly undermine competitiveness. Cherries, on the other hand, are a lower value and
            perishable crop that faces stiff competition from Moldova's neighboring countries, many of
            which have already invested in cherry orchards.

        -   Being tree crops, both walnuts and cherries require capital investments over a longer period
            of time before they generated a positive annual margin. Financial capacity or constraints will
            thus play a key part in the development of new orchards. At present, these are probably most
            suited for larger farmers who are generating cash surpluses from other crops and can make
            investments in cherry and walnut orchards from retained earnings.

        -   Even though there are Government subsidies for planting both crops, they only cover a small
            portion of the establishment costs. Therefore, if export crops such as these are to be
            promoted, increasing the level of subsidies should be considered.

        -   Both cherries and walnut exports would be much more competitive if grown on larger farms.
            The cherries would be more attractive to buyers because their quality would be much more
            uniform and a large walnut plantation would justify an investment in cold storage and
            processing factory, which would make it easier to access the high priced retail markets.

        -   There is need for a better understanding of the best agronomic techniques to achieve the best
            yields and quality, especially for walnut production.

103. There are also good opportunities from improving vegetable production and quality standards
for the local market. Most of the recommendations have focused on improving competitiveness and
opportunities for fruit production that is targeted for export markets, but there should also be efforts
made to improve vegetable production for the local market. Currently, the yields of vegetables for the
local market are low and the quality of the produce is, at best, variable. There are significant amounts of
vegetables imported due in part to the seasonality of local production, but the use of greenhouses and
poly tunnels could lengthen the season. The expected increased dominance of the supermarkets in food
retailing will also create opportunities for farmers, but to take advantage of these opportunities, it is
important that yields and quality improve and that the level of presentation and service are raised. If a
few of the better larger farmers growing vegetables decided to use world class technologies, they could
vastly improve yields and increase their domestic market shares. This should lead to cheaper and more
hygienic vegetables in the urban areas. Once improved yields and supermarket standards are achieved,
there might be some export opportunities to neighboring countries.

104. Horticulture in Moldova is already receiving significant help from major donors to help with
market diversification and indeed provide assistance to help farmers cope with market failures .
However, most of these interventions have shorter-term horizons often associated with the

                                                                                                        41
establishment of donor projects. This study has identified a number of areas where further interventions
are needed to help develop strategies and policies to secure the longer-term future of the horticultural
sector. These include:

         -    A comprehensive risk assessment of the Moldovan agriculture sector (including horticulture),
              in order to put in place a coherent set of risk management tools;
         -    A better understanding of the horticultural value chain – especially of the market
              opportunities, potential profitability and Moldova’s competitive advantage;
         -    Benchmarking of production costs and subsidies with neighboring countries for both the
              production and processing of horticultural crops;
         -    Focus efforts on further improving the business and marketing management skills of the
              domestic producers;
         -    Promoting innovation;
         -    Improving distribution of technological knowledge of crop production and marketing;
         -    Better understanding the coping strategies of the rural population and their incentives to
              accept work opportunities.

105. A comprehensive risk management assessment is needed to map, measure, and propose a
coherent set of instruments to address the constellation of risks that affect Moldova’s horticulture, in
particular, and agriculture, more broadly. Such an analysis could follow an analytical framework, as the
one outlined in Figure 13 below. The figure distinguishes between independent and systemic risks25, on
the one hand, and between normal and catastrophic26, on the other hand. It is important to recognize
that farm risk is a multidimensional issue, and that various risk management tools can be developed in
order to cope with the above risks and their individual characteristics. The core ingredient is the same in
any country and in any economic environment. However, the design of the tool and its commercial form
differ due to local demand characteristics, culture and local history, sector organization and public
incentives.




25 A risk is considered independent when the probability of occurrence of adverse events does not depend on economic agents
affected by this risk. A risk is considered systemic when the probability of occurrence of adverse events does depend on economic
agents involved. For example, price is a fully systemic risk, since very low market commodity prices affect all producers at the
same period of time.
26 A normal risk applies usually to adverse events with a low expected loss (either the probability of occurrence or the value of

the loss) and a catastrophic risk carries a high expected loss, especially a high potential value loss.

                                                                                                                              42

106. Under this framework, four types, or "families", of tools can be considered for using in the
future:

       (i)     Fiscal tools are a means to smooth farm income, whereby a national public authority
               recognizes that agriculture is affected by specific natural shocks that lead to "normal" farm
               income volatility.

       (ii)    Insurance contracts are used against independent risk and "in between" risks. Contracts that
               cover "in between" risks provide revenue or margin coverage and are sometimes referred to
               as hybrid contacts, as the insurers manage risks by pooling together the independent risk
               component and option risk replication on the financial market (if available).

      (iii)    Financial contracts are used against systemic risk that can thus be dispersed among large and
               well-diversified portfolios of investors.

      (iv)     Public safety nets are a governmental provision of support to agriculture in case of
               catastrophic events, as a measure to ensure social stability (both from a consumer's and/or a
               producer's point of view).

It will be important to establish, however, the appropriate mix of tools applicable to Moldova’s agricultural
conditions, the adequate division of roles and risk sharing between the public and private sectors, as well
as the appropriate targeting of these risk management instruments.

107. Further analysis is needed for an improved understanding horticultural value-chains, especially
of future market opportunities, potential profitability and Moldova’s competitive advantage. There
might have been a number of horticultural value chains undertaken in Moldova, but many of these do not
fully analyze the costs of production, do not research the market properly, and result in misleading
potential selling prices and have not understood what are the comparative/competitive advantages for
Moldovan producers. Without this information, it is extremely difficult for the Government to develop

                                                                                                          43
strategies to promote horticulture, it might lead potential investors to lose money and it makes
coordination of donor support virtually impossible. Many of the existing Value Chain Studies make
references to the quality of soils and climate, especially their impact on taste, but there is a poor
understanding of how this can be converted into competitive advantage. It is appreciated that the Russian
ban on imports has caused short-term problems for the horticultural industry, but it is important that the
industry still has a long-term strategy based on sound businesses and market opportunities. Therefore, an
analysis of horticultural value chains that include a comprehensive understanding of the real costs of
production and comprehensive market research is warranted. It would be able to recommend to
Government and potential investors on the best products to promote, help stimulate innovation and help
establish the longer-term vision for the horticultural industry. This information would be vital to the
development of policies and also the establishment of more appropriate and focused subsidies.

108. Such analysis should include the benchmarking of production costs and subsidies with
neighboring countries.27 Many farmers exporting fruit claim that they are being disadvantaged by the
higher subsidies that producers in neighboring countries receive, especially in the EU. It is important that
this competitive position is understood and that proper adaptive strategies are considered for the
Moldovan exporters. In addition, the benchmarking exercise could also attempt to compare costs of
production for horticultural crops and processing to gain further understanding of Moldova’s competitive
position with its nearby competitors. Moldova does successfully process some horticultural products and
its farmers would benefit from an expanded processing sector. It is believed that there is considerable
opportunity to expand horticultural processing; benchmarking of costs should confirm this and be useful
in attracting foreign investment in new technologies. However, to promote further investment in
horticultural processing, especially foreign direct investment, it is necessary to be able to demonstrate
Moldova’s economic advantages. Benchmarking data should be routinely updated, and this is relatively
simple once an appropriate model has been developed. This would be an extremely useful tool for
attracting new foreign investment, which is vital for bringing new technologies and market access into
Moldova. When this benchmarking comparison is complete, it can provide compelling reasons for
Government to revise policies and strategies to create an attractive business environment for Moldovan
farmers and investors.

109. Consolidated efforts need to be made towards improving the business and marketing
management skills of the domestic producers. The key to the success in any business is the quality of
management; especially business and marketing skills; all too often it is assumed that if a “technology
bullet” is identified, then that will be the solution for success, but it only works if it is allied to good

27Benchmarking is an important technique to help companies, and countries, become more efficient. Originally the concept of
a benchmark was as a reference or measurement standard used for comparison; it probably originated as a surveyor's mark on
a permanent object of predetermined position and elevation which could be used as a reference point. Now it is applied more
widely to measure the performance of a company’s (or country’s) costs, outputs, quality, service or process efficiency agains t
best practices elsewhere and it can be vitally important to understanding the competitive position. Benchmarking an organization
can be used to help establish targets, priorities and improvements, leading to competitive advantage and/or cost reductions. In
addition to using benchmarking data to establish competitive position, it can also be very important for establishing internal
management targets to drive efficiency, cost savings etc.

                                                                                                                             44
commercial management. In Moldova, this was reconfirmed in interviews with large farmers and business
leaders. Good technical management can be recruited internationally in the short-term, but this can be
costly and in the longer-term it will be necessary to utilize Moldovan trained management.

110. In this context, priority should be given to revamping agriculture education and modernizing its
curriculum to meet contemporary business needs. Moldova has a system of pre-university level
agricultural colleges (seven, all located outside of Chisinau) to support the industry. These colleges are
not popular with the country’s youth, most likely because they do not lead to remunerative jobs. There is
only one college that focuses on horticulture (Taul in Donduseni, in the north of the country), and it
concentrates on technical aspects and not business or marketing. The curriculum of the rest of these
colleges are outdated and do not correspond to the requirements of a modern agricultural industry, let
alone the more sophisticated requirements of horticulture. The curriculum at these colleges need to be
reviewed and help could be given to introducing courses on business administration that are specifically
designed for the training of middle-management and supervisors for the horticultural industry. These
diploma courses should have a strong link with the private sector with an emphasis on practical
horticultural production and business management. In addition, these colleges could provide on-farm
training for the introduction of the certification demanded by the EU retailers, e.g. GlobalG.A.P and other
private standards, which is a good way of establishing close linkages with the private sector.

111. Similarly, it is recommended that the university curricula is reviewed, and more emphasis is
placed on modern business practices and closer cooperation with the private sector. Agricultural higher
education was established in 1933 in State Agrarian University of Moldova (UASM) and it is now the only
University providing a course in horticulture. The numbers on this course are decreasing. The curriculum
covers the basics of horticultural production and has not been adapted to reflect market economy
requirements needed in Moldova. Training is mainly theoretical, as the University has limited contact with
the private sector to organize student placements. It is recommended that efforts be made to add courses
on business administration, marketing, etc. that are relevant to the Moldovan industry. An alternative to
supporting UASM could be to introduce a Master’s in horticultural marketing or commercial horticulture,
which would target students who already have an understanding of horticulture, but would provide them
with training in business administration. This could be introduce by the Academy of Economic Studies of
Moldova, which already has staff who are well versed in delivering modern business training. These more
commercially trained graduates could then take up positions in Government, donor projects as well as
private companies and this should help develop more business-focused strategies and polices impacting
on the horticultural industry.

112. Another approach could be to introduce a scheme for accelerated learning for selected
university graduates, which would provide a combination of training programs in business with
placements in companies offering practical management experience. This model has been developed
successfully in the UK by the horticultural industry and is called Management Development Services Ltd
(MDS Ltd).28 It was established about 25 years ago by a group of about 25 companies who recognized that

28   More information at: http://www.mds-ltd.co.uk

                                                                                                        45
they had to attract more good graduates if they were going to remain competitive. MDS was set up as a
non-profit making organization to attract graduates with management potential who wanted to work in
the fresh food and produce industry. The scheme provides the graduates with an accelerated
management training program that consists of four placements in their members’ companies; each
placement lasts six months. These placements are real and practical management jobs and the members
commit to give the student one-to-one training. There is also formal off-the-job training which consists of
finance and accounting, negotiation skills, management, marketing, or business strategy, and the
graduates are expected to do dissertations on each of their placements. When they have completed the
program, they attain a Certificate in Food and Fresh Produce Management validated by a University.
Whilst being trained, the students get paid a salary. The strength of this scheme comes from members
working in partnership with a common goal, even though some may be competitors in the commercial
world.

113. If Moldova is to create competitive advantage, it will be through high quality, professional and
innovative management. There are a number of possible solutions to increasing the cadre of competent
managers with the skill set to drive the Moldovan horticultural industry forward. It is recommended that
the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI) reviews these options and, working with
international horticultural training specialists, the Moldovan Universities and the Moldovan private sector
to develop a clear action plan to improve business management, which needs to be supported by the
donors.

114. If it is to succeed in developing a world class and competitive horticultural industry and develop
higher paid and better jobs for the rural workforce, Moldova must innovate. It is recognized that the
start-up and development costs of truly new and innovative enterprises in Moldova is expensive and
difficult. An Innovation Fund, managed by MAFI, could be set up to provide matching grants and
supplementary technical assistance to encourage companies to innovate. Ideally, this innovation fund
would target successful farming and processing companies with the clear aim of stimulating diversification
as well as become more competitive through increasing yields, improving quality and service, and
reducing their cost structure. The use of benchmarking data could be useful to focus innovative efforts.
The Innovation Fund could finance the development of new products or markets, the uptake of new
technologies or processes, or the building of new strategic relations among the value chain actors. A
model this Fund might be the Fundación Chile29, established in 1976, involving a partnership between the
Chilean Government and BHP Billiton-Minera Escondida. The Fundación established a number of
successful enterprises introducing new technology to Chile.

115. Improved distribution of technological knowledge of crop production and marketing could
greatly improve the performance of the horticulture sector. Moldovan horticulture would benefit from
improved technical knowledge on many aspects of production. Some crop associations, such as the
walnut, are bringing in experts from outside to give agronomic and processing advice, whilst some donor
projects are also providing specialist support. This should be encouraged because most of the fruit crops

29   More information at: www.fundacionchile.com

                                                                                                        46
in Moldova are perennial, therefore it would be impractical to wait for local research scientists to generate
agronomic advice. Therefore, bringing in technical experts is a sensible short-term solution, but it is also
important that this information is distributed widely and trials can be established to determine best
practices in Moldova in the longer-term. The horticultural research workers would obviously like to be
funded to carry out detailed agronomic research and provide recommendations for the farmers, but the
long-term nature of many of the horticultural crops makes this a non-starter. Therefore, it would be
sensible for the private sector through an Association to decide on what technical advice is required and
what the best source of this information is. This could be financed, at least in part by MAFI, but perhaps
more importantly, the government has a role to play helping to ensure that the advice is held somewhere
that is publically accessible in what could be regarded as a “virtual” library. MAFI could promote linkages
between Association members and research scientists to perform and finance field trials to determine
improved agronomic practices and make sure that the results are disseminated through open days etc. In
the longer-term, the finance for establishing a database of improved technological advice could come
from levies on crop production; in other words, it would be financed by the private sector.

116. It is also important to better understand, through a rural labor market perspective, the coping
strategies of the rural population and their incentives to accept work opportunities. Many of the larger
horticultural producers in Moldova claim that getting reliable labor to harvest their crops is becoming
more difficult. It is recognized that this may in part be due to the seasonality of the work but it is also
important to look at this trend in the context of the evolving income composition of the rural population.
Therefore, it is important to understand the incentives, or lack of incentives, of the rural population for
taking advantage of employment opportunities being created by larger farmers. It is likely that they would
prefer the opportunity for more permanent employment, and possibly higher rates of pay. It is also
recognized that perhaps these can only be offered if the profitability of the larger-farms can be improved.
But for sure, if there is an impending shortage of labor for the horticultural farms, then this would be a
serious impediment to its expansion – which is why the efforts of MAFI must be to improve profitability
and drive innovation.

ANNEX 1: Observations on the cherries value chain

         Background

Moldova's horticulture is facing increasing difficulties in its trade with Russia, as a result of Russia's
occasional trade bans. To counter the related uncertainties, efforts have been made to access new
markets and diversify horticultural production. In particular, markets in the EU have been researched and
a number of donor programs have suggested that fresh cherries could be well suited to the Moldovan
climate. In particular, the USAID-funded ACED project has undertaken a considerable amount of effort to
produce a technical manual giving agronomic advice and supporting farmers who are interested in
growing and marketing cherries. The help of the management and staff of the ACED project in the
preparation of this annex are gratefully acknowledged.

In much of Europe, sweet cherries are considered as a good and profitable crop, because once the trees
start bearing fruits yield are usually good, and the demand is generally high, resulting in prices that deliver
decent margins.30 However, the establishment costs are significant, since it takes about six years to reach
full production and there is need for an initial investment in capital equipment for irrigation, frost control,
the prevention of rain damage on the fruit, pack houses and cold stores. Therefore, this is probably an
ideal crop for farmers to develop on the back of retained earnings from crops, and also the opportunity
for sharing some of the post-harvest infrastructure.31

Because of the potential for attractive returns, there are many other countries that have started to invest
in cherry production. Some importers in the EU15 have considered sourcing fresh cherries from countries
around the Black sea (e.g. Turkey) to supplement their main sources from Spain and Italy. This strategy
has been pursued in part because it represents a way of diversifying production risk, taking into account
a long lead-time to place orders and deliver the fruit from the Black Sea area. However, from the seller’s
perspective, it is always better to be the main supplier and not a reserve supplier. Therefore, if Moldova
is to develop a significant and sustainable export cherry industry, it must target markets where it can
become the primary supplier.

The world cherry industry has changed dramatically since the 1990s with the introduction of new varieties
and dwarf rootstocks as well as more modern management techniques, such as high-density plantings
and training of trees to grow and produce fruit for hand-picking whereby the picker stands on the ground.
In particular, cherry growers in Turkey, the United States and Chile planted large areas of intensive fruit,
adopted more effective post-harvest technologies and implemented standards and became dominant in
world trade. In order to develop a cherry industry able to compete with Turkey and other dominant
producers, Moldova's horticulture industry will have to adopt these techniques. It is within this context

30 This value chain analysis looks at sweet cherries as opposed to sour cherries. Sour cherries are widely grown in Eastern Europe
(e.g. most of the cherries produced in Poland are sour cherries), while in Moldova there is a predominance of sweet cherries.
31 For example the harvest time of cherries are different from those of the remaining major fruit crops grown in Moldova: cherries

are expected to ripen in late May and June, whereas apples and grapes are harvested in late summer and autumn.

                                                                                                                               49
that the USAID and other donors recognized the importance of supporting growers with appropriate
technology to enable them to compete.

Data provided by the ACED project shows that since the mid-1980s, the world area of cherries has
increased by 34% from around 288,000ha/year on average during 1985-1987 to around 386,000ha/year
in 2011 (Table A1.1). Interestingly, all this increase has taken place in Asia, North America and other non-
European countries, while productivity in Europe has declined. The decline in Eastern Europe was
probably associated with the loss of markets following the demise of the Soviet Union. The increase in
output in Western Asia is mainly due to the expansion in Turkey, a country that is regarded as having ideal
growing conditions for cherries. Other Asian countries that have put considerable efforts into promoting
the growing of fresh cherries and other stone fruit include Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and China, whereby the
first two primarily target the Russian market.

        Moldova’s trade in fresh cherries

Moldova already has a small fresh cherry export industry that generates between 2,000MT/year to
3,000MT/year of exports, worth about US$2 million/year. Virtually all the exports are destined for Russia
and Belarus and the average selling price is US$670/MT (Table A1.2).

Moldova imports some fresh cherries, mainly from Turkey (Table A1.3). Interestingly, imports from
Turkey have increased rapidly after 2010, from 155MT to about 3,500MT in 2013. The average yearly
value of imported cherries is about three times higher than the value of exported cherries.

         Market competitors

In terms of weight of cherries produced, Turkey and the USA are the two biggest producers with
438,500MT/year and 303,400MT/year in 2011, respectively. Within the East European region, Uzbekistan
(82,000MT/year), Romania (81,800MT/year), Russia (76,000MT/year) and Ukraine (72,800MT/year) are
significant producers. In comparison, production in Moldova of 2,000MT/year to 3,000MT/year is
relatively small and does not qualify among the top twenty producers.

The ACED report highlights a number of potential competitors:

   (i)   Bulgaria, which in 2011 produced 30,000MT and has a significant area of young orchards.
         Bulgaria has a reputation on the European market of producing fruit of excellent quality.
   (ii) Greece, which has made use of EU subsidies to modernize its industry.
   (iii) Poland, traditionally a producer of sour cherries for the Russian market, but since accession to
         the EU also recognizing the opportunity in sweet cherries production. However, not much
         progress has been made in investing in sweet cherry orchards.

                                                                                                                    51
     (iv) Romania, despite orchards being removed after the collapse of the Communist regime and much
            of the production infrastructure destroyed, Romania remains one of the top ten sweet cherry
            producers in the world.
     (v) Russia is a major cherry producer, but many of its orchards have yet to be modernized.
     (vi) Serbia has the potential to be a major competitor with Moldova for the Russian and European
            markets, but it would need more investment in plantings and post-harvest infrastructure.
     (vii) Turkey will undoubtedly remain a strong competitor, especially as it has made considerable
            strides to improve yields, quality and presentation of the fruit. It has a favorable climate and
            opportunities for expansion, as fruit growers diversify when margins are attractive. Like
            Moldova, Turkey is conveniently located close to a number of major markets including the EU,
            the Middle East and Russia. The ability to compete on these markets will be determined by
            quality and price. The Turkish competitive position is constrained by its tradition of using a
            narrow range of old varieties and the variability of quality associated with the production by a
            large number of small-farmers.
     (viii) Uzbekistan is a major sweet cherry producer that targets the Russian market and its government
            is trying to promote further investment in stone fruit, but there is a shortage of technical
            expertise and management.

Most importantly, the ACED project believes that Moldova has significant potential to develop a fresh
sweet cherry industry targeting the European markets. However, competition from the countries listed
above will be stiff and Moldova's producers will need to deliver top-quality and well-presented fruit to
establish themselves as reliable suppliers. In order to achieve this, significant investment in appropriate
varieties will be required, as well as into in-field and post-harvest infrastructure. Exceptional management
and technical skills will also be key.

          Potential profitability of the fresh cherry sector in Moldova

The AECD project has developed some gross margin models for fresh cherry production in Moldova; these
have been used as the basis for estimating profitability (Table A1.4). The projections show that the direct
costs would amount to about MDL186,000/ha (US$2,400/ha) for the first two years to establish an
orchard. However, this estimate does not include some major capital costs, such as irrigation, protection
against rain at harvest time, pack house and cold store.32 The trees will start to produce some fruit after
approximately four years of growth, and will be at their full potential from the seventh year onwards.
Estimates project that the orchards would produce about 8MT/ha at full yield, of which 70% of fruit will
be suitable for the fresh market and 30% for processing.

In terms of field costs, the cash outlay over the first three years is about MDL51,500/ha (US$3,200/ha).
The projections indicate that positive margins could be generated during the sixth year, but of course, it
would take another couple of years to recover the initial capital investment. In fact, it is precisely the

32 Cherries are very susceptible torain damage at harvest time. Rain causes the skin to split and spoils the appearance of the fruit,
severely limiting export potential. Damaged fruit can still be used in processing, but is sold at a much lower price.

                                                                                                                                  52
capital and overhead costs that make an investment in fresh cherry production expensive. At full
production however, the gross margins appear to significantly high: almost MDL118,000/ha
(US$10,600/ha). It is worth emphasizing the challenge for farmers: it takes seven years to achieve
substantial margins and in addition to the investments outlined above, cherry production requires also
significant investment in irrigation, rain protection and post-harvest infra-structure. When all this is taken
into account, the key question remains whether the rate of return on the initial investment will still prove
attractive.

The two key factors that will have most impact on future profitability are the selling price and yields. The
selling price projected by ACED is MDL25,000/MT (US$1,430/MT) for sales on the fresh fruit market and
MDL10,000/MT (US$570/MT) for the processing market. These prices are higher than the export prices
reported in Table A.2, but are lower than the import prices paid by EU-importers: during the Moldovan
season, typical prices would be EUR3.0-4.5/kg. The higher price would be for larger fruit (28-30mm) and
the lower price for smaller fruit (20-22mm). A sensible target import price for analysis would be about
EUR3.5/kg, but a lot will depend on quality and timing of harvest.

However, the absolute key with marketing of fresh produce is its seasonality and how it competes on the
market. In the case Moldova, it is probably essential that it avoids being in direct competition with Turkey,
if it wants to achieve the best possible prices for its exports. A grower in Moldova with a recently planted
intensive orchard expects to produce fruit between 25 May and 15 June, which is hopefully before the
Turkish harvest. The same grower expects that he will be able to sell his cherries on Europe markets for
EUR2,000/MT (MDL39,000/MT) and expects yields of at least 20MT/ha using irrigation and rain protection
to try to ensure these yields and quality. In reality, this is likely on the optimistic side. The estimated
investment in on-farm infrastructure is within the range of EUR45,000-60,000/ha (MDL87,700-
117,000/ha). These projections, if realized, markedly change the gross margins projections in Table A1.4:
they indicate that to establish a 25ha modern cherry orchard would cost about EUR1.5 million and the
returns would amount to EUR0.5 million/year from the seventh year onwards.33 This would indicate that
the payback time for a 25ha investment in fresh cherries would be about 10 years.

         The comparative advantages for cherry production in Moldova

     (i) Seasonality – as with any perishable horticultural product, its seasonality compared with the
         competition is one of the key comparative issues. Likely Moldova's fruit could be harvested
         outside the harvesting season of main competitors, but it still needs to be proven that Moldovan
         cherries can be marketed when prices are high.

     (ii) Good climate and soils for quality – in general, Moldova's soils and climate are considered as
          excellent for horticulture. However, in the case of cherries, this does not exclude necessary
          investments in irrigation to prevent frost damage at flowering, as well to sustain eventual
          droughts. In order to ensure fruit quality, the crop also needs to be covered to prevent rain
          damage. Perhaps the biggest comparative advantage of the climate will be if it results in fruit
          maturing at a time when the international markets are short of supply.

     (iii) Proximity to market – assuming that the target markets will be countries relatively close to
           Moldova (e.g. Romania, Bulgaria, Hungry and Slovakia), this might give the producers a transport
           cost advantage over other competitors (e.g. Turkey).



33Assuming 20MT/ha and 70% of fruit being of sufficient quality for the fresh market, and a selling price of EUR2/kg with a
deduction of 20% to cover marketing costs.

                                                                                                                        54
(iv) Cheap labor – labor wages of around MDL150-200/day (US$8.6-11.5/day) should make manual
     tasks associated with cherry production competitive with other EU competitors. However, a
     number of exporters noted that recruiting seasonal labor for harvesting was becoming rather
     difficult.

(v) High demand – the market claims that there is a good and increasing demand for top quality sweet
    cherries, especially in the higher priced EU15 countries.

(vi) Two market options – most Moldovan horticultural exports have traditionally targeted the
     Russian and CIS markets. However, recent Russia's bans have led many stakeholders to investigate
     alternatives, in particular the EU. With cherries farmers could target either the EU or the Russian
     market, which would give them considerable flexibility. A high-quality and well-presented product
     could be sold in both markets, in Russia most likely in superior Russian outlets rather than the
     outdoor wholesale markets.

    Challenges for the cherry sector in Moldova

(i) Lack of technical knowledge – this is a challenge both in terms of yields, as well as agronomic
    recommendations. The ACED project has made an impressive effort to develop a production
    manual, but further research into the best and most profitable agronomic practices would be
    beneficial.

(ii) Lack of understanding of the economics of cherry production – there is little practical evidence
     from existing and mature orchards, yet a number of farmers have invested in intensive fruit
     production and these investments could form the foundation of a comprehensive understanding
     of real production costs and profitability.

(iii) Lack of understanding of the market opportunities – the Moldovan farmers need to have a clear
      idea of the market that they are targeting. If they try to target markets in Eastern Europe, they
      will be competing with the established producers in Spain (whose market season starts mid-May,
      shortly before Moldova and finishes in July). The great advantage that Spain has in this market is
      the short journey time to the main markets in Northern Europe. If the target of Moldova's fruit
      producers are the new EU member states, they will have to compete with Bulgarian fruit, which
      has a good reputation for quality, in addition to Romania, Ukraine and Turkey. Moldova's industry
      will therefore have to be innovative and establish unique selling propositions.

(iv) Long time between planting and the trees fruiting – as with any tree crop, there is a long time
     between planting and fruiting. It will not be until about year five or six that the investment will
     start to show a positive cash flow. To partly overcome this and promote cheery orchards, the
     Government of Moldova is already offering a subsidy on newly planted orchards, as well as some
     of the farm infrastructure. Cherries might be a particularly useful crop for diversification among
     fruit producers who are making a cash surplus on other crops.

                                                                                                     55
    Lessons learnt and Recommendations

(i) Need for a review of the economics of cherry production – even though the ACED project has
    done a detailed cost analysis of cherry production, it is important that this is continually updated
    to provide the best possible information for future investors.

(ii) Need for continued specialist expertise – given the importance of achieving top quality fruit, high
     yields and good presentation, it is recommended that continued support is given to bring in
     international expertise to assist growers. It is important that this is information is retained and
     made available to all fruit farmers, as well as shared with the private sector and/or associations
     of fruit (or cherry) growers and exporters.

(iii) Better understanding of market opportunities – Moldova is somewhat fortunate in the sense that
      it has a number of markets that it could supply. However, there are many other countries trying
      to compete in these same markets. Detailed market research will therefore be important to
      ensure that growers know exactly what is expected and needed and how they can best position
      themselves to develop a competitive advantage.

(iv) Improving management skills – for Moldova's cherry production, and indeed all horticultural
     crops, to compete effectively in the future and be viable, it is important that there is a greater
     pool of trained horticultural managers it can tap into. These managers will need to understand
     both the technical and business aspects of managing a modern horticultural unit, as well as
     command man-management skills.

ANNEX 2: Observations on the walnut value chain

        Background

The total world production of walnuts is estimated at about 3.3 million MT/year of unshelled nuts.
According to FAO, over half of production is generated by China (1.7 million MT/year), followed by Iran
(450,000MT/year), the US (430,000MT/year) and Turkey (190,000MT/year). Ukraine is the sixth largest
producer with 97,000MT/year and Romania tenth largest with 30,546MT/year. According to FAO,
Moldova's walnut industry produced around 9,000MT in 2012, but most data sources in Moldova suggest
that its production is higher ─ around 12,000-14,000MT/year.

Walnut production and trade has an interesting history in Moldova dating back to the 17 th and 18th
centuries when it reportedly exported significant quantities to neighboring countries. During the Soviet
era new walnut trees were planted alongside roads as a windbreak. It is these trees that nowadays
constitute the basis for most of the production and trade and interestingly, it is estimated that about half
of all trees are formally not owned by anyone. The surrounding rural population collects the fallen nuts
from the ground, crack the shells and removes the kernels for sale. Most of the exporters have established
rural buying centers where they buy walnut kernels and transport them to a central grading and packaging
factory, where most of them are prepared for export. According to estimates, this system currently
accounts for as much as 90% of Moldova's walnut production.

By the mid 1990s, it was estimated that there were over 2 million walnut trees in Moldova, but no
orchards or plantations. The long period of time between planting and fruiting makes an investment in
orchards unattractive for most farmers. There are various estimates of the area of walnuts in Moldova,
some of which claim that there are about 14,000ha. However, it is difficult to provide a reliable estimate
since so many trees are planted as windbreaks and not in fields. Only since 1996, when a walnut
association was founded, some plantations have been established: something the Government supported
by subsidizing new plantings.

At present, Moldova is recognized as a major international source of walnuts. It is the second largest
source of walnuts imported by the EU: only the US exports more walnuts (almost 21,000MT in 2013) than
Moldova (more than 9,000MT in 2013) (Table A2.1). Ukraine and Chile are third and fourth largest,
respectively, and these four countries jointly account for about 90% of the total EU exports of walnuts.
Within the EU, there is significant production especially in France and Italy.

Due to its climate and soils, Moldova is considered as an excellent location for walnut production and the
quality of walnuts ─ at least in terms of taste ─ is also considered good. However, considerable care is
needed when choosing the right locations for planting new trees. First, because walnut trees can be
susceptible to extreme cold, low-lying sites should be avoided. Second, due to the same consideration of
vulnerability to cold, those varieties should be grown that are cold tolerant; hence, care must be taken to
avoid some of the imported varieties. In addition to domestic production, Moldova has also become a
processing center for walnuts grown in other countries, mainly due to low labor costs.34

            Moldova’s trade in walnuts

In 2013, over 10,000MT of walnut kernels were exported from Moldova. The main destination markets
were Germany and France and the total value of exports reached almost US$86 million (Table A2.2). Some
of these exports would have originated from the imports of unshelled walnuts for processing. Exports in
2013 were lower than in 2012, when 13,500t was exported. What is particularly encouraging is the
increase in the unit prices of walnut exports; from USD 4,500/t in 2009 to over USD8,000/t in 2013; this is
probably due to the investment in processing facilities and establishment of international standards. In
addition, Moldova exports about 1,000t/year of unshelled walnuts; historically the main destinations are
Iraq and Romania (Table A2.3). This means the value of walnut exports are about 45% of the country’s
fruit and vegetable exports.




34   For example, it imports about 2,000MT/year of unshelled nuts, mainly from France for processing and subsequent re-export.

Moldova's exporters have access to the EU market under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP),
while also enjoying further concessions as the only CIS country adhering to the International Labor
Organization (ILO) conventions. Under these rules, walnuts (and other agricultural products) can enter
the EU market duty-free.

As mentioned earlier, around 2,000MT of unshelled walnuts are imported yearly, mainly from France, to
utilize the cost effective processing facilities in Moldova (Table A2.4).

Moldova also imports a relatively small amount of shelled walnuts, mainly from Ukraine (Table A2.5).
Most likely, these might are imported for re-export to the EU to take advantage of Moldova’s duty free
access to the EU market.

There are a number of companies in Moldova that have invested in walnut processing, including the
following:

       (i)     Monicol – processor and exporter;
       (ii)    Reforema Natural Fruit and Nuts – an export company established with German investment;
       (iii)   Prometeu-T – processor and exporter;
       (iv)    AMG Kernal Group Soroca – grower and exporter;
       (v)     Irida Trade Company – grower and exporter.

During the research for this report, some of the EU-based buyers of Moldovan walnuts were interviewed.
For most, Moldova was a good source of walnuts overall and the quality of nuts was considered to be
generally good. Despite this, the buyers expressed preference for sourcing from Chile, the US and France,
with Moldova comparable to the "second best" sources.35 However, the most challenging factor affecting
trade with Moldova is the process of cracking nuts at home, instead of in an organized, controlled facility.
The importers would prefer if the nuts were purchased by local buyers in their shells and then cracked in
factories where conditions could supervised and traceability could be established.




35   The color of Moldova's walnuts is a bit darker than the color of walnuts from preferred sources.

        Profitability of the walnut sector in Moldova

Despite considerable interest in and promotion of the walnut sector, the understanding of its economics
is still relatively poor ─ both in terms of cost structure, as well as yields. The poor understanding of yields
is not too surprising given that there are very few solid stands of walnut trees: the organized plantations
have not yet reached maturity. However, based on discussions with walnut growers, traders and the
Walnut association estimates of gross margins have been made (Table A2.6).

The estimated cost of establishing a walnut orchard is about MDL34,500/ha (US$1,970/ha), assuming that
the land is rented. Walnut trees start producing some fruit in the seventh or eighth year, but yields usually
become significant around the ninth year. Assuming therefore that there are no significant returns on
investment until the ninth year, the direct costs of establishing a plantation before meaningful nut
production starts can be estimated as MDL120,000/ha (US$6,850/ha). However, the initial investment is
quickly recovered once the trees come to maturity. The yield can reach 2MT/ha and the selling price
around MDL130,400/MT (US$7,460/MT). While the margins may appear very attractive at first sight, they
will require significant investment in processing infrastructure, cold storage and farm equipment.

The Government of Moldova offers subsidies for establishing walnut plantations of MDL15,000/ha. This
is sufficient to cover the costs of planting material of good quality. Cheaper trees are available, but might
be of varieties not resistant to cold. Given that the subsidy only covers 12.5% of the establishment costs,
introducing a higher level of subsidy should perhaps be considered. This could be done through a second
payment after five or six years to cover some of the costs associated with the maintenance of the orchard,
on the condition that the orchards are well maintained. In addition, subsidies for investment in specialized
equipment (e.g. harvesters) and processing facilities should be considered also for walnut producers, as
is the case for other horticultural crops such as apples.

        The comparative advantages for walnut production in Moldova

    (i) Tradition – Moldova has long a tradition of growing and exporting walnuts to many countries in
        the world, where their quality is recognized and appreciated. It is important that this reputation
        is preserved and efforts must be made to improve it through higher standards and possibly
        supervised cracking.

    (ii) A well-established market chain – probably because walnuts generate good profit margins, an
         effective marketing chain has been developed between the rural areas and the packers/exporters
         based in Chisinau.

    (iii) Good climate – Moldova's climate is favorable for the production of high-quality walnuts and this
          appears to be recognized on the market. However, it remains to be seen whether the climate
          allows for competitive yields of trees planted in orchards.

    (iv) Cost of labor – perhaps Moldova's major advantage in walnut production and processing are the
         low labor costs, especially when compared with some of the main suppliers to the EU and North
         American markets. This is also confirmed by the fact that France sends approximately
         2,000MT/year of shelled walnuts to Moldova for processing.

    (v) High demand from the main international markets – the demand for nuts in the EU and North
        America is growing rapidly and this opens considerable opportunities for new plantings. This is


                                                                                                          62
    further strengthened by the increasing internal demand within China, leading to a reduction in
    the amount of nuts left for export.

    Issues impacting the walnut sector in Moldova

(i) Lack of technical knowledge – both in terms of yields and agronomic recommendations. Even
    though walnuts have been grown in Moldova for a long time, there is a rather poor understanding
    of the field yields, the best varieties to recommend and how grow them for optimal returns.

(ii) Lack of understanding of the economics of walnut production – given the lack of technical
     knowledge, it is not surprising that the understanding of economics of walnut production is also
     limited.

(iii) Time gap between planting and fruiting – as with any tree crop, there is a certain time gap
      between planting and fruiting, measured in years. In the case of walnuts, it is not before year nine
      or ten that the investment will start generating a positive cash position. The subsidy offered by
      the Government at this stage covers just 12.5% of the overall initial investment.

(iv) Lack of subsidies for other capital equipment – most of the other horticultural crops receive
     subsidies for investment in capital equipment, including pack houses and cold stores. The same
     logic should be applied to walnuts, so as to increase the attractiveness of this high-value-
     generating crop that requires long-term horticultural investments.

(v) Over-reliance on small-farmer production and small-scale cracking – if Moldovan exports are to
    be marketed in the highest value retail outlets, it will be important to improve traceability and
    hygiene standards. This can best be achieved by concentrating production in larger orchards and
    cracking nuts in factories. Similarly, rural agents should be encouraged to buy nuts in shells, while
    providing incentives to packers/exporters to invest in equipment and labor to remove the kernels
    in supervised locations.

    Lessons learnt and Recommendations

(i) Comprehensive review of the economics of walnut production – a review of the economics of
    walnut production and exports would be beneficial to better understand the potential of
    expansion, especially into orchard-based production. Given the long gestation period between
    planting and commercial production of walnuts, additional revenue-generating activities could be
    built alongside, e.g. intercropping.

(ii) Review of the existing subsidies – walnut production at present does not enjoy all the public
     support that other crops, for example apples, do. This is why a review of the current financial
     support schemes would help aligning incentives for walnut production with other horticultural
     orchard crops.

                                                                                                       63
(iii) Profitable crops attract good businesses and management – one of the characteristics of the
      walnut value chain is that there are a number of efficient and well-managed exporters who
      compete to buy nuts from the farmers. Walnut production offers solid margins and should thus
      also attract good management, offering better-than-average incomes.

(iv) The establishment of a center of technical excellence – the lack of technical knowledge, especially
     in terms of best varieties and expected yields, might act as a major constraint to further
     investment. However, because of the very long-term nature of walnut production, any new
     agronomic trials would bring results only over a long period of time. Instead, international
     specialists in walnut production should be invited to work with and advise the current plantation
     owners. Their recommendations should then be placed in the public domain. In addition, it
     appears opportune if growers would cooperate on addressing the lack of knowledge jointly and
     establish some trial plots in their fields, open for other growers to view. Plantation owners will
     be better off if they cooperate to improve the entire industry, rather than compete with each
     other.

(v) Intercropping – intercropping could provide an extra source of revenue, since walnut trees require
    several years to mature, and even once mature allow for other crops to grow alongside. External
    technical assistance could establish what combinations would work best in Moldova.

(vi) Encourage large-scale walnut plantations to integrate with processor/exporters – this is needed
     in order to expand the industry and generate the best returns.

ANNEX 3: Observations on the greenhouse vegetable production value chain
(tomatoes)

            Background

Moldova produces annually about 350,000MT of vegetables, out of which approximately 54,000MT are
tomatoes, 51,000MT onions, 29,000MT cabbage and 23,000MT cucumbers.36 The field vegetable
production is cultivated on approximately 6,000ha, with the area allocated to tomatoes decreasing from
8,044ha in 2006 to 5,471ha in 2013. The production of field tomatoes has also been dropping during the
same period, from approximately 104,000MT in 2006 to just slightly more than 54,000MT in 2013.
Unsurprisingly, the yield pattern mirrors the decline in area and production, as it dropped from around
13MT/ha in 2006 to around 10MT/ha in 2013.

Domestic demand for fresh vegetables in Moldova has been growing over the recent years, mostly due to
increasing purchasing power. Yet, a large share of the increase was met by imports, rather than local
production which recorded a slow growth rate. The amount of vegetables consumed is influenced by two
key trends marking the current consumption patterns in Moldova. First, consumers tend to favor domestic
products, especially when it comes to seasonal products. The taste of vegetables often determines
consumers' choices and for many items Moldova's consumers prefer to choose domestic products at the
expense of imports, sometimes reducing or even avoid consumption of certain products off-season (e.g.
tomatoes in winter, especially in rural areas). Second, there is a tendency to move towards healthier diets
which include a higher consumption of vegetables and fruit, resulting in an increased consumption of
vegetables per capita.

Greenhouse vegetable production is not a large sector in Moldova, yet it is register high growth with many
new commercial greenhouse operations set-up in recent years. Greenhouse production is manly
concentrated on the Nistru and Prut rivers, as it is strongly dependent on access to water. Overall, the
greenhouses own around 350ha, which represents a very small share of the country's agricultural land.
The majority of the operations (around 80%) are home-built plastic greenhouses and tunnels. Some larger
operations established more recently consist of glass houses (around 20%) which contain modern
technology.

The growing cycle of greenhouse-grown tomatoes and cucumbers takes place in the fall and spring of
each year, with the aim of extending the season. Tomatoes are grown on approximately 300ha, taking the
larger share of greenhouse area, followed by cucumbers and smaller productions of lettuce, greens, sweet
pepper, eggplant and cabbage. The total production volume of greenhouse-grown vegetables is quite
small in comparison to the country potential and has been volatile over the last few years: it was around
9,800MT in 2010, 10,300MT in 2011, 5,600MT in 2012 and 7,000MT in 2013.

                                                                                                        65
On average, an individual greenhouse-grown tomato plant in Moldova produces four kilograms, but at
this yield level most likely not all costs are covered, especially taking into account that the costs to
establish a modern greenhouse operation are very high. The growers should achieve yields of eight or
more kilograms per plant, which would make the business profitable and sustainable. The average yield
in the EU and the US is around twelve kilograms or more per plant.

The majority of commercial greenhouse tomato and cucumber farming in the EU, the US and the Middle
East is in bags, hard containers, or sand culture with fertilization systems. In Moldova, most production is
in ground beds or troughs with drip irrigation and some fertilization. If fertilization is already in place,
growers can convert to bag culture and the increase in production should be immediate. The yields in
Moldova can also be raised with refinement of the production systems and training of growers.

        Market opportunities

The level of consumption of fruits and vegetables is slowly increasing ─ with high discrepancy between
rural and urban areas ─ yet remains below the recommended values. Youth and low-income people in
particular consume insufficient amounts of fruits and vegetables, especially off-seasons. Unfortunately,
despite the fact that the offer of fruits and vegetables in Moldova is well diversified, the diversification of
supply on its own does not guarantee an increase in consumption. In fact, higher purchasing power is a
more important factor in raising individual levels of intake of fruits and vegetables.

The value-added of fruit and vegetable produce in Moldova is small, mainly because:

    (i) the lack of marketing knowledge involving preparation of products for commercialization (sorting,
          classification) and presentation (packaging, labeling) to ensure product safety and attractiveness
          to the consumer;
    (ii) the lack of equipment for washing, sorting, packaging, labeling, storage and transport of products
          to the market;
    (iii) the lack of production planning system and its correlation to market requirements.

Vegetable growers are facing significant pressures from large hypermarkets and stiff competition from
growing imports. On the one hand, hypermarkets push prices down, since they wield considerable market
power, resulting in growers' difficult negotiating position. On the other hand, imports of agro-food
products are well established in Moldova and growing in size.

Around 80% of Moldova's production of fruit and vegetables is marketed in organized open markets in
urban centers, along the main roads or at the farm gate. All these offer relatively low prices when
compared to established large-scale buyers, among them also large supermarkets. These are slowly
changing consumer preferences to sorted, packaged and labeled products that comply with higher quality
and safety standards. The result is that the share of farm gate sales is dropping, yet due to the stringent
standards and quantity requirements only few farmers are able to sell their products to supermarkets. In
fact, according to estimates less than 10% of vegetables sold are sold in this way.

                                                                                                            66
Vegetable imports have quadrupled over the last ten years, but mostly to compete with domestic
production rather than diversify supply. In fact, tomatoes, potatoes and onions have registered the largest
values of imports, while the export of vegetables, including tomatoes, has halved during the last three
years alone. Greenhouse production of fresh produce faces the strongest competition from growers in
Turkey, especially for tomatoes.

Greenhouse producers are not be able to compete with open-field growers during the normal season, but
unsurprisingly, the price of tomatoes rises significantly during the off-season.37 This is why greenhouse
production needs to target most of the delivery to the market during the second and fourth quarters when
prices are higher. Indication from the last few years show that if done correctly, greenhouse vegetable
production can be sustained as a profitable business. The most lucrative target markets are those serving
consumers with higher incomes, mostly in urban areas of Chisnau, Balti, Cahul and other rayon centers.

         Profitability of the greenhouse vegetable sector in Moldova

The production of fresh vegetables is a very important source of revenue for farmers, yet their access to
the largest (and most profitable) markets is poor. In addition, due to their relative small size and limited
market power, the farmers earn lower profit margins than other actors along the value chain (e.g.
wholesale sellers and retail sellers).

The establishment of greenhouse vegetable production implies large upfront costs which amount to more
than 50% of total cost of production. The most significant costs of establishment are related to the setting
up of the necessary infrastructure (i.e. the actual greenhouses, the film cover, irrigation), as well as labor
costs, purchase of seedlings and fertilizer, heating costs. In subsequent years, maintenance works and
replacement of deteriorating materials represents significant costs. At present the Government of
Moldova provides subsidies for the establishment of a greenhouse operation, yet the individual allocation
is too small to cover all initial establishment costs.

The Table A3.1 provides cost estimates based on the following assumptions: (i) all prices are based on
2014 market prices; (ii) the greenhouse is not heated; (iii) the greenhouse film covers can be used for four
years and mulch for three years; (iv) cost components include two production cycles; and (v) total volume
produced during both cycles is 21MT of fresh tomatoes.




37Even during the season, the current average price is around EUR2/kg, which is 15% higher than the price of tomatoes from
Turkey.

Due to the relatively small size of their operations, many growers are not able to cover upfront expenses
from retained profits. They are therefore left with two options: (i) borrow the necessary funds or (ii) all
establishment inputs on credit at a higher price. But the larger problem remains the following: due to
their overall business model, relatively low productivity, market competition, lack of cooperation among
producers, as well as weak value chain integration, the producers still face profitability problems that



                                                                                                                       68
prevent them from establishing potentially more profitable greenhouse operations without major
challenges.

         Issues impacting the greenhouse vegetable sector in Moldova

   (i)   Underdeveloped infrastructure ─ this is the greatest challenge for increasing the quantity and
         quality of greenhouse products; improvements are needed in the area of cold transport,
         warehousing, packaging, laboratory testing, and access to quality inputs.

   (ii) High energy cost ─ the cost of electricity is high compared to neighboring countries and the
        heating period is around eight months per year, limiting the ability of greenhouses to begin
        production early in the winter months. This is coupled with a energy inefficient design of the
        greenhouses.

   (iii) Lack of post-harvest infrastructure ─ greenhouses in Moldova lack post-harvest cooling. World
         practice shows that all efficient greenhouses are equipped with cooling stations, which allow for
         tomatoes to be stored for up to ten days following harvest. This helps regulating the volumes
         that reach the market, delivering produce at specific intervals in specific quantities that match
         the market demand.

   (iv) Packaging ─ lack of quality packaging capacity is a major bottleneck. If tomatoes are not handled
        and packed properly this results in poor appearance, limiting their value on markets.

   (v) Lack of market information ─ the supply chain is sub-optimally organized and vertical integration
       at the sectoral level is limited due to poor communication downstream. Labeling in general is
       substandard for all producers and traceability is often missing.

   (vi) Primitive production and management practices ─ because of variations in production methods
        and the use of inputs (seed, fertilizer, pesticides), production quality and quantity vary
        significantly from producer to producer and from year to year. This variability is increased due
        to low levels of specialized staff and greenhouse management know-how, as well as inadequate
        record-keeping, analysis and planning.

   (vii) Lack of own financial capacity ─ as can be observed from the farm structure in Moldova, many
         of the farms are extensions of households. Because of the inherent financial linkages between
         the two (labor, incomes), the farmer often has to make choices in one area (farming or
         household) that might affect the needs of the other (farming or household). With lack of financial
         capacity prevalent due to little, if any, retained profits and savings, this dilemma often translates
         in reduced use of fertilizer, labor, pesticides and thus lower yields.

   (viii) Limited access to finance – from the agricultural sector’s perspective, bank loans are prohibitively
          costly and loan conditions harsh: maturity and grace periods are considered as too short,

                                                                                                           69
      collateral requirements as too high, and loan size offered too small. From the banks' perspective,
      the agricultural market is perceived as risky, costly and difficult to serve. In particular, banks
      believe that it is often difficult to obtain suitable and accurate information from agricultural
      entities that could underpin loan applications, as farmers often have limited financial and
      accounting skills. The resulting lack of agricultural finance often leaves farmers few options
      beyond self-financing.

      Lessons learnt and Recommendations

(i)   Specific business characteristics of greenhouse production: (a) greenhouse produce is easier to
      sell because of its visibly higher quality in comparison with open-field produce; and (b) lower
      vulnerability to market price fluctuations when there is a long-term purchasing arrangement in
      place.

(ii) Optimization of production costs and supply planning: it is very important that producers
     strengthen their planning in order to better adjust their supply to market demand in terms of
     quality, quantity, delivery terms, principles of traceability and similar.

(iii) Increasing the competitiveness of the products: given the current low level of marketing
      knowledge and skills, investment in competitiveness through training, innovation and cost
      optimization is key. At the same time, investment is needed in more productive greenhouse
      production technologies and techniques, as well as marketing network infrastructure.

(iv) Diversification of crops portfolio: many farmers developed a portfolio of other crops to grow in
     the greenhouse to increase the total on-farm income. These include lettuce, sweet potato, sweet
     pepper, eggplant, and a range of herbs and spices. Some producers start to grow red and yellow
     cherry tomato varieties. The diversification of crops can increase the whole farm output and
     allow for a continuous cash flow through an on-going presence in the marketplace.

(v) Additional training: for the sector to develop, farmers and farm managers would require
    additional skills in the following aspects of the greenhouse production: (a) market intelligence;
    (b) business assessment skills; (c) negotiation skills; (d) greenhouse crop agronomy; (e) financial
    and human capital development; and (f) technology information (e.g. fertilizer technology,
    pesticide technology, crop varieties, cooling/ventilation).

(vi) Better marketing: the sale of greenhouse vegetables requires a more structured approach to
     marketing. Locally produced vegetables either match or are even superior to the imported
     products in term of taste and appearance – this should allow greenhouse producers to negotiate
     premium prices for their products and occupy prime shelf-space. However, greenhouse
     producers should identify attributes that consumers’ demand, so that they can better match
     their needs and wants.


                                                                                                     70
(vii) Development of post-harvest infrastructure: an important stage in ensuring high quality of the
      product is harvesting the crop, sorting and cooling. At present, greenhouses in Moldova are not
      equipped with cooling facilities, forcing farmers to sell immediately after harvest. Better (cool)
      storage infrastructure would allow them to time the sale of produce more efficiently.

(viii) Development of growers’ organizations: these organizations (cooperatives, associations, etc.)
       exist in most EU countries, and are widely spread also in Africa and the Middle East. Their
       purpose is to improve the effectiveness and cost efficiency of marketing, input purchases,
       insurance, as well as to exchange knowledge, assist with regulatory support, and certification.
