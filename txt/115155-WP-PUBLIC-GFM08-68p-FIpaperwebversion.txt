About KNOWLEDGE & RESEARCH
The World Bank Group’s current partnership with Malaysia is focused on
knowledge-sharing. It is centered on support for Malaysia’s vision to join the
ranks of high-income economies by 2020 through inclusive and sustainable
growth, and to share its lessons with developing countries.

In March 2016, the World Bank Group officially launched its Global Knowledge
and Research Hub in Malaysia. The new Hub is the first of its kind, serving both
as a field presence in Malaysia and as a global knowledge and research hub.
It focuses on sharing Malaysia’s people-centered development expertise and
creating new innovative policy research on local, regional and global issues.

Knowledge & Research reports are flagship work emanating from the teams
based in the Malaysia Hub.

The Malaysia Development Experience Series captures key lessons from
Malaysia relevant for emerging economies in Asia, Africa and elsewhere that
are transitioning out of poverty and into shared prosperity.

Financial Inclusion in Malaysia: Distilling Lessons for Other Countries                                  7
Executive Summary
Among middle-income countries, Malaysia has achieved one of the highest levels of financial inclusion
in the world. At the end of 2015, 92 percent of Malaysia’s adult population had an active deposit account at
a financial institution, enabling accountholders to save, withdraw money, access automated teller machines
(ATMs), and carry out payments through electronic means nationwide. Most households in Malaysia have
access to a wide range of conventional and Islamic finance products and services. It is estimated that more
than 70 percent of Malaysian adults in the labor force are accountholders of unit trusts (mutual funds), which
enable them to invest their savings in the local stock market.

Recent data reveal that the remaining segments of the population with limited or no access to
financial services – low-income households, people living in rural areas, and workers with few years
of formal school education – are rapidly gaining access to financial services through innovative financial
products provided by financial institutions, such as mobile phone applications and agent banking, which
leverage technology and enable financial institutions to reach out to customers in remote areas in a secure
and cost effective manner.

Malaysia’s journey in financial inclusion has been unique in various aspects. Unlike many other
emerging market economies that have experienced systemic banking crises after liberalizing, deregulating
and privatizing their financial systems, Malaysia did not experience a systemic banking crisis. Malaysia has
been able to achieve sustainable growth of its financial system over a long period of time, reconciling two
policy objectives; namely, “financial stability” and “financial inclusion”, in a successful manner so far.

How has Malaysia achieved its success in financial inclusion? What specific actions, programs, and
strategies have contributed to enhance financial inclusion? What has (or has not) worked well and why?
What could low- and middle-income countries learn from Malaysia’s experience? To what extent could those
experiences be replicated in other jurisdictions?

There is no single factor or silver bullet that can explain Malaysia’s success in financial inclusion. The
progress that Malaysia has achieved is the result of efforts undertaken by authorities and the financial sector
industry over the past 20 years. Following a process of banking sector consolidation in the aftermath of the
Asian financial crisis, authorities formulated a ten-year Financial Sector Masterplan (FSMP) in 2000, which
provided not only a comprehensive diagnostic of problems preventing financial inclusion and overall financial
sector development, but also prescribed a set of specific policy actions to address them. Building on the
success of the FSMP, in 2011 a second ten-year strategy, the Financial Sector Blueprint (FSB) was adopted
for the period 2011-2020, and is being executed under a robust monitoring and evaluation framework that
tracks progress on financial inclusion, quality and usage of financial services, and customer satisfaction.

As part of the execution of the FSMP and FSB, a wide range of initiatives have been carried out to
accelerate financial inclusion. For example, the mandate of Malaysia’s central bank was amended to grant
it the legal authority to proactively advance financial inclusion. In this regard, Malaysia’s central bank was a
pioneer among central banks around the world in recognizing and formalizing the important role that they
can play to advance financial inclusion.

                                                                                             Executive Summary




Other major reforms included reforming development finance institutions (DFIs), the establishment
of a credit bureau, issuing a new regulation requiring banks to provide financial services to the poor at
affordable fees, and launching the agent banking model to enable financial institutions to reach out
new customers in remote locations in a safe and cost-effective manner. Moreover, Malaysia has made
significant investments in the modernization of the national payment system infrastructure, accelerating the
adoption of electronic means of payments nationwide.

The journey that Malaysia has followed has delivered positive results in terms of increasing the
percentage of the population with access to basic financial services. However, the journey has not been
exempted from obstacles and still several challenges will need to be tackled in the future.

Looking forward, Malaysia faces various challenges in terms of financial inclusion. Firstly, Malaysia
will need to reach out to the remaining unserved population. Covering the last mile in financial inclusion
might not be as easy as it seems. A large part of the unserved population is composed of foreign workers
and their families, some of whom are undocumented workers. Secondly, a major challenge is how to ensure
that the people with access to financial services actually make active use of their accounts. The report shows
that many people still use cash to settle day-to-day payments despite the availability of a modern payment
system infrastructure in Malaysia. Moreover, a large number of employers pay their workers’ salaries in cash
as opposed to direct deposits into the workers’ bank accounts. Finally, another challenge is to ensure that
efforts to promote financial inclusion remain sustainable. In particular, the high level of household debt,
which in 2016 amounted to 82 percent of GDP, is an important alert signal that should be monitored carefully.

There are several lessons from Malaysia’s experience in financial inclusion that could be useful
for other countries, especially for low- and middle-income countries that are still in early stages
of financial sector development and wish to make progress on financial inclusion. They include the
following:

    1.	 Adopting a long term strategy for financial inclusion
    2.	 Setting up a robust monitoring system to track progress
    3.	 Finding a champion institution for financial inclusion
    4.	 Carrying out large investments in the modernization of the payment system infrastructure
    5.	 Building and strengthening institutions to support financial inclusion
    6.	 Encouraging financial innovation
    7.	 Adopting regulations that promote financial inclusion without compromising financial stability
    8.	 Advancing consumer protection and financial literacy
    9.	 Maintaining a sound financial system, and
    10.	 Involving the private sector in any effort to advance financial inclusion




Financial Inclusion in Malaysia: Distilling Lessons for Other Countries                                     9
               Introduction
               Every year, financial sector authorities from many countries around the world
               visit Malaysia to learn more about Malaysia’s experience on a wide range
               of topics related to financial inclusion, such as: financial inclusion strategies,
               innovations in payment systems, national identification cards, data and statistical tools
               to monitor and evaluate financial inclusion policies, agent banking, digital finance,
               FinTech and regulatory sandboxing, unit trusts (mutual funds), Islamic finance, the role
               of development finance institutions, financial education and literacy programs etc.

               Despite the enormous interest of policy makers from various parts of the world
               in Malaysia’s financial inclusion experience, so far little has been written to
               document this experience in a comprehensive manner. This report constitutes one
               of the first attempts to analyze and distill Malaysia’s experience of financial inclusion
               over the past 20 years. The report focuses exclusively on the provision of basic financial
               services to households. The provision of financial services to micro, small and medium
               enterprises (MSMEs) and large firms will remain outside the focus of this report.

               The report is divided into five sections. The first one examines current levels of
               financial inclusion in Malaysia from an international perspective. The report uses the
               data provided by BNM as well as the data collected by the World Bank through the
               Global Findex Survey in 2014. The second section identifies the specific reforms and
               actions undertaken by Malaysia to expand financial inclusion since the Asian financial
               crisis of 1997-98. It groups the wide range of policy actions, initiatives, and strategies
               undertaken in the past 20 years during three different periods: a) Consolidation of
               the Banking system, b) Financial Sector Development Masterplan 2001-2010, and c)
               Financial Sector Blueprint 2011-2020.

               The third section reviews Malaysia’s experience with “agent banking”, which is
               a hallmark initiative that leverages technology to provide financial services to
               under-served population, particularly in rural areas. The fourth section discusses
               challenges faced by authorities in further advancing financial inclusion. It looks not
               only at the remaining unbanked population, but also at recent patterns in terms of
               the actual “usage” of financial services by adults who already have accounts. Finally,
               the last section presents the report’s conclusions and distills valuable lessons from
               Malaysia’s experience for other countries which are considering advancing their levels
               of financial inclusion.

Where Does
Malaysia Stand in
Terms of Financial
Inclusion?
Among middle-income countries, Malaysia has achieved
one of the highest levels of financial inclusion. According
to data from BNM, 92 percent of the adult population
(total adult population in Malaysia is 22 million) had
a bank account in 2015, with 59 percent of the adult
population having an account at a single institution and
the remaining 33 percent having accounts at multiple
banking institutions.1




1    Data are based on the Financial Capability and Inclusion Demand Side Survey 2015. Malaysia’s total adult population is defined as those aged 15
     and above.



12                                                                             Financial Inclusion in Malaysia: Distilling Lessons for Other Countries
                                                                    Chapter 1: Where Does Malaysia Stand in Terms of Financial Inclusion?




Malaysia’s banking system has grown an average rate of 6.8 percent p.a. in terms of assets since
2011. This trend is expected to continue in the upcoming years. Given the positive outlook for the banking
system in the upcoming years, Malaysia is likely to reach universal access in the provision of financial services
to its adult population by 2020.

Currently, Malaysia has 1.4 bank branches per 10,000 adults, 4.7 ATMs per 10,000 adults, and 10.7
point-of-sale (POS) terminals per 1,000 inhabitants, which are among the highest ratios in South
East Asia. Data from BNM show that financial institutions provide services in 97 percent of all sub-districts
in Malaysia either through bank branches or agent banks.

The Global Findex Database of the World Bank, which collects data on financial inclusion in countries
around the world every three years, revealed that 81 percent of Malaysia’s adults had an account at
a licensed financial institution in 2014. Differences in financial inclusion data between Findex and BNM
are mainly due to methodological issues and coverage. An important difference between the two databases
is that BNM’s data cover only Malaysian citizens, whereas Findex makes no distinction between Malaysian
and non-Malaysian adults. BNM’s data cover savings accounts at a wide range of financial institutions,
whereas Findex 2014 did not include savings at some specialized institutions, such as the Pilgrim Fund
and Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), which are popular for long-term savings among the Malaysian
population. In addition, Findex data were collected in 2014, whereas BNM’s data were collected a year later
(2015).

Findex data shows that around the world, the percentage of adults with an account at a financial
institution increased from 51 percent to 61 percent between 2011 and 2014. Malaysia recorded one of
the highest increased levels of financial inclusion among middle-income countries, moving from 66 percent
to 81 percent between 2011 and 2014, as shown in the following table.

Eco-system of financial institutions

Underpinning the high rate of financial inclusion achieved by Malaysia is a large eco-system of
banking institutions providing a wide range of conventional and Islamic financial services to the
population. The banking system serving households is currently composed of 27 commercial banks, 16
Islamic banks, and six development finance institutions (DFIs) with a combined network of 3,264 branches
and 11,308 ATMs.

Commercial banks are the largest intermediaries in Malaysia’s banking system. They account for 70
percent of total assets in the banking system and operate 62 percent of all bank branches nationwide. They
are the largest type of provider of financial services to households in Malaysia, including deposits, credit,
payments, money transfers, insurance products, and so on.

Opening a savings account at a conventional or Islamic bank is a simple procedure in Malaysia.
Malaysian citizens only need to present their national identity card, which incorporates various biometric
features, and sign the required documentation. Accounts can be opened with as little as RM20 (US$4.40),
or even less in some banks, and there are no annual fees for maintaining an account. As discussed in the
next chapter, customers in rural areas can also initiate the opening of an account at a bank agent, and
subsequently complete their account opening at a bank branch, where bank officers complete required anti-
money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) checks.

                  National Identity Card as
                 Pillar for Financial Inclusion
            The Malaysian identity card is the compulsory identity card for Malaysian citizens
            aged 12 and above. The current identity card, known as MyKad, was introduced by the
            National Registration Department of Malaysia in September 2001. Malaysia became the
            first country in the world to develop and use an identification card that incorporates both
            photo identification and fingerprint biometric data on a built-in computer chip embedded
            in a piece of plastic.

            MyKad is the first smartcard in the world designed with six main functions:
            identification, driver’s license, passport information, health information, and an
            e-cash function. Today, thanks to MyKad, opening bank accounts is a simple procedure,
            as new customers are quickly validated upon the presentation of their MyKad. Moreover,
            they can also activate MyKad to have additional payment functions linked to their bank
            account and use it as an ATM card or an electronic means of payment nationwide.

            MyKad security features include authentication using symmetric-key cryptography,
            multi-layered operating systems with firewalls, and a secure chip platform. MyKad
            incorporates two types of biometric technology for identification purposes; namely, a
            colour photograph of the card holder and the Digital Certificate.

In addition to large private commercial banks, three development financial institutions (DFIs) play
an important role in financial inclusion in Malaysia: Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN), Agrobank and
Bank Rakyat. Although these institutions are small in terms of assets (they account for less than 5 percent
of the banking system’s assets), together they have one third of the total number of deposit accounts in
Malaysia’s banking system. Moreover, these DFIs operate 23 percent of all branches in Malaysia. BSN has the
largest branch network (403), followed by Agrobank (188), and Bank Rakyat (148).

BSN’s mandate includes the promotion and mobilization of savings, especially to small savers. It has
USD$6.6 billion in assets and nine million customers. BSN offers traditional banking products, including
Islamic banking products and micro finance. BSN focuses on provision of microfinance and agent banking,
and promotes savings and opening of accounts among school children.2

Agrobank, formerly known as Bank Pertanian Malaysia (BPM), was established in 1969 as a DFI with
a mandate to meet the financial needs of the agriculture sector. Being a full-fledged Islamic Bank since
2015, the Bank has developed Shariah compliant financing packages for the entrepreneurs throughout the
agriculture value chain (i.e. from production, processing, marketing and support services). In support of the
financial inclusion agenda, Agrobank has broadened its rural branches and agents network and expanded
utilization of its electronic banking platform. It currently operates in 70 percent of rural communities in
Malaysia.

Bank Rakyat is the biggest Islamic bank in Malaysia. It has a large branch network, and its services and
products include savings accounts for children, teenagers and adults, as well as investment accounts for
adults and senior citizens. On the consumer financing front, Bank Rakyat offers personal financing, housing
financing, education financing, car financing, credit cards etc. Bank Rakyat’s main lending product is personal
financing. The bank offers financing to government employees, a product with low risk and high return. In
the global ratings Bank Rakyat appeared not only as the tenth largest Islamic bank, but also as the second-
most profitable Islamic banking institution in the world in 2011.

Malaysia also has a few unique government-owned institutions dedicated to mobilize savings from
low-income households, including Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) and the Pilgrim Fund. PNB
mobilizes savings from Malaysian nationals (especially the Bumiputra ethnic group) and invests resources in
corporate entities to generate returns that are higher than the deposit interest rates offered by banks. As of
2016, PNB had more than 10 million customer accounts and had consistently provided attractive returns to
its customers (unit holders). Moreover, PNB has become the largest asset management company in Malaysia
in terms of total assets.

The Pilgrim Fund Board (Lembaga Tabung Haji) was established in 1963 to provide a savings scheme
for the Muslim population. The government provides a blanket guarantee on all its deposits, making it
an attractive investment vehicle not just for small but also for large individual Muslim investors in Malaysia.
Currently, it serves more than seven million individual clients through its 119 branches, making it the second
largest deposit-taking DFI after BSN, in terms of number of clients.

Levels of financial inclusion across different
segments of the population
The data collected by the World Bank Findex Survey reveal that levels of financial inclusion are
relatively homogeneous across different segments of the population in Malaysia. In particular, when
the population is divided by age groups, income levels, place of residence (rural vs. urban areas), and gender,
the rates of financial inclusion, measured as the number of adults with an account at a financial institution,
remain relatively homogeneous. However, some significant disparities in terms of financial inclusion are
observed when the population is grouped according to their education level.




Income
According to the Findex database, between 2011 and 2014 Malaysia made significant progress in
granting access to an account to the poorest 40 percent of the adult population. During this period,
the percentage of adults in the low-income bracket with an account at a financial institution increased from
50 percent to 76 percent. As a result, the gap on account ownership between the richest and the poorest
significantly declined.

In 2011, the gap between the richest 60 percent and poorest 40 percent was 27 p.p., within the average
of the East Asia and Pacific region, and at similar levels to other middle-income countries such as
Brazil and Mexico. In 2014, the gap in Malaysia decreased to nine p.p., one of the biggest improvements in
the provision of financial services to the poor recorded by Findex in this timeframe.

Age
In 2014, 82 percent of older adults (25 years and older) in Malaysia reported having an account at a
financial institution while the figure for the group of young adults (younger than 25) was 76 percent.
While in 2011 the gap between older adults and younger adults was 13 p.p., in 2014 it declined to six p.p.

In the East Asia and Pacific region, the age gap has broadened in past years; while in 2011 the gap was
six p.p. (56 percent of older adults and 50 percent of young adults), in 2014, the gap increased to 10 p.p. In
contrast to Malaysia’s case, the age gap in the East Asia and Pacific region has increased due to the lower
take-up of younger adults compared to that of older adults. Income disparities among these groups might
be one of the explanations for the lower growth rates of the younger group in the East Asia Pacific region.

Education
In Malaysia, adults with more years of formal education are more likely to have an account than
adults with fewer years of school. The education gap between these two groups declined from 34 p.p. in
2011 to 25 p.p. in 2014, but still remains significant. In 2014, the financial inclusion rate stood at 59 percent for
adults with less than six years of education and at 84 percent for adults with more than six years of education.
In the East Asia and Pacific region, levels of financial inclusion related to education levels are improving at
faster rates than the ones shown in Malaysia. While in 2011 the education gap in East Asia and Pacific was
15 p.p., in 2014 it decreased to 13 p.p. Thus, the education gap in the country is twice the reported figure
in the region.

Urban vs Rural
Globally, adults in rural areas have traditionally faced difficulties in having an account at a financial
institution, due to the high cost faced by banks in opening branches in small villages and remote
areas. In 2014, 74 percent of adults in rural areas in Malaysia had an account (versus 82 percent in urban
areas), an improvement of 22 p.p. with respect to 2011. In the East Asia and Pacific region, 64 percent of
adults living in rural areas did so.

Gender
Around the world, the gender gap in financial inclusion is seven p.p., with 64 percent of male adults
having an account vs. 57 percent of female adults, according to Findex. In Malaysia, the gap between
men (83 percent) and women (78 percent) stood at five p.p. in 2014, an improvement of one p.p. from the
figure reported in 2011. Malaysia’s female account ownership is also comparable to the East Asia and Pacific
average (which is 67 percent).

So, who does not have access to financial services in Malaysia? The answer will depend on which
database is used. BNM’s data indicate that around 1.7 million people (8 percent of Malaysia’s adult
population) do not have a bank account yet. They are mostly composed of low-income households living in
rural areas. But this figure only includes Malaysian citizens.

If we use Findex, we can conclude that there are approximately 3.9 million adults (regardless of
nationality) in Malaysia that still do not have a bank account. This means that one out of five adults
does not have the initial entry point to formal financial services. According to Findex data, the population
more likely to be unbanked comprises adults living in rural areas with low education levels. Moreover, they
are likely to be foreign workers. Malaysia hosts a large number of foreign workers many of whom come from
neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Nepal, among other countries.3




3   According to the Human Resources Ministry, there are around 2.1 million registered foreign workers in Malaysia. However, the estimated number
    of undocumented workers varies a lot depending on the source of information.

How has Malaysia
Achieved a High
Financial Inclusion
Rate?
There are various actions and initiatives that have
contributed to Malaysia’s success in financial inclusion.
In this section, we examine the journey that Malaysia
has followed during the past 20 years to broaden access
to financial services to its population.
We start with the actions put in place in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, which marked
a milestone in the international financial system, and prompted authorities in Malaysia and other countries
in Asia to put in place measures to protect their financial systems from volatility in financial markets, large
capital outflows, and economic recession in the region.

In addition to the need to strengthen the solvency of banking institutions, Malaysia also identified
the need to strengthen the skills of the workforce in the financial services industry and develop a
new generation of local bankers with strong skills to better serve the evolving marketplace in Malaysia and
ASEAN. As a result of this, BNM in collaboration with financial sector industry associations has actively
supported the establishment of various institutions to build capacity and develop the skills and talents of the
working force, currently composed of 128,000 people in the banking industry alone.

Financial Sector Masterplan (2001-2010)
The FSMP for the period 2001-2010 was the first long-term plan launched by Malaysia for the
development of the sector. The FSMP included more than 100 recommendations to address vulnerabilities
and build a strong and resilient financial system that is responsive to changing economic requirements.
In the particular case of the banking sector, the Masterplan included 39 recommendations that had the
objective of improving efficiency, resilience, and dynamism in the banking system. The primary focus was
to build the capabilities of domestic banking institutions to enhance their competitiveness and promote the
development of a more robust banking system.

The FSMP had three phases. During the first one, the focus was on building the domestic capacity of
the financial sector and enhancing their efficiency through mergers among institutions. The second phase
was aimed to gradually deregulate the domestic financial market, with the main objective being to foster
competition among participants. The last phase included measures to accelerate the pace for integration of
the financial system with international markets.




Key actions under FSMP to scale up financial inclusion
In the timeframe 2001 to 2010, several major reforms in the financial sector were formulated and
put in place by Malaysian authorities. They included the following:

Strengthening DFIs. Malaysia has six DFIs, which are expected to provide financial services in sectors not
sufficiently covered by banking institutions. Before 2002, DFIs were not adequately supervised and faced
recurrent financial problems. In 2002, a major reform was initiated with the enactment of the Development
Financial Institutions Act 2002 (DFIA), which empowered BNM as the regulatory and supervisory authority of
these institutions. The main objective of DFIA is to ensure that the DFIs perform their mandates in a safe and
sound manner. Since the enactment of DFIA in 2002, a total of six DFIs5 fall under the purview of BNM with
mandates to serve identified strategic sectors of the economy including agriculture, SMEs, infrastructure,
maritime and the export-import sector.

DFIs also contribute significantly to financial inclusion initiatives, with Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN),
Agrobank and Bank Rakyat as the main drivers of financial inclusion. After more than a decade, the Act was
further strengthened to allow DFIs to better serve its respective mandates and at the same time reflects
the challenges arising from the new financial landscape. The amended DFIA came into effect on 31 January
2016, comprising enhancements in areas of governance, business activities of DFIs and regulatory oversight
as well as inclusion of new areas on Shariah, business conduct and consumer protection, and the regulatory
enforcement framework.

Making the access and cost of basic banking services affordable to the population. Through the
Guideline for Basic Banking Services issued by BNM in 2005 all banks were required to provide basic banking
services and ensure that all segments of the population had access to deposit and transaction services at low



5    The six DFIs are: Bank Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia Berhad (Bank Rakyat), Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Berhad (Bank Pembangunan), Bank Pertanian
     Malaysia Berhad (Agrobank), Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN), Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Berhad (EXIM Bank) and Small Medium Enterprise
     Development Bank Malaysia Berhad (SME Bank). With the exception of Bank Rakyat, which is a cooperative bank, DFIs are owned by the government

costs, and receive reasonable savings rates. Specifically, the Guideline prescribed the following measured
to be observed by banks:

      a)	 All Malaysian citizens and permanent residents shall be entitled to have one Basic Savings Account
          (BSA) and one Basic Current Account (BCA) per institution.
      b)	 The initial deposit to open a BSA shall not exceed RM20 (US$4.40).
      c)	 A BSA should earn interest irrespective of account balance. The minimum level of interest rate to be
          offered shall not be lower than 0.25 percent per annum.
      d)	 No service or maintenance charge shall be imposed on the account.

BNM’s mandate on financial inclusion. Traditionally, central banks have not had an explicit mandate to
promote financial inclusion. In 2009, the Central Bank of Malaysia Act was amended to grant the central bank
with the legal authority to proactively promote financial inclusion. This was a key milestone that empowered
BNM to promote financial inclusion. Moreover, from an international perspective, Malaysia had been one of
the pioneers in granting the central bank the explicit mandate to advance financial inclusion.

Deposit Insurance. In 2005, Malaysia established the Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation (PIDM).
PIDM was mandated to insure both deposits and benefit payments under insurance and takaful6 in the case
of banks’ and insurance companies’ failing. PIDM covers deposits up to US$62,500 per depositor (per bank)
and up to US$125,000 per policyholder in insurance and takaful benefits. The safety net is provided with no
charge to users and is activated automatically.

Collection of Credit Information. One of the challenges that Malaysia faced in the aftermath of the
Asian financial crisis was that there was no reliable credit history of individual borrowers. Given that lack of
credit information could be a major barrier to accessing formal financial services, BNM led the initiative to
establish a credit bureau. In 2001, the Central Credit Reference Information System (CCRIS) was established
to collect credit information from all regulated financial institutions. As at end-2016, the CCRIS captured
credit information on nine million active borrowers.

Disputes’ Resolution Mechanism. The Financial Mediation Bureau was established in 2005 to ensure that
all financial services consumers had access to an independent, and impartial dispute resolution scheme.7
Not only did the population have an agency to deal with complaints on the services or products of the
financial institutions, but a Credit Counseling and Debt Management Agency (AKPK)8 was also established
in 2006 to provide counseling on financial and debt management and assist indebted individuals to work on
loan repayment schemes.

BNM also established the Consumer and Market Conduct Department in 2006, which is in charge of
formulating and implementing policies that promote fair and responsible treatment of consumers by financial
institutions. This Department also monitors financial institutions’ compliance with standards on complaints
handling, debt collection, financing, imposition of fees and charges, and provision of credit cards. BNMLINK9
was established as a centralized point of contact for the public to address any type of inquiry related to the
provision of services or products of the financial sector.

Consumer education. An important component of the strategy to promote financial inclusion was the
strengthening of the consumer education and protection framework. Financial institutions in Malaysia are
required to comply with a set of disclosure requirements that aim to ensure that information disseminated to
financial services users is not only timely, but easy to understand and accurate. Consumers are empowered
with both the knowledge and the skills to make good financial decisions through financial education. The
programs were developed by BNM, AKPK, and the financial sector. These programs10 provide awareness to
consumers of the risks involved in using various financial products, as well as the benefits. One distinctive
component of the protection framework is that the financial institutions are responsible to assess the
suitability of a product for a potential user.

   customer service bus equipped with supporting facilities and technologies.

The transformation of the Malaysian financial sector through the implementation of the
recommendations of the first FSMP delivered important results. During this period, the banking system
grew at an annual rate of 7.3 percent. Moreover, the banking system emerged with fewer but stronger and
larger domestic institutions, some of which have become leading players in retail banking in South East Asia
(Maybank and CIMB).

In terms of financial inclusion, the number of bank branches per 100,000 adults increased from
11.3 to 14.6 between 2000 and 2010, according to BNM. The total number of deposit accounts per
1,000 adults increased from 1,975 to 2,954 in the same period. During this timeframe, Malaysia registered a
substantial increase in the number of loans per 1,000 adults, which increased from 310 to 858.

Notwithstanding this progress, at the end of 2010, financial inclusion indicators were still not fully
satisfactory for authorities in Malaysia. Specifically, physical outreach of banks was considered low. In
2010, Malaysia had 15 branches per 100,000 adults versus 32 in high-income countries. In terms of ATMs,
Malaysia had 52 ATMs per 100,000 adults vs. 94 in high-income countries. Moreover, 54 percent of sub-
districts (mukims) with a population of more than 2,000 adults (where 17 percent of the total population
live) did not have any financial inclusion access point. For low-income households, data revealed that they
were lagging behind the rest of the population in terms of financial services. For example, for low-income
households the take-up rate of insurance products was only 10 percent vs. 41 percent for general households.

Financial Sector Blueprint (2011-2020)
The FSB, launched in 2011, changed its focus from a sector-based approach adopted during the
previous decade to one that reflected a more integrated financial sector with increased interlinkages
with different economic sectors with many jurisdictions. In the FSB, the role of the financial sector
includes not only meeting the financing needs of the country, but also playing an important role in meeting the
growing financial needs of an emerging Asia. An important part of this strategy was the internationalization
of Islamic finance, as well as development of the country’s international Islamic financial center.

In the development of the FSB, BNM designed a comprehensive Financial Inclusion Framework in 2010,
setting specific and measurable outcomes, strategies and actions to advance financial inclusion. To
formulate this framework, a cross-departmental working group was established within BNM. The group
generated over 100 ideas to advance financial inclusion, which translated into 10 high-impact strategies,
as illustrated in the next figure. For the formulation of this Framework, engagements and consultations
with a wide range of stakeholders were carried out, including poverty experts, bankers, NGOs, as well as
institutions such as SKM, ICU, JKM & KPWKM.

Moreover, BNM formulated a Financial Inclusion Index to monitor its own progress on a systematic
and regular basis. As shown in the following figure, the Financial Inclusion Index (FII) adopted in Malaysia
has four dimensions (Convenient accessibility, Take-up rate, Responsible usage, and Satisfaction levels) and
eight monitoring indicators. The FII is constructed from both supply-side and demand-side data collected
by BNM on a regular basis. The index ranges from a score of 0 to 1, where higher numbers denote progress
towards reaching the financial inclusion goals in the country.

The index assesses progress against a previously established target for each indicator. This means
that data for each indicator is divided by the target and once this result is obtained, it is multiplied by its
weight. Each dimension has the same weight. The indicators’ goals are set from 40 percent in the case of
adults with insurance/takaful to 95 percent for the population living in sub-districts with at least one access
point.

also, financial sector development, and enabling

Leveraging
Technology: The
Case of Agent
Banking in
Malaysia
As part of the 10 high-impact initiatives under the FSBP
2011-2020 to reach out to the remaining segments of the
population with no access to financial services, especially
the population living in rural areas in which there is no
bank branch, BNM launched the agent banking initiative
in 2012.
Through this initiative, licensed financial institutions are allowed to partner with an existing business to
offer financial services such as retail outlets (e.g. grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, gas stations,
etc.) and post offices that are located in sub-districts not served by any bank branch.

                                                                     Chapter 3: Leveraging Technology: The Case of Agent Banking in Malaysia




Each of the selected retail stores or agents receive a POS device/terminal that is connected online-
real time with the back-end system of the financial institution. This terminal allows agents to offer basic
financial services to their customers on behalf of the financial institution, such as opening savings accounts,
deposit or withdraw money, making bill and loan payments, making domestic fund transfers, etc.

The use of agent banking provides attractive benefits for participating financial institutions and
their agents. For financial institutions, it allows them to provide basic financial services to customers in
remote areas in a cost-effective manner, thus reducing customers’ travelling time to the nearest financial
service access point. Agent banking represents a significantly lower-cost alternative to traditional bank
branches and automatic teller machines (ATMs).

For appointed agent banks, this mechanism enables them to get additional income from the
commissions they earn for the financial transactions conducted on behalf of the financial institutions.
Moreover they attract more customers to their premises and thus generate higher sales or revenues for their
core business activity.

Performance of agent banking in Malaysia
Since its inception in 2012, the agent banking initiative has become an effective vehicle to advance
financial inclusion in Malaysia, in particular in locations that have no bank branches. In 2011, before
the AB initiative was operational, only 46 percent of the sub-districts15 in Malaysia had access to financial
services. In 2015, three years after it was implemented, 97 percent of the country’s sub-districts16 had access
to basic financial services thanks to agent banks. Agent banking provides a vehicle for people in Malaysia’s
rural areas to perform basic financial transactions in a convenient and safe manner and at no additional cost.

The network of bank agents providing financial services has grown rapidly in the past years. At the
end of 2016, the AB network had 7,984 agents from the 460 that were already established at the end of 2011.
In its first five years, the number of agents increased more than 17 fold.

During the first five years of AB in Malaysia, AB has facilitated 100 million transactions for a total
amount of US$ 2.1 billion. Since inception to end-December 2016, the most frequent transaction by volume
has been bill payments with 63 million records, representing 63 percent of total number of transactions, and
contributing with 61 percent of the value. The second most frequently used service is prepaid top-up with 26
million transactions or 26 percent of the total, and with a share of three percent of the total amount. Deposits
and withdrawals each represent six and five percent, respectively, of the total number of transactions, and 26
percent and eight percent of the total amount.

Thus, AB has become an important channel to provide payments, deposits and withdrawals services
to the population not previously served by branches of financial institutions in Malaysia. In 2015,
according to the Financial Capabilities and Inclusion Demand side Survey (FCIDSS), only 38 percent of adults
in the country answered that they were aware of AB and from those people that reported being aware of
the initiative, only a third were current users of such services. As more people become familiarized with this
product, AB has vast potential to not only enhance access in rural areas, but also deepen financial inclusion
through more active use of accounts.

                 Benefits of Agent-Banking:
                     BSN’s Experience
        Since the launch of the AB initiative in December 2012, BSN’s number of transactions
        has reached more than 90 million with a value of US$1.6 bn. The rapid growth of agent
        banking services in rural communities in Malaysia shows that there is a need for financial services
        in under-served areas that did not have a convenient access point. To illustrate this point, prior
        to the introduction of agent banking by BSN in 2012, the people in Felda Chini, Pahang, had
        to travel up to two hours (120 kilometers round trip) to access financial services in the town of
        Bandar Muadzam Shah. This travel implied a cost of time and transportation. Also, given the cash
        nature of the transactions, people faced a risk of potential loss of their money.

        BSN AB has changed the way people perceive banking; instead of walking into a typical
        banking hall to perform banking transactions, customers now have the option to bank
        while performing cashless purchases at their local grocery stores or at any BSN AB
        premise located all over Malaysia. Furthermore, customers have the peace of mind of
        performing cash withdrawals and deposits safely outside a bank’s automated banking lobby and
        after banking hours at BSN AB premises, which typically open between 8am and 10pm daily. For
        city folk, this also means that they save precious time queuing at the counter and searching for
        parking.

        In rural areas where there is generally poorer exposure to sophisticated IT, BSN AB has
        helped to increase the knowledge of appointed agents of the use of technology via the
        POS terminal. Therefore, agents who now appreciate the convenience and security of online
        banking are educating their fellow neighbors in the community on the benefits of savings and
        the security of cashless purchases using their BSN ATM/debit cards.

How Adults in
Malaysia Use
Financial Services


In light of the existing high rates of account ownership
among the adult population in Malaysia and the large
eco-system of financial institutions serving the needs of
households, what are the challenges that Malaysia still
faces in terms of financial inclusion?
Is the high ratio of account ownership being translated into active account usage in Malaysia? Do adults
with accounts at financial institutions actively use their accounts to save, purchase goods and services,
receive their salaries, pay utility bills and make other types of payments, and remit money to other
households within Malaysia? In this section we examine how Malaysians save, borrow, make payments,
transfer money, and make deposits using publicly available data from Findex, FIDSS and BNM.

                                                                                 Chapter 4: How Do Adults in Malaysia Use Financial Services




Overall, the data shows that high account ownership is not being proportionately translated into an
active usage of accounts in Malaysia yet. Cash is still being used extensively despite the availability of
a modern, large, and secure payment system network. Looking forward, current efforts to promote greater
use of financial services among the adult population should continue. In particular, efforts to channel a larger
volume of government transfers to households through e-payments should continue.

Also a growing volume of monthly salary payments from the private sector to workers should be
executed through electronic transfers. Moreover, greater use of debit cards and expansion of electronic-
payment-ready POS terminals will further encourage people to reduce the use of cash in favor of other
electronic and more secure means of payment.




How people save
In the Findex survey, adults in Malaysia were asked whether they had saved any money (regardless
of the institution or instrument) during the past year or not; 82 percent of adults reported having
saved money in the past 12 months, an increase of 31 p.p. with respect to 2011’s level. However, the share of
adults who reported saving formally (at a bank) was only 34 percent, while the rest was saving through other
instruments/institutions.

One reason why the number of people in Malaysia that save at bank institutions is low, despite the
fact that 92 percent of adults already have a bank account, is because many adults prefer to put
their “long-term” savings at other institutions which offer more attractive returns than conventional
bank deposits. These institutions, such as the Pilgrim Fund Board or PNB, are quite popular in Malaysia
because of their high returns and implicit government guarantee on their products. People also save and
make voluntary contributions to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) or purchase unit trusts (mutual funds).
In 2016 the EPF reported US$11.4 billion in gross investment income, which represented the highest level
recorded since the establishment of the Fund in 1951. Also, the purchase of residential property is quite
popular among the growing middle class as a means for long-term savings and creating wealth, given the
historical appreciation of the value of real estate.

How people borrow
In Malaysia, 56 percent of adults reported borrowing money in the last 12 months in 2014. The most
common source of borrowing was family or friends with 39 percent of adults doing so from this source. The
second most frequent mode of borrowing was from financial institutions with 20 percent of adults. Less than
one percent of adults in the country borrowed from a private informal lender.

The share of adults that reported formal borrowing increased from 11 percent of adults in 2011 to 20
percent in 2014. The expansion of credit in the country has translated into higher household indebtedness
levels. While in 2011 the level was close to the 2009’s below 80 percent of the GDP, in 2014 the household
debt represented 86.8 percent of GDP. Although the level of household indebtedness has grown rapidly,
it is considered manageable by financial sector authorities. BNM recently issued a Responsible Lending
Guideline which limits individuals’ ability to be over-leveraged.

Data reveal that access to formal credit by low-income families in Malaysia has increased. While in
2011 only three percent of the poorest 40 percent reported borrowing from a financial institution, in 2014 15
percent of them did so. In the case of the richest 60 percent, in 2011, 17 percent reported accessing formal
credit markets and in 2014, 22 percent did so. So the income gap decreased from 14 p.p. (2011) to seven
p.p. (2014).

To some extent, the adults’ borrowing patterns observed in Malaysia are not different from patterns
observed in other jurisdictions. For instance, for East Asia and the Pacific, borrowing from family members
or friends is 1.5 times more likely than borrowing from banks. In Latin America and Caribbean adults
borrowing money are 20 percent more likely to do so through these channels than doing so through financial
institutions. In Malaysia the percentage of adults that reported borrowing from family or friends almost
doubled from 20 percent in 2011 to 39 in 2014.

People that borrow from financial institutions in Malaysia do it for different purposes. Borrowing for
emergencies, cover education expenditures, and purchasing a car are the main reasons for borrowing in
Malaysia, as illustrated in the following figure.

In the past 20 years, the Malaysian banking sector has experienced a shift in its lending focus, with
the total credit portfolio shifting from businesses to households. The share of the latter has more than
doubled in the last two decades to reach 57 percent of total financing in 2016.

Given the rapid expansion of the economy for the last 15 years, and increasing income at the
household level, the banking sector has expanded. Since 2010 financing granted by banking institutions
has increased in both corporate and household segments. The average annual credit growth for the period
2010-2015 was 11 percent. Bank credit has been financed mainly through customer deposits, and the loans/
deposit ratio was 90 percent in 2015.

With rapid consumer credit growth, household debt has increased significantly in the past years.
While in 2000 household debt amounted to 48 percent of Malaysia’s GDP, in 2016 it reached 88.4 percent of
GDP. By component, most household debt is composed of mortgages (55 percent), followed by auto loans,
personal loans, and credit cards. Even though fewer people have mortgages as compared to personal loans,
mortgages constitute the largest component of household debt on an aggregate basis, given the nature of
these loans.

Use of debit and credit cards
In Malaysia, adults who open a bank account receive a debit card, which they can use to carry out
a wide range of transactions at ATMs, pay for products and services at more than 323,000 points
of sale nationwide, and do online transactions. Notwithstanding the large number of debit cards in
Malaysia, data from BNM and Findex reveal that only half of the people with debit cards use them actively
to make payments.

The high use of cash is not unique to Malaysia. In Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, 40
percent of account holders reported owning a debit card, but only 28 percent of them reported having
made use of it in the last year, according to Findex.

Under the Financial Sector Blueprint 2011-2020, Malaysia is undertaking various initiatives
to encourage people to reduce the use of cash and checks. Strategies focus on enhancing payment
infrastructures in order to achieve greater coverage, faster settlements and more efficient payment services.

Efforts to displace checks are mainly centered on promoting the use of credit transfer services, while
the key strategy to displace cash is by encouraging the use of debit cards as a convenient alternative
to cash. The proliferation of mobile phones and mobile payment solutions also has significant potential to
accelerate the migration to e-payments, especially among smaller traders that continue to transact mostly
in cash.

As illustrated in the table above, the total number of e-payment transactions per capita in 2016
was 97 compared to 49 in 2011, driven primarily by an increase in credit transfers and payment
card transactions. The use of checks is declining. In 2011, 205 million checks were cleared while in 2016
the figure dropped to 133 million. The target for 2020 is 100 million. In terms of payment card terminals (per
1,000 inhabitants), Malaysia has set an ambitious target of 25 for year 2020 from seven in 2011. Similarly, for
debit card transactions per capita, Malaysia has set a target of 30 transactions per year, versus only one in
2011. As at end-2016, Malaysia had 10.2 payment card terminals per 1,000 inhabitants and 3.4 debit card
transactions per capita in 2016.

According to Findex, in Malaysia 20 percent of adults reported owning a credit card in 2014, an
increase of eight p.p. with respect to 2011’s figure. However, those who own a credit card are more likely
to use it than those who have a debit card. The share of credit card holders that reported having made use
of it was 84 percent (in 2014). So in Malaysia credit card holders are twice as likely as debit cardholders to
make use of their card to make payments.

                                                                          Chapter 4: How Do Adults in Malaysia Use Financial Services




How people pay or are paid
Malaysia has a modern payment system infrastructure that allows banks to conduct a high volume
of transactions on a secure basis and low cost. However, data reveals that the existing infrastructure is
not being used at its full capacity yet.

According to Findex, in 2014 only 55 percent of adults that received wages reported that they had
received their wages into an account at a financial institution, and the remaining 45 percent were
paid by their employer in cash. This latter figure illustrates the potential for advancing e-payments in
Malaysia. A much higher percentage of workers could receive their monthly salaries and wages directly
deposited into their bank accounts. This would not only be safer, but also more cost effective. Among adults
receiving wage payments, adults in the bottom 40 percent (income level) were 17 p.p. more likely to receive
their payments in cash.

In Malaysia, according to the Findex survey, 0.5 million people in the public sector and 3.7 million
adults in the private sector receive wages in cash. However, a recent survey of 208 companies by BNM
had found that 80 percent of the companies surveyed have fully adopted e-payments for salary payments.
Nevertheless, certain sectors such as agriculture have a lower adoption rate, which may be due to factors
such as remoteness, which hampers access to banking facilities, and the presence of undocumented migrant
workers. Moving forward, the deployment of agent banks and payment card terminals and the increase in
the adoption of mobile banking, mobile payments and e-remittance services would reduce the demand
for cash in the rural areas. Moreover, a clear challenge is to convert the remaining volume of monthly salary
payments that still take place in cash into regular deposits at the bank accounts of employees.

Government payments and transfers
In Malaysia, 32 percent of adults in the Findex survey reported having received government transfers
in the last year, such as pension payments, social transfers, agriculture subsidies, etc. According to
Findex, only 60 percent of adults in Malaysia receiving government transfers reported receiving them into an
account, while the remaining 40 percent did so in cash. However, based on data from the Federal and State
Governments in Malaysia, in 2016, 99.8 percent of the payments made by the Federal Government and 93.2
percent of the payments made by the State Governments were made via e-payments and the remainder
were paid via checks. In addition, 92 percent of the distribution of government aid via the Bantuan Rakyat
1Malaysia (BR1M) scheme were made via e-payments in 2016.18



Payment of utilities
While in high-income OECD countries 80 percent of those making utility payments reported doing so
using a bank account, in East Asia and Pacific 91 percent of adults reported making these types of
payments in cash. In Malaysia, 55 percent of the adult population reported making utility payments. Four
out of five utility payers did so in cash, and the rest did so through a financial institution account.

According to Findex, the use of mobile phones to pay utility bills is still nascent in some regions, while
globally three percent of utility payers reported doing so, more than 50 percent of payers in Kenya used
these devices to make such payments. In Malaysia, six percent of adults who reported making utility bills
payments did so through a mobile phone in 2014, according to Findex.

Although it is still at low levels, the adoption of electronic channels (e-channels) for bill payments
is increasing rapidly in Malaysia. According to BNM data, in 2016, the total number of bill payment
transactions conducted via online banking, mobile banking and ATMs increased by 41.5 percent to 116
million transactions (2015: 20.0 percent, 82 million). Notably, bill payment transactions performed via mobile

banking grew more than twofold to 11.7 million transactions during the year (2015: 23.8 percent, 5.1 million),
indicating the increasing appeal of mobile banking as a convenient channel for bill payments.

The national open electronic bill payment platform, JomPAY, recorded 3.9 million transactions valued
at RM2.8 billion in 2016 (2015: 0.3 million, RM0.1 billion). The number of billers registered with JomPAY
more than doubled from 472 billers in 2015 to 1,105 billers in 2016, enabling the public to make online
payments to more billers from any banking account.



How people send or receive their domestic remittances
On average, 17 percent of adults in East Asia and Pacific reported having sent money to family or
friends living in the country, and 21 percent received this type of payment. Domestic remittances are
important in some regions of the world such as in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 29 percent of adults reported
having sent them. In 2014 in Malaysia, 28 percent of its population (15 years +) reported sending domestic
remittances and 25 percent reported receiving them in the last twelve months.

In Malaysia, the most common method to send domestic remittances is through a financial institution,
almost four out of five senders reported doing so, and 65 percent of adults who received them did so
through this channel. The second most frequent method to send money domestically is in cash; 47 percent
of adults who sent remittances reported doing so. The third most common way is through a money transfer
operator, 40 percent of remittances senders used this channel. The use of mobile phones to send money is
still in early stages in Malaysia with less than two percent of adults having reported using this method.

According to Findex in 2014, the use of mobile phones to send money is still in early stages in
Malaysia, with less than two percent of adults who reported having used this method. Based on
BNM’s data, in 2016, there were 8.9 million mobile banking subscribers for an adult population of about 23
million. BNM’s data also show that the volume of funds transfers made using the mobile banking channel had
almost doubled, from 17.1 million transactions valued at RM16.8 billion, to 33.7 million transactions valued at
RM27.5 billion in 2016, signifying increasing adoption of mobile banking in Malaysia. Thus, Malaysia still has
room to channel a larger volume of domestic remittances through cashless channels, given the widespread
use of traditional cash-based methods.

                       Outflow of International
                       Remittances in Malaysia
         Migrants represent 15 percent of Malaysia’s workforce, making Malaysia home to the fourth
         largest number of migrants in the East Asia and Pacific Region. The migrant population is diverse
         and includes workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Vietnam, China and India, among
         other countries. They have become an integral part of Malaysia’s economy, and on a yearly basis they
         remit substantial amounts of money to their dependents in their home countries through various channels.
         Remittance growth by migrants in Malaysia has been dramatic since 2006 (see graph below), with an
         increase in remittance outflows of more than 500 percent in the past 10 years.

         In 2016, BNM and the WB conducted a survey to explore the migrant workers’ level of financial
         inclusion, and their prevalent practices and needs in remitting money to their origin countries.
         401 migrants working in urbanized areas and remote plantations were surveyed to determine their specific
         remittance behavior. The main survey results entail the following:

         First, the survey showed that among migrant workers the level of bank account ownership is low
         (22 percent for plantation workers and 55 percent for urban workers). Many workers cannot comply
         with the basic requirements to open a bank account, due to a lack of proper documentation. However,
         the factors that had the biggest impact are the habit among employers to pay wages in cash and the
         remoteness of plantations, making traveling to banks not only a hazardous (cash is carried on one’s person)
         but also a time-consuming undertaking.

         Second, word of mouth is the main source of information on remittance services among migrants.
         Two thirds of the migrant workers use non-bank remittance service providers (E.g Western Union, Moneygram
         etc). Banks are the second most preferred remittance option, while money exchangers and post offices are
         used by less than five percent of the surveyed migrant workers.

         Third, 74 percent of the surveyed migrants own a smartphone and 90 percent of them access the
         internet via their smartphone. These numbers are high and present a tremendous business opportunity
         for technology-driven remittance services providers who invest in educating their consumer base and
         provide reliable and competitive remittance services.

Use of mobile phones and FinTech
Globally, less than 10 percent of adults (with a financial institution account) reported accessing their
accounts through a mobile phone (in the last 12 months) and performed a transaction. High-income
OECD economies had the largest share of adults who reported doing so at 21 percent, followed by East Asia
and the Pacific with 11 percent, and Sub-Saharan Africa with six percent.

In Malaysia, eight percent of adults reported making banking transactions through a mobile phone
in 2014, according to Findex. However, the latest figures from BNM show that at the end of 2016, the total
number of mobile banking subscribers reached the amount of 8.9 million people (or 40 percent of adults).
Moreover, BNM also showed that the number of internet banking subscribers reached 22.8 million people
(practically the equivalent of all the adult population with an existing bank account).

Mobile payments have significant potential to reduce the use of cash, with 43.9 million mobile
phone subscriptions covering a population of 31.7 million individuals in Malaysia. It also complements
initiatives to promote financial inclusion. The growth in financial transactions conducted via the mobile
banking channel increased almost threefold from 35.6 percent in 2015 to 92.6 percent in 2016, representing
60.3 million transactions valued at RM33 billion (2015: 31.6 million transactions, RM20.6 billion).

Recognizing the enormous potential of technology to transform the financial sector industry in the
upcoming years, Malaysia has taken proactive steps to facilitate innovation and the growth of the
FinTech industry. In September 2016, BNM issued the Regulatory Sandbox for new companies to test their
products in a safe regulatory environment. The “sandbox” provides a regulatory regime for new companies
in the financial sector so that they can develop and test their products under more flexible regulatory
requirements set by BNM for a period of up to six months. The sandbox is intended to protect consumers
and contain risks, as some products and FinTech companies will not be able to survive in the marketplace.

To catalyze the development of a thriving FinTech ecosystem in Malaysia, BNM is currently embarking
on several priority development areas, such as19:

    i)	   adopting an open application program interface (API) to enable data-sharing with third parties
          without compromising data privacy and security;
    ii)	 creating a common KYC utility to facilitate a more effective and efficient approach by financial
         institutions to manage compliance obligations. This also aims to reduce fraud and improve the
         delivery of personalized financial services;
    iii)	 developing guidelines for cloud computing to harness operational efficiencies while protecting data
          integrity in financial services;
    iv)	 examining applications of distributed ledger technology to evolve new infrastructure, arrangements,
         and processes that will transform the way financial services are delivered; and
    v)	 enhancing cybersecurity resilience within the financial services sector.

Lessons from Malaysia’s
Experience
There are several lessons from Malaysia’s experience in financial inclusion that could be useful for
other countries, especially for low- and middle income countries that are still in early stages of
financial sector development and wish to make progress on financial inclusion.

1.	 Long-term planning has been a key ingredient                             for different stakeholders and institutions – such

8.	 Consumer protection and financial literacy.                               these types of products and services.
    A key element for the success of financial
    inclusion in Malaysia has been the attention
    that authorities have put on consumer
    protection and financial literacy. In this area,
    Malaysia proactively takes steps to educate
    the population, helping them better manage
    their financial affairs, reduce the use of cash
    and adopt new technologies. At the same time,
    Malaysia provides an institutional framework
    to resolve consumer complaints rapidly. The
    institutions in charge of addressing financial
    services complaints are highly regarded by
    the Malaysian community and bankers. It is a
    good example that other institutions involved
    with the provision of services could consider
    in order to improve the quality of the products
    and services offered.

9.	 Maintain a sound financial system. Financial
    sector stability has been a prerequisite to the
    well-functioning credit and payments markets
    in Malaysia. The initial efforts to consolidate the
    domestic banking system laid the foundations
    to foster competition within a deregulated
    environment, which eventually translated into
    a gradual process of integration with regional
    markets. Moreover, BNM has taken adequate
    measures to ensure that DFIs involved in
    financial inclusion remain financially sound.
    In fact, the regulatory framework for DFIs
    involved in financial inclusion is similar to the
    one applicable to private banks. Furthermore,
    despite the rapid growth of credit and financial
    intermediation during the past two decades,
    the financial system has remained resilient so
    far.
