                                                           Preface
Since the late 1990s access to information and communication technolo-
gies (ICTs) has seen tremendous growth—driven primarily by the wireless
technologies and liberalization of telecommunications markets . Mobile com-
munications have evolved from simple voice and text services to diversified
innovative applications and mobile broadband Internet . In 2016, there
were more than 7 .3 billion mobile-cellular subscriptions worldwide . Globally,
3 .5 billion people were using the Internet, of which 2 .5 billion were from
developing countries . Mobile-broadband subscriptions have risen constantly
to reach 3 .6 billion, while the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions
reached more than 884 million during the same period .

The impacts of ICTs cross all sectors . Research has shown that investment
in information and communication technologies is associated with such
economic benefits as higher productivity, lower costs, new economic oppor-
tunities, job creation, innovation, and increased trade . ICTs also help provide
better services in health and education, and strengthen social cohesion .

The Little Data Book on Information and Communication Technology 2017
illustrates the progress of this revolution for 217 economies around the
world . It provides comparable statistics on the sector for 2005 and 2015
across a range of indicators, enabling readers to readily compare econo-
mies . This book includes indicators covering the economic and social
context, the structure of the information and communication technology
sector, sector efficiency and capacity, and sector performance related to
access, usage, quality, affordability, trade, and applications . The glossary
contains definitions of the terms used in the tables .

Data notes
The data in this book are for 2010 and 2015 or the most recent year
unless otherwise noted in the table or the glossary .

     • Growth rates are proportional changes from the previous year unless
        otherwise noted .

     • Regional aggregates include data for low- and middle-income econo-
        mies only .

     • Figures in italics indicate data for years or periods other than those
       specified .

Symbols used:

        .  .   indicates that data are not available or that aggregates cannot
               be calculated because of missing data .

0 or 0 .0      indicates zero or small enough that the number would round
               to zero at the displayed number of decimal places .

        $      indicates current U .S . dollars .

Lettered notes on some country tables can be found in the notes on page 235 .

Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or
for smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank or the ITU .
The term country (used interchangeably with economy) does not imply
political independence or official recognition by the World Bank or the ITU
but refers to any economy for which the authorities report separate social
or economic statistics .

Aggregates for groups of economies are based on the World Bank’s regional
and income classifications, and may differ from those published by the
ITU . Because of missing data, aggregates should be treated as approxi-
mations of unknown totals or average values . The aggregation method
for each indicator is noted in the glossary . Sums (s) are simple totals of
available data . Weighted averages (w) are calculated using the value of the
denominator or, in some cases, another indicator as the weight . Median
(m) calculations are based on available data and exclude economies with
populations below 1 million . For more information about aggregation meth-
ods visit datahelpdesk .worldbank .org .

The cutoff date for data is June 18, 2016 .

Income group tables
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bank’s main criterion for
classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita . Every economy
in The Little Data Book on Information and Communication Technology is clas-
sified as low income, middle income, or high income . Note: Classifications
are fixed during the World Bank’s fiscal year (ending on June 30), thus
countries remain in the categories in which they are classified irrespective
of any revisions to their per capita income data .

Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $1,025 or less
in 2015 .

Lower middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between
$1,026 and $4,035 .

Upper middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between
$4,036 and $12,475 .

High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,476 or more .

Glossary
Adult literacy rate is the percentage of people ages 15 and older who
can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement about
their everyday life . (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization Institute for Statistics) (w)

Domestic mobile traffic refers to the total number of minutes of calls
made by mobile subscribers within a country (including minutes to fixed-
telephone and minutes to mobile-phone subscribers) . Data listed for 2015
are for 2014 . (International Telecommunication Union) (w)

Fixed-broadband sub-basket refers to the price of the monthly subscription
to an entry-level fixed broadband plan . For comparability reasons, the fixed
broadband sub-basket is based on a monthly usage of (a minimum of) 1
gigabyte (GB) . For plans that limit the monthly amount of data transferred
by including caps below 1 GB, the cost for additional bytes is added to
the sub-basket . The minimum speed of a broadband connection is 256
kbit/s . (International Telecommunication Union) (m)

Fixed-broadband subscriptions refers to fixed subscriptions to high-speed
access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds
equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s . This includes cable modem, DSL,
fiber-to-the-home/building, other fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions,
satellite broadband, and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband . This total
is measured irrespective of the method of payment . It excludes subscrip-
tions that have access to data communications (including the Internet)
via mobile-cellular networks . It should include fixed WiMAX and any other
fixed wireless technologies . It includes both residential subscriptions and
subscriptions for organization (International Telecommunication Union) (w)

Fixed-telephone subscriptions refers to the sum of active number of analog
fixed-telephone lines, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) subscriptions, fixed
wireless local loop (WLL) subscriptions, ISDN voice-channel equivalents,
and fixed public payphones . (International Telecommunication Union) (w)

Foreign ownership refers to the allowance of foreign participation or owner-
ship in facility-based and spectrum-based operators as well as in Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) . (No = not allowed, R = allowed with restrictions,
A = allowed without restrictions) . Data are based on self-reported informa-
tion submitted by country administrations . (International Telecommunication
Union)

GDP growth is the annual percentage growth rate of gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) at market prices based on constant local currency . Aggregates
are based on constant 2010 U .S . dollars . GDP is the sum of gross value
added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes
and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products . It is
calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets
or for depletion and degradation of natural resources . (World Bank and
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) (w)

the midyear population . GNI is the sum of value added by all resident
producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the
valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of
employees and property income) from abroad . GNI, calculated in national
currency, is usually converted to U .S . dollars at official exchange rates for
comparisons across economies . The World Bank Atlas method is used to
smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates . It averages the exchange
rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences
in rates of inflation between the country and the Euro area, Japan, the
United Kingdom, and the United States . (World Bank) (w)

Internet traffic . The average should be calculated over the 12-month period
of the reference year, and should take into consideration the traffic of all
international Internet links . If the traffic is asymmetric (i .e ., more incoming
[downlink] than outgoing [uplink] traffic), then the average incoming (down-
link) traffic load should be provided . The combined average traffic load of
different international Internet links can be reported as the addition of the
average traffic load of each link . (International Telecommunication Union) (w)
