Abstract: This report analyzes the available data to determine if there are systemic differences in
the access to and funding of health services in different sub-regions of Comoros, and to link these
to variations in the socioeconomic status of residents in these sub-regions. It focuses on a
number of key questions that are analyzed at the sub-national level, including: the effect of out-of-
pocket payments on household financial well-being; whether out-of-pocket payments for health
are progressive or regressive; whether ill health is more concentrated among the poor; whether
the poor use health services less than the rich; and the major sources of financing for the health
system in Comoros. It introduces a specific analysis of “pockets of poverty” – the five sub-regions
with the highest level of poverty headcount (more than 50%) – comparing their characteristics to
those of the remaining sub-regions. These “pockets of poverty” appear to have generally lower
utilization of health services, poorer health outcomes in some areas (although not on aggregate
measures which bears further analysis), and lower levels of health spending, especially from the
public sector. Aside from the conclusions and potential policy implications for Comoros, it may be
useful to apply this type of analysis in other countries.

This report analyzes the available data to determine if there are systemic differences in the
access to and funding of health services in different sub-regions of Comoros, and to link these to
variations in the socioeconomic status of residents in these sub-regions. Data are drawn from the
2012 Household Budget/Consumption Survey or “Enquête sur l’emploi, le secteur informel et la
consommation des ménages aux Comores 2014” (HBS), the 2014 Demographic Health Survey
(DHS), and the 2011 National Health Accounts (NHA). Analysis was conducted using specialized
World Bank developed software (ADePT), and answers a number of questions.

What is the effect of out-of-pocket payments on household financial well-being?

Better-off households spend more on health. Households in urban areas, non-poor households,
and households headed by males and by those 55 years old or older spend more on health.
However, in terms of proportion, the rural and poor households have higher health spending in
relation to their gross consumption. There are significant variations between sub-regions and
regions. For example, the Ngazidja region has a higher average level of per capita out-of-pocket
health payments compared to the overall level of per capita consumption.

Catastrophic expenditures are found to be highly concentrated among the richest, but are more
common among the poor at the highest threshold of 40 percent when using either the total
household or non-food measure. Koimbani and Hambou sub-regions in Ngazidja, Nioumachoua
and Wanani sub-region in Mwali have two to three times the national average proportion of
households allocating 40 percent of the nonfood consumption spending on health. The incidence
of catastrophic payments increases with income but lower quintiles have higher incidence of
catastrophic payments exceeding the threshold of 40 percent in relation to both total household
expenditure and nonfood consumption. The incidence of catastrophic payments is generally
higher in Ngazidja, and lower in Ndzouani.

Health spending contributes to impoverishment. Out of pocket payments for health care lead to
poverty for 1.7 percent of the population (about 12,826 people a year), increasing overall levels of
poverty by 5 percent. In other words, on average, 35 Comorians fall into poverty daily because of
catastrophic health payments due to poor health. Many already poor households experience a
deepening of poverty as a result of their health expenses, particularly among the households in
the third and lower half of quintiles. Out-of-pocket payments are also responsible for a deepening
of poverty among the already poor.

There are significant variations of poverty levels, per capita OOP payments for health care and
the incidence of catastrophic expenditure between sub-region and regions. Nioumakele sub
region has the highest level of poverty in the country with health care spending barely affecting the
poverty headcount. Ndzouani has much lower average per capita payments and Ngazidja has the
highest incidence of catastrophic expenditure. In Hambou and Mitsamihouli sub-regions in
Ngazidja, health spending increases the poverty headcount despite a relatively different levels of
poverty. Are out-of-pocket payments for health progressive or regressive?

Overall, health care financing through OOP payments in Comoros is progressive, implying that
such payments are more concentrated among the better-off. Put differently, a poor household
contributes a smaller share of its resources on health care OOP payments than a rich one. Rich
households might contribute relatively more to financing government public expenditure through a
progressive tax system. However, the average budget share of OOP health payments compared
to gross per capita consumption is regressive over the first three quintiles. This means that OOP
spending is absorbing a larger share of these poor individuals’ resources than it does for rich
individuals.




                                                 vii
Is ill health more concentrated among the poor?

Overall, households living in rural areas and those in the lower quintile have a higher prevalence
of health problems than those living in urban areas and in the richest quintiles. Health problems
decrease with income, except ARIs which are more prevalent among the richest quintiles. For
example, the incidence of ARIs is higher in Ndzouani-Domoni, Ndzouani-Mutsamudu, Ngazidja-
Tsoudjini, and Ngazidja-Hambou sub regions. Ill health and the under-five mortality rate (U5MR)
are concentrated among the poor in Comoros. U1MR and U5MR are quite high in Ngazidja sub-
regions such as Dembeni, Foumbouni, and Mbeni, and in Ndzouani Domoni sub-region. Sima
sub-region in Ndzouani and Hambou sub-region in Ngazidja have a high U5MR but low U1MR.
The incidence of diarrhea is over 20 percent in seven sub-regions: in Ndzouani sub-region of
Domoni, Mutsamudu, Ouani and Sima; in Ngazidja sub-region of Hambou, Bambao and
Tsoudjini. First quintiles (the poorest 20 percent of the population) have higher average
prevalence of nutritional issues such as stunting, underweight and particularly wasting. Higher
than average levels of moderate stunting and underweight are seen in Ndzouani sub-regions
(Domoni, Mutsamudu, Nioumakele, Ouani, and Sima) and in Kiombani and Moroni sub-regions of
Ngazidja. However, there is almost no inequality between the lowest and richest quintiles for
birthweight and U1MR.

Do the poor use health services less than the rich?

The utilization of health care in Comoros is concentrated among the better-off, increasing the
poor’s risk for ill health. Most Maternal and child health interventions have significant and positive
concentration indices, signifying that utilization of any MCH interventions is higher among the
better-off. Antenatal care is considerably below average in the Ndzouani sub-regions of Ouani and
Mutsamudu. To tackle these inequalities in health utilization, an analysis of the causes of lower
utilization of health care services among the first quintiles should be undertaken. There is higher
utilization of health care by richer households reflecting a more pro-rich health service delivery
system, except for the tetanus vaccine for pregnant women which is pro-poor. Utilization of
delivery services provided by doctors is higher among the rich and in the Ngazidja sub-regions of
Dembeni, Hambou, Kiombani and Mbeni. The sub-regions of Mwali-Nioumachoua, Ndzouani-
Domoni and Nioumakele have the lowest skilled birth attendant coverage. Coverage of Vitamin A
supplementation for children under 5 is higher in the Mwali sub-region of Fomboni and in the
Ngazidja sub-regions of Hambou, Koimbani and Tsoudjini. There is little association between
income and the utilization of essential maternal health services and diarrhea treatment for
children. However, substantial variation exists on the percentage of cases of diarrhea that are
treated within the health care system. Lower utilization of this service is shown in the Ngazidja
sub-regions of Mitsamihouli, Tsoudjini, Mbeni and Bambao and in the Ndzouani sub-region of
Domoni.

Higher vaccination coverage is observed in sub-regions with high levels of ANC and skilled birth
attendance (SBA). However, low vitamin A supplementation for pregnant women is observed in
sub-regions with high levels of ANC implying that quality of ANC services needs to be improved.

The relationship between utilization and outcome variables is interesting. Nutritional status has a
negative correlation with ANC, SBA and ITN use, and Vitamin A supplementation for children,
implying that higher use of these services tends to show lower levels of nutrition-related indicators.
Similarly, sub-regions with higher levels of vaccination coverage have lower rates of ARI and
diarrhea.

How is the health system financed in Comoros?

The majority of health system financing is private. Most of the public financing is directed toward
salaries and benefits, while private and donor funds support non-salary expenses. More than half
of the non-salary expenditure is directed toward the purchase of services and/or drugs, from the
private sector and directly by households. Allocation of funds per capita across sub-regions shows



                                                 viii
significant variation. For example, Ngazidja Moroni receives higher funds per capita (KMF20,000)
compared to the rest of the sub-region (KMF1,305). However, donor funding targets poorer areas
especially subregions with higher levels of poverty headcount. On the contrary, public spending
tends to be lower in sub-regions with higher poverty headcount. Overall, out-of-pocket spending
increases where other sources of funding are lacking. The relationship between poverty and the
use of health services suggests that the poor are facing financial barriers to accessing health
services.

What are “pockets of poverty” and why are they important?

The five sub-regions with the highest levels of poverty headcount (more than 50 percent) were
analyzed by comparing their characteristics to the remaining sub-regions. These poorest regions
are: (i) Mbeni (Ngazidja); (ii) Sima (Ndzouani); (iii) Nioumakele (Ndzouani); (iv) Wanani (Mwali);
and (v) Nioumachoua (Mwali). This analysis found that the impoverishing effect of health
payments is less in the poorer sub-regions, which is reflective of the much lower average health
spending and may reflect care being forgone in the poorer regions due to lack of available
funding. While it would be expected that the overall level of consumption and health spending in
the poorer sub-regions would be less than in the richer ones, the poorest sub-regions actually
spend 15 percent less of their income on health compared to the richer regions. Similarly, the
impoverishing effect of health payments is also less in these sub-regions: a 2.7 percent increase
in poverty on average, compared to a 7.1 percent increase in the other sub-regions. This is
reflective of the much lower average health spending and may reflect care being forgone in the
poorer regions due to lack of available funding.

With regard to catastrophic health spending, however, a higher proportion of households in poorer
sub-regions (16 percent) spent 40 percent or more on health than those in richer sub-regions.
Over 40 percent of the households in poorer regions allocate more than 30 or 40 percent of their
total spending on health related issues.

Turning to the utilization of health services, the poorer sub-regions have 60 percent fewer doctor
assisted deliveries but slightly higher levels of nurse assisted deliveries. As a result, the overall
level of professionally assisted deliveries in these sub-regions is around 11 percent less than in
the richer regions. There do not seem to be significant differences in the utilization of
immunization services, although there does appear to be some issues with respect to follow-up.
Both polio-3 and DPT-3 coverage seem to be less in the poorer sub-regions. ITN usage is also
almost 13 percent lower in the poorer sub-regions compared to the richer ones, suggesting that
some better targeting is needed. The level of treatment for ARI is lower (64.5 percent) in the
poorer sub-regions, compared to the reported incidence (44 percent lower). This also suggests
some possible access issues in these sub-regions. Similarly, access to vitamin A for children is
much lower (21 percent less), although vitamin A coverage for pregnant women is not much
different between the two groups. In terms of outcomes, stunting, wasting and underweight rates
are all higher for the poorer sub-regions, although the percentage of severe stunting is fairly
similar and the percentage of severe underweight is actually 20 percent less in the richer sub-
regions. Infant and child mortality are also lower in the poorer sub-regions, which might bear
further examination.

Looking at the proportion of total spending by source, it seems that donor funds are well targeted
to poorer sub-regions, but other types of funds, especially public funds are more highly
concentrated in richer sub-regions. In terms of spending per capita, there is approximately 3.5
times the donor funds going to poorer sub-regions compared to the richer ones, but the richer
ones, on average, get almost 15 times the level of public spending compared to the poorer ones.
In this regard, private spending is more equitable, since the per capita private spend in the poorer
sub-regions is around 6 times that in the richer ones. These issues clearly need further
investigation. Poorer sub-regions have a significantly higher proportion of funds going to health
centers and health posts, and a much lower proportion going to medical offices and vendors. The




                                                 ix
five poorest sub-regions have no spending at all for hospitals, labs, pharmacy and financial
institutions.

What are the policy implications of this analysis?

This analysis suggests that within Comoros there are significant variations in the level of spending
on health, as well as in health utilization and outcomes. The data shows that some of these
variations seem to be related to a greater or lesser extent to the level of poverty within the specific
geographic area. These “pockets of poverty” appear to have generally lower utilization of health
services, poorer health outcomes in some areas (although not on aggregate measures which
bears further analysis), and lower levels of health spending, especially from the public sector. In
this context, subsidies targeting the poorest to increase their access while containing the welfare
impact of OOP payments would be a possible option. This would help to address possible
“demand side” constraints. Other policy options may include better targeting of government
funding for health or of health infrastructure to improve the “supply side”.

All of this suggests that mechanisms need to be developed to address the various issues. Better
information on the availability of government resources in these “pockets of poverty” would also
be needed. To allow more granular analysis on the Benefit Incidence Analysis and an in depth
analysis of the progressivity of health financing, simple amendments to the health module of
future consumption survey questionnaires would be highly recommended.

Beyond the application in Comoros, the approach employed may be considered useful for doing
sub-national analyses in other countries that have two or more of the following: Demographic and
Health Surveys, Household Budget Surveys and National Health Accounts, where they all have
data that can be coded to common administrative sub-divisions below the national level. Although
it was not possible to do so for this report, the inclusion of sub-national level administrative data
on health facilities, human resources and other characteristics from the national Health
Management Information Systems should further enrich such an analysis.

The Union of Comoros is a “small island nation” consisting of an archipelago of 3 islands off the
coasts of Mozambique and Madagascar (see map) structured into three regional states (Ngazidja;
Ndzouani and Moheli or Mwali) and 15 sub regions or Prefectures. Moroni is the largest city,
capital and headquarters of the government of the Union of the Comoros in Ngazidja. Mutsamudu
is the main city of Ndjouani and Fomboni for Mwali. Comoros has a population of around 770,000
people (2014 World Bank estimate) and a GNI per capita (Atlas method) of US$ 790. Health
expenditure is around US$ 56.80 per capita (6.7 percent of GDP), with 32.9 percent of this
coming from public sources. Public financing for health care comprises 8.7 percent of
government spending (2014 World Bank estimate) although this varies significantly from year to
year.

                                               1
Within each island, the road network covers a total of 834km, 508 km of which approximately (that
is, 61 percent) in Ngazidja, 232 km in Ndzouani and 94 km in Mwali. 1 However, the condition of
these roads has significantly deteriorated over the last decade, failing funding for required
maintenance and investment, makes transport difficult. The three islands are connected by sea
and through three ports (Moroni in Ngazidja; Mutsamudu in Ndzouani and Fomboni in Mwali).
Despite this potential, the port infrastructure in the archipelago is not up to the minimum
requirements, in terms of safety, capacity and activity volume management. 2

The health status of Comorians has improved over the past five years, but much remains
to be done. Life expectancy in Comoros is above the average for the Africa region (62 compared
to 56). Between 1990 and 2012, the under-five mortality has declined from 124 to 78 per thousand
live births, a decrease of 37 percent. The Infant mortality rate or the risk of death between birth
and the first birthday is estimated at 36 per thousand. This result was the consequence of the
combined reduction in neonatal, post-neonatal and child mortality. Progress was also made
towards reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by three-quarters (from 440 to 280 deaths
per 10,000 live births between 1990 and 2010).

The prevalence rate of Malaria sharply decreased from 9 percent in 2012 (WHO Report 2013) to
1 percent in 2014 (MIS 2014) and the prevalence rate of HIV remains low at 0.03 percent. The
incidence of tuberculosis (37 cases per 100,000 individuals in 2011) remains significantly lower in
Comoros than the recorded average for Sub-Saharan African countries (350 cases per 100,000
individuals in 2009), and has followed a downward trend since 2006 (44 cases per 100,000
individuals in 2006).

The epidemiological situation is characterized by communicable and non-communicable
diseases, with high prevalence of diarrheal diseases and ARI among children under 5 years old,
aggravated by malnutrition (4.4 percent of which were severely underweight and 30 percent being
stunted). 3 Comoros faces the emergence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as
cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer due to changes in lifestyle behavior, and the lack of
preventive measures and care. Deaths due to NCDs represent 40 percent of the total death in
Comoros compared with the 28 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. 4

The coverage of health services is higher-than-expected in some key areas. Indeed, one of
the preliminary findings of the DHS-MICS II 2012 is the high access to qualified staff during
childbirth (76 percent) and to antenatal care (92 percent). Nearly eight out of ten households have
at least one mosquito net, whether treated or untreated with insecticide (79 percent), 5 and 59
percent of households own at least one insecticide treated net (ITN). In addition, 70.3 percent of
pregnant women aged 15-49 years slept under a mosquito net (impregnated or not with
insecticide) 6.

This high level of coverage is likely responsible for the maternal mortality ratio indicator being on
track to meet the MDG goal set for 2015. Full immunization has also increased to 80 percent. 7 An
area in which further progress is needed is with regard to health interventions on children if the
infant mortality rate and under-five mortality ratio are to substantially improve.

However, critical services such as family planning and nutrition are inadequate. Given the low use
of contraception (26 percent) and the current population growth rate of 2.9 percent, the population
of Comoros is projected to reach one million in twelve years and to more than double by the year
2050. 8 Nutrition interventions are mainly absent, and early breastfeeding is very low (at 12
percent) and has decreased in the last five years. From the DHS-MICS II 2012 report, treatment
for acute respiratory infections (ARI) and fever for children under the age of 5 is very low, at 38.1
percent and 40 percent, respectively. Additionally, although the rate of oral rehydration is
increasing, it still remains under 60 percent.

A large number of government health policy papers and national health plans have been
prepared over the past five years. Policies and strategies containing the key elements relevant
to the country are available. These include the revised National Health Policy 2015 – 2024,
validated in December 2014, along with the National Health Development Plan 2015-2019 in
which the following strategic orientations were identified: (i) expanding and strengthening access
to health services and quality nutrition; (ii) strengthening prevention and health promotion
systems; (iii) developing leadership and governance; (iv) developing human resources for health;
(v) developing infrastructure, equipment and health products; (vi) increasing health financing; (vii)
developing the health information system; and (viii) promoting research and knowledge
management. Other recent policies and strategies include: a National Pharmaceutical Policy; a
Strategic Development Plan for Human Resource for Health 2010 – 2015; a National Strategy for
Community Health; a national water and sanitation strategy for the period 2015-2030 to address
drinking water needs for all the population; and an Ebola Preparedness Plan. The National
Nutrition and Food Policy and its operational plan 2014-2019 is designed to improve the nutritional
status of vulnerable groups, including children, women of reproductive age and the particularly
disadvantaged. Comoros joined the Scaling up Nutrition (SUN) movement in 2014, and a multi-
sectoral nutrition platform has been established.

The social and financial protection systems are limited in Comoros. People are not
protected from the financial consequences of illness and of having to obtain medical care.
Existing social protection schemes cover only a small part of the population. These include: (i) the
retirement fund for old-age, disability and death of civil servants and private sector employees
covers 10 percent of the population over 65 years old; (ii) the Social Security Fund for the
protection of employees against occupational diseases and accidents at work covers less than 6
percent of assets in Ngazidja; (iii) the military retirement fund and mutual for old-age, disability
benefits and medical coverage for military personnel and their families covers ……; (iv) and health
mutual, which covers only 3.3 percent of the population as of 2012.

The Public Expenditure Review (PER) and other sources have identified a number of challenges
in the health system in Comoros, including: (a) low levels of health expenditure financed by the
state in general ($ 3 per inhabitant); (b) high levels of expenditure on the salaries of health
workers in relation to operating costs such as medical equipment, medicines and training; (c)
heavy reliance on user charges (user fees) to cover the costs of operating deficits resulting from
high "out of pocket" fees or direct payments and private expenditure; and (d) differences in the
distribution of funds between the central and regional (island) levels and the allocation of financial
and human resources between the islands. A crucial question that has not been addressed so far
is the extent to which this affects the poor disproportionately.

In FY16, the World Bank allocated funds for a “just-in-time analysis” to get a better picture of the
situation on the ground based on the available data and to propose a number of options which
could improve the delivery of health services, specifically tailored to their needs. As the study was
underway, the team learned that further funding was being made available in FY17 to more fully


8The total fertility rate or the number of children per woman of childbearing age was 5.3% in
2003. Anjouan has the highest rate (at 6.3%), followed by Moheli (at 6.1%) and Ngazidja (at
4.5%).

explore the potential options and conduct policy dialogue with the Government on their
implementation.

The overall objective of this study is to assist the Comoros Government in improving the access,
cost efficiency, targeting and sustainability of health services. The specific objectives are to utilize
the available data to determine if there are systemic differences in the access to and funding of
health services in different sub-regions of Comoros, and to link these to variations in the
socioeconomic status of residents in these sub-regions. The analysis is particularly important at
this stage in the development of the health system in Comoros because of the national goal of
Universal Health Coverage (UHC).

The key questions that were to be addressed include:

     (a)     What geographic (national and sub-regional) differences exist in health care spending
             (both by households and within the health system as a whole), utilization and
             outcomes, and to what extent are these differences related to socioeconomic status?
     (b)     Are such differences more pronounced in areas of low socio-economic status?
     (c)     To what extent do correlations exist between health care spending, utilization and
             outcomes; that is, does higher spending appear to result in better utilization and
             outcomes, or do better outcomes appear to result from higher utilization?

                                              GENERAL

During an initial scoping mission, the available data was explored together with the Ministry of
Health and a proposed methodology was developed and agreed upon. Essentially, the approach
involved conducting an analysis of secondary data to identify geographic "pockets of poverty" and
explore the correlations between the geographic distribution of the poor and their use of health
care or health status.

During the initial stages of the review of the data, it was determined that both the Household
Budget/ Consumption Survey or “Enquête sur l’emploi, le secteur informel et la consommation des
ménages aux Comores 2014” (HBS) and Demographic Health Survey (DHS) databases had
specific coding by Regional Prefecture. In order to get further detail in the areas around Moroni,
the Cantons were used, representing a smaller geographic division than the Prefecture. This was
important due to the large size of Moroni, and the need for further detail in this area. This resulted
in a total of 17 sub-national divisions, most of which had well over 100 households. The
distribution of households in the HBS and DHS databases by these divisions is given in Table 1
below.




        Box 1. Data used and limitations

        The main elements of the analysis included data from: (a) the 2014 Household
        Budget/Consumptions Survey (HBS); (b) the 2012 Demographic and Health
        Survey (DHS), and (c) the 2011 National Health Accounts (NHA). Annex 1
        contains more detail on the various databases and related methodology.

        While originally it was envisioned that data from the National Health Information
        System (NHIS) would also be included in the analysis, this data was not made
        available during the course of the project, so could not be included. This
        represented a major constraint to the resulting analysis, since much of the
        background data on the number of facilities and staff in different sub-regions was
        not available.

        It was felt that the dates of the various datasets were close enough together that
        this should not present a time-based problem with the comparability of the data.
        Further, although HBS wealth quintiles were calculated based on per capita
        household consumption (ordering the per capita consumption from lowest to
        highest and allocating 20 percent of the households to each quintile) and the
        wealth quintile measure was constructed using the standard DHS-Measure
        methodology, a high degree of overlap between the two measures was likely.

        In addition, the composition of revenues and expenditures were analyzed to
        identify differences between health centers in areas with pockets of poverty and
        those without.

                                    SOFTWARE AND PROCESSING

The initial analysis was generated by using a World Bank developed software package called
ADePT. The advantage of this package is that it requires users to have only a limited knowledge
of Stata and/or SPSS, so that they only need to be able to prepare the data set in the prescribed
format, but do not need to know how to program Stata to undertake the often complex analysis
that ADePT performs. It also ensures that the processing of the data is always done in a
consistent and appropriate manner. Thus ADePT frees up time and resources which can be used
for data preparation, interpretation of results, and thinking about the policy implications of results.




                                                  6
The software has been used to produce “Health Equity and Financial Protection” data sheets for
roughly 100 countries, and is an important resource in determining progress in achieving the
World Bank’s twin goals (ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity) in health.
ADePT generates standard tables and figures which summarize the results of distributional
analyses of household survey data. ADePT has two health modules: one covers inequality and
equity in health, and health care utilization, while the second addresses health financing and
financial protection. The first module utilizes data from the DHS, while the second uses HBS
data. Both datasets use calculated poverty quintiles from the respective surveys.

Using the DHS variables specified (see Annex 1 for details), the software was able to calculate
national level health outcomes by various household characteristics (urban rural, sub-region and
wealth quintile), as well as indicators of health inequality and concentration curves; for both
utilization and outcome variables. The HBS variables allowed the calculation of (a) health
spending as a percent of total consumption by various characteristics (urban-rural, sub-region,
gender of HH head, age of HH head, consumption quintile); (b) incidence and intensity of
catastrophic health payments (both compared to total and non-food consumption, with different
levels of catastrophic payments); (c) poverty headcount with and without health payments to
provide an indication of the poverty-inducing impact of health payments; and (d) the redistributive
impact of health spending.

The data included in the HBS was limited, and did not include either utilization or unit cost
information. As such, it was not possible to conduct a formal Benefit-Incidence Analysis, which
could have proved to be very useful to show whether and how far government health expenditure
benefits the poor.

The ADePT software generated national level indicators, as well as summary statistics at the sub-
regional level. Using the same techniques, additional sub-regional level indicators were
calculated by the project team.

It is worth noting, that the results presented are largely descriptive. This report made use of the
available data to determine if there are systemic differences in the access to and funding of health
services in different sub-regions of Comoros, and to link these to variations in the socioeconomic
status of residents in these sub-regions. The inequality analysis and causal relationships between
wealth and health will be further elaborated upon in future follow-on analytical work.

                             NATIONAL-LEVEL HEALTH FINANCING RESULTS 9


The proportion of health spending is higher for household in rural areas, poor households,
households headed by males and by people over 55 years of age, and among the fourth and fifth
richest quintiles.

Table 2, presents the relation between average household consumption per family member,
average health related spending per family member and household characteristics. There are two
household characteristics: the area of residence (rural, urban and the region) and the poverty
status of the household (poor and non-poor), defined as poverty in relation to an absolute amount
of household expenditure per capita per year which is KMF 295,105 per capita (KMF 276,380 in
Ngazidja; KMF 224,765 in Ndzouani; and KMF 274,490 in Mwali). Households in urban areas of
residence are richer with KMF 634,614.6 gross consumption per capita than the rural ones at
KMF 481,660.6 which are even lower than the overall national level (KMF 542,453.3). With KMF
807,918.1 gross consumption per capita, Dembeni sub region in Ngazidja is richer than the other
sub regions, and the Nioumachoua sub region in Mwali is the poorest at KMF 277,321.8.

The amount of health spending seems to be higher for the urban and non-poor but in
terms of proportion, rural and poor households have higher health spending. According to
the Comoros Public Expenditure and fiscal management review in 2015, island budget allocations
are the primary resource for public schools and health centers. These allocations are low. On
average, the islands allocated USD 5 per person to non-salary spending on education, and a total
of USD 3 to both salary and non-salary spending for health. Thus, the latter rely on fees and
charges, effectively transferring the cost burden to families and the community. According to
Table 2, household health spending at national level is KMF21, 606.6. The urban and non-poor
households are spending above the national level on health, KMF 23, 518 and KMF 29, 244.6
respectively. In the 2014 HBS survey, health spending consists of several items (medical
equipment and materials; outpatient care; paramedical services; and hospital services) for a recall
period of 12 and three months.

Table 3 presents the relation between the source of health financing and individual characteristics.
Households headed by males have a higher share of health spending (4.18 percent), than
those headed by females, which is higher than the national level at 3.98 percent.
Households headed by people over 55 years of age have a health spending per capita of more
than five percent on average with a maximum of 6.17 percent among the age groups of 55-59
years.

While quintiles 1 and 2 have the same share of health spending per capita in terms of the
percentage of consumption, quintile 2 spends almost double in absolute terms
(KMF11,136.3 compared to KMF5,735.9 for the first quintile). The fourth and fifth richest quintiles
spend more on health on average, 3.95 percent and 4.49 percent respectively.

                                      FINANCIAL PROTECTION

The most important finding emerging from this section is the fact that there is a concentration of
out-of-pocket and of catastrophic payments among those who are better off. This implies that
these groups are paying higher share of their consumption on health and might be forced to
sacrifice other basic needs due to health care spending.

Households without full health insurance coverage face a risk of incurring large expenditures for
medical care should they fall ill. This uninsured risk reduces welfare. Further, should a household
member fall ill, the out-of-pocket purchase of medical care would disrupt the material living
standards of the household. If the health care expenses are large relative to the resources
available to the household, this disruption to living standards may be considered catastrophic.
One conception of fairness in health finance is that households should be protected against such
catastrophic medical expenses (World Health Organization 2000).



                                                10
A household is classified as having catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending if it exceeds a
certain fraction of consumption as a share of total (or non-food) expenditure. The percentage of
the population being so classified is likely, of course, to depend on the threshold chosen. Since
there is no established international benchmark for “catastrophic” a range of thresholds are given
so that the reader can compare the impact at various levels. ADePT reports the percentage of
the population experiencing catastrophic health spending for different thresholds; this is termed
“the head count”.

In Table 4, columns provide different thresholds, between five percent and 40 percent, according
to which the share of spending allocated by the household to health is considered to be
catastrophic. This table provides more detailed analysis of the catastrophic impact of out-of-
pocket payments. The first section of the table shows the catastrophic payments head count (H),
which represents the proportion of households with a health payment share greater than the given
thresholds; the severity of these payments, is measured by the Overshoot (O), which represents
the average excess of health payment budget share in the whole population and the Mean
positive overshoot (MPO), which represents the average excess of health payment budget share
of those households with catastrophic payments. 10 Put in a simple way, the overshoot counts all
dollars spent on health care in excess of the threshold. The intensity of catastrophic expenditure is
measured by the payment in excess of the threshold. Averaged over all households exceeding
that threshold, 24.4 percent of individual in the richest quintiles have a share of health
spending exceeding the thresholds of five percent compared to the total household
expenditure. This table also shows that when the threshold of budget share increased from five
percent to 40 percent, the estimation of the incidence of catastrophic payments decreased from
21.4 percent to 0.4 percent at national level, and the mean overshoot drops from 1.6 percent to
only 0.1 percent. This implies that only few proportion of households allocate 40 percent of the
total household consumption spending on health. The lowest quintile have higher incidence of
catastrophic payments exceeding the threshold of 40 percent (1.3 percent) compared to the
national average and the highest quintile. Unlike the head count and the overshoot, the mean
positive overshoot among those exceeding the threshold (MPO) has not declined as the threshold
is raised from five to 40 percent (6.5 percent to 11.6 percent). Those spending more than 5
percent of total expenditure on health care, on average spent 11.5 percent (5 percent + 6.5
percent). Those spending more than 40 percent of the household budget on health care, on
average spent 51.6 percent.

Overall, more than half (54.9 percent) of households allocate 5 percent or more of the non-food
consumption spending on health (Table 5). When the threshold increased from 5 percent to 40
percent, of non-food consumption, the estimated incidence of catastrophic payments decreased
from 54.9 percent to 3.3 percent, and the mean overshoot drops from 6.7 percent to only 0.6
percent, this implies that only few proportion of households allocate 40 percent of the non-food
consumption spending on health. However, the proportion is still higher among the lowest quintile
(4.8 percent) compared to the richest quintile (3.0 percent). The MPO increased from 12.2 to 17.4
percent, which implies that those spending more than 5 percent of nonfood expenditure on health
care, on average spent 17.2 percent (5 percent + 12.2 percent). Those spending more than 40
percent of the nonfood household budget on health care, on average spent 57.4 percent.

                   DISTRIBUTION SENSITIVE MEASURES OF CATASTROPHIC PAYMENTS

The distribution of catastrophic payments in relation to income could be measured by
concentration indexes (C_E and C_O) 11. A concentration index measures the extent to which

11
     The first line of the tables shows the concentration index of the incidence of catastrophic
     payments (C_E). A positive value of C_E indicates a greater tendency for the better off to
     exceed the payment threshold, whereas a negative value indicates a greater tendency for the
     worse off to exceed it. The concentration index of payment overshoot (C_O) is a very similar
     measure. This indicates whether the average payment exceeding the threshold is greater
     among the better off (C_O > 0) or among the poor (C_O < 0). H_W and H_O adjust the
     catastrophic payment head count (H) and overshoot (O), respectively, in order to make these
     measures sensitive to the distribution of income. (Wagstaff, A. et al, Health Equity and
     Financial Protection, World Bank, 2011, p. 127).

                                                 13
this distribution is concentrated in the better off (positive value) or the poor (negative value) For
example, in Table 6, which utilizes total household spending, the threshold concentration value of
40 percent share of health spending in relation to the income is negative (C_E: -0.298 and C_O: -
0.310), implying that the poor are more likely to incur catastrophic expenditures at that
threshold level. On the other hand, those who are well off are more likely to hit the
spending threshold at lower threshold levels.

The same situation is reflected in the 40 percent threshold concentration value on health spending
in relation to the non-food expenditure (Table 7), where the concentration index is negative. This
implies that catastrophic expenditures are concentrated among the poorest.

                          MEASURE OF POVERTY BASED ON CONSUMPTION

Table 8 presents poverty measures corresponding to household expenditure both gross and net
of health payments. Comparison of gross and net measures is indicative of the scale of
impoverishment due to health payments. On the basis of total household consumption, 34.3
percent of the population is estimated to be in poverty. If out-of-pocket payments for health care
are netted out of household consumption, this percentage rises to 36 percent. So 1.7 percent of
the population would not be counted as living in poverty if the resources devoted to health
were consumed otherwise. In other words, the poverty rate increased by 1.7 percentage
points or 5.0 percent due to out-of-pocket payments made due to poor health which
diverted household expenditure from general consumption to health spending. The poverty
gap increases from 12.5 percent of the poverty line to 13.3 percent when health payments are
netted out of household consumption, but the normalized mean positive poverty gap increases
slightly (from 36.4 to 37.1). This suggests that the rise in the poverty gap is due mainly to more
households being brought into poverty, because copayments are too high for the poorest, and not
to a deepening of the poverty of the already poor.

                                                        HEALTH PAYMENTS AND HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION

Figure 1 below shows the effect of health payments on the household consumption and poverty
through "Pen's parade”. Households are ranked in ascending order of their consumption,
including health payments. For each household, the vertical bar, or “paint drip” shows the extent to
which health payments reduce consumption (on food, education, clothing….). If a bar crosses the
poverty line, then a household is not poor on the basis of gross consumption, but is poor on the
basis of net consumption. In other words, the household gets impoverished by health payments.
The Figure shows that health payments are largest at higher values of total consumption,
but it is the households in the third quintiles of distribution that are brought below the
poverty line by health payments. This graph equally indicates that many already poor
households are experiencing a deepening poverty because of their health expenses.

        PROGRESSIVITY OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING THROUGH OUT-OF-POCKET PAYMENTS


The analysis done in this report can only conclude that out-of-pocket payments are progressive in
the sense that they are more concentrated amongst the rich. The report could not look at the
distribution of other sources of financing and could not therefore say anything about the
progressivity of overall health financing in the country.

There is a general consensus that payments for health care ought to be at least proportional to
households’ ability to pay, if not progressive (meaning a poor household contributes a smaller
share of its resources than a rich one). Table 9 gives the average consumption and financing
share, by quintile. The poorest quintile consumes 5.2 percent of total consumption, while the
richest quintile consumes 47.3 percent of the total. Looking at health related payments, the
richest quintile contributes 51.7 percent of the total which is more than ten times as much as the
poorest quintile at 4.7 percent. Average consumption and health payments shares are ten
times greater among the richest quintile than the poorest quintile.

The Kakwani indexes measures financing progressivity as the difference between the
concentration index and the gross consumption Gini index. Kakwani indexes for out-of-pocket
payments is positive (0.0563), indicating progressivity, which means that financing is more
concentrated among the rich and it increases with income, implying that the highest
quintile spent a larger fraction of their consumption on health care than the poorest.
However, as indicated in Tables 6 and 7, the impact in terms of catastrophic spending is more
pronounced for the poor at the higher threshold levels.

out-of-pocket payments are more concentrated among the rich and increase with income.

                                     INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES 12


Households living in rural areas have more health problems. Health outcomes are relatively
equally distributed, except for undernutrition outcomes which are concentrated among the worse-
off and particularly the first quintile.

Table 10 presents the relation between health outcomes and household characteristics. Health
outcome variables are used to analyze inequalities in health. Health and health care are integral to
people’s capability to function – their ability to flourish as human beings. Health is among the most
important conditions of human life and critically significant constituent of human capabilities which
we have reason to value (Sen 2002). This table shows that in general, households living in
rural areas have more health problems than those living in urban areas. However,
households in urban areas have a higher prevalence of Acute Respiratory Infection (10.5%) and
child wasting (low weight-for-height) (13.7%) compared to those in rural areas (ARI at 6 percent
and wasting at 10.7 percent). This table also shows that health outcomes are relatively equally
distributed, except for undernutrition outcomes, which are concentrated among the worse-off.
Details of the results by health region are examined below.

Table 11 shows the income-related inequality in 11 health status variables. The concentration
index is a measure of how health status is related to income. A positive value indicates that the
health variable is more concentrated among richer individuals. A negative value indicates the
opposite, whereas a concentration index not very different from 0 reflects no relationship between
income and health status. The concentration index is negative for all the health problems, but the
ARI, which reflects the decrease in health problems with income. In contrast, the concentration
index for ARI is clearly positive (0.1403) as a result of the increase in prevalence with income. The
concentration index for birthweight and U1MR are close to 0 (-0.0048 and -0.0058 respectively),
which indicates that inequality between lowest and richest quintiles is less pronounced. The
concentration index aversion to inequality is increased, thus the weight of the first quintiles is
increased relative to the richest quintiles. That is, the first quintiles have a higher prevalence of
health problems (U5MR and nutritional status), thus, the corresponding extended
concentration index is negative.

The last three columns of the table display the achievement index which is a measure of average
health, taking health inequality into account: the greater the health inequality, the smaller is the
achievement index. The achievement index aversion to inequality is increased for birthweight,
stunted, underweight and wasted, which reflects a higher average prevalence of these health
problems among the first quintiles.

                              CONCENTRATION OF HEALTH OUTCOMES


Figure 3 shows the income-related inequality in several health outcomes. These curves show how
health outcomes vary according to consumption: the farther a curve is above the 45º line, the
more the corresponding health variable is concentrated among the poorest households. The
concentration curve for most health outcomes, particularly wasted prevalence, lies above the 45º
line, which confirms that these health problems are more prevalent among the poor. By
contrast, the concentration curve for ARI lies below the 45º line, which means that this
health problem is more concentrated among the rich. Birthweight and U1MR concentration
curve is very close to the 45º line, which indicates very little association between these health
outcomes and income, the values of which are confirmed in table 11 above.

                               INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH UTILIZATION


Health service utilization is concentrated among the better-off which reflects a more pro-rich
health services delivery system in Comoros. By contrast, worse-off households underutilize health
services, particularly the first quintiles, except for tetanus vaccine.

Table 12 shows the income-related inequality in the utilization of health care. The health care
utilization is increasing with income, the household in the richest quintile have higher coverage of
health care use, except for pregnant women receiving tetanus vaccine where the coverage is
higher among the household in the lowest quintile (65.8 percent) compared to the richest quintile
(56.8 percent).

  The same trend is reflected in the corresponding concentration index where the number is
  negative (-0.030), revealing higher utilization of tetanus vaccine services by poorer households
  (Table 13). The concentration indexes for all the other health care utilization are clearly positive,
  indicating higher utilization by richer households. Aversion inequality is higher and positive for
  most of the health care utilization, which shows a greater concentration of utilization
  among the rich. Thus, utilization of health care services becomes even more pro-rich. Finally,
  the aversion to inequality of achievement index has lower value than the standard achievement
  index, which reflects a lower average utilization of these health care services among the first
  quintiles, except for tetanus vaccine. The same trend is revealed in low-income countries, where
  the lack of health insurance and purchasing power among the poor typically mean that their
  utilization of health care is less than that of the better off despite their greater need (Gwatkin 2003;
  O’Donnell and others 2007).

                                      CONCENTRATION OF HEALTH UTILIZATION

    The Figure 4 shows the income-related inequality health care utilization. These curves show how
    utilization vary according to consumption: the farther a curve is above the 45º line, the more the
    corresponding health variable is concentrated among the poorest households. The concentration
    curve for most of the health care utilization, particularly births attended by a doctor, lies below the
    45º line, which confirms that utilization is more prevalent among the rich. By contrast, the
    concentration curve for the tetanus vaccine lies above the 45º line, which means that this health
    service is more concentrated among the poor. Antenatal Care with skilled health providers,
    delivery with nurse, Vitamin A supplementation for pregnant women, diarrhea treatment and
    tetanus vaccine concentration curves are very close to the 45º line. This indicates very little
    association between the use of these health care services and income, the values of which are
    confirmed in Table 12 above.

           SUB-REGIONAL LEVEL HEALTH FINANCING, UTILIZATION AND OUTCOMES RESULTS


The impoverishing effect of health payments is actually less in the poorer sub-regions, except in in
Hambou and Mitsamihouli where health spending boosts the poverty headcount by close to 12
percent. Looking at the relationships between utilization and outcome variables, sub-regions that
had high rates of ANC, skilled birth attendance, insecticide treated bed-nets (ITN) use and
Vitamin A coverage for children fared better in all of the nutrition-related indicators.

Table 14 shows the average level of per capita out-of-pocket payments on health compared to the
overall level of per capita consumption. This data shows that while the overall level of payments
is quite modest, at 4 percent, there are significant variations between sub-regions and regions.
For example, Ngazidja excluding the Moroni area has an overall level of 6.1 percent, with very
high levels of 7.5 to 7.9 percent in Kiombani and Tsoudjini. On the other end of the spectrum,
Ndzouani has much lower average per capita payments with an average of 2.3 percent and under
2.0 percent in Ouani.

These trends are also reflected in the incidence of catastrophic expenditure by sub-region, where
the levels of such expenditure are generally higher in Ngazidja, and lower in Ndzouani, as shown
in Figure 5 below. The legend at the bottom shows the different health expenditure thresholds,
ranging from 5 percent (0.05) to 40 percent (0.40). While a range of thresholds are given, the
most common threshold used in the literature for total expenditure is 10 percent. A threshold of
5 percent of total income spent on health affected roughly 45 percent of the households in
Koimbani and close to 40 percent in Mbeni, but just 7.6 percent in Ouani and 8.1 percent in
Mutsamudu. Increasing the threshold results in a proportionately smaller percentage of
households being affected, although the impact still seems to be greater in Ngazidja than
in either Mwali or Ndzouani.

Figure 6 shows the same information but calculates health expenditure as a percentage of non-
food consumption spending. Non-food spending is used because most food related expenditure
is not discretionary, so using non-food spending as the denominator is viewed as providing a
better measure of “capacity to pay”. The same general trends exist, although the proportion of
families spending 5 percent or more in Mwali and Ndzouani are much more similar.

Overall, 55 percent of families allocate 5 percent or more of the non-food consumption
spending on health, with this declining to just over a third at the 10 percent level, almost a
quarter at the 15 percent level and one-tenth at the 25 percent level. Roughly 7 and 3.3
percent of families spend 30 and 40 percent respectively of their non-food budget on
health. At the 40 percent level, there are also some significant differences, with Koimbani having
three times the national average proportion of households spending this level, and between 2 and
3 times the percentage of households in Nioumachoua, Wanani and Hambou allocating this level
or more.

Table 15 shows the poverty impact of health expenditure by sub-region. The first column shows
the poverty headcount including health spending while the second shows the headcount without
such spending. The last column is the percentage change in the overall level of poverty due to
spending on health services. Overall, the poverty headcount is calculated at 36.0 percent with
health spending and 34.3 percent without, for a net impact of 5.0 percent. However, this impact is
not equal across sub-regions.

For example, while the overall level of poverty in Nioumakele is among the highest in the country,
spending for health services barely affects the poverty headcount, and in Domoni there is no
impact. On the other hand, in Hambou and Mitsamihouli health spending boosts the poverty
headcount by close to 12 percent, even though the former has a relatively higher level of
poverty than average and the latter is below the national average.

The analysis now turns from the financial impact to outcomes and utilization. First with respect to
outcomes, Figure 7 shows the infant (IMR) and under-5 (U5MR) mortality by sub-region, based on
the DHS data. This data shows that there are several areas with quite high IMR (over 60 per
1,000 live births) and U5MR (over 80 per 1,000 live births), including Dembeni, Domoni,
Foumbouni and Mbeni.

Several others, such as Sima and Hambou have high U5MR, but lower IMR, suggesting issues
with mortality in the 1-5 year age range. There are several sub-regions that show higher IMR than
U5MR, which is technically not possible, but is likely a function of data issues.

Figure 8 shows the reported incidence of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea for
children under 5 years of age by sub-region. This Figure shows substantially higher incidence of
ARI (10 percent or more) in Domoni and Tsoudjini, with very high incidence (over 18 percent) in
Mutsamudu and Hambou. On the other hand, five sub-regions have an incidence of diarrhea of
over 20 percent (Domoni, Mutsamudu, Ouani, Sima and Bambao), while Hambou and Tsoudjini
have incidence over 25 percent.

Finally on the outcomes side, Figure 9 shows the nutrition outcomes by sub-region, including
moderate and severe stunting, underweight and wasting. With respect to moderate stunting,
higher than average levels are seen in Mutsamudu, Nioumakele, Kiombani, Ouani, and Domoni,
while Kiombani and Mutsamudu and Nioumakele have higher levels of severe stunting. Ndzouani
as a whole has worse nutritional outcomes based on this measure, as well as for underweight.
The results for wasting are more dispersed, with Kiombani, Moroni, Wanani and Mutsamudu
having higher moderate levels, while Wanani, Kiombani, Foumbouni and Moroni having higher
severe levels.

Turning to utilization of services, a number of areas are covered by the DHS. Specific results are
shown below in the areas of the use of antenatal care 13, skilled birth attendance (doctors and
nurses), Vitamin A coverage, and treatment of diarrhea (compared to incidence). Figure 10
shows that the use of antenatal care ranges from a low of less than 30 percent in Ouani to a high
of over 90 percent in Tsoudjini. The national average is 56 percent. Ouani and Mutsamudu are
considerably below the average, while Bambao, Moroni, Dembeni, Foumbouni, and Tsoudjini are
quite a bit above the average.

13Antenatal care is defined as mother aged 15 to 49 who had at least one antenatal care during
pregnancy from any skilled personnel (doctor, nurse/midwife, auxiliary midwife, feldsher, family
nurse or trained birth attendant)

Figure 11, above, shows the coverage of Vitamin A supplementation for pregnant women and for
children by sub-region. It is interesting to note that there is no correlation between the level of
coverage for mothers and for children (correlation coefficient 0.052). The sub-regions of
Fomboni, Ouani, Sima and Dembeni have higher-than average (more than 40 percent) coverage
of mothers, while Fomboni, Hambou, Koimbani and Tsoudjini have higher (more than 60 percent)
coverage of children under 5.

Figure 12 shows the use of skilled birth attendants by sub-region, subdivided into the percentage
of total births delivered by doctors and by nurses. While there is generally limited variability in
overall skilled birth attendant coverage (with the exceptions of Bambao on the high side, and
Nioumachoua, Domoni and Nioumakele on the low side), the variation with respect to the use of
physicians versus nurses is much more pronounced. The sub-regions of Nioumachoua, Wanani,
Nioumakele, Ouani and Sima have a much lower percentage of births attended by doctors, while
Dembeni, Hambou, Kiombani and Mbeni have a higher percentage of doctor-assisted births.

Finally, Figure 13 shows the percentage of cases of diarrhea that are treated within the health
care system. Again, substantial variation exists, with Mitsamihouli, Tsoudjini, Mbeni, Domoni, and
Bambao showing lower use of health services for this condition, while Wanani, Dembeni and
Mutsamudu showing higher use of health services.

The use of some health services is highly correlated with others. For example, high levels of
vaccination coverage is observed in sub-regions that have high levels of antenatal care and

                                               32
skilled birth attendance, and there is also a high level of correlation between ANC and SBA (0.60).
Interestingly, ANC is negatively correlated with Vitamin A coverage for pregnant women,
suggesting that work may be needed in improving the quality of ANC services. There is also no
correlation between ANC coverage and tetanus coverage for pregnant women. On the outcomes
side, there are high negative correlations between most nutrition indicators and both U5MR and
IMR, suggesting that there is a paradox, with sub-regions suffering from highest childhood
undernutrition despite comparatively lowest U5MR and IMR. There is a high positive correlation
between the incidence of diarrhea and the incidence of ARI.

Looking at the relationships between utilization and outcome variables, sub-regions that
had high rates of ANC tended to have lower levels of moderate and severe stunting and
moderate underweight, and those that had higher overall rates of skilled birth attendance
had lower rates of moderate stunting and underweight. Similarly, sub-regions with higher
use of insecticide treated bed-nets (ITN) fared better in all of the nutrition-related
indicators, and those that had increased coverage of Vitamin A for children also had lower
rates of moderate and severe underweight and wasting. Finally, sub-regions with higher
levels of immunization coverage had lower rates of ARI and diarrhea.

The next area to be examined is the expenditure data contained in the latest National Health
Accounts (NHA).

                           NATIONAL AND SUB-REGIONAL NHA RESULTS


The majority of total health expenditure is private. Most of the public funds (84 percent) are
directed toward salaries and benefits, while most private and donor funds go towards non-salary
expenses such as purchase of services and/or drugs. There is a significant variation in the
allocation of public funds across sub-region. Those where the funding primarily goes to health
posts and health centers tend to have lower funding, while those with hospitals tend to have
higher funding. In terms of relationships between poverty headcount and health expenditure
variables, we saw a high positive relationship between poverty and the percent of donor funding,
suggesting that donor funding may be well targeted to poorer areas. On the other hand, the
percent of public spending tends to be lower in areas with higher poverty headcount, both total
and non-salary, implying that there may be room for better targeting of public spending.

The National Health Accounts data represents a rich source of information for expenditure
patterns across a number of dimensions. As shown in Figure 14, one dimension is the source of
financing, which shows that the vast majority of total health expenditure is private (68
percent) with just 31 percent coming from the public sector and one percent from donors.

                          Source: National Health Accounts (NHA) 2011


Drilling down further to the nature of expenditure financed through each source, Figure 15 shows
that most of the public funds (84 percent) are directed toward salaries and benefits, while most
private and donor funds go towards non-salary expenses. Overall, about one third of total
expenses are for salaries and two-thirds are for non-salary items




Source: National Health Accounts (NHA) 2011

Finally, Figure 16 looks at the national composition of non-salary expenses. The categorization by
type required a detailed examination of the individual expenditure descriptions (403 in all) in order
to assign each expenditure to one of eight spending types. In future iterations of the NHA, it
would be useful to utilize standard expenditure classifications to ensure consistency.


                                                 34
More than half of the non-salary expenditure (57 percent) is for the purchase of services and/or
drugs, primarily from the private sector and primarily directly by households. Direct purchase of
medications is the next largest type of expenditure, accounting for 12 percent of total non-salary
spending. Aside from “other” expenditure, grants and capital are the next largest at 6 percent
each. Grants are only made from public funds, while the bulk of capital spending is in the private
sector (about 81 percent of the total), with 5 percent coming from donations and 14 percent from
the public sector. Other types of spending account for relatively minor shares of the total.
Looking at the breakdown by the type of funding, different patterns emerge. Donor funds show a
higher proportion going to capital items and medications and a lower proportion going to health
services and drugs. On the other hand public funds go mostly to grants and capital items, while
private funds more closely mirror the overall total.




Source: National Health Accounts (NHA) 2011


Turning to the sub-regional data, the NHA database shows significant variation in the
allocation of funds across sub-regions. Figure 17 shows the per capita (KMF) funding by
source and Figure 18 shows the per capita funding by the nature of expenditure. The population
figures were calculated based on the sum of the household weightings in the Household Budget
Survey for each sub-region. These figures show very large variations both across sub-regions
and also across regions. For example, the Moroni area of Ngazidja receives over KMF 20,000 in
total health funding per capita, about two-thirds of which are private. On the other hand, the rest
of Ngazidja gets only KMF 1,305 per capita, virtually all of which is private. Grants (donations)
are concentrated in just five sub-regions (Fomboni and Nioumachoua in Mwali, and
Mutsamudu, Nioumakele and Ouani in Ndzouani). Together these account for 95 percent
of the total grants reported.

Figure 18 shows similar variations for the nature of expenditure, with some sub-regions, such as
Moroni, Dembeni, Sima and Nioumachoua showing a much smaller proportion of salary related
expenses. Figure 19 provides some clues to the reasons behind this funding allocation by
showing the allocation of funding by type of structure that received the funds. Sub-regions
where the funding primarily goes to health posts and health centers tend to have lower
funding, while those with hospitals tend to have higher funding.

                                        STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

This section looks at some of the statistical relationships inherent in these datasets. Simple
correlations were calculated looking primarily at the relationship between poverty and other
variables at the sub-region level, but also measures of consumption and relationships between
utilization and outcome variables and between health expenditure and other variables.

In terms of the relationship between poverty and the use of health services, there were high
negative correlations (< -0.30) with delivery by a physician and overall levels of assisted delivery (-
0.553 and -0.584 respectively), as well as Polio-3 immunization (-0.396) and treatment of acute
respiratory infections (-0.423). These relationships suggest that the poor are facing real
financial barriers to accessing health services. There is an unexplained positive relationship
between the poverty headcount and tetanus immunization status for pregnant women (0.690).

In terms of poverty and outcome variables, the highest negative correlations were with infant
mortality (-0.332) and severe underweight (-0.323).

Turning to the relationships between poverty headcount and health expenditure variables
from the NHA, we see a high positive relationship between poverty and the percentage of

                                                  37
donor funding (0.444), suggesting that donor funding may be well targeted to poorer areas.
On the other hand, the percentage of public spending tends to be lower in areas with
higher poverty headcount, both total (-0.319) and non-salary (-0.358), suggesting there may
be room for better targeting of public spending.

Looking at the relationship between out-of-pocket spending on health and other sources of health
spending, the data suggests a negative relationship between donor and household spending (-
0.390), as well as with overall levels of non-salary and total health spending (-0.424 and -0.613
respectively). This suggests that out-of-pocket spending increases in the absence of other
sources of funding, either from the government or from donors.


                               ANALYSIS OF “POCKETS OF POVERTY”

The following five sub-regions with the highest level of poverty headcount (more than 50%) and
common characteristics were identified: (i) Mbeni (Ngazidja); (ii) Sima (Ndzouani); (iii) Nioumakele
(Ndzouani); (iv) Wanani (Mwali); and (v) Nioumachoua (Mwali). However, the impoverishing effect
of health payments is less in the poorer sub-regions. This is reflective of the much lower average
health spending and may reflect care being forgone in the poorer regions due to lack of available
funding.

While the statistical analysis showed some correlations between poverty levels and other
variables, this section examines the sub-regions with the highest level of poverty as a group, to
determine if they have any common characteristics. As shown in Figure 21 through 24 below, this
appears to be the case with respect to many of the variables included in this analysis. In each

                                                38
case, the bar represents the percentage difference between the average value for the 5 poorest
sub-regions and the average value for the remaining 12 sub-regions for that particular indicator.
For example, as shown in Figure 20, while it is expected that the overall level of consumption and
health spending in the poorer sub-regions would be less than in the richer ones, it is interesting to
note that the poorest sub-regions spend 15 percent less of their income on health compared to
the richer regions. Similarly, while as expected the average poverty headcount is more than
double that of the remaining sub-regions and the headcount net of health payments is even higher
(115 percent), the impoverishing effect of health payments is actually less in the poorer
sub-regions: 2.7 percent increase in poverty on average, compared to a 7.1 percent
increase in the other sub-regions. This is reflective of the much lower average health spending
and may reflect care being forgone in the poorer regions due to lack of available funding. This
issue may need to be explored further.

With regard to catastrophic health spending, however, a higher proportion of households in poorer
sub-regions (16 percent) spend 40 percent or more on health than those in richer sub-regions.
Over 40 percent of the households in poorer regions allocate more than 30 or 40 percent of their
total spending on health related issues.

Turning to the utilization of health services (Figure 21), the poorer sub-regions have 60 percent
fewer doctor assisted deliveries but slightly higher levels of nurse assisted deliveries, with the
result that the overall level of professionally assisted deliveries in these sub-regions is around 11
percent less than in the richer regions. There do not seem to be significant differences in the
utilization of immunization services, although there does appear to be some issues with respect to
follow-up. Both polio-3 and DPT-3 coverage seem to be less in the poorer sub-regions. ITN

                                                 39
usage is also almost 13 percent lower in the poorer sub-regions compared to the richer ones,
suggesting that some better targeting is needed. The level of treatment for ARI is quite a bit lower
(64.5 percent) in the poorer sub-regions, compared to the reported incidence (44 percent lower).
This also suggests some possible access issues in these sub-regions. Similarly, access to
vitamin A for children is much lower (21 percent less), although vitamin A coverage for pregnant
women is not much different between the two groups.




Source: Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2012

In terms of outcomes (Figure 22), stunting, wasting and underweight rates are all higher for the
poorer sub-regions, although the percentage of severe stunting is fairly similar and the percentage
of severe underweight is actually 20 percent less in the richer sub-regions. Infant and child
mortality are also lower in the poorer sub-regions, which might bear further examination.

Looking at sub-region level spending (Figure 23), the proportion of total spending by
source seems to suggest that donor funds are targeted to poorer sub-regions, but other
types of funds, especially public funds are more concentrated in richer sub-regions. In
terms of spending per capita, there is approximately 3.5 times the donor funds going to poorer
sub-regions compared to the richer ones, but the richer ones, on average, get almost 15 times the
level of public spending compared to the poorer ones. In this regard, private spending is more
equitable, since the per capita private spend in the poorer sub-regions is around 6 times that in
the richer ones. These issues clearly need further investigation.




Source: National Health Accounts (NHA) 2011

Related data on the funding by type of structure shows that the poorer sub-regions have a
significantly higher proportion of funds going to health centers and health posts, and a much lower


                                                41
proportion going to medical offices and vendors. The five poorest sub-regions have no spending
at all for hospitals, lab, pharmacy and financial institutions.

Finally, as shown in Figure 24, a review of the household characteristics in the poorer sub-regions
shows no major differences in the proportion of total expenditures on food, household size, or the
age and gender of the household head. They are more predominantly rural, however.

                             PART IV – CONCLUSIONS

    EFFECT OF OUT-OF-POCKET PAYMENTS ON HOUSEHOLD FINANCIAL WELL-BEING


Better-off households spend more on health. Households in urban areas, non-poor households,
and households headed by males and by those 55 years old or older spend more on health.
However, in terms of proportion, the rural and poor households have higher health spending in
relation to their gross consumption. There are significant variations between sub-regions and
regions where Ngazidja has a higher average level of per capita out-of-pocket payments on health
compared to the overall level of per capita consumption.

Catastrophic expenditures are found to be highly concentrated among the richest, but are more
common among the poor at the highest threshold of 40 percent when using either the total
household or non-food measure. Koimbani and Hambou sub-regions in Ngazidja, Nioumachoua
and Wanani sub-region in Mwali have two to three times the national average proportion of
households allocating 40 percent of the nonfood consumption spending on health. The incidence
of catastrophic payments increases with income but lower quintile have a higher incidence of
catastrophic payments exceeding the threshold of 40 percent in relation to both total household
expenditure and nonfood consumption. The level of incidence of catastrophic payments is
generally higher in Ngazidja, and lower in Ndzouani.

Health spending contributes to impoverishment. Out of pocket payments for health care
affect 1.7 percent of the population. About 12,826 people a year are brought into poverty
due to poor health. In other words, on average, 35 Comorians fall into poverty daily
because of catastrophic health payments. Many already poor households are experiencing a
deepening of poverty as a result of their health expenses, particularly among the households in
the third and lower half of quintiles. Out-of-pocket payments are responsible for an increase in the
incidence of poverty, and a deepening of poverty among the already poor. Put another way, if out-
of-pocket spending on health had been eliminated and Comorians households had spent the
money on things directly contributing to their welfare, poverty in Comoros would have fallen.

There is a significant variations of poverty level, per capita OOP payments on health and
incidence of catastrophic expenditure between sub-regions and regions. Nioumakele sub region
has the highest level of poverty in the country with spending for health care barely affecting the
poverty headcount. Ndzouani has much lower average per capita payments and Ngazidja has the
highest incidence of catastrophic expenditure. In Hambou and Mitsamihouli sub-regions in
Ngazidja, health spending increases the poverty headcount despite a relatively different levels of
poverty.



   PROGRESSIVITY OR REGRESSIVITY OF HEALTH FINANCING THROUGH OUT-OF-POCKET PAYMENTS


Overall, health care financing through OOP in Comoros is progressive, implying that such
expenditure is more concentrated among the better-off. Put differently, a poor household
contributes a smaller share of its resources on health care OOP than a rich one. Rich households
might contribute relatively more to financing government public expenditure through a progressive
tax system. However, the average budget share of OOP health payments compared to gross per
capita consumption are regressive over the first three quintiles, meaning that OOP spending is
absorbing a larger share of the resources of poor individuals than of the rich.

                   CONCENTRATION OF ILL HEALTH AMONG THE POOR OR THE RICH


Overall, households living in rural areas and in the lower quintile have higher prevalence of health
problems than those living in urban areas and in the richest quintiles. Health problems decrease
with income, except the ARI which is more prevalent among the richest quintiles and the
incidence is higher in Ndzouani-Domoni, Ndzouani-Mutsamudu, Ngazidja-Tsoudjini, and Ngazidja-
Hambou. Ill health and U5MR is concentrated among the poor in Comoros. U1MR and U5MR are
quite high in the Ngazidja sub-regions of Dembeni, Foumbouni, and Mbeni, and in Ndzouani
Domoni sub-region. Sima sub-region in Ndzouani and Hambou sub-region in Ngazidja have
issues with 1-5 year age mortality (U5MR high but low U1MR). The incidence of diarrhea is over
20 percent in seven sub-regions: Ndzouani sub-regions of Domoni, Mutsamudu, Ouani and Sima;
and the Ngazidja sub-regions of Hambou, Bambao and Tsoudjini. First quintiles have a higher
average prevalence of nutrition related conditions such as stunting, underweight and particularly
wasting. Higher than average levels of moderate stunting and underweight are seen in Ndzouani
sub-regions (Domoni, Mutsamudu, Nioumakele, Ouani, and Sima) and in Kiombani and Moroni
sub-regions of Ngazidja. However, there is almost no inequality between lowest and richest
quintiles for birthweight and U1MR.



                                INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH UTILIZATION


The utilization of health care in Comoros is concentrated among the better-off, increasing the
poor’s risk for ill health. Most MCH interventions have significant and positive concentration
indices, signifying that utilization of any MCH interventions is higher among the better-off.
Antenatal care is considerably below the average in Ndzouani sub-regions of Ouani and
Mutsamudu. To tackle these inequalities in health utilization, an analysis of the causes of lower
utilization of health care services among the first quintiles should be undertaken.

There is a higher utilization of health care by richer households implying that health care services
are more pro-rich, except for the tetanus vaccine for pregnant women which is pro-poor.
Utilization of delivery services provided by doctors is higher among the rich and higher in the
Ngazidja sub-regions of Dembeni, Hambou, Kiombani and Mbeni. The sub-regions of Mwali-
Nioumachoua, Ndzouani-Domoni and Nioumakele have the lowest skilled birth attendant
coverage. Coverage of Vitamin A supplementation for children under 5 is higher in the Mwali sub-
region of Fomboni and in the Ngazidja sub-regions of Hambou, Koimbani and Tsoudjini. There is
very little association between the use of essential maternal health (Antenatal care with skilled
health providers, delivery with nurse, tetanus vaccine and Vitamin A supplementation) and
diarrhea treatment for children. However, substantial variation exists in the percentage of cases of
diarrhea that are treated within the health care system. Lower use of this service is shown in the
Ngazidja sub-regions of Mitsamihouli, Tsoudjini, Mbeni and Bambao and in the Ndzouani sub-
region of Domoni.

There are high levels of vaccination coverage observed in sub-regions with high coverage of ANC
and SBA. However, low vitamin A supplementation for pregnant women is observed in sub-
regions with high levels of ANC, implying that quality of ANC services needs to be improved. The
relationship between utilization and outcome variables is interesting as the nutritional status has a
negative correlation with ANC, SBA ITN use, and Vitamin A supplementation for children. This
implies that higher use of these services tends to show lower levels of nutrition-related indicators.
Similarly, sub-regions with higher levels of vaccination coverage have lower rates of ARI and
diarrhea.


                                                 44
                             SOURCES OF HEALTH SYSTEM FINANCING


The vast majority of health system financing is private. Most of the public sources are directed
toward salaries and benefits, while the private and donor funds support non-salary expenses.
More than half of the non-salary expenditure is directed toward the purchase of services and/or
drugs, from the private sector and directly by households. Allocation of funds per capita across
sub-regions shows significant variation. Ngazidja Moroni receives higher funds per capita
(KMF20,000) and the rest of the sub-region a smaller amount (KMF1,305). However, donor
funding targets poorer areas especially sub-regions with higher levels of poverty headcount. In the
contrary, public spending tends to be lower in sub-regions with higher poverty headcount. The
relationship between out-of-pocket spending on health and other sources of health spending
shows that out-of-pocket spending increases where other sources of funding are lacking.

Relationships between poverty and the use of health services suggest that the poor are facing
financial barriers to accessing health services.

                        PART V – POLICY IMPLICATIONS

This analysis suggests that within Comoros there are significant variations in the level of spending
on health, as well as in health utilization and outcomes. The data shows that some of these
variations seem to be related to a greater or lesser extent to the level of poverty within the specific
geographic area.

These “pockets of poverty” appear to have generally lower utilization of health services, poorer
health outcomes in some areas (although not on aggregate measures which bears further
analysis), and lower levels of health spending, especially from the public sector.

In this context, targeted subsidies towards the poorest to increase their access while containing
the welfare impact of OOP payments would be a possible option. This would help to address
possible “demand side” constraints. Other policy options may include better targeting of
government funding for health or of health infrastructure to improve the “supply side”.

All of this suggests that mechanisms need to be developed which address these various issues.
Better information on the availability of government resources in these “pockets of poverty” would
also be needed. This will be the subject of further analysis in the coming year.

To allow for more granular Benefit Incidence Analysis and an in depth analysis of the progressivity
of health financing, simple amendments to the health module of future consumption survey
questionnaires would be highly recommended.

                                   Annex 1 – Methodology
The following databases were included in the analysis:

a) Household Budget/Consumption Survey (HBS) Analysis – The HBS was done in 2014 and
the dataset consists of detailed expenditure data by category (10 categories, with 1 for health), for
a random sample of 3,131 households. The sampling frames included weights which allowed the
results by sub-region to be generalized to the overall population of Comoros. Expenditure data
was also adjusted based on regional cost of living factors, and poverty status was based on the
average cost-of-living adjusted expenditures per household member. Wealth quintiles were
calculated based on this per capita consumption, ordering the per capita consumption from lowest
to highest and allocating 20 percent of the households to each quintile. In addition to the
expenditure data, this dataset included the age and gender of the household head, the family size,
and whether the household was in an urban versus rural area.

With micro-data from this survey, health-related expenditures were analyzed. The data was also
aggregated by income quintile, and the impact of health expenditures on poverty status was
analyzed. The geographic coding inherent in the dataset allowed the identification of "pockets of
poverty" on a geographical basis. The data included in the HBS was limited, and did not include
either utilization or unit cost information. As such, it was not possible to conduct a formal Benefit-
Incidence Analysis, which could have proved to be very useful.

b) Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) Analysis – The Comoros DHS was last done in
2012 and consists of data for 3,592 households, with specific data on a variety of household
variables, utilization of health services, health and nutrition status and various other variables
related to special topics such as HIV/AIDS, gender-based violence. The wealth quintile measure
was constructed using the standard DHS-Measure methodology14. Thus while the quintiles used
in the DHS and HBS datasets are not the same, it is highly likely that that there would be high
degree of overlap between the two measures. Also, while the two surveys do not cover the same
time period, they were done just two years apart, and it is unlikely that there would have been
extensive changes in the underlying conditions over the intervening period.

With the micro-DHS data, similar analysis with respect to the use of health services and health
conditions (nutrition, diseases, etc.) by quintiles and geographic area was developed. This helped
to highlight areas where access to basic services and health outcomes were problematic.

c) Analysis of the National Health Accounts (NHA) – The NHA database consists of 784
expenditure records, including both public, private and donor funds. Data is also broken down
into the broad category of expenditure (salary and non-salary), and then further disaggregated by
a specific expenditure type. Unfortunately, these types are not consistently used, so the grouping
of expenditures within the larger salary and non-salary grouping was not a trivial exercise, since
there were 427 different expenditure descriptions that were used (for example, “vente de
medicaments”, and “vente des medicaments”), and these had to be manually allocated to a
particular expenditure grouping.

The database therefore offers a rich source of information to analyze revenues and expenses by
source and type. Different types of analysis were performed, including by looking at the profiles of
similar expenses in different geographic areas (for example, the "pockets of poverty" areas versus
others). The results were also compared with the results of the (a) and (b) above, to see if any
similarities trends emerge among the various data sources. The potential substitution between
public and private services were also considered.

d) Analysis National Health Information System (NHIS) – data from the NHIS database was
not made available in electronic format during the course of the project, so could not be included
in the analysis. This represented a major constraint to the resulting analysis, since much of the
background data on the number of facilities and staff in different sub-regions was not available.

The steps of the analysis were as follows:

         (a)      Get databases - HBS, DHS, NHA - in electronic format;
         (b)      Determine the lowest geographical divisions of each database, and arrive at the
                  lowest common division;
         (c)      Make the connections between divisions for each common database;
         (d)      analysis of HBS and identify geographic pockets of poverty;
         (e)      DHS analysis and NHA (individual and structural respectively), and NHIS in terms
                  of poverty pockets;
          (f)     Analyze the common factors between the pockets of poverty;
         (g)      To the extent possible, map of all relevant data;
         (h)      Identify conclusions and recommendations, with particular emphasis on their
                  implications for UHC;
          (i)     Hold an internal review of the World Bank to ensure quality control of the
                  analysis;
          (j)     Hold a validation workshop with key stakeholders from the government and the
                  technical and financial partners;
         (k)      Finalize the analysis report with the findings of steps (i) and (j), and send to the
                  Ministry of Health;
          (l)     Complete documentation of the process of this analysis for replication in other
                  countries.

This report analyzes the available data to determine if there are systemic differences in the access to and
funding of health services in different sub-regions of Comoros, and to link these to variations in the
socioeconomic status of residents in these sub-regions. It focuses on a number of key questions that are
analyzed at the sub-national level, including: the effect of out-of-pocket payments on household financial well-
being; whether out-of-pocket payments for health are progressive or regressive; whether ill health is more
concentrated among the poor; whether the poor use health services less than the rich; and the major sources
of financing for the health system in Comoros. It introduces a specific analysis of “pockets of poverty” – the five
sub-regions with the highest level of poverty headcount (more than 50%) – comparing their characteristics to
those of the remaining sub-regions. These “pockets of poverty” appear to have generally lower utilization of
health services, poorer health outcomes in some areas (although not on aggregate measures which bears
further analysis), and lower levels of health spending, especially from the public sector. Aside from the
conclusions and potential policy implications for Comoros, it may be useful to apply this type of analysis in
other countries.
