THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        The Architect and Civil Engineer applies for the building permit online
        by completing an application form and uploading all necessary
        drawing, reports and documents. MEPA issues a tracking number for
        the application to both the applicant and the Architect and Civil
        Engineer. Proof of ownership is not required for a building permit. The
        applicant must however declare that he/she is the owner of the site, or
        confirm that he/she has the approval of the owner to submit the              21 days             EUR 50

      Receive and respond to the screening letter

      MEPA will issue the screening letter to the architect and the applicant.
      The screening letter is important as it provides information on several
      aspects:
      - What additional information, if any, is needed for the application
      besides that already submitted in Procedure 1
      - Which entities MEPA will consult with – for a warehouse, MEPA will
      typically consult with the Civil Protection Department, Transport Malta,
      the National Commission for Persons with Disability, Enemalta, and the
      Sanitary Engineering Office
      - Issues that may arise during the processing of the application such as
      policies that are not being followed by the proposal, etc
3     - The fee to be paid for the processing of the application                   30 days      EUR 19,695
      - Any additional reports required, such as fire safety report, ventilation
      report, accessibility report, etc.

      The architect must respond to the screening letter within a maximum of
      3 months (could be as soon as a day later if all the information is
      available), and the applicant must also pay the necessary fee at the
      same time. Once all the submissions required by the screening letter
      are submitted, the application proceeds to Full Processing.


      Agency: Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA)



      Obtain a Permit Application Report (DPAR), attend hearing in
      front of the Environmental Planning Commission (EPC) and receive
      building permit

      Once the full application is submitted, MEPA publishes a notice in the
      local newspaper and on its website, informs the relevant local council
      and neighbors of the site, and affixes a notice on the site. This is done
      so that the public is informed that an application has been received,
      and the public may comment within 21 days from publication in the
      newspaper. Persons doing so will be recognised as interested parties
      during the processing of the application.

      The DPAR includes the Case Officer's assessment of the application,
      and concludes with his/her recommendation as to whether the
4     application should be approved or not. If the recommendation is              28 days       no charge
      favorable, a draft building permit with conditions is attached to the
      DPAR. The DPAR also specifies the bank guarantees that may be
      required to obtain the permit, such as for the protection of the
      surrounding road surface, archaeological or environmentall sentive site,
      etc.

      The DPAR notice gives the date for the hearing in front of the EPC
      (Environmental Planning Commission) which cannot be held later than
      90 days after the submission of the application but is usually held 30
      days after.

      There are two EPCs (Environment Planning Commission) - one deals
      with projects in Urban Conservation Areas and Outside Development
      Zone, while the other deals with projects which are in scheme. (For

      large projects, the application is reviewed by the main MEPA Board).
      The EPC reviews the application in a public hearing, which is attended
      by the applicant and the Architect and Civil Engineer responsible for
      the application. The EPC may request changes to the project, and the
      applicant is given an additional 4 weeks in which to submit such
      changes for final determination by the EPC. If no changes are
      requested, the physical permit is issued on the spot. The permit is valid
      for 5 years.

      on the site while works are ongoing, and a commencement notice
      which is to be submitted to MEPA not less than 5 days before
      commencement of works. The commencement notice requires details
      of the contractor and site manager (including 24-hour contact details)
6     who will be engaged on the site. When submitting the commencement            1 day        no charge
      notice, the Architect and Civil Engineer can indicate whether MEPA is
      required to provide official alignment on site or not. If yes, MEPA will
      provide this within 10 days.

      Hire an agency specialized in safety

      A specialized agency in health and safety is generally hired to be in
      charge of safety issues to ensure that everything is done according to
      regulations on the construction site. The reason for this is that the legal
      responsibility lies with the owner and the contractor in case of an
8     accident. The state will initiate a lawsuit against both if there is some      1 day        EUR 1,500

      the risk of accidents or non-observance of legislation on site.

GETTING ELECTRICITY
What are the details?
The indicators reported here for Malta are based on a set
                                                                    OBTAINING AN ELECTRICITY CONNECTION

must complete to get a warehouse connected to
electricity by the local distribution utility—identified by          Name of utility:              Enemalta Corporation
Doing Business. Data are collected from the distribution
utility, then completed and verified by electricity
                                                                     City:                         Valletta

        * Enemalta inspects the site with the client

        Enemalta meets with the client or his engineer on the site to determine
        exactly the cable route from the closest suitable source. This route must
        pass through public rights of way, which in Malta are almost exclusively
        public roads. The route distance given by the client may differ from the
        final determination, because (1) either short cuts through undeveloped
        land or third party property are chosen by the client, (2) the source,
        effectively the transformer chosen by the client may not be suitable as it
        may be a dedicated transformer or a fully loaded one, or (3) the location
        on the client property of the connection point (usually meter/switch           14 calendar days        EUR 0
   2
        room) is unsuitable.
        Once the route is determined the client discusses with Enemalta on the
        actual load required and future business plans. In the case study, as the
        required load is at the threshold between LV and MV connection in
        Malta, a client is likely to choose to install a substation to have a security
        in case the power load of the warehouse increases.
        Once the basic parameters are finalized a formal quotation is prepared.
        This includes permitting, trenching and road re-instatement for the cable
        route. These may also be carried out directly by the client to Enemalta’s
        specifications but most of the time for the connection of a small
        warehouse Enemalta is in charge of the trenching and subcontracts it.

      Agency: Enemalta Corporation




      The clients receives and signs the quote and Enemalta carry out the
      external connection works

      Before the works starts Enemalta needs to obtain a trenching permit and
      find a contractor to carry out the works. The agency delivering the
      trenching permit is Transport Malta who consults with all involved
      stakeholders including MEPA, heritage, local councils, various roads
      departments, all utility companies including telecom, preparation and
      approval of work plan, traffic management plan etc. The contractor has
      to be engaged following a ‘call off’ procedure (similar to a restricted
      tender) amongst the contractors authorised to carry out such works.
      In most cases Enemalta provides the transformer. The client has the
      option to purchase it through private company, in which case Enemalta
      gives the specifications of the required transformer.
       There are various contractual forms for the property of the transformer.
      If the transformer is to remain dedicated to the client, Enemalta only
      requires a title permitting access and use. It is not necessary to transfer 90 calendar days     EUR 69,100
3
      the property of the transformer. In the case of a substation which is
      shared between the client and Enemalta (for general use) then Enemalta
      requires title on the property and there is a legal mechanism establishing
      the costs.

      Fast track procedures are also available. There is a formal procedure
      through Malta Enterprise (which has recently been repackaged as
      ‘Business First’) and an ad hoc procedure where the client explains and
      justifies the urgency and Enemalta takes whatever steps are possible to
      accelerate the process from their side. This may be used both at quote
      stage and for execution of works and may involve carrying out works on
      overtime and week-ends to shorten the total duration.

      * MEPA inspects the premises of the warehouse to deliver the
      compliance certificate

      The compliance certificate is necessary to apply for electricity.
      The architect applies for a compliance certificate to MEPA. It is just a
4     declaration by the architect. The form can be downloaded online but it      28 calendar days       EUR 60
      has to submit it on paper because it is a legal declaration from the
      architect.
      The compliance certificate is only required for the formal application with
      ARMS. An inspector from MEPA comes to inspect the finished building in
      50% of the cases.

        Agency: MEPA




        The client sends a formal application to ARMS and Enemalta comes
        to install the meter and do the final connection.

        A formal form needs to be filled and can be submitted to ARMS during
        the external connection works. ARMS Ltd is a private limited liability
        company, set up as a joint venture between the Enemalta Corporation
        and the Water Services Corporation. ARMS is in charge of the billing of
        electricity.

        The form to request a new electrical connection is available online. It is
        filled by the electrical engineer of the client and submits on paper to
        ARMS. The engineer responsible of the internal wiring has to certify that
        it has been done according to standards. Enemalta sometimes does an
        inspection of the internal wiring but it is occasionally.

        The electricians are licensed by Malta Resources Authority (MRA). MRA is
        the regulator for water, electricity and oil exploration and falls under the
        Ministry of Resources and rural affairs.
        The MRA regulates electricity tariffs

        The documents required for the new connection are:
   5                                                                                   11 calendar days      EUR 900
        A copy of the front elevation and the site plan signed by the architect as
        well as a photo of the façade
        A copy of the client electrician’s license
        The compliance certificate from MEPA
        A copy of identification as well as the company resolution authorizing
        the applicant to apply on behalf of the company
        A document proving ownership of the premise or a guarantee deposit of
        €466 will be required.

        Enemalta installs the meter once the formal application is processed by
        ARMs and a notification sent by ARMs to Enemalta through the
        integrated back office software used by Enemalta and ARMs and WSC.
        Once work is completed, a completion notification is sent by Enemalta to
        ARMs in the same way through the integrated system.
        Smart meters are being installed in Malta. The objective is to have a full
        coverage of the country by mid 2013.

       Notary orders a search of title at Land Registry

       It is in this transitory time between signing of promise of sale and the
       final contract that the Notary is engaged with all necessary verifications
       and preparations that will in turn enable the final contract to be made.
       The Notary orders searches to ascertain that the Seller has good title and
       can proceed with the sale without being impeded by legal niceties. The
       Notary conducts a search at Land Registry by submitting an application
       (Form E) with a Land Registry plan of the property being transferred to
       verify if the property is in a registration area or not (since not all             10 days
       properties are in a registration area). If the property is in a registration   (simultaneous          EUR 4.66

       area, the land registry informs the Notary whether the property is
                                                                                     with Procedure 3)
       registered or not. If registered, the Land Registry notifies the Notary and
       issues a Certificate of Title with details on whom the property is
       registered and other details ancillary thereto (such as for e.g. contract
       details, if property is freehold or not etc..) The Land Registry will give an
       official search result within 8 working days from the date the request was
       submitted.
