percent as a share of the total population between
now and 2040, with an even sharper decline in
terms of absolute numbers from just under 49
million to around 40.5 million people. In terms
of population share, the forecasted decline in
working age population is higher in Thailand
than any developing EAP country in the period
(even higher than China).

         The other notable feature which Thailand
shares with a number of its developing Asian
neighbors is that it is aging rapidly at a relatively
low level of GDP per capita. While Thailand is a
solidly upper middle income country, compared
to rich East Asian countries and those of the
OECD, it is aging at a much lower income level,
suggesting that fiscal and administrative capacity
to address aging is likely to be constrained.

         The speed of demographic transition in
Thailand poses new challenges for policymakers,
employers and citizens, but also opportunities.
Aging will require policy action and behavioral
change in a number of areas. In labor markets,
the challenge is to mitigate the structural decline
in working age population and to enhance labor
productivity of the shrinking labor force. In fiscal
terms, the biggest risk will be pension spending,
but there are significant challenges also for
healthcare and aged/long-term care systems to
ensure affordable care for all in a sustainable
manner in a context of rapid aging. At the same
time, aging offers expanded opportunities for
Thailand as a provider of services to the growing
elderly population across the region.

 There are four main indicators including:
1) Public debt to GDP ratio (<60 percent); 2) Debt service to total annual budget (<15 percent); 3) Budgetary balance
(within FY2017); and 4) Capital investment budget to total budget (at least 25 percent). There is also the Public Debt
Management Act of 2005 (amended 2008) which allows the government to only borrow up to 20 percent of its annual
budget plus 80 percent of principal debt repayments. However, in times of emergencies such as during the great floods of
2011, the Cabinet can issue Emergency Decrees for additional borrowing in amounts that exceed those stipulated in the
PDMO Act.

      Thailand has made impressive
progress in reducing poverty over the past
two decades. Extreme poverty as measured by
the international extreme poverty line (US$1.90
per day, 2011 PPP) is no longer a concern for
Thailand as a whole, falling from a rate of 14.3
percent in 1988 to 0.04 percent in 2013. Based on
the national poverty line (in 2013, approximately
US$6.20 per day 2011 PPP), the poverty rate
fell from 67.4 percent in 1986 to 10.9 percent in
2013, with 26.6 million Thai people moving out
of poverty (Figure 11).

       However, poverty and vulnerability                 GNI per capita index, Atlas Method (2006 = 100)
continue to pose significant challenges,
with pockets of poverty remain in lagging
regions, such as the Northeast, North, and
Deep South. As of 2013, 7.3 million Thais were
still living in poverty, measured by the national
poverty line (at about US$6.20 in 2011 PPP).
Moreover, an additional 6.7 million, or 14 million
in total, were living within 20 percent above the
national poverty line and remained vulnerable to
falling back into poverty. Over 70% of the poor
people (or 5.2 million out of the total 7.3 million
in Thailand) lived in the Northeast and North
regions, which have the highest share of poor
relative to the total population living in each
region as well as the highest number of poor. The
share of Thailand’s poor living in the Northeast
and North increased from 61 percent in 1986 to
71 percent in 2013, despite the fact that the total
population living in these two regions declined
from 55 percent to 45 percent. Among the top

        While the inequality have declined
at the national level, gaps within the urban
areas widened and those within the two
leading regions (Bangkok and central)
increased in relative terms. The decline of
total inequality is mainly due to the decline of
inequality within provinces in rural areas and
that between urban and rural. Measured by Theil
index, the level of inequality within urban area has
not changed much over time; its share increased
from 35% in 1986 to 53% in 2013. The inequality

                                                     1996. This is likely to be related to the sharp
                                                     increase in agriculture price, which was partly

the share of working-age adults and of employed

factor explaining the large decreases in poverty
during the period 2000-2012 was the rapidly
increasing agricultural prices. While overall
poverty rates remained roughly constant in 2014,
there are clear signs that regional poverty have
risen, especially in the areas of Thailand where
large proportions of households are farmers.
For instance, rates in the South where most of
Thailand’s rubber is produced rose. Most likely,
poverty rates will edge upwards in 2015 and
2016, especially in the South where nearly 60
percent of average household income comes
from farming, Moreover, household debt can be
expected to increase further as well, as farmers
seek to cushion the fall in incomes.

       Looking ahead, rubber and rice
prices are projected to start increasing in
2017 but only at a very gradual pace. As
such, farm incomes is likely to remain subdued
for several years to come, and will not be the
driving force in reducing poverty further. For
poverty to reduce further, more productive and
better paying jobs are needed, both within the

         unprecedented pace. As of 2016, around 11                        has been the steep decline in fertility rates,
         percent of the Thai population, or almost seven                  with the total fertility rate per woman falling
         and a half million people, are 65 years old or                   from around 6.1 in 1965 to only 1.5 in 2015 as
         older, up from only 5 percent as recently as 1995.               a result of rising income and educational levels
         By 2040, there is projected to be 17 million Thais               and the successful National Family Planning
         65 years and older, accounting for more than a                   Program launched in 1970. In the same period,
         quarter of the population.5 The speed of aging is                life expectancy rose from just under 62 years
         among the fastest seen globally to date. Together                old to almost 74.7 years (World Development
         with China, Thailand already has the highest                     Indicators). Both indicators can be considered

         way, the elderly dependency ratio in Thailand                            An important consequence of these
         (the percentage of people 65+ relative to the                    trends is the expected decline in working age
         working age population) is expected to almost                    population. Using the standard ILO definition

           There have been increasing efforts to refine this traditional measure of the elderly dependency ratio to take better account
         of increases in life expectancy and healthy years of life expectancy, as well as observed labor force participation rates among
         the elderly, particularly in developing countries. See World Bank (op. cit.) for details.

       The other notable feature which
Thailand shares with a number of its
developing Asian neighbors is that it is
aging rapidly at a relatively low level of
GDP per capita. While Thailand is a solidly
upper middle income country, compared to rich
East Asian countries and those of the OECD, it is
aging at a much lower income level, suggesting
that fiscal and administrative capacity to address
aging is likely to be constrained (Figure 2).

       The speed of demographic transition
in Thailand poses new challenges for
policymakers, employers and citizens, but
also opportunities. Aging will require policy
action and behavioral change in a number of areas.
In labor markets, the challenge is to mitigate the
structural decline in working age population and
to enhance labor productivity of the shrinking
labor force. In fiscal terms, the biggest risk will
be pension spending, but there are significant
challenges also for healthcare and aged/long-
term care systems to ensure affordable care for
all in a sustainable manner in a context of rapid
aging. At the same time, aging offers expanded
opportunities for Thailand as a provider of
services to the growing elderly population across
the region. The following sections first discuss
the living situation of older people in Thailand
and then the key policy challenges presented
by aging, before a short discussion of emerging
opportunities.

         al, 2005). This is reflected in income sources in            2016). Such a pattern generates rising needs for

         future source of support. In this regard, around
         77 percent of people expected themselves (own
         work) or family members to be their main source
         of support in old age, according to the Thai
         Survey of Older Persons (Knodel et al, 2013). In
         contrast, a recent survey that asked who ideally
         should be the primary source of support on
         old age, around two thirds of adult Thai answer
         “government” (Figure 8). The second aspect
         on expectations is an apparent divide across
         generations on the expected role of children in
         supporting the elderly. The second point is that
         only around a quarter of those 18-39 expect their
         children to be their primary source of support in
         old age, while the share rises to 38 percent for
         those 50-59, suggesting that there are divergent
         expectations around old age support which could
         presage a need for greater public policy support
         in future (Knodel et al, 2013).

(iv)     Opportunities from aging:

       Thailand has the opportunity to
benefit from rapid aging across Asia and
the world, including in rich countries. Older
people across the region are a new and expanding
class of global consumers, and offer commercial
opportunities in areas where Thailand has
demonstrated comparative advantage. Medical
tourism for example is already a growing sector
and there are big opportunities to expand the
market in the face of rapid growth in older
populations in large neighboring countries,
costs pressures on public funding and household
budgets in those countries, and the combination
of quality and affordability that Thailand offers
in health services. 24 Similarly, the burgeoning
market in Thailand for retirees from abroad to
relocate has significant upside potential as the
number of retirees around the region explodes.
More broadly, there are a range of service
