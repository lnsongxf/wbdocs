 Box 1          Impact of new credit easing measures by the European Central Bank


The ECB presented in June a series of measures aimed at reducing financing costs, improving lending flows and monetary policy transmis-
sion channels. The package includes:

 A new €400 billion ($598 billion) Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operations facility (TLTRO), allowing banks to borrow at very low fixed
   interest rates (benchmark policy rate plus 10bp) from the ECB up to September 2018, conditional on increased net lending to companies
 A 10bp cut in the ECB's main refinancing and deposit rates (bringing the latter to -0.1 percent)
 Suspension of liquidity sterilization injected through previous anti -crisis asset purchase programs
 Preparation of an asset purchase program of "plain" securitization products
In contrast to unconventional monetary policy measures of other major central banks (US Federal Reserve Bank, Bank of Japan, Bank of
England), the ECB continues to steer clear of purchases of government bonds.
The credit easing measures announced in June differ from the Long Term Refinancing Operations implemented by the ECB in 2011 -12.
Rather than expanding commercial banks’ access to liquidity in general, the new measures are more specifically designed to encourage
lending to the private sector and reinforce forward guidance by locking low interest rates for an extended period of time (through fixed rate
refinancing operations until 2018). The eventual success of these measures will primarily depend on banks’ uptake of the new conditional
refinancing facility and the extent to which firms are currently credit constrained and can be supported by the measures.
Elements of the TLTRO are comparable to the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) that started in mid -2012, allowing
banks and building societies to borrow from the Bank of England at below -market rates for up to 4 years (the program is in operation in the
UK until January 2015). Both the UK Treasury and Bank of England argue that FLS has played a significant role in underpinning the recov-
ery, and provided incentives for banks to boost lending. However, banks participation undershot expectations and there have been con-
cerns that FLS has contributed to rapid rise in housing prices in the UK. In the TLTRO case, however, the incentive structure is different,
with lending for house purchases notably excluded from eligibility criteria.
The mere increase in liquidity and the ECB’s commitment to keep exceptional levels of policy accommodation through a range of unconvention-
al policies should itself contribute to exerting downward pressure on yields and the euro exchange rate, while encouraging greater risk taking.
This could entail significant spillover effects for developing countries. Euro Area banks are global financial hubs, with their cross-border
loans and holdings of foreign securities and deposits about twice as large as those of US and Japanese counterparts (see Figure B1.1).
Increased liquidity and a further reduction in long -term interest rates could prompt Euro Area banks to search for higher yields outside the
Euro Area, which would translate into additional cross -border lending and portfolio flows to developing countries.
On the other hand, a depreciation of the euro would exert competitiveness pressures on some trading partners. The effect should be offset
by stronger demand from a recovering Euro Area economy, supporting exports and activity especially in neighboring countries i n Eastern
Europe, Central Asia and North Africa.

 Box 2            Revisions of the World Bank’s net capital flows data and projections


Beginning with the June 2014 edition, capital flow forecasts contained in the Global Economic Prospects reports make full
use of the International Monetary Fund’s Balance of Payments Manual 6 definitions. Previously, the data combined liability
transactions (gross disbursement minus repayments) compiled by the World Bank from various official sources with the IM-
F’s BPM5 definition for FDI and portfolio equity investment. The new approach captures more comprehensively portfolio
investments and implies significant upward revisions to FDI flows for some countries. The change in data source and defini-
tion has resulted in a significant increase in the level of recorded net capital inflows to developing countries, from 4.7 percent
of developing-country GDP under the Bank’s previous definition to 5.6 percent under the new methodology.

Changes in interest rate assumptions and prevailing market conditions account for additional upward revisions to capital flow
forecasts for 2014 and 2015. Model simulations, in particular, suggest that a lower path for long -term interest rates this year
(U.S. 10-year yields 30 basis point lower than previously assumed) and a drop in market volatility (VIX index of implied stock
market volatility around 10 percent lower than in January) could increase capital inflows to developing countries by some 0.5
percent of GDP this year and next (when compared with the previous baseline projections). The effect would dissipate by
2016, when capital flows would weaken in line with previous expectations.
