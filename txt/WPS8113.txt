Policy professionals play an essential role in the design and implementation of policies, programs,
and projects across the world. While key decisions are typically taken by elected officials or other
political appointees, decision makers depend on policy professionals, often civil servants, for policy
preparation and advice. These professionals play a central role in translating data and research into
policy options and in guiding decision-making. In this paper, we use experiments to study cognitive
biases in interpreting data for the purpose of providing advice to decision-makers. The subject pool
is novel. We study policy professionals working in the area of international development – in
particular, UK civil servants and international civil servants working for the World Bank. The
experiments are adapted to the development context from a number of classic studies on biases in
decision-making.

The objective and accurate use of data on the part of policy professionals is important for at least
two reasons. First, it is almost axiomatic that policies will be more effective when those who design
and implement them are able to form accurate beliefs about how the world works and conduct
accurate assessments of the costs and effectiveness of policy initiatives. Even if policy professionals
sometimes utilize effective heuristics or employ an “ecological rationality,” rather than cost-benefit
analysis or expected utility theory or a related set of decision rules, biases in assessing information
and calculating value remain important. After all, it is the policy professionals themselves who must
adopt and use decision rules, as well as evaluate their effectiveness. Bureaucrats also confront novel
cases or situations in which prevailing decision rules do not apply. For these reasons, it is important
for policy professionals to be able to evaluate data and assess value accurately, even if not every
decision requires that capacity.

Second, objectivity, impartiality, and accuracy are often legal or official requirements. Those values
are elements of modern bureaucracy, in Weber’s (1946) sense, and often help bureaucracies
discharge their business objectively, “according to calculable rules and ‘without regard for persons.’”
Many governments and organizations maintain the Weberian idea that a bureaucracy is perfected
“the more completely it succeeds in eliminating from official business love, hatred, and all purely
personal, irrational, and emotional elements which escape calculation. This is the specific nature of
bureaucracy and it is appraised as its special virtue.” (Weber 1946: 216)

For instance, the UK Constitutional Reform and Governance Act of 2010 sets out a civil service
code that provides guidance on its four “core values” for UK public sector employees and that
should guide part of our subject pool: “integrity, honesty, objectivity, and impartiality.”2 The
objectivity criterion further elaborates that the principle involves “basing your advice and decisions
on rigorous analysis of the evidence.” Similarly, the United Nations sets out standards of conduct
for the international civil service and lists “honesty, truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility”
under the concept of integrity. The code further elaborates that “civil servants do not have the
freedom of private persons to take sides or to express their convictions publicly on controversial
matters, either individually or as members of a group.”3 World Bank staff, who form the other part
of our sample pool, are required to act with “integrity, independence and impartiality” in line with
their status as employees of an international organization.4 The World Bank established its

Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) in order to “provid[e] impartial evidence based assessments
and lessons on drivers of success and failure.”5

To promote the impartial and proper use of evidence, large public organizations recruit and rely on
the judgments of well-qualified economists, epidemiologists, environmental scientists, engineers, and
other professionals. Having been trained in the natural or social sciences, these professionals are, in
theory, well-equipped to conduct and use evidence-based assessments of policies. But there are
strong reasons to suspect that professionals in public sector organizations, like most individuals, are
subject to and exhibit substantial biases in information processing, assessments of value, and
decision making. The psychological literature suggests that biases in decision-making, both on the
part of the general public and experts, are widespread (Cooke, 1991; Shanteau, 1992; Shanteau, 1988;
Englich, Mussweiler, and Strack, 2006; Tversky and Kahneman, 1981; Langfeldt, 2004; Stewart and
Stasser, 1995; Bero and Jadad, 1997; Herek, Janis, and Huth, 1987; Calvert, 1985; among others). If
bureaucrats and policy professionals are as biased as the general population, meritocracy and good
recruiting processes will not protect against partiality and subjectivity.

To further promote objective and impartial decision making, large public organizations implement a
number of procedural safeguards. Often, they encourage and sometimes require peer review and
deliberation, cost-benefit analysis and other kinds of ex-ante policy scrutiny, and the ex-post
evaluation of projects and programs on the basis of randomized controlled trials and other methods.
It is unclear how effective these procedural safeguards are. Policy professionals are often adept at
identifying sympathetic peer reviewers and decision makers, influencing the direction of a
deliberative meeting by setting the agenda in particular fashion, burying contestable assumptions of
cost-benefit calculations in a thicket of footnotes and appendices, and carefully curating evaluations
most relevant to a particular project or decision. More generally, because most principals, including
elected politicians in charge of final decision-making, have little idea how biases affect decision
making in their own organizations, they are not able to match procedural safeguards to the most
significant or prevalent cognitive biases, let alone measure the effectiveness of those procedures.

This paper presents the results of a survey designed to identify decision making biases within a
sample of development professionals in two prominent organizations: The World Bank and
Department for International Development in the UK (the UK government department responsible
for development policy and spending the foreign aid budget, “DFID” hereafter). The survey used a
series of experiments adapted to the development context and consistent with the kinds of decisions
staff are in these organizations are asked to make. The survey focused on confirmation bias, sunk
cost bias, and the effects of framing on risk aversion. These decision making areas and biases were
selected for study because they loom large in development policymaking. This paper is, to our
knowledge, the first examination of these cognitive biases in large public sector organizations. The
results show that staff engage in biased decision-making, including apparent bias correlated with
ideological priors.

The next section introduces the survey and procedures used. The succeeding sections assess, in turn,
confirmation bias, sunk cost bias, and the effect of framing on risk aversion. The final section

Survey design and data collection

The surveys were conducted entirely online, through email invitations via SurveyMonkey.com. The
underlying population was all World Bank and DFID full-time staff of professional grade levels,6
both in headquarters (DC and London, respectively) and in country offices for each organization. A
random sample for each organization was selected in the following manner: the employee roster for
World Bank and DFID staff (including names, email addresses, staff identification numbers, and
location) were obtained and, after the population was split into two groups (headquarters and
country offices), representative samples were drawn from each group.7

In order to increase the motivation of World Bank staff to participate in the survey, all respondents
were offered a free coffee mug. No such incentive was provided to DFID staff. Recruitment was
conducted in three waves, with each wave lasting one week. The survey was fairly extensive and
took 30-40 minutes to complete. Invitations were sent to 4,724 World Bank and 1,148 DFID staff.
At the end of the study period, 2,053 responses were received from the World Bank (response rate
43%) and 825 responses from DFID (response rate 72%).8 This yielded an overall sample of 2,878
respondents across the two organizations. The survey adapts classic behavioral experiments, as
described in the corresponding sections below. Each treatment in a given experiment was randomly
and independently assigned from the other experiments. Table 1 provides summary statistics for
our sample, distinguishing between DFID and World Bank respondents.

Confirmation bias

A longstanding finding from social psychology holds that the general public uses evidence partially,
interpreting findings in light of the symbols or metaphors they invoke, or in accord with the views
of respected opinion leaders (Lord, Ross, and Lepper 1979). This is a specific, and socially
contextualized, instance of confirmation bias, in which individuals selectively seek, remember, and
prefer information in a manner that confirms prior views. The social problems arising from
confirmation bias creates of particular concern in public discussions of scientific evidence.
Jelveh, Kogut, and Naidu (2015) find substantial sorting of economists into sub-fields and,
strikingly, a correlation between the political ideology of economists and the policy-relevant
parameter estimates that the economists report. In other words, political preferences appear to be
affecting the scientific findings of published economists. Relatedly, Sunstein et al (2006) find that the
political composition of judicial panels significantly influences judges’ opinions. The same judge,
whether appointed by a Democrat or a Republican, exhibits more ideological voting patterns when
sitting on a panel with politically homogenous judges than with ideologically mixed panels. Together,
these studies show that technical expertise does not by itself resolve the problem of ideologically
motivated or socially influenced confirmation bias.

In order to test the presence of confirmation bias among our sample of policy professionals, we
designed an experiment in which we asked them to assess data from the evaluation of an
intervention. The experiment we conducted was an extension of Kahan et al. (2013). In the original
experiment, respondents were asked to evaluate the outcome reported by a study that generated the
following frequency table:
                      Table 2: Data presentation template for confirmation bias vignette
                                                       Good Outcome         Bad Outcome
                  Individuals taking action X                  223                  75
                  Individuals taking action Y                  107                  21


In Kahan et al. (2013) there were two treatments, both of which presented these exact data but
changed the objectives and framing of the two hypothetical studies. One study addressed the
effectiveness of a skin rash cream (low prior biases); the other addressed the impact of gun control
laws on crime (high prior biases). Respondents were then asked to interpret the conclusion of the
study they saw, based on the data presented in the table. The authors found that respondent
accuracy was higher with the skin cream framing than the gun control framing, and that there was
evidence that ideology was driving this difference.

Our study used a similar approach but substituted the impact of minimum wage laws for gun
control laws because the attitudes toward the minimum wage are likely to exhibit more ideological
                                                                                                                        6



variation among development practitioners than attitudes toward gun control. The comparison
frame in our study focused, like Kahan et al (2013), on skin cream.9Again, in each treatment, the
numbers presented to respondents were identical, but the labels were changed to reflect the framing.
Following Kahan et al. (2013), within each frame we randomly switched the labels for “Good
Outcome” and “Bad Outcome” so that the data supported either one or the other policy conclusion
(or statement regarding clinical outcomes).

Respondents in the skin cream frame saw the following prompt:

         Medical researchers have developed a new cream for treating skin rashes. New treatments often work but
         sometimes make rashes worse. Even when treatments don’t work, skin rashes sometimes get better and
         sometimes get worse on their own. As a result, it is necessary to test any new treatment in an experiment to
         see whether it makes the skin condition of those who use it better or worse than if they had not used it.
         Researchers have conducted an experiment on patients with skin rashes. In the experiment, one group of
         patients used the new cream for two weeks, and a second group did not use the cream. In each group, the
         number of people whose skin condition got better and the number whose condition got worse is recorded in the
         table below. Because patients do not always complete the studies, the total number of patients in each two
         groups is not exactly the same, but this does not prevent the assessment of the results. Please consider two
         statements about this study:

         (a) People who used the skin cream were more likely to GET BETTER than those who didn’t
         (b) People who used the skin cream were more likely to GET WORSE than those who didn’t

         Which statement (above) is the study most consistent with?

The labels on the rows (in table 2) were replaced with “Patients who did [did not] use the new skin
cream” and the labels on the columns are replaced with “Rash got better [worse]”.

Respondents in the minimum wage frame saw the following prompt:

         A decentralization reform gave local jurisdictions in an upper-middle income country authority over the
         minimum wage. Some raised the minimum wage, and others left it unchanged. Because of natural barriers
         dividing the localities, there was little population mobility in response to the changes. Capital, however, was
         mobile. Some believe that increasing the minimum wage tends to raise the income of the poorest 40%. Others
         think that raising the minimum wage slows business growth so much that the incomes of the poorest 40%
         tend to fall. To examine this question, researchers at a major university measured the number of jurisdictions
         in which the incomes of the poorest 40% rose, and the number in which the incomes fell, four years after the
         reform. Please consider two statements about this study:

         (a) The income of the poorest 40% of the population FALLS when the minimum wage is increased
         (b) The income of the poorest 40% of the population RISES when the minimum wage is increased

         Which statement (above) is the study most consistent with?
9 We replicate their skin cream treatment, but recognize that gun control laws would work well for a random sample of

US citizens, but less well with development professionals, as they are more liberal. We use a “minimum wage”
treatment, where we utilize a minimum wage frame.
                                                                                                                     7




As in the original study, respondents were asked to choose which statement best reflected the study
findings. The labels on the rows (in table 2) were replaced with “Localities that did [did not] increase
the minimum wage” and the labels on the columns were replaced with “Income of poorest 40% rose
[fell]”. Respondents were randomly assigned to either the skin cream or the minimum wage frame,
and whether the data supported statement A or statement B.10

Respondents were also asked to assess the quality of the study (on a 10-point scale). In addition to
this, the study collected data on the respondents’ ideological orientation with regard to redistribution
(adapted from the World Values Survey): On a scale of 1 to 10, where do your views fall: 1 = “Incomes should
be made more equal”; 10 = “We need larger income differences as incentives for individual effort”. This question
measures respondents’ ideological orientation with respect to redistribution, a key predictor of
support for/against minimum wage laws.11

If respondents evaluate data objectively and independent of prior beliefs regarding redistribution,
they should have offered equally accurate assessments of the minimum wage study and skin cream
study frames. Alternatively, if respondents are influenced by their ideologies or values, accuracy in
the minimum wage frame should have been lower than in the skin cream frame. In fact,
respondents were significantly less accurate in the minimum wage treatments (45% responded with
the correct answer) relative to the skin cream treatments (65% responded with the correct answer:
two sample proportions test: p<0.01), and relative to random guesses (p<0.01). Respondents
exposed to the ideologically charged frame were significantly less likely to interpret the data
correctly, compared to the neutral frame, which suggests that development professionals exhibit a
bias when interpreting data on ideologically charged interventions. Figure 1 presents these results.12




10 Since we were primarily interested in the responses to the minimum wage frame, we assigned 20% of respondents to

the skin cream frame, while 80% were assigned to the minimum wage frame.
11Ideological orientation was measured towards the end of the extensive survey. In the survey, respondents were

exposed to the vignettes first, then socio-demographic questions were recorded, followed by political orientation. As
mentioned, while the treatments within experiments were randomized, the order of the questions was not.
12 Recall that within each frame (skin cream versus minimum wage), the data support either income (rash) improving, or

income (rash) getting worse. 41% of the respondents report the correct answer when the data support income
improving (58% accuracy for the rash); while 48% of the respondents report the correct answer when the data support
income declining (72% accuracy for the rash getting worse).

Table 3 displays the results of probit regressions estimating the likelihood of providing a correct
response. Model 1 includes a dummy variable equal to 1 is the respondent was exposed to the
minimum wage frame, while model 2 includes controls for mathematical ability using the Cognitive
Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005) and respondent assessment of the study (to control for the
methods used in the two study frames, one being experimental and the other observational). Model
3 includes controls for socio-demographic variables (age and gender). Model 4 includes
organizational controls (dummy variable for whether the respondent works for the World Bank or
for DFID, whether the respondent was posted at HQ or a country office, and the salary grade of the
respondent). Finally, model 5 includes respondent expertise relevant for the minimum wage frame
(whether the subject of the respondents’ highest degree was economics or development,13 and
whether the respondent currently works on poverty14).

14 The poverty expert variable was constructed based on responses to the question: “What best describes the focus of

your work?”. The variable takes on a value of 1 if the subject responded with poverty-relevant responses: “Poverty”;
“Social development” or “Social protection” (World Bank), or “Economics Advisor”; “Humanitarian Advisor”;
“Livelihoods Advisor”; or “Social Development Advisor” (DFID).

Table 3 shows support for the finding that ideologically charged questions reduce accuracy in the
interpretation of data among development professionals. Respondents were 20% less likely to
provide the correct response when exposed to the minimum wage frame (p<0.01), across all
specifications. As expected, respondents with higher scores on the Cognitive Reflection Test
(related to higher mathematical ability) were significantly more likely to provide the correct response
(p<0.01). In addition, economics majors were significantly more likely to provide the correct answer
in both study frames, suggesting that, at least to some extent, social science training helps
professionals interpret data accurately (p<0.05). Furthermore, respondents that assessed this study
to be of a higher quality were also more likely to provide the correct response, though this variable
was not robust to changes in model specification. Finally, there were no differences between DFID
and World Bank respondents (p=0.66) and between duty stations (HQ vs. country office: p=0.94).15




15In addition to the above, we also test for whether the treatment effects vary by training (economics), or by area of

expertise (poverty experts). No significant differences are found, indicating that economists are significantly more
accurate overall, and that poverty experts show no significant differences across treatments.
                                                                                                              10



Recall that the minimum wage frame question had two treatments with two different correct
answers (depending on the labelling of the columns). Half of the respondents were provided with
data that support the conclusion that the income of the poorest falls when minimum wages are
increased (“Income Falls”), while the other half were provided with data supporting the conclusion
that the income of the poorest rises when minimum wages are increased (“Income Rises”). This
structure was identical for the skin cream frame, as well. Combining these treatments with the
question about equality preference permits a direct test of the influence of ideology on data
interpretation.

Table 4 presents the results of probit regressions where the dependent variable takes a value of 1 if
the respondent provided the correct interpretation of the data. Models 1 and 2 correspond to the
ideological frame (minimum wage), with model 1 reflecting the treatment where the data support the
bad outcome (income falling) and model 2 reflecting the treatment where the data support the good
outcome (income rising). There are corresponding good and bad outcomes in the skin cream
treatments (the skin cream eliminates rash and does not eliminate rash). The estimations include
controls for inequality preferences, mathematical ability, the respondent’s assessment of the study,
age, gender, and organization. The main relationship of interest is the effect of inequality
preferences on getting the correct answer. If respondents rely on their priors, rather than evaluating
the frequency table carefully, one should expect to see that the higher the respondents’ preferences
for inequality (and hence, their anticipated opposition to minimum wage laws), the more likely they
are to respond correctly when the data support the income falling, and the less likely to respond
correctly when the data support the income rising. Since this preference is irrelevant for evaluating the
effectiveness of skin creams, one would expect to see no relationship under in both treatments using
the skin cream frame.

This is precisely what we find. Model 1 corresponds to the treatment where the data support the
finding that minimum wage laws lead to the income of the poorest falling. In that model, there is a
positive and significant relationship between inequality preferences and the correct interpretation of
the data (p<0.05). Similarly, in model 2, where the data support the finding that minimum wage
laws increase the income of the poorest, there is a negative and significant relationship between
inequality preferences and correct interpretation of the data (p<0.05). This means that when the
priors and the results match, respondents were more likely to interpret the data correctly. By
contrast, there is no evidence of this relationship in the skin cream frame. In models 3 and 4, both
coefficients are not significantly different from 0 (p=0.85 and p=0.77 respectively). The results are
similar across the two institutions across all four treatments (p>0.20).

Sunk cost bias

A major challenge in government agencies involves inertia and path dependency. In particular,
bureaucracies exhibit a tendency to continue initiatives even when they have been shown not to
work. They have difficulty cutting failed policies and programs, preferring to continue what has
previously been authorized and financed. Examples from the policymaking world abound, including
the continuing procurement of products and services even after they have been shown to be
defective, extending information campaigns even when they do not work, and prolonging wars
because the cost of admitting failure is too high (see for example, Levy, 2003; Brockner and Rubin,
1985; Schaubroeck and Davis, 1994; Staw, 1976; McDermott, 2004). The psychology of those
involved in designing or implementing policy is likely implicated in some of these decisions.

The sunk cost fallacy is the tendency of individuals to continue a project once an initial investment
of resources has been made (Arkes and Blumer 1985). This effect is predicated on the psychology of
individuals to not appear wasteful, even though continuing a project that is questionable may be
completely dominated by other options. While the initial observation regarding the presence of sunk
costs is grounded in prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), Arkes and Blumer (1985) find
that individuals that incur a sunk cost have a higher expectation regarding the probability of success
of the project, relative to those that did not incur a cost.
                                                                                                                         12



The second experiment tested for the presence of this cognitive bias in policy professionals. It
adapted the sunk cost vignette (scenario 2) used by Garland and Newport (1991)16 to generate a
scenario that would be contextually plausible for those involved in policy:

         You are managing a five-year, $500 million land management, conservation, and biodiversity project focusing
         on the forests of a small country. The project has been active for four years, $[450] [350] [250] [150]
         million of project funds have been disbursed, and the project is [90] [70] [50] [30]% complete.

         A new provincial government comes into office and announces that it will develop hydropower in the main
         river of the forest. This will require major resettlement. At the same time, the new government still wants you
         to complete the project. How likely is it that, if faced with this situation, you personally would decide to
         commit the last [50] [150] [250] [350] million dollars to complete the project? Please indicate on a scale of
         0-100%.

Respondents were asked to indicate how likely they were to support a project that was unlikely to
achieve its development objectives due to a new provincial government coming to power and
implementing a new set of policies. (In the development context, resettlement problems, such as the
one in the vignette, often trigger major and likely insurmountable problems for a project). The
treatments varied the amount of funds already disbursed (i.e. the sunk cost) on a $500 million
project. Treatments indicated that 30%, 50%, 70% or 90% of funds were disbursed. The vignette
then asked respondents how likely they were (in percent terms) to disburse the remaining funds of
the project. On a separate page, they were then asked how likely others in their organization were to
commit the remaining funds.

The level of the sunk cost should have no bearing on the decision to commit the remaining funds to
the project, yet the experiment finds clear evidence of an effect.17 Respondents reported, on average,
a 40% likelihood of disbursing the remaining funds when 30% of costs were sunk. This likelihood
increased to 43% with50% of costs sunk (3% increase, two sample t-test p<0.10). The likelihood of
disbursing the remaining funds increased to 49% when 70% of costs were sunk (6% increase,
p<0.01). The 90% sunk cost treatment was somewhat lower than when 70% of costs were sunk,
but the difference was not significant (<1% decrease; p=0.93). The likelihood that others would

16 The original vignette is as follows: “You are the owner and manager of Security Tower, an older downtown office
building that overlooks several square blocks in an area that has been slated for urban renewal over the next three years.
The City Council has indicated that it would like to create a ‘greenway’ with grass, trees, and a small lake networked with
bicycle and jogging paths. You have begun remodeling your building, anticipating renewed interest in downtown offices,
with convenient parking, good access to the cross-town freeway, and a nice view. You have spent _____ of the
approximately _____ you had budgeted for remodeling and the project is ____% complete. You have just learned that
the ‘greenway’ plan has been voted down in favor of a sports stadium that will give all 15 floors of your building a view
of cement walls and/or parking lots. Additionally, the increased traffic in the area will clog the freeway access for years,
even with the plans to widen adjacent streets.” – Garland and Newport (1991).
17 The vignette presented suggests that, in the development context, the expected returns to the biodiversity project fall

sharply, after the hydropower plan emerges, and that this holds at all levels of project disbursement. It may be that it is
still worthwhile or profitable to implement the project so stopping the project is not necessarily required. However, for
reasonable scenarios, whether it is still profitable should not depend on how much has already been spent, so there
should not be a relationship between the likelihood of committing the remaining funds and the level of sunk costs. It is
possible that, in other scenarios and with other technologies, a new policy could affect the returns to the project in a
manner that varies with extant levels of disbursement. A possible case could be projects that are implemented in discrete
units. While such exceptions are possible, it is far-fetched to try to explain the observed answers by such scenarios.

disburse the remaining funds exhibited a very similar pattern. Notably, respondents reported a
significantly higher likelihood that others in their organization would disburse the remaining funds in
all four treatments (paired t-tests: p<0.01), a finding consistent with the idea that individuals in these
organizations may be influenced by sunk costs because they believe that is the norm in their
organization. Figure 2 displays these results.

Tables 5 and 6 present OLS regressions of the likelihood that the respondent would disburse the
remaining funds and the likelihood that others in the organization would do the same, respectively.
Model 1 includes three dummy variables, one for each treatment (with 30% sunk cost used as the
baseline). Model 2 adds controls for socio-demographics (age and gender). Model 3 includes
organizational controls (dummy variables for organization and location of posting, and the salary
grade of the respondent). Finally, model 4 includes respondent expertise relevant for the framing of
the vignette (whether the subject of the respondents’ highest degree was economics or development,
and whether the respondent was working on environmental issues18).

Tables 5 and 6 confirm the pattern of figure 2. Respondents were 4% more likely to disburse the
remaining over the baseline, which is weakly significant (p<0.10). Respondents were significantly
more likely (nearly 10%) to disburse the remaining funds in the 70% and 90% sunk cost treatments
over the baseline (p<0.10), and were also significantly more likely to disburse given 50% sunk costs
(p<0.05 in both cases). There was no significant difference in responses between 70 and 90% sunk
costs level, possibly due to probability overweighting or satiation. An alternate specification (not
reported) found evidence of a linear trend: there was a 3.5% increase in the likelihood for each 20%
increase in sunk costs (p<0.01). Finally, environmental experts – plausibly more committed to
                                                                                                                     16



complete environmental projects - were 7.3% more likely to disburse the remaining funds across all
treatments.19

Table 6, concerning the expected responses of others, shows a similar pattern. And as in the
responses regarding own behavior, a linear trend was observable in the alternate specification (not
reported): a 2.6% increase in the likelihood for each 20% increase in sunk costs (p<0.01).
Environmental experts, unlike the sample as a whole, did not believe that others were more or less
likely to disburse than they were themselves. Respondents posted in country offices, possibly more
likely to confront this scenario than HQ staff, reported that others in their organization were 5%
less likely to disburse the remaining funds.

There were a few modest differences between the samples in the two organizations, with World
Bank respondents exhibiting a higher likelihood of disbursing, for themselves and others, but these
findings were not robust to specification. There were nearly identical linear trends across the
organizations.

In sum, there was strong evidence for the presence of sunk cost bias among development policy
professionals. Moreover, respondents believed that others were more likely to disburse than they
were themselves.

Framing and Risk

The framing of information affects the perceptions of risk, as well as decisions to take risky
decisions on behalf of others. The latter phenomenon appears linked to social preferences (Eckel
and Grossman 2002; 2008; Song, 2008; Chakravarty et al 2011; Anderson et al 2012; Bradler 2009).
Several of these studies show that an individual’s risk tolerance increases when taking risk on behalf
of others, in comparison to the willingness to take risk when making decisions for oneself. In other
words, individuals become more risk seeking when they are playing with house money, rather than
their own. But these findings seem contrary to the common perception that public sector
institutions, and the bureaucrats and professionals in them, are unusually risk averse, and more risk
averse than the individuals who compose them.

To explore this issue, we conducted two experiments that examined the effect of framing on risk
preferences. The first was a replication, in our novel subject pool, of a classic experiment from
Tversky and Kahneman (1981) that examined whether loss or gain framing affects willingness to
take on risk, but importantly, with a health context relevant for policy professionals during the
Ebola virus epidemic (2014). The second, conducted with the DFID sample only, directly compared
whether respondents were more or less willing to take on risk when making decisions for their
organizations than for themselves.

In order to investigate the effect of framing on risky decision-making among policy professionals,
we replicated the original Tversky and Kahneman (1981) experiment, and asked respondents the
following question:
19Environment   experts display a similar trend across treatments. Using a specification interacting the environment and
treatment dummies (not reported), we find no significant differences within the lowest three sunk cost treatments, and a
marginally significant increase in the 90% sunk cost treatment (11.5%: p<0.10).
                                                                                                                      17




          Suppose your country is preparing for a new disease that is expected to infect 12,000 people. Scientists have
          come up with two treatments – let’s call them Treatment 1 and Treatment 2. Here is the internationally
          validated scientific evidence on the effectiveness of the treatments.

          [Gain frame]

          If people take Treatment 1, then 4,000 people will be saved. [Safe choice]
          If people take Treatment 2, then there is 1/3 probability that 12,000 people will be saved and 2/3
          probability that no one will be saved. [Risky choice]

          Which treatment do you think the health authorities should implement?

          [Loss frame]

          If people take Treatment 1, then 8,000 people will die.[Safe choice]
          If people take Treatment 2, there is 1/3 probability that no one will die and 2/3 probability that 12,000
          people will die. [Risky choice]

          Which treatment do you think the health authorities should implement?

This vignette asked respondents to decide between two alternative medical treatments with the same
expected value, but one was safe and the other entailed risk. The experiment randomly assigned
respondents to either a frame emphasizing gains (“will be saved”) or losses (“will die”). If framing
does not matter, then respondents’ choices are guided by their own risk preferences, and one would
expect no difference in the proportion of respondents selecting the risky policy. However, if
respondents are prone to biases arising from framing (and prospect theory more generally), one
would expect respondents to be more risk-seeking in losses relative to gains (Kahneman and
Tversky, 1981).20

Figure 3 reports the results of the experiment across the two samples (pooled). 22% of the
respondents assigned to the gains frame (n=1,314) selected the risky policy option while 65% of the
respondents assigned to the losses frame (n=1,277) did the same. This difference in proportion is
significant (two sample proportions test: p<0.01).21




20While  we conducted this experiment in both the World Bank and DFID, we only collected risk preferences in the
DFID sample, as explained in experiment 4 below. Hence we do not control for risk preferences in the subsequent
analysis. Controlling for risk restricts our sample to DFID only, but our core result remains robust in the DFID sample
alone.
21These results are even more striking when compared to the original results reported in Tversky and Kahneman (1981):

They are extremely similar. In the original paper, 28% of the sample chose the risky policy in the gains frame (22% of
our sample did the same); while 78% chose the risky policy in the losses frame (65% of our sample did the same).

            Figure 3: Percentage of respondents choosing risky policy option under different frames

Table 7 displays the results of probit regressions estimating the likelihood that a respondent chose
the risky policy option. Model 1 includes a dummy variable equal to 1 if the respondent was
exposed to the losses frame, while model 2 includes controls for socio-demographics (age and
gender). Model 3 includes organizational controls (dummy variable for whether the respondent
works for the World Bank or for DFID, whether the respondent is posted at HQ or a country
office, and the salary grade of the respondent). Model 4 includes respondent expertise relevant for
this vignette (whether the subject of the respondents’ highest degree was economics or
development, and whether the respondent was working on health22).




22 The health expert variable was constructed based on responses to the question: “What best describes the focus of

your work?” The variable takes on a value of 1 if the subject responded with the health-relevant response: “Health”
(World Bank), or “Health Advisor” (DFID).

From table 7, we find strong evidence for the presence of biases arising as a result of framing. Using
marginal effects (not reported), respondents were 45% more likely to select the risky option when
the decision problem was framed as a loss. The result was robust to a number of additional
controls, including socio-demographics, organization specific variables, and prior expertise.
Respondents from the World Bank were marginally more likely to select the risky option (p<0.10),
but this was not robust to alternate specifications. In sum, framing dramatically affects how
development professionals perceive risk. While our results are very similar to Tversky and
Kahneman (1981), we do note that it is striking that policy professionals, who provide advice based
on similar types of evidence, are just as susceptible to the framing of the crisis. We also note that
the period of our study overlaps with the Ebola virus epidemic of 2014, suggesting that the manner
                                                                                                                       20



in which the crisis was framed could have had an impact on the decisions made by policy
professionals (and hence, policy makers).

Obviously, an important issue is how the organizational context, which involves complex of factors,
including reputation, career growth, and social preferences, affects risk taking. Are policy
professionals more risk averse when undertaking policy decisions, relative to decisions made for
themselves?23 To examine this question, we offered a test for risk taking by including a risk
preference measure at two points in the DfID survey. Respondents were provided with the
following prompt and then asked to select one of five policy proposals, each increasing in expected
value and variance.

         You are the Head of Office for a large country. You have a budget of £100m to spend on a vaccination
         programme and your team have presented you with five proposals on how to implement the programme. The
         expected number of beneficiaries reached is shown in the table below. The probability of the “things go wrong”
         scenario is 50% while the probability of the “all goes well” scenario is also 50%. Therefore, both scenarios
         have an equal chance of occurring.




                           Figure 4: Risk-taking for the organization – gamble choices

In addition to the above, to measure their own levels of risk aversion, respondents were also asked
to select a gamble for themselves:

         You are invited to play one of six games of chance. In each game a two-sided coin is tossed. If it lands on
         heads you receive the low payoff. If it lands on tails, you receive the high payoff.
         Which game would you play? You can only choose one.

  There are a number of papers investigating the role of agents undertaking risky decisions on behalf of principals,
often with mixed results. Chakravarty et al. (2010); Polman (2012); and Pollmann et al. (2014) all find that agents
exhibit greater risk tolerance (i.e. lower risk aversion) when undertaking risky investments on behalf of principals.
On the other hand, Eriksen and Kvaloy (2010) and Fullbrunn and Luhan (2014) find that agents exhibit higher risk
aversion when undertaking decisions on behalf of principals. Importantly, Pollmann et al. (2014) show that
accountability reduces the difference between principal and agent risk-taking, and suggest that this mechanism can
be used to discipline agent behavior in these types of settings.

                                   Figure 5: Risk-taking for self – gamble choices

Note that aside from the first choice in figure 5, the risk-free option, the outcomes were identical to
the prompt where respondents were asked to select a proposal in a professional capacity.24 Both
vignettes clearly stated that each outcome had a 50% chance of occurring. While the order of the
vignettes was fixed, the vignettes occurred at very different points in the survey (questions 2 and 19
for organizational and personal risk-taking, respectively). This mitigated spillovers from one
vignette to the next (since the gambles were nearly identical). This within-respondents’ setup allows
for a direct comparison of risk-taking in two different domains.

Figure 6 displays the number of respondents that selected each gamble for the organization (Y-axis)
and for self (X-axis).25 If respondents evaluated the gambles identically for themselves and their
organizations, then all choices would fall on the 45-degree line (dotted line in the figure).26 But the
figure shows that the linear trend is less than 1, which indicates that respondents were more likely to
be risk-averse in their decisions for the organization than for themselves.




24Our risk preference measure adds a risk-free choice in the manner of previous risk preference measures (for example,

see Eckel and Grossman, 2008 and Banuri and Keefer, 2016). This was done to keep risk preference measures
comparable with other studies. The risk-free option is dropped in the organizational risk-taking vignette for sake of
context.
25Note that the gambles in the risk preference measure have been rescaled from 1-6 in figure 5, to 0-5 in figure 6 to bring

them in line with the risk proposals for the organization (figure 4).
26With this exception of those risk-averse respondents that would choose the risk free option (gamble 1 in figure 5), but

theoretically, these respondents would also choose the lowest risk choice for their organization (proposal 1 in figure 4).

Table 8 (model 1) presents analyses to confirm this finding. Model 1 presents results from a tobit
model, accounting for censoring at the lower end of the data, with risk-taking for the organization as
the dependent variable. The model suppresses the constant to test whether the coefficient is
different from 1 (the null hypothesis of no difference between the two questions). The table shows
that the coefficient is lower and significantly different from 1 (p<0.01). This result provides evidence
that subjects exhibit greater risk aversion when evaluating policy choices, relative to what they would
choose for themselves.27

Table 8 (models 2-5) estimates OLS regressions with additional correlates. Model 2simply tests for a
relationship between risk-taking for self and for the organization. Model 3controls for respondent
evaluation of the importance of their response in the vignette for their career,28 in addition to
respondent gender and age. Further models control organization-specific variables, such as current
post and grade (model 4), and educational background (model 5).29

27 The organizational risk-taking vignette had a control (baseline risk) and three treatments which introduced additional
layers of risk: Three-fourths of respondents received an additional line indicating that there was (a) media interest
(reputational risk); (b) secretary of state interest (professional risk); and (c) risk of misappropriation (fiduciary risk). The
idea was to examine whether respondents chose different proposals in response to oversight and fiduciary risks. To test
for differential responses to treatment, we estimated model 2 in Table A.1 in the Appendix, which interacts the risk
preference measure with the control and each treatment separately. In this model, each coefficient is below 1, and all are
significantly different from 1 (p<0.01 in all four treatments). The results do not differ across treatments: that is, whether
the organizational risk is framed as financial, reputational, or fiduciary does not seem to make a difference in choices.
Because the results are not significantly different across these treatments, we pool all treatments together for the
subsequent analysis.
28The actual text of the question is: ‘I care about selecting the right proposal, as it will reflect positively on my career.’ If you were in this

situation, would you agree or disagree with this statement?
29The results are robust to using a tobit specification with lower level censors.

We find a strong positive relationship between our risk preference measure and risk-taking for the
organization, as expected in model 2 (p<0.01). Risk seeking respondents were significantly more
likely to be risk seeking for the organization as well. Respondents who were more likely to agree that
their response is important for their career were more likely to take higher risks for the organization
(p<0.01). Older respondents were more likely to be risk-seeking (p<0.05). Interestingly, there were
no significant differences by gender (p=0.34). There was some evidence for a relationship between
organizational risk-aversion and seniority, but this result was not robust to controlling for
educational background. In sum, policy professionals appear to take fewer risks for their
organizations than for themselves. Further research might help explain whether reputational or
                                                                                                                         24



career concerns at these organizations drive this phenomenon, whether framing risk in
organizational terms elicits widespread risk aversion among policy professionals, or whether other
factors are at play.


Summary and discussion

These experiments with World Bank and DFID staff are the first to systematically document the
presence of biases among policy professionals. The data suggest that despite the non-political
charter of many bureaucracies, such as at the World Bank and DFID, and despite the fact that
public institutions are designed to address, in Weber’s language, instrumental/purposive rationality
rather than values/belief rationality, significant biases in decision-making are evident. This finding
should worry policy professionals and their principals in governments and large organizations, as
well as citizens themselves.

As mentioned at the outset, some bureaucracies implement procedures that attempt to address
cognitive biases in decision making. It is unclear how effective these procedures are, in significant
part because research on the biases of policy professionals and bureaucrats is scarce. Further
exploration of the extent and magnitudes of these biases could also inform the design of
bureaucratic procedures to address them. Among the procedures that may go some way in
mitigating biases among bureaucrats are “red teaming” major decisions (e.g., implementing mock
adversarial arguments, as in playing the “devil’s advocate,” or war games to identify the strengths
and weakness of different courses of action or points of view), “dogfooding” products and services
(e.g., sampling the products and services that consumers or citizens use before rollout), prediction
tournaments, and group deliberation (Tetlock and Gardner 2015, World Bank 2015).

Hastie and Sunstein (2015) explore the effects of group deliberation and interaction on the quality of
decision making. They argue that group interaction is helpful for “eureka” problems (when the right
answer, once announced, is clear to all), and can mitigate the effects of availability heuristics and
anchoring. On the other hand, group deliberation can increase polarization and reduce variance in
the views that individuals hold (“groupthink”), largely as a result of informational and reputational
cascades – individuals do not want to appear to be out of step with the views of others. Group
deliberation also tends to increase the confidence, or overconfidence, of individuals in their own
judgments and beliefs.

To explore the effects of one potential intervention, group deliberation, we conducted a follow-up
experiment with a small sample of DFID policy professionals. First, the policy professionals were
exposed, individually, to the confirmation bias, sunk cost, and loss versus gain framing experiments
described above. Then they met in pairs and were asked, again, to provide answers following a brief
period of deliberation.30

30The deliberation experiment was conducted during an annual retreat for economists working for DfID. Unlike the
World Bank and DfID staff survey reported earlier, this experiment was conducted using pen and paper (rather than
online). This (plus the small sample) restricted the number of treatments that could be employed for the experiment.
Hence, there were two versions of the survey, each containing a single sequence of treatments for the confirmation,
sunk cost, and framing bias experiments: Version 1 contained 70% sunk cost, the gains frame, and confirmation bias
vignette data supporting income falling as a result of the intervention. Version 2 contained 30% sunk cost, the losses

                       Figure 7: Effects of deliberation on confirmation, sunk cost, and framing bias

Figure 7 presents the main results of the experiment for our three biases of interest. The
confirmation bias result (left) pools both treatments together and finds an overall increase in
accuracy of 12%. For sunk cost bias (center), without deliberation, we find that increasing the level
of sunk cost (from 30 to 70%) increases the likelihood of committing remaining funds to the project
by 15% in the absence of deliberation. With deliberation, sunk cost bias is completely mitigated: We
observe a reduction in likelihood of committing remaining funds by 2%. Finally, for the framing
vignette (right), participants exposed to the losses frame were 17% more likely (relative to gains) to
choose the risky policy option in the absence of deliberation. With deliberation, there is no real
change in this difference: participants were 19% more likely to choose the risky policy option in the
losses frame (relative to gains). Hence, we find that group deliberation mitigated biases associated
with sunk costs and confirmation bias. It did not, however, have any effect on the biases associated
with the framing of losses versus gains.

The reason for this, we suspect, is that the first two experiments are “eureka” problems. There is a
“right” answer to the minimum wage experiment, in the sense that in each treatment the data are

frame, and confirmation bias vignette data supporting income rising as a result of the intervention. 81 participants were
randomly allocated to either version 1 or 2 of the survey at the beginning of the retreat. In the afternoon, the
participants that were given version 1 of the survey were randomly paired and given version 1 again, and asked to discuss
their answers (and the same for version 2). Hence, each individual completed the same version of the survey twice, one
individually, and once with a partner. Three participants left the retreat early to meet other commitments, so there were
a total of 39 groups in the partner phase of the survey.
                                                                                                        26



more consistent with one interpretation of the data than with its converse. Similarly, once policy
professionals recognize the sunk cost fallacy, they tend to see the right answer, in the sense that
there is an instrumentally rational, and therefore organizationally preferred, course of action. The
experiment regarding the framing of losses and gains is different. The main finding relies on how
different respondents (or pairs of respondents) answer differently under different frames, not on
whether individuals or pairs provide the correct answer in a given frame.

To summarize, deliberation seems to be a more effective safeguard for some problems than others.
In general, when organizations implement procedural safeguards to reduce biases and improve
decisions among policy professionals, they need to be cognizant that the safeguards may be effective
for some biases and ineffective (or even counterproductive) for others. Group deliberation might
reduce confirmation bias, but have no effect the framing of risk, and could even increase a policy
professional’s risk aversion if the group makes risk-aversion in the authorizing environment more
salient.

Psychological processes and social contexts can have dramatic effects on the ways in which policy
professionals use and interpret data, make project decisions, and take personal and organizational
risks. Public sector organizations rarely study and collect data on the biases of their staff. As a result,
they are often unaware of the extent to which these influences affect their organizations’ choices and
policies, and cannot develop evidence-based approaches to mitigating biases. Efforts to study and
understand the decision-making processes of policy professionals could help governments and
international organizations devise more effective policies and programs, and to live up to legal and
professional ideals of objectivity, impartiality, and scientific accuracy.

Notes:
a   Tobit regressions suppressing the constant. The dependent variable is the proposal selected by the respondent in the
risk-taking vignette (organization).
b   Models account for censoring at the lower level as the risk preference measure has an additional (risk-free) option.
c   Table reports coefficients with standard errors in parentheses.
d   * 10%, ** 5%, *** 1% significance level.
