About the Study

As part of its sustainable energy development program, the World Bank (WB) has initiated a
study entitled, “MENA – Delivery Mechanisms and Institutions to Realize Energy Efficiency
Potential.” The study aims to deliver a detailed survey to develop strategies for raising
energy efficiency in the MENA region. There are several tasks envisioned during the course
of the project, including: (1) screening/gap analysis and coordination with partners; (2)
energy projections, efficiency potential and benefits; (3) lessons from scaling-up energy
efficiency investments in other regions; (4) mapping of policies and delivery mechanisms;
and (5) policy implications.

This report presents findings of the second task, a study on energy projections, efficiency
potential and benefits.

1   Introduction
The MENA region is one of the few energy abundant regions in the world with extensive oil
and natural gas reserves. Countries have been extracting large quantities of hydrocarbons
to be exported and used worldwide. The broad availability of hydrocarbons associated with
universal subsidy schemes for energy consumption has hindered the use of new
technologies to harvest renewable energy and energy efficiency potential. The production of
energy from renewable sources is still extremely limited, even as solar and wind energy can
be easily harvested due to the climate of the region. What is more, political revolutions and
wars in the region greatly impacted several energy sectors. While some countries were
affected more than others, energy sectors in the region are still growing and the economies
of a large number of countries under review are extensively dependent on hydrocarbons.

The current report presents (1) a brief overview of current trends of energy supply and
demand in the region and by country; (2) a “simple projection” of energy demand for 2020
and 2025 based on a historical trend of energy consumption; and (3) provides an estimate
of technical energy efficiency potential. The main uses of energy in the future by major
sectors will be assessed, the most important consuming sectors and uses will be identified
by subsector, and potential energy savings will be highlighted. It is expected that
socioeconomic structure and trends will remain unchanged over the projection period.

Countries under assessment are Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon,
Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Tunisia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab
Emirates, and Yemen.

2    Data, Methodology, and Key Assumptions

2.1 Data
A crucial step for each task is the data collection and appraisal to ensure sufficient relevance
and internal coherence, as well as inter-country comparison. This will be done in order to
perform the planned project tasks, in particular energy demand projections and estimations
of energy efficiency potential. The project primarily relies on the recent RCREEE Energy
Efficiency Indicator Study project, as well as on databases from the IEA and ESWCA,
especially for the GCC countries.

Energy Demand Projections are primarily based on the energy balances series available
from 2000 to 2012 prepared within the scope of the “RCREEE Energy Efficiency Indicators
Study” project1 and published data of IEA, UNESWCA, and other regional and international
organizations including OPEC, OAPEC, and BP. The choice of the RCREEE Energy Efficiency
Indicators Study was based on the cross checking and validation of data with national focal
points and sources. The format chosen, although slightly altered, allows a suitable
comparison of data over the selected period in the same table. Energy balances for the
remaining countries, mainly GCC countries, was collected through desk review of available
national and international sources.

The data sources differ according to each sub-region and are as follows:

    -     RCREEE member states (12): IEA and national sources with an extensive process of
          data consolidation on total and sectoral breakdown by national experts; and
    -     GCC countries (5): Based on national sources and complemented by regional and
          international organizations data.

This tailored approach was designed to ensure the most relevant and quality sources
available were utilized. The following table provides a detailed data assessment by country
and data sources. In addition, Annex A presents an extensive list of resources organized by
country of the studies, reports, and statistical data sets used to complement the available
data sources.

 The objective of this project was to design and implement a detailed and comparable set of indicators to monitor and assess
energy efficiency performance and policies in RCREEE member states. The project offered a regular and consistent baseline
data generation process. Information is used in regional benchmarking and decision-making support in designing energy
efficiency policies.

                    XX: Detailed sectoral breakdown


The lack of direct energy surveys among end-use sectors in the MENA region is a major
barrier for energy balance coherence (since it is largely preventing to check supply data)
and scope. The absence in these surveys also hampers an effective breakdown of energy
consumption by subsectors/products and uses for the industrial, residential, and service
sectors. Most countries still lack the tools necessary to collect energy demand data, which
hinders the availability of reliable official statistics (See Box 1 below).

The lack of data revolves mainly around the breakdown of final energy consumption
between economic activities. Despite the efforts made to elaborate more detailed and
reliable energy balances, generally the repartition of the final consumption between the
main sectors—industry, transportation, tertiary and residential—is problematic in most
target countries. Thus, the distribution of the consumption between branches, by use or by
mode within the sectors, is not available. This lack of information constitutes a real barrier
to calculate indicators at a disaggregated level.

Some MENA countries have shown advancement in statistical surveys in several fields
related to energy, industry, and agriculture sectors with the implementation of energy use
surveys, whether in the household or transport sectors. However, a large number of
countries still lack such advancement in statistics that hinders the availability of reliable
official statistics.

Box 1: Energy Demand Data Collection

An effective and relevant energy data system should primarily rely on a solid and
comprehensive data collection scheme, in particular on primary energy supply and
transformation data from energy companies. For the final energy consumption by end-use
sectors, energy supply sources are generally insufficient even to balance supply and
demand in the annual energy balance according to international standards (as for the
IEA/EUROSTAT/UNECE annual questionnaires).

Only sample surveys on final energy consumption by the end-use sectors (industry,
residential, tertiary, transport, agriculture) are possible due to accurate, relevant, and
detailed energy consumption data by subsectors and often by uses. This allows a breakdown
of final demand in the energy balance. Additionally, direct demand surveys and associated
databases have proven to be crucial tools to better understanding of the current and future
energy demands and customer behaviors necessary for prospective and energy planning.

In the MENA region, only few countries Morocco have put in place regular direct demand
surveys in the industrial, residential, and transport sectors, notably through existing
surveys. The exceptions include Tunisia, which has since the late 1980s conducted a
detailed household survey by the power utility STEG in collaboration with the Industry
Ministry and ANME, and more recently Morocco. Nonetheless, despite those references, the
support of EUROSTAT (MEDSTAT Energy) and ESCWA, their crucial function, relevance, and
modest cost, direct demand surveys are still largely ignored by policymakers and thus
remain neglected by national statistical offices and energy ministries.

A detailed review of the available surveys in the MENA countries under this study has been
made to generate a list of the available surveys of the energy sector at the country level, as
well as end-use sectors such as industry, residential, and agriculture. Table 2 below shows a
summary of the available surveys and censuses consulted over the course of the study.

2.2     Methodology and Key Assumptions

2.2.1 Energy Demand Projections
Economic projection is defined as “a calculation of the way that something will change and
develop in the future”. It aims to give a picture of the future based on knowledge of the
past. In other words, a projection is a prolongation of past trends over a selected period.


                                                                                                        12
            MENA – Delivery Mechanisms and Institutions to Realize Energy Efficiency Potential


A large number of previous relevant studies and publications on different methodologies for
estimating energy demand projections were reviewed to identify the most suitable
methodology given the lack of detailed, comparable data sets in the MENA region. The
question was whether to pursue energy demand estimations using detailed end-use
methodologies (such as the MAED model 2) or a simple econometric model. The latter option
has been chosen due to the above-mentioned data constraints.

A thorough review of the data over the time series, by sector and fuel, of each country’s
energy balance was made. As such, the following data compilations and calculations were
performed:

        Calculation of the average annual growth rate and average value for the period
         2000-2012; and
        Projections for 2020 and 2025 based on average annual growth rate. For the period
         2020-2025, the hypothesis is that the energy demand growth would be for some
         countries is less rapid than during the first period, owing to the results of EE policies
         and measures as well as energy-intensive economies. Such differential growth for
         this second period would rely on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of existing EE
         policies and notably its goals (NEEAP) and policy implementation.

The projection for the horizons 2020 and 2025 is based on a Business as Usual (BAU) or
conservative scenario that implies that the socio-economic structure and energy
consumption patterns remain unchanged over the projected period. It correlates with the
objective of identifying energy consumption segments and will be the largest at those
horizons with current consumption trends.

While such a strong assumption may be reasonable for countries with slow change in energy
infrastructure and consumption patterns, it may not be relevant for other countries in rapid
reforms and modernization such as Morocco and the UAE, especially due to their expanding
energy infrastructure and more rapid socioeconomic development.

2.2.2 Energy Efficiency Potential

Energy savings and energy efficiency (EE) While both terms are used interchangeably,
they are in fact different. Energy savings means using less energy, generally through a
behavioural change (e.g. turn off the light or reduce its daily use). Energy efficiency (EE)
means using energy more effectively and durably for the same level of service, product, or
comfort based on technological, organisational, structural, or behavioural changes (e.g.
change the incandescent bulb by a CFL or LED). Thus, less energy is used to produce the

  The MAED model computes energy demand at the subsector level and activity level. It evaluates future energy demand based
on medium to long-term scenarios of socio-economic, technological and demographic developments. It relates systematically
the specific energy demand for producing various goods and services identified in the model, to the corresponding social,
economic and technological factors that affect this demand. The total energy demand for each end-use category is aggregated
into four main “energy consumer” sectors: Industry (including agriculture, constr uction, mining and manufacturing),
transportation, services and households. Finally, the model focuses exclusively on energy demand, and even more specifically
on demand for specified energy services. It does require a detailed and reliable set of energy and socioeconomic data.

                                                                                                                        13

same service or good. According to the IEA,3 “Something is more energy efficient if it
delivers more services for the same energy input, or the same services for less energy
input”.

For this study, the term energy savings may be understood in a global sense and thus
encompasses behavioural energy savings (as occurs through awareness campaigns) as well
as EE, in particular through new investments in more efficient technologies. For
simplification, in the rest of the report, the generic term of energy efficiency (EE) will be
used.

Technical potential and techno-economic EE potential While technical potential covers
all actions and investments that are technically feasible without the limitations of realisation
costs, the techno-economic potential includes only those actions and investments with a
payback time (as with the ratio between the economic savings and investment costs)
considered as acceptable by most customers.

In most MENA countries, the existence of high universal energy subsidies for all customers
proportionally reduces the value of those economic savings and thus the payback time and
attractiveness of EE. Thus, for simplicity purposes, the technical potential for energy savings
will be assessed in this study. The option to estimate the techno-economic potential would
require acquiring much more data than is generally available and be based on weak
assumptions.

Direct RE technology as energy savings A methodological issue is to either or not list
direct renewable energy (RE) technologies, such as solar water heating (SWH) and
Photovoltaic (PV), as energy savings technologies in the tertiary and residential sectors. In
both cases, they reduce the use of grid or direct energy consumption including electricity
and thus are energy savings technologies. On the other hand, as RE technology, they enter
in the RE potential assessment. For this study, as SWH generally substitute fossil fuels such
as LPG and fuel oil or electricity in the building itself and thus generate direct energy
savings, they will be considered as part of the energy efficiency potential and technologies.

Primary and final EE potential Primary energy savings are realised in the energy sector
(supply side), while final energy savings refer to energy savings in the end-use sectors
(demand side). Final electricity savings can be converted in primary energy equivalent to
take into account the transformation and transport losses. The usual coefficient to convert
final electricity into primary energy is 2.58 (1 kWh final = 2.58 kWh primary), or a global
efficiency of the electricity system (from the power plant to the consumer) of 38.5%. Based
on the broad and in-depth data collection of the RCREEE Energy Efficiency Indicators Study
project, reliable country-specific consumption of power generation (in toe/GWh) indicators
are available for almost all countries. They are equivalent to a final electricity conversion to
primary energy. Nevertheless, a statistical issue is that electricity consumption data in end-
use sectors is generally available for the residential sector only.

In a situation of scarce detailed data, especially on energy consumption at subsectoral and
product levels as final energy breakdown remains limited in most countries, the use of
existing EE indicators to estimate the EE potential appears the best methodological
compromise. Generally, the unit consumption ratios are more accurate than relying on
physical units, as they have less bias than energy intensities (with possible multiple
fluctuations of the GDP and external reasons as exchange rate variations). Energy
intensities measure first the energy content of products or services but not directly the
physical efficiency of energy use. Thus, it does not necessarily reflect a high or higher EE
and hence EE potential. The estimation of the energy efficiency potential by sector or
subsector relies on the relative difference between the current level of one EE indicator or a
set of EE indicators with references or benchmarks at country, regional or sub-regional
levels (when relevant, international references are also mentioned). When detailed data is
available by subsectors or products (i.e. for the seven industrial energy-intensive products,
public lighting), or by energy uses (i.e. lighting, air conditioning, and motors), an estimation
of EE technical potential has been further detailed.

The same methodology for EE potential estimation is applied to the electricity sector and
end-use sectors, which rely on existing EE indicators. The technical EE potential is estimated
for the latest data available year (in most cases, 2011 or 2012).

For sectoral EE indicators, benchmarks, and EE potential estimation, energy and socio-
economic data availability and reliability at country and regional levels are crucial. While a
sectoral EE indicator may be available for one country and considered reliable, the lack of
sufficient indicators in other countries may prevent the establishment of a benchmark at
country or regional levels that would inform an EE potential estimation. Additionally, final
energy intensities (e.g. toe/unit of GDP) are generally too subject to specific structural
conditions such as sectoral and product composition to be comparable between countries
within the same sub-region.

Thus, specific energy consumption ratios such as toe/t and kWh/m2 have been prioritized as
generally not directly influenced by macroeconomics and variations and thus provide more
accurate data. Nevertheless, these ratios require detailed and reliable energy and socio-
economic data, which reduce the possibility of country comparisons and benchmarking.

The estimation of the EE potential relies on the following general assumptions:
        The reliability of the country EE indicators and the regional benchmarks is
          relevant between countries in the same sub-regions (i.e. the Mediterranean, the
          Gulf, and Africa) and is not influenced by structural parameter differences; and
        The use of regional benchmarks within the MENA region supposes that socio-
          economic and technology conditions are similar between the various countries
          within the same climatic zone and socio-economic categories for the residential
          sector.

2.2.3 Cost of Conserved Energy
The basic principle of the EE potential abatement cost is to associate the EE potential and
the corresponding abatement cost in US dollars (USD) or euros per saved ktoe or GWh.
Those abatement costs include all direct and related costs (including avoided energy costs)
to study, install, and operate EE actions and technologies paid by the customers. They
include annualized payments for the capital and operation expenses. In addition, the
accumulated energy savings in economic terms (a measure based on customer’s electricity
bills) can also be associated.

The EE potential measures or technologies are ranked by abatement cost from the cheapest
to the most expensive technology or action. This merit order by cost prioritizes technologies
with the lowest cost, even if they have less potential. .

Uncertainty may be significant for estimates of the EE potential and abatement costs. It is
linked with the effective implementation of EE measures and effective investment costs,
respectively.

The associated reductions in energy expenditures consist of reduced energy expenses for
customers while avoided investments include new capacities made unnecessary by reduced
energy consumption.

The application of the EE potential abatement costs to a set of MENA countries relies first on
the estimated EE potential carried out for the latest available year in the electricity sector
and five end-use sectors: industry, transport, tertiary, residential, and agriculture and
fishing. The estimated EE potential is also projected to the 2020 and 2025 to serve as
framework data or the maximum technical EE potential.

An indispensable source of information used in this report is the Budget Allocation Chart
(BAC) prepared by the MED-ENEC and MED-EMIP EU Southern Mediterranean regional
projects for Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia for 2020. The cost abatement
approach target electricity consumption and are built based on extensive data collection,
compilation, and simulation both in the MENA region and the EU by using a set of EE&RE
technologies, as well as their cost and impact on electricity consumption. These are based
on an estimation of the electricity efficiency potential and abatement cost in both euro/kWh
and total amount for the most promising EE&RE technologies in various subsectors and
transversal uses, such as lighting – Annex C.

It combines the sectoral 2020 EE potential with selected EE technologies and solar water
heating (SWH) within the industry, tertiary, and residential sectors to assess their electricity
efficiency potential for 2020. Transport, agriculture, and fishing are not covered as they
consume almost only fuels. The electricity efficiency potential is then expressed in final
electricity. The abatement period starts from 2012 until the horizon 2020 for the industry,
tertiary, and residential sectors. Tables 5 and 6 below show an example of the electricity
efficiency potential abatement cost.

The unit investment costs (USD/toe) of EE technologies and measures are estimated based
on existing international references and benchmarks and on the hypothesis that:

                                                                                             16

   -    30 percent of the investments are realizable for an average cost of 100 USD/toe;
   -    50 percent of the investments are realizable for an average cost of 200 USD/toe;
        and
   -    20 percent of the investments are realizable for an average cost of 300 USD/toe, for
        an average total cost of 190 USD/toe (expert estimates based on previous studies
        and international benchmarks).

2.2.4 Reductions in Energy Expenditures and Avoided Investments
The methodology is based on the electricity efficiency potential abatement and associated
reductions in electricity expenditures for 2020 for a set of EE technologies. They represent
the customer economic savings at a full realization of the electricity efficiency potential in
2020.

The avoided investments in capacity (MW) in the power sector are calculated with the
assumption that the yearly average of electricity usage currently unavailable is similar to
power plant time usage calculated for the total power capacity. The associated avoided
investments in economic terms are based on an average investment cost of the combined
cycle (CCGT) technology of 850 €/kW or 1,100 USD/kW. The CCGT has been selected as
being the most energy efficient and the most common thermal power generation
technology.

3     Results for the MENA Region

3.1    Overview of Energy Supply and Demand

The region relies heavily on oil, which makes up to 56 percent of its total primary energy
supply, and natural gas, which makes up to 46 percent. An 83 percent increase in natural
gas and a 16 percent increase in the share of oil products between 2000 and 2011 are
reflected in this figure. Total electricity generation at the regional level increased from 484
TWh in 2000 to 925 TWh in 2012, with a total capacity of 193 TWh in 2011. Electricity was
mainly generated from natural gas (59 percent) and crude oil and oil products (40 percent),
with 0.2 percent of electricity generated from other fuels in 2012, mainly from renewable
sources.

In 2011, final energy consumption was comprised of natural gas (17 percent), oil products
(45 percent), electricity (15 percent), coal 90.4 percent) and other energies (2 percent).
Total energy consumed by end use sectors amounted to 390 Mtoe in 2011 compared to 239
Mtoe in 2000.

Available statistics in the region shows that the largest energy-consuming sector was
transport at 36 percent in 2011, followed by industry (35 percent) and residential (17
percent). Figure 1 sketches relative sectoral shares for 2000 and 2011.

3.2    Energy Demand Outlook 2020

Total final energy consumed in the region is projected to amount to 623 Mtoe in 2020,
compared to a total consumed energy of 390 Mtoe in 2011 and 217 Mtoe in 2000, an almost
threefold increase. Total electricity generation increased from 428 TWh in 2000 to 861 TWh
in 2011 and is estimated to reach 1,504 TWh in 2020, representing a twofold increase.

The largest energy-consuming sector in the region is expected to be the transport sector at
36 percent, followed by industry at 35 percent, residential at 17 percent, tertiary at 11
percent and agriculture and fishing at 1 percent.

                                                                                                       20

3.4 Energy Efficiency Potential
Energy is consumed in all economic sectors and socio-economic activities. Major energy
consuming sectors in the MENA region are the oil refining and petrochemical sectors,
electricity generation, and end-use sectors. In the MENA region, total primary energy
supplied in 2012 amounted to 511 Mtoe, compared to 386 Mtoe in 2000, at an annual
variation rate of 4.5 percent, of which 79 percent of total energy was consumed by the end-
use sectors.

The total energy efficiency (EE) potential for the region amounted to 142 Mtoe4. The EE was
comprised of 76 percent of end-use sectors and 24 percent of electricity sector. The total EE
potential represented 28.1 percent of total energy consumed in 2012.

Beyond this quantitative estimation of the EE potential, a crucial element for EE policies for
the effective deployment of EE is to assess, in each country, what are the priority EE
potential sectors and measures/technologies that take into account a broad scope and
interlinked factors for:

Customers
   - Economic profitability through reduced and lasting energy bills and maintenance; and
   - Attractiveness through customer awareness, adequate access to related information
     (technical economic and financial) and advice on the EE potential realization
     facilitating its effective realization.

Stakeholders (in particular the financial sector)
   - Ease of the realization of EE potential through investment projects, grouping of
      projects, and economic and financial maturation.

State
   - Socio-economic benefits, including for customers through reduced energy bills
      enhancing household’s welfare and business competiveness, as well as establishing
      and developing an EE sector;
   - Durable reduction of country energy consumption and imports, along with the
      associated subsidies for consumption and investment;
   - Ease of the realization of the EE potential through investment size and maturation for
      an optimal use of eventual state incentives such as grants and loans for EE
      investment and support administration; and
   - Deployment of low-cost transversal measures as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs)
      and S&L.


3.4.2.1 Sectoral analysis
Industry
Beyond the large and energy-intensive industrial plants and companies for which EE
investments are generally sizeable and relatively well identified for a relatively low unit
management cost owing to the size and grouping of projects especially on utilities as
boilers, motors, lighting or compressed air, it is necessary to analyse SMEs through a
sectoral approach as these smaller-sized companies are diverse in terms of their processes,
sectors, markets, and locations.

Tertiary
This sector includes subsectors and units with public administrations; private businesses for
public such as hotels, commerce, and banks; and staff. Also diverse, the energy use of
enterprises in this sector varies widely even if EE projects can be identified transversally for
utilities and similar consumer types.


                                                                                             24
         MENA – Delivery Mechanisms and Institutions to Realize Energy Efficiency Potential


Residential
The residential sector comprises a large number of individual units, with great heterogeneity
in terms of geography, society, economy, and level of urbanization, allowing for an effective
and swift realization of EE potential. As such, the design of transversal and replicable
measures applicable to most customer profiles is preferable.

Transport
This sector is particularly complex owing to the number and diversity of consuming units
such as private and company cars, passenger and freight vehicles, and local and
international vehicles. With an associated lack of reliable data, the design and
implementation of EE measures requires a specific approach.

The following table provides a qualitative assessment of the deployment of EE technologies
and measures by sector

3.4.3 Country Comparison
The MENA region is comprised of countries with varying energy needs and consumption
patterns, available energy resources; size of economy; level of economic development; and
population and land size. The above-mentioned factors play an important role in
characterizing the magnitude of the EE potential. The table below shows a ranking of MENA
countries from the largest estimated EE potential to the smallest.

Those differences is influenced by several factors, which include the size of the country, its
level and type of production, energy consumption patterns, and the age and efficiency of
the installed electricity system. The technical EE potential estimated for Saudi Arabia
indicated that 48.9 Mtoe can be saved, or 24.4 percent of TPES; Egypt can save 20 Mtoe or
26 percent of TPES; and the United Arab Emirates can save 18 Mtoe, or 24 percent of TPES.
These savings can be realized if technical improvements are implemented to increase the
efficiency of the electricity sector and end-use sectors.

Yemen and Palestine are the countries with the lowest EE potential based on technical
improvements of the electricity sector and end-use sectors. In Yemen, the energy sector is
underdeveloped due to a low level of economic maturity and chronic financial difficulties.
The lack and limited access to energy resources in Palestine has greatly impacted the
consumption patterns of the population with no access to fossil fuels and limited electricity
generation capacity, decreasing its EE potential.

3.4.4 Projections for 2020 and 2025
Based on 2000 – 2012 annual sectoral variation (percent/year), a simple projection was
done in order to estimate the technical EE potential for the region in the years 2020 and
2025. The MENA total EE potential amounted to 222 Mtoe in 2020 and 297 Mtoe in 2025.
The EE potential is projected to account 74 percent of end-use sectors in 2020 and 73
percent in 2025, as for the electricity sector, it should represent 26 percent in 2020 and 27
percent in 2025. The total EE potential represented 21.9 percent of total energy consumed
in 2020 and 20.4 percent in 2025.

4   Results by Country

4.1 Algeria

4.1.1 Overview of Energy Supply and Demand
Algeria’s energy production amounted to 143,793 ktoe in 2011, mostly from natural gas and
crude oil at an annual increase of 0.2 percent from 2000. Algeria relies heavily on exporting
hydrocarbons, which decreased from 113,645 ktoe in 2000 to 104,419 ktoe in 2011, while
its primary energy increased during the same period from 26,550 to 41,100 ktoe.

Final energy consumption amounted to 26,315 ktoe in 2012, compared to 15,894 ktoe in
2000, an increase of 66 percent. Final energy consumed in 2011 originated from oil
products (53 percent), natural gas (28 percent), electricity (11 percent), and coal (0.2
percent). The largest contributor to electricity generation was natural gas at 93 percent in
2011, on the rest coming from oil products. Total electricity generated amounted to 4,936
ktoe in 2012, compared to 2,185 ktoe in 2000.

Figure 11 shows the energy consumed by sector in 2000 and 2011. The largest energy-
consuming sector was transport, followed by residential and industry. There was a slight
increase between 2000 and 2011 in the transport sector at 11,475 ktoe in 2011. This figure
remained constant for the residential sector at 6,976 ktoe in 2011, decreased 4 percent for
industry at 5,219 ktoe, and increased 3 percent for the tertiary sector at 2,065 ktoe in
2011.

4.2   Bahrain

4.2.1 Overview of Energy Supply and Demand

The total production of energy in Bahrain reached 24,037 ktoe in 2012 compared to 19,736
ktoe in 2000. The country’s production relies on natural gas , with a production value of
15,384 ktoe and crude oil at 8,653 ktoe in 2012. Bahrain also imports crude oil and
transforms it to oil products, much of which is exported. Specifically, 6,387 ktoe of crude oil
and 11,838 ktoe of oil products were exported in 2012, a decrease of 10.6 and 2.8 percent
respectively since 2000.

Natural gas and oil products were the main energy sources for electricity generation in the
country, with heavy input from natural gas. Total final energy consumption by sector
consisted of 38 percent of energy consumed from electricity, 22 percent from oil products
and 3 percent from electricity in 2012.

The consumption distribution by end use sector is illustrated in Figure 19. The major
energy-intensive sector was industry, which consumed 75 percent of energy in 2012. The
second intensive sector was transport, which consumed 19 percent in 2011, followed by the
residential sector that consumed 12 percent. Due to the country’s relatively small land area
and arid climate conditions, the agricultural sector is limited and consumed only about 0.08
percent of total energy.

        ii. Transport

Total EE potential was in terms of final energy 179 ktoe in 2012, using the total energy
consumed by the transport sector that year and based on the percentage of the EE potential
of the transport sector of Jordan due to the proximity of the Jordan car fleet to Bahrain. The
EE potential represents road transportation only due to the absence of data for other
transportation means such as air, maritime, and railways.

The average emissions factor of the sector was 2.9 teCO2/toe in 2012 while the CO2
intensity of the sector was 0.14 teCO2/1,000 USD. In addition, the motorization rate was
3.1 persons/vehicle that year, compared to 3.6 persons/vehicle in 2001.

      iii. Tertiary

The energy intensity of the tertiary sector in terms of final energy was 0.51 toe/1,000 USD.
The EE potential of the sector was 107 ktoe in 2012 using the country-tailored benchmark
that was set at 0.37 toe/1,000 USD.11 The EE potential represented 27 percent of total
energy consumed by the tertiary sector.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was equivalent to 105 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy
estimated the total EE potential for the sector at 212 ktoe. The average emission factor
amounted to 8.5 teCO2/toe in 2012, while the CO2 intensity of the tertiary sector was 4.3
teCO2/1,000 USD the same year.

       iv. Residential

The specific consumption of energy per unit area was calculated at 35 kgoe/m2/yr in 2012,
while the specific consumption of electricity per unit area was 352 Kwh/m 2/yr in the same
year. The country-tailored benchmark was set at 24.5 kgoe/m2/yr, based on comparisons
with countries covered by the Plan Bleu study and expert analyses. The EE potential for the
residential sector in terms of final energy was estimated to be 188 ktoe, or 30 percent of
the total energy consumed by the sector.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was equivalent to 159 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy
estimated the total EE potential for the sector at 348 ktoe.

The unit consumption of energy per dwelling amounted to 3,151 kgoe/DW in 2012, while
the unit consumption of electricity per dwelling was 31,678 Kwh/Dw. These values are
estimated to be of the highest in the MENA region. The average emission factor was 7.7
teCO2/toe in 2012.

       v. Agriculture and Fishing Sector

4.3.1 Overview of Energy Supply and Demand
Egypt’s total production of energy amounted to 87,178 ktoe in 2012, an increase of almost
39 percent from 2000. The country’s main energy resources are natural gas, crude oil,
hydropower and renewables. It is worth noting that the country has a production of
combustible renewable and waste at the value of 1,617 ktoe and geothermal and solar
energy at 168 ktoe for 2011.

Egypt imported 9,089 ktoe of oil products in 2011, a stark increase of 143 percent from
2000. It also imported 1,454 ktoe of coal, an increase of 21 percent over the same period.
The total amount of electricity exports increased over time from 28 ktoe in 2000 to 139 ktoe
in 2011.

Gross inland consumption in Egypt reached the amount of 78,129 ktoe in 2011, including all
energy resources, both renewable and non-renewable. On the other hand, Egypt depended
on natural gas and oil products to produce electricity, with 77 percent originating from
natural gas and 23 percent from oil products in 2012.

Final energy consumption for 2012 amounted to 66,387 ktoe, with 44 percent from oil
products, 28 percent from natural gas, and nearly 18 percent from electricity. The largest
energy-consuming sector was industry, with a consumption increasing from 13,137 ktoe in
2000 to 21,278 ktoe in 2012. Industry was followed by tertiary sector, which increased from
2,407 ktoe to 12,907 ktoe over the same period. The transport sector reached 11,576 ktoe
in compared to 9,771 ktoe, while the residential sector increased from 5,708 ktoe to 10,856
ktoe. The agriculture and fishing sector increased from 329 ktoe in 2000 to 2,707 ktoe in
2012.

of final energy was 4,943 ktoe for 2012, using an energy-efficiency and country-tailored
benchmark, as well as taking into account the energy intensity of the sector.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 1,006 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total
EE potential for the sector at 5,948 ktoe.

The carbon dioxide intensity of the industry sector amounted to 3.8 teCO 2/1,000 USD for
2012, an increase of 69 percent from 2000. For comparison, the average emission factor of
the industry sector was 3.1 teCO2/toe for 2012, a decrease of 3 percent from 2000.

            ii. Transport

The EE potential of the transport sector in terms of final energy was 1,898 ktoe in 2012,
considering 16.4 percent of the total energy was consumed by the transport sector. Because
of the absence of reliable data for the energy consumption of personal automobiles in
Egypt, its EE potential was estimated using information from the closest car fleet of another
country in the region. In this case, Tunisia has the closest car fleet and hence the EE
potential estimation relied on Tunisia’s EE potential for the transport sector.

The average emission factor for the transport sector was 2.86 teCO2/toe for 2012 while the
CO2 intensity of this sector amounted to 0.13 teCO 2/1,000 USD. The motorization rate in
2012 was calculated at 29.5 persons per vehicle, compared to 48.9 persons per vehicle in
2000.

           iii.   Tertiary

The final energy intensity of the tertiary sector amounted to 0.54 toe/1,000 USD in 2012.
Using a country-tailored benchmark of 0.37 based on the Plan Bleu study and energy
intensity of the sector, the EE potential in terms of final energy was 4,122 ktoe.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 1,013 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total
EE potential for the sector at 5,135 ktoe. The CO2 intensity of the tertiary sector amounted
to 1.8 teCO2/1,000 USD, while the average emission factor was 3.3 teCO2/toe in 2012.

           iv. Residential

The total intensity of the residential sector amounted to 0.3 toe/1,000 USD in 2012, while
the specific consumption of energy was 7.52 kgoe/m2/yr. The total EE potential for the
residential sector, in terms of final energy based on specific consumption, was 3,060 ktoe
using a country-tailored benchmark of 5.4 based on the Plan Bleu study.13

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 1,643 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total
EE potential for the sector at 4,703 ktoe.

The unit consumption of energy per dwelling amounted to 526 kgoe/Dw in 2012, while the
unit consumption of electricity per dwelling was 2,747 Kwh/Dw. The CO 2 intensity of the
residential sector in 2012 was 1.2 teCO2/1,000 USD and the average emission factor was
4.2 teCO2/toe.

             v. Agriculture and Fishing Sector

The final energy intensity for agriculture amounted to 0.4 toe/1,000 USD in 2012. Due to
lack of data regarding fishing, the total EE potential in terms of final energy using a country-
tailored benchmark of 0.32 and energy intensity of the agriculture sector was 645 ktoe for
the agriculture and fishing sector for 2012.

4.3.5 Energy Efficiency potential 2020 and 2025
The technical EE potential projected for 2020 and 2025 amounts to 27,818 ktoe and 32,794
ktoe, respectively. The EE potential was based on the annual sectoral variation for 2000 to
2012. Based on the projected values of 2025, the total EE potential of 2025 represents 20
percent of TPES. Figure 33 shows the percentages of the subsectors with their projected EE
potential, while Figure 34 shows the variation of the EE potential from 2012, 2020, and
2025.

4.3.6 Cost of conserved energy
A set of the available data for the electricity efficiency potential abatement cost curve for
Egypt in 2020 is represented in the table 15 below. It provides a combined estimation of
electricity efficiency potential and net abatement cost by end-use sectors for a set of EE
technologies.

The total cost-effective electricity efficiency potential (1,605 ktoe) accounts for a large share
– Almost 48 percent – of the total identified electricity efficiency potential (3,289 ktoe). This
indicates a relatively high concentration of the electricity efficiency potential on a set of EE
technologies.

With almost 1,400 ktoe, the residential sector accounts for 87 percent of the total electricity
efficiency potential while tertiary sector represents only 13 percent14. In terms of
technologies, efficient lighting in the residential sector dominated the scene with 56 percent
followed by efficient fridges at 26 percent and street lighting at 11 percent. SWH on the
other hand accounted for a marginal share of only 2 percent in the electricity efficiency
potential.

           MENA – Delivery Mechanisms and Institutions to Realize Energy Efficiency Potential


The needed annual investment cost to realise this electricity efficiency potential is estimated
to reach USD 139 million, with almost 78 percent coming from the residential sector.
Efficient lighting and efficient fridges account for the largest shares of this cost with 35
percent and 32 percent, respectively. Over the period 2012 to 2020, the total investment
cost of USD 1,112 million is largely compensated by the net (negative) abatement cost of
USD 2,335 million.

(c) Based on average investment cost of combined cycle (CCGT) of 850€/kW or 1,100 USD/kW (sources: IEA

The main result that can be extracted from this above table is the fact that, for end-use
customers, the electricity efficiency potential is almost equivalent to a reduction of USD
2,150 million of their electricity expenditures every year over the period 2012 – 2020. On
the power generation side, the electricity efficiency potential corresponds to an avoidable
capacity of 3,446 MW (2.6 times higher than the recently commissioned Ain Sokhna power
plant, considered as one of the largest in the country with a capacity of 1,300 MW) almost
around 12 percent of Egypt’s existing installed power capacity. Such avoided new
investment on power capacities would be equivalent to USD 3,800 million (using CCGT
technology). Cumulating both electricity consumption and supply savings, Egypt should be
saving every year more than USD 5,950 million representing almost 2.3 percent of its actual
GDP at current price.

4.4.1 Overview of Energy Supply and Demand
The total energy production in Iraq consisted of 97 percent of crude oil in 2012 (compared
to 98 percent in 2000), 3 percent of natural gas (compared to 1.9 percent), and less than
0.3 percent of hydropower (compared to 0.1 percent). The total production was 155,119
ktoe in 2012 compared to 134,909 ktoe in 2000. The country exported 82 percent of its
crude oil production in 2012, while it imported oil products and electricity.

Electricity generation in Iraq relied mainly on natural gas, crude oil, and oil products.
However, a portion of electricity was produced using other energies, mainly hydropower.
Iraq imported increasing amounts of electricity since 2004, reaching 705 ktoe in 2012.
Generated electricity almost doubled between 2000 and 2012, reaching 5,307 ktoe in 2012.

Final energy consumption in Iraq originated from electricity, oil products, natural gas, and
other energies. In 2012, 86 percent of energy consumed in was generated from oil products
(compared to 83 percent in 2000), followed by 9 percent from electricity (compared to 12
percent) and 1 percent from natural gas (compared to 7 percent). These different energy
sources were used diversely between sectors, as shown in Figure 35. The transport sector is
the largest energy-consuming sector. While the industrial sector used to be the second most
intensive sector in 2000, residential sector consumption increased to become the second
most intensive sector in 2012. Tertiary and agricultural and fishing sectors remained
relatively stable at 2 and 1 percent, respectively, of total consumption.

The final energy intensity of the industry sector was 0.247 toe/1,000 USD in 2012. A
country-tailored benchmark based on the structure of the industrial sector, its evolution,
and other country performances was set at 0.18 toe/1,000 USD. The EE potential for the
industry sector based on the energy intensity in terms of final energy was 1,085 ktoe in
2012. The EE potential represented 27 percent of energy consumed by this sector.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 538 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total EE
potential for the sector at 1,622 ktoe. The average emission factor of the industry sector
amounted to 4.1 teCO2/toe, while the CO2 intensity of the industry sector was 1.0
teCO2/1,000 USD in 2012.

      ii. Transport

The total energy intensity of the transport sector was 0.594 toe/1,000 USD in 2012, while
the average energy unit consumption of cars was 960 Kgoe/car/yr. The country-tailored
benchmark of 1,000 kgoe/car/yr, along with an estimation of 30 percent of fuel smuggling
that was unaccounted for in the average energy unit consumption of cars, led to an
estimated EE potential in terms of final energy and based on the specific consumption of
cars, for the transport sector at 730 ktoe in 2012. The EE potential represented 6 percent of
total energy consumed by the transport sector.

The average emission factor of the transport sector was 2.94 teCO 2/toe in 2012, with a CO2
intensity of the transport sector of 1.75 teCO 2/1,000 USD. The motorization rate was 8.5
persons/vehicle in 2012, including the Kurdistan area.

     iii. Tertiary

The energy intensity of the tertiary sector was 0.057 toe/1,000 USD in 2012. A country-
tailored benchmark based on the Plan Bleu Study was set at 0.045 toe/1,000 USD, which
estimated the EE potential for the tertiary sector in terms of final energy based on energy
intensity at 78 ktoe for 2012.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 125 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total EE
potential for the sector at 203 ktoe.

      iv. Residential

produced natural gas at a rate of 121 ktoe in 2012 and geothermal and solar energies at
140 ktoe. The country relies mostly on imports of natural gas, crude oil, and oil products to
meet its local demands. In 2012, imports amounted to 7,903 ktoe, an increase of 66
percent from 2000. Crude oil and oil products were largest share of imports, of which they
constituted 91 percent of total imports in 2012. Jordan exported only electricity at varying
rates, reaching 26 ktoe in 2012.

Total primary energy available amounted to 7,463 ktoe in 2012 compared to 4,805 ktoe in
2000. Crude oil and oil products amounted to 96 percent of total available primary energy.
Electricity generation also depended heavily on oil products in 2012 at 81 percent and 19
percent for natural gas. Total electricity generated in Jordan reached 1,427 ktoe in 2012,
compared to 634 ktoe in 2000.

Final energy consumption by end-use sectors as per fuel input amounted to 5,932 ktoe in
2012 and is allocated as follows: 4,448 ktoe for oil products; 1,228 ktoe for electricity; and
127 ktoe for other energies. This is in comparison to 2000, when the main energy sources
were 2,817 ktoe for oil products, 527 ktoe for electricity, and 71 ktoe for other energies.

The largest energy-consuming sector was transport, with a consumption of 2,521 ktoe in
2012 (compared to 1,199 ktoe in 2000), followed by residential at 1,389 ktoe (compared to

4.5.4.1 Electricity Generation
Total generated electricity amounted to 1,427 ktoe in 2012, increasing from 634 ktoe in
2000 at an average annual rate of 6.4 percent. The country tailored benchmark for power
generation efficiency, based on the electricity sector situation and international references,
was set at 44 percent. Using the power generation efficiency that was calculated at 40.2
percent for 2012, the EE potential was estimated to be 135 ktoe in 2012. The specific
consumption of power generation was 214 toe/GWh in 2012.

The transmission and distribution electricity losses were 17.3 percent in 2012, of which 4
percent was for transmission losses and 13.3 percent for distribution losses. The sub-
regional benchmarks were set at 3 percent for transmission and 8 percent for distribution,
which resulted in an EE potential at 14 ktoe for transmission losses and 75 ktoe for
distribution losses. The total EE potential for transmission and distribution was 89 ktoe. The
total EE potential of the electricity sector, in terms of primary energy, was 224 ktoe in
2012.

The final energy intensity of the industry sector in Jordan was 0.41 toe/1,000 USD in 2012.
A country-tailored benchmark based on the structure of the industrial sector, its evolution,
and other country performances was set at 0.32 to estimate the EE potential in terms of
final energy based on energy intensity at 250 ktoe in 2012. The EE potential for industry
represented 22 percent of total energy consumed by this sector in 2012. In addition, out of
the nine energy-intensive sectors, data suggests the EE potential for steel industries at 5
ktoe and the EE potential for paper industries at 3 ktoe.

The final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy was 98
ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total EE potential
for the sector at 348 ktoe.

The average emission factor of the industry sector was 4.1 teCO2/toe in 2012 while the CO2
energy intensity was 1.7 teCO2/1,000 USD in 2012, a decrease of 3 percent from 2000.

      ii. Transport

The average energy unit consumption of gasoline cars was 1,174 kgoe/car/yr in 2012,
decreasing from 2,178 kgoe/car/yr in 2000. The EE potential for the transport sector, in
terms of final energy was based on the consumption of road transport only due to lack of
data for other transportation means, such as air, maritime and railways. The EE potential
was 169 ktoe in 2012, based on a regional benchmark from three MENA countries. The EE
potential represented 7 percent out of total energy consumed by this sector in 2012.

The average emission factor of the transport sector was 2.9 teCO2/toe in 2012, constant in
comparison with 2000. The CO2 intensity of the sector was 0.7 teCO2/1,000 USD in the
same year, compared to 0.8 in 2000. The motorization rate in Jordan for 2012 was 7.7
persons per vehicle.

     iii. Tertiary

The final energy intensity of the tertiary sector was 0.062 toe/1,000 USD in 2012. Based on
the country-tailored benchmark from the Plan Bleu study that was set at 0.043, the EE
potential for the tertiary sector, in terms of final energy and based on energy intensity, was
184 ktoe. The EE potential represented 30 percent of total energy consumed by this sector
in 2012.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 182 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total EE
potential for the sector at 365 ktoe.

The average emission factor for the tertiary sector in Jordan amounted to 5.9 teCO 2/toe in
2012, compared to 5.2 teCO2/toe in 2000. The CO2 intensity of the sector was 0.4
teCO2/1,000 USD in the same year, compared to 0.4 in 2000.



                                                                                              59

     iv. Residential

The energy intensity of the residential sector was 0.124 toe/1,000 USD for 2012, while the
specific consumption of energy per unit area was 7.6 kgoe/m2/yr. The EE potential for the
residential sector in terms of final energy was 311 ktoe, based on country-tailored
benchmark from the Plan Bleu study that was set at 5.9 Kgoe/m2/yr for the specific
consumption of energy for this sector. The EE potential represented 22 percent out of total
energy consumed by this sector in 2012.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 176 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total EE
potential for the sector at 486 ktoe.

The unit consumption of energy per dwelling was 912 kgoe/Dw in 2012, while the unit
consumption of electricity per dwelling was 4,024 Kwh/Dw in the same year. In addition,
the average emission factor for the sector amounted to 4.4 teCO 2/toe while the CO2
intensity was 0.5 teCO2/1,000 USD.

      v. Agriculture and Fishing Sector

The final intensity of the agriculture sector was 0.32 toe/1,000 USD in 2012. The country-
tailored benchmark for the agriculture sector was set at 0.28 based on estimations,
providing an EE potential in terms of final energy, at 20 ktoe based on energy intensity.
There was no information available regarding the intensity of the fishing sector; therefore, it
was not possible to provide an EE potential estimation for this subsector.

4.5.5 Energy Efficiency Potential 2020 and 2025
The technical EE potential projected for 2020 and 2025 amounts to 2,126 ktoe and 2,046
ktoe, respectively. The EE potential was projected based on the annual sectoral variation for
2000 to 2012. Based on the projected values of 2025, the total EE potential represents 13
percent of TPES. Figure 49 shows the percentages of the subsectors with their projected EE
potential, while Figure 50 shows the variation of the EE potential for 2012, 2020, and 2025.

4.5.6 Cost of Conserved Energy Curve
The total cost-effective electricity efficiency potential – 206 ktoe – for a set of technologies
shown in Table 20 below, accounts for only 19 percent of the total identified electricity
efficiency potential. The main reason behind this fact is that there exist a lot of EE sectoral
and transversal technologies and measures that are not listed in this assessment.

As there are more technologies listed in the residential sector than in other sectors, the
coverage is higher in this sector (without SWH) and lower in the tertiary and industry.
Furthermore, as fuels account for the largest share of total EE potential —up to 75 percent of
total EE potential in Jordan—the need to undertake deeper research as the BAC expands the
technology scope and also include fuel consumption is highlighted.

The residential sector dominates with 62 percent of the total EE potential, followed by
tertiary at 23 percent and industry at 15 percent. In terms of technologies, SWH accounts
for the largest share with 63 percent, while the shares of other technologies, such as
electric motors at 10 percent and efficient lighting at 5 percent, are much lower.

The needed annual investment cost to realize this electricity efficiency potential is USD 36
million, mostly in the residential sector which represents 55 percent. SWH and building
insulation account for the largest shares within the residential sector at 61 percent and 17
percent, respectively. Over the period 2012 to 2020, the total investment of USD 288
million will largely be compensated by net (negative) abatement cost savings of USD 4,705
million.

The main results include an estimated 480 MW of avoidable electricity capacity, which is
equivalent to 14.5 percent of the existing installed capacity. Such avoided new investment
of power capacities would be equivalent to USD 527 million (using CCGT technology). Added
to the end-customers reductions in electricity expenditures of USD 261 million, Jordan
would save above USD 790 Million, or over 2.30 percent of its actual GDP at the current
price.

4.6   Kuwait

4.6.1 Overview of Energy Demand and Supply
Total energy production in Kuwait increased from 114,317 ktoe in 2000 to 173,252 ktoe in
2012. This increase is due to the increase in the production of crude oil during the same
period. Kuwait did not import energy until 2009, when natural gas importation started with
728 ktoe and reached 2,164 ktoe in 2012. However, the country exported almost 80
percent of its production in 2012 as crude oil and oil products.

Electricity is mainly generated from natural gas and oil products. An increase was recorded
in the values of oil products from 4,494 ktoe in 2000 to 8,337 ktoe in 2012, while natural
gas fuel input increased from 2,287 ktoe in 2000 to 5,573 ktoe in 2012. Crude oil values as
fuel input to generate electricity amounted to 2,338 ktoe in 2012, compared to 1,803 ktoe
in 2000. Total electricity generated reached 5,388 ktoe in 2012, compared to 2,780 ktoe in
2000.

In the petrochemicals sector, 18,428 ktoe was used in 2012, compared to 10,656 ktoe in
2000. The country used 11 percent of its production in this sector in 2012, while it
amounted to 9 percent in 2000.

Final energy consumption by end-use sectors increased from 8,441 ktoe in 2000 to 16,787
ktoe in 2012, with a significant increase in the consumption of oil products. The
consumption of energy by the industry sector was the highest in Kuwait, at 47 percent in
2000, decreasing to 39 percent in 2012. The transport sector increased by 5 percent to
reach 33 percent in 2012. Residential and tertiary sectors slightly increased between the
same period to reach 19 and 9 percent, respectively.

          iv. Residential

The total EE potential for the residential sector in Kuwait, in terms of final energy, was 704
ktoe in 2012, based on a country-tailored percentage benchmark based on set of GCC
individual audits, studies and expert analysis, and the total consumption of energy by the
residential sector. Data for energy intensity for the residential sector was unavailable; hence
the percentage was used to estimate the total EE potential.

4.7   Lebanon

4.7.1 Overview of Energy Supply and Demand
Lebanon is one of the two MENA countries under review that does not have energy
production from conventional sources through 2012. Energy was produced solely from
hydro power and renewable sources, at a value of 87 ktoe in 2012, compared to 39 ktoe in
2000. Energy production from combustible renewable and waste amounted to 119 ktoe in
2012, compared to 130 ktoe in 2000, and geothermal and solar amounted to 20 ktoe in
2012, compared to 4 ktoe in 2000. Lebanon imports coal, oil products, and electricity,
amounting to 7,190 ktoe in 2012. The largest quantities in 2012 are for oil products at
6,997 ktoe (97 percent of total imports), 165 ktoe for coal (about 2 percent) and 28 ktoe
for electricity. Lebanon does not export energy products.

Total primary energy available for consumption was about 7,149 ktoe in 2012, compared to
4,906 ktoe in 2000, comprising mainly of oil products, coal, hydro power, renewable
electricity, and combustible renewable and waste. Total electricity generated was about
1,275 ktoe in 2012, increasing by almost 52 percent from 2000.

Final energy consumed for 2012 was 4,386 ktoe, compared to 3,289 ktoe in 2000. In 2006,
Israel launched a one-month war on Lebanon, affecting the energy sector by striking a
power plant and industries, causing a decrease in the total energy available for consumption
and energy consumed during that year. Transport sector was the largest energy-consuming
sector, with 43 percent in 2000 and growing to 42 percent of total energy available for
consumption in 2012 at 1,839 ktoe. Residential was the second most energy-consuming
sector in 2000 at 30 percent and increased to 32 percent in 2012 at 1,434 ktoe. The
industry sector decreased from 17 percent of total energy consumption to 13 percent in
2012 at 595 ktoe. Finally, tertiary, and agriculture and fishing sectors consumed 4 and 6
percent, respectively, in 2000 and increased to consume 5 and 8 percent in 2012, at 342
ktoe and 204 ktoe, respectively.

4.7.4.1 Electricity Generation
Total electricity generated in Lebanon in 2012 was 1,275 ktoe, with an average annual
increase of 3.3 percent from 2000. The power generation efficiency in the country was
estimated at 33 percent in 2012, excluding electricity imports. The country-tailored
benchmark was set at 50 percent, which estimated the EE potential at 649 ktoe in 2012.
The specific consumption of power generation was 235 toe/GWh in 2012.

The total transmission and distribution electricity losses amounted to 45 percent in 2012.
However, according to PWMSP, 26 percent of the losses were due to non-payment of
electricity bills, while the technical distribution losses were estimated at 14 percent and
transmission losses at 5 percent. Using the sub-regional benchmark of 3 percent for
transmission losses and 8 percent for distribution losses, the transmission and distribution
EE potential was 102 ktoe, of which 26 ktoe for transmission and 76 ktoe for distribution.

The total EE potential for the electricity sector, in terms of primary energy, was 751 ktoe for
2012.




19Estimations for electricity sector are in terms of primary energy, estimations for transport and agriculture and fishing sectors
are in terms of final energy, while estimations for industry, residential and tertiary sectors are in terms of primary and final
energy.

4.7.4.2 End-Use Sectors
      i. Industry

The final energy intensity of the industry sector was 0.099 toe/1,000 USD in 2012. The EE
potential for the industry sector in terms of final energy was 82 ktoe using the country-
tailored benchmark of 0.085 based on the structure of the industry sector, its evolution, and
other country performances. The EE potential consisted of 14 percent of the total energy
consumed by the industry sector in 2012.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 74 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total EE
potential for the sector at 157 ktoe.

The average emission factor of the industry sector amounted to 9.9 teCO 2/toe in 2012,
while the CO2 intensity was 0.98 teCO2/1,000 USD for the same year.

      ii. Transport

The final energy intensity of the transport sector, including road transportation only,
amounted to 0.06 toe/1,000 USD in 2012, while the average energy unit consumption of
cars amounted to 793 kgoe/car/yr. The inaccuracy of data has led to estimating the EE
potential, in terms of final energy, at 20 percent of total energy consumed by the sector in
2012, which corresponds to 280 ktoe.

The average emission factor for this sector was 2.9 teCO2/toe in 2012, while the CO2
intensity of the sector was 0.17 teCO2/1,000 USD in the same year (compared to 0.22 in
2000), and a motorization rate of 2.22 persons per vehicle.

     iii. Tertiary

The final energy intensity of the tertiary sector amounted to 0.013 toe/1,000 USD in 2011.
The country-tailored benchmark of 0.012 toe/1,000 USD based on the Plan Bleu study
estimates the EE potential for the tertiary sector in terms of final energy to be 25 ktoe in
2011.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted into primary
energy was 41 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the
total EE potential for the sector at 66 ktoe.

The average emission factor was 7.8 teCO2/toe in 2012, while the CO2 intensity of the
sector amounted to 0.1 teCO2/1,000 USD the same year.

     iv. Residential

The EE potential, in terms of final energy, was 347 ktoe in 2012, using the specific
consumption of energy per unit area (8.18 kgoe/m2/yr for 2010), the country-tailored
benchmark (which is 6.2 kgoe/m2/yr based on the Plan Bleu study), and total energy
consumed by the sector in 2012. The energy intensity of the residential sector was 0.055
toe/1000 USD, compared to 0.051 toe/1,000 USD in 2000.

                                                                                              75
           MENA – Delivery Mechanisms and Institutions to Realize Energy Efficiency Potential


In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was equivalent to 190 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy
estimated the total EE potential for the sector at 537 ktoe.

The unit consumption of energy per dwelling was 1,273 kgoe/Dw in 2012, an increase of 42
percent from 2000. On the other hand, the average emission factor of the residential sector
was 0.6 teCO2/toe in 2011 and the CO2 intensity was 0.03 teCO2/1,000 USD.

      v. Agriculture and Fishing Sector

The final energy intensity of agriculture was 0.179 toe/1,000 USD in 2012. Due to lack of
data for the energy intensity of fishing, the total EE potential for the agriculture and fishing
sector, in terms of final energy, was estimated at 29 ktoe in 2012 using the country
benchmark based on estimations.

4.7.5 Energy Efficiency potential 2020 and 2025
The technical EE potential projected for 2020 and 2025 is 2,242 ktoe and 2,434 ktoe,
respectively. The EE potential was projected based on the annual sectoral variation for
2000 to 2012. Based on the projected values of 2025, the total EE potential represents 33
percent of TPES. Figure 65 shows the percentages of the subsectors with their projected EE
potential, while Figure 66 shows the variation of the EE potential for 2012, 2020, and 2025.

4.7.6 Cost of conserved energy
Table 25 below lists the available data related to the electricity efficiency potential
abatement cost curve for Lebanon in 2020. It provides a combined estimation of electricity
efficiency potential and net abatement cost by end-use sectors for a set of EE technologies.

The total cost-effective electricity efficiency potential (93 ktoe) accounts for a significant
share reaching 39 percent of the total identified electricity efficiency potential. With almost
1,400 ktoe, the residential sector accounts for almost 51 percent of the total the electricity
efficiency potential followed by the industrial sector representing 38 percent and tertiary
only 12 percent. In terms of technologies, efficient lighting and housekeeping in the
residential sector represent together over 51 percent followed by efficient compressed air at
38 percent. SWH accounts here for a marginal share of 2 percent in the electricity efficiency
potential but is not covered in the residential sector.

The needed annual investment cost to realise this electricity efficiency potential is estimated
to 5.8 million USD, mostly in the residential sector with 70 percent. Over the period 2012 to
2020, the total investment cost of USD 46.4 million is largely compensated by the net
(negative) abatement cost of USD 2,300 million.

The electricity efficiency potential would materialise for end-customers in a reduction of
their electricity expenditures of USD 149 million every year over the period 2012-2020. On
the power generation side, the electricity efficiency potential corresponds to an avoidable
capacity of 182 MW or around 8 percent of Lebanon’s existing installed power capacity
(without private generation). Such avoided new investment on power capacities would be
equivalent to USD 200 million (using CCGT technology). Cumulating both consumption and
supply savings, Lebanon would then save every year above USD 350 million or 1.1% of its
actual GDP at current price.

4.8   Libya

4.8.1 Overview of Energy Supply and Demand
Libya produces natural gas and crude oil, with a significantly higher proportion of crude oil.
Most of the crude oil produced is exported (88 percent in 2012 compared to 73 percent in
2000). Libya imports oil products and a relatively small quantity of electricity, while its
exports include crude oil, natural gas, and oil products. It is worth mentioning that during
the Libyan revolution in 2011, the oil industry witnessed a sudden drop in production and
exports of crude oil and natural gas due to security issues. However, the sector quickly
recovered in 2012 with the resumption of production and exports, albeit at a lower level
than in 2010. Primary energy available for consumption in Libya amounted to 17,144 ktoe
in 2012 compared to 15,903 ktoe in 2000.

The main fuels used for electricity generation are natural gas and oil products. Available
data shows a steady increase in the use of natural gas between 2000 and 2012, where its
use increased from 860 ktoe in 2000 to 3,401 ktoe in 2012. On the other hand, electricity
generation doubled between in that period to reach 2,922 ktoe.

Final energy consumed in Libya by end-use sectors depends on oil products, electricity, and
natural gas. Although the variation is minimal between 2000 and 2012 (9,388 ktoe in 2000
and 10,461 ktoe in 2012), we can say that the political situation shift in 2011 had a
significant impact on the energy use sector. Figure 67 shows the variation between the
various sectors and their energy consumption intensity between 2000 and 2012. The largest
energy-consuming sector in Libya was the transport sector (increasing from 54 percent in
2000 to 66 percent in 2012), followed by residential (decreasing from 22 percent to 15
percent in 2012), industrial (decreasing from 22 to 12 percent in 2012) and tertiary and
agriculture and fishing sectors representing 5 and 2 percent, respectively.

Total energy production in Morocco was 285 ktoe in 2012, mainly from natural gas, crude
oil, hydropower, and renewable electricity. The country heavily relies on imports of coal,
natural gas, crude oil, oil products, and electricity. Total imports amounted to 19,301 ktoe
in 2012, compared to 11,282 ktoe in 2000. The largest imports are those of oil products,
amounting to almost 48 percent of total imports in 2012, followed by crude oil at 28
percent, 16 percent for coal, 5.7 percent for natural gas, and 2.5 percent for electricity. The
country exported oil products only during the period under review, where exports decreased
from 1,472 ktoe in 2000 to 1,056 ktoe in 2012.

In 2012, fuel input for electricity generation came from coal (54 percent of total fuel
consumed for electricity generation), from oil products (28 percent), and from natural gas
(18 percent).

Final energy consumed amounted to 14,032 ktoe in 2012, an increase of 80 percent from
2000. The most used energy by end-use sectors in 2012 was oil products at 75 percent,
followed by electricity at 17 percent, natural gas at 0.5 percent, and coal at 0.1 percent.

The largest energy-consuming sector was the transport sector at a consumption rate of
5,334 ktoe in 2012, compared to 2,528 ktoe in 2000, followed by industry at 3,051 ktoe in
2012 compared to 1,887 ktoe in 2000; residential at 2,985 ktoe in 2012, compared to 1,224
ktoe in 2000; agriculture and fishing at 1,025 ktoe in 2012, compared to 1,359 ktoe; and
tertiary at 540 ktoe in 2012, compared to 257 ktoe in 2000. Of the end-use sectors, 41
percent of total energy was consumed by the transport sector, 24 percent by industry, 23

4.9.6 Cost of conserved energy
Table 30 below lists the available data on the electricity efficiency potential abatement cost
curve for Morocco in 2020. It provides a combined estimation of electricity efficiency
potential and net abatement cost by end-use sectors for a set of EE technologies.

The total cost-effective electricity efficiency potential (293 ktoe) accounts for 36 percent of
the total identified electricity efficiency potential. The residential sector accounts for 47
percent of this total with 4 EE technologies and SWH. Tertiary with street lighting and SWH
is the second largest sector with 30 percent followed by the industry with 23 percent (with
only one technology: compressed air).

The needed annual investment cost to realise this electricity efficiency potential is estimated
to USD 41 million, mostly in the residential sector with 46 percent. Compressed air would
account for the largest share of this investment cost with 36 percent of total. Over the
period 2012 to 2020, the total investment cost of USD 328 million is largely compensated
by the net (negative) abatement cost of USD 3,116 million.

The table above indicates that the electricity efficiency potential for end-customers would be
equivalent to an annual reduction of USD 380 million of their electricity bills over the period
2012-2020. On the power generation side, the electricity efficiency potential corresponds to
an annual avoidable capacity of 1,225 MW (equivalent to the projected coal-fired power
plant of Safi of 1,320 MW and thus to be one the largest in the country) or around 12
percent of Morocco’s existing installed power capacity. Avoiding such new investment on
power capacities would annually save USD 1,350 million (using CCGT technology).
Cumulating both consumption and supply savings, Morocco would then save every year
above USD 1,730 million or 1.9 percent of its actual GDP at current price.

Total energy production was 75,774 ktoe in 2012, compared to 60,451 ktoe in 2000. Energy
was produced from natural gas and crude oil sources, with 65 percent from crude oil and 35
from natural gas. Oman imported oil products only up through 2008, when the country
started importing natural gas. Natural gas amounted to 1,735 ktoe in 2012. Eighty seven
percent of the energy production was exported in 2000, a figure that decreased to 70
percent in 2012.

The main electricity-producing fuels are natural gas and oil products, with 98 percent from
natural gas and 2 percent from oil products in 2012. Total electricity generated increased
from 784 ktoe in 2000 to 2,151 ktoe in 2012.

Final energy consumption by end-use sectors increased from 2,614 ktoe in 2000 to 19,205
ktoe in 2012. In 2000, the largest energy-consuming sector was industry, followed by
transport, residential, and tertiary, respectively. In 2012, the industry sector was the
largest energy-consuming sector, followed by transport, residential, tertiary, and agriculture
and fishing, respectively (Figure 83).

4.11 Palestine

4.11.1 Overview of Energy Supply and Demand
Palestine is the second MENA country under review that did not have production of energy
from fossil sources until 2012, and now produces only geothermal and solar energy. This
production amounted to 118 ktoe in 2012, compared to 102 ktoe in 2001. Total imports
were 1,142 ktoe, compared to 656 ktoe in 2001. Since energy production is very limited,
Palestine relies heavily on the imports of energy, which consists of more than 82 percent of
the total primary energy available for consumption.

Energy available for consumption amounted to 1,181 ktoe in 2012, while electricity
generated in the same year amounted to 40 ktoe, in addition to 422 ktoe of electricity
imported. The main conventional source of fuel for electricity production was oil products, of
which 137 ktoe were consumed to generate electricity in 2012, compared to 8 ktoe in
2001.

Final energy consumed by end-use sectors amounted to 1,297 ktoe in 2012, a 100 percent
increase from 2001. The distribution of energy consumed by sector remained relatively
stable, with the residential sector consuming the largest quantity of fuel, followed by
transport, tertiary, industry, and agriculture and fishing. Total energy consumed in the
residential sector in 2011 amounted to 574 ktoe, transport to 305 ktoe, tertiary to 92 ktoe,
industry to 68 ktoe, and 5 ktoe for the agriculture and fishing sector.

In 2001, residential sector consumed 412 ktoe, transport 129 ktoe, tertiary 55 ktoe, and
industrial 51 ktoe.

4.11.4.1 Electricity Generation
Palestine generated 40 ktoe of electricity in 2012, at an average annual variation of 11
percent since 2002. The power generation efficiency was 29 percent in 2012. The country-
tailored benchmark was set at 40 percent, estimating a power generation EE potential of 15
ktoe in 2012. The specific consumption of power generation was 296 toe/GWh in 2012.

Total transmission and distribution loss of electricity was 25 percent in 2012; 6 percent for
transmission losses and 19 percent for distribution losses. The sub-regional benchmarks set
at 3 percent for transmission losses and 11 percent for distribution losses, have estimated
the EE potential at 1 ktoe for the transmission losses and 5 ktoe for the distribution losses.
The total EE potential of the electricity sector, in terms of primary energy, was 21 ktoe in
2012.

4.11.4.2 End-Use Sectors
      i. Industry

The final energy intensity of the industry sector was 0.088 toe/1,000 USD in 2011. The
country-tailored benchmark was set at 0.066 toe/1,000 USD, based on the structure of the
industry sector, its evolution, and other country performances. This benchmark provides an
estimation of the EE potential for the industry sector, in terms of final energy, at 18 ktoe in

23Estimations for electricity sector are in terms of primary energy, estimations for transport and agriculture and fishing sectors
are in terms of final energy, while estimations for industry, residential and tertiary sectors are in terms of primary and final

2011. This EE potential represented 26 percent of the sector’s total energy consumption in
2011.

The average emissions factor of the industry sector was 0.72 teCO2/toe in 2011 while the
CO2 intensity emissions factor was 0.06 teCO2/1,000 USD the same year.

      ii. Transport

The final energy intensity of the transport sector was 0.047 toe/1,000 USD in 2011. Using
the benchmark based on the total energy consumption of the transport sector and Jordan’s
EE potential for personal car share of 17.4 percent, the EE potential for the transport sector,
in terms of final energy, was estimated at 53 ktoe for 2011, based solely on road transport
information due to missing data regarding maritime and air transports.

The average emissions factor of the transport sector was 2.9 teCO2/toe in 2011 while the
CO2 intensity emission factor was 0.14 teCO2/1,000 USD the same year.

     iii. Tertiary

The final energy intensity of the tertiary sector was 0.213 toe/1,000 USD in 2009. The EE
potential, in terms of final energy, was 28 ktoe using the percentage of the EE potential of
Jordan due to lack of reliable data on the value-added of the tertiary sector and the total
energy consumption of the sector in 2011.

The average emissions factor amounted to 0.59 teCO2/toe in 2009 and the CO2 intensity of
the tertiary sector was 0.125 teCO2/1,000 USD in the same year.

     iv. Residential

The intensity of the residential sector was 0.094 toe/1,000 USD in 2012, while the specific
consumption of energy per unit area was 11.83 kgoe/m2/yr the same year. Using the
country-tailored benchmark based on Jordan EE potential percentage of the residential
sector set at 50 percent and the total energy consumption of the residential sector of 2011,
the EE potential, in terms of final energy was estimated to be 288 ktoe in 2012.

The unit consumption of energy per dwelling was 592 kgoe/Dw in 2012, while the unit
consumption of electricity per dwelling was 2,206 Kwh/Dw. The average emissions factor
amounted to 1 teCO2/toe in 2012 while the CO2 intensity of the residential sector was 0.183
teCO2/1,000 USD.

      v. Agriculture and Fishing Sector

The final energy intensity of the agriculture sector was 0.014 ktoe in 2011; however, data
was not available for the fishing sector. The EE potential for the agriculture and fishing
sector in terms of final energy was 0.8 Ktoe using the percentage of the Jordan EE potential
for the agriculture energy intensity.

4.11.5 Energy Efficiency Potential 2020 and 2025
The technical EE potential projected for 2020 and 2025 was 576 ktoe and 671 ktoe,
respectively. The EE potential was projected based on the annual sectoral variation for 2011
to 2011. Based on the projected values of 2025, the total EE potential represents 21
percent of TPES. Figure 97 shows the percentages of the subsectors with their projected EE
potential, while Figure 98 shows the variation of the EE potential for 2011, 2020, and 2025.

exported 75 percent of its natural gas production in 2012, or 105,565 ktoe. In 2012, crude
oil exports increased by 53 percent to 52,459 ktoe and oil products exports increased to
22,831 ktoe.

The total available primary energy for consumption was 37,922 ktoe in 2012, triple that in
2000. A large quantity of oil produced is used in the petrochemical sector, amounting to
almost 9 percent of total production. In addition, 4,381 ktoe was used in 2012 for non-
energy purposes compared to 2,216 ktoe in 2000, mainly as feedstock in the petrochemical
processes.

Qatar relies on natural gas for electricity generation, using 2,992 ktoe in 2012 to produce
electricity. Electricity constituted 13 percent of total energy consumed in the country that
year, along with 32 percent for oil products and 26 percent for natural gas. In 2000, natural
gas constituted the most-commonly used energy at 36 percent; 15 percent of electricity
was produced from oil products and 10 percent from electricity.

Energy consumption by sector went through a large change in the most-consuming sectors.
While in 2000 industry was the largest energy-consuming sector at 2,220 ktoe, followed by
transport at 812 ktoe, residential at 349 ktoe, and tertiary 113 ktoe, energy consumed in
2012 followed the same trend with the transport sector consuming around 3,522 ktoe,
industrial at 6,043 ktoe, residential at 916 ktoe and tertiary at 359 ktoe.

Total primary energy supplied in Qatar was 37,922 ktoe in 2012, increasing from 10,921
ktoe in 2000, of which 40 percent was consumed by end-use sectors.

The total EE potential in 2012 was 4,442 ktoe,24 of which 19 percent was for the electricity
sector and 81 percent for end-use sectors. Out of the end-use sectors, the highest EE
potential was for industry at 41 percent. The EE potential for the rest of the sectors was 20
percent for transport, 14 percent for residential and 6 percent for tertiary. Data for
agriculture and fishing sector was not available to estimate EE potential. The EE potential
represented 12 percent of total primary energy supplied in 2012.

4.13.4 Energy Efficiency Potential
Saudi Arabia is the largest energy-producing, -consuming and -exporting MENA country. Its
total primary energy supply reached 200,249 ktoe in 2012, compared to 97,853 ktoe in
2000. The final energy consumption for end-use sectors reached 133,106 ktoe in 2012 and
accounts for over 30 percent of that of the entire MENA region.

Saudi Arabia’s total EE potential was estimated for 2012 to be 48,900 ktoe,26 of which 31
percent is used by the electricity sector and 69 percent by end-use sectors. The EE potential
accounted for 24.4 percent of total primary energy consumption. Within the end-use
sectors, transport, and residential account for 23 percent each, industry 16 percent, tertiary
13 percent, and agriculture and fishing 0.1 percent.

4.14 Sudan

4.14.1 Overview of Energy Supply and Demand
Sudan’s energy production was 34,756 ktoe in 2011, mainly from crude oil, hydro, and
combustible renewable and waste, up 74 percent from 2000. It is worth noting that the
energy production for Sudan for 2012 decreased to 17,320 ktoe due to the situation
between South Sudan and Sudan that led to a halt in energy production. Sudan relies
heavily on exporting its oil products; exports increased from 7,297 ktoe in 2000 to 18,991
ktoe in 2011. Energy available for consumption increased during the same period, from
13,308 to 16,605 ktoe.

Final energy consumption amounted to 10,989 ktoe in 2011, compared to 7,332 ktoe in
2000. Final energy consumed in 2011 came from other energies (61 percent) mainly
combustible renewable and waste, oil products (32 percent), and electricity (5 percent).
Electricity generation was 100 percent dependent on oil products in 2011. Total electricity
generated amounted to 727 ktoe in 2011, compared to 221 ktoe in 2000.

Figure 115 shows the energy consumed by sectors between 2000 and 2011. The largest
energy-consuming sector was residential, followed by transport, industry, tertiary and
agriculture and fishing. The evolution between 2000 and 2011 saw a decrease by 14
percent in the residential sector (at 5,061 ktoe in 2011), an increase by 10 percent in the
transport sector (at 2,540 ktoe), an increase by 5 percent for tertiary (at 1,659 ktoe), a
decrease of 1 percent for the agriculture and fishing sector (at 81 ktoe), and a steady
industry sector at 15 percent (at 1,581 ktoe).

oil, an increase of 6 percent from 2000. Energy exports increased from 3,577 ktoe in 2000
to 3,710 ktoe in 2012, while its imports increased in the same period from 4,390 ktoe to
6,712 ktoe. Tunisia used to import coal but stopped in 2003. Energy available for national
consumption increased from 6,298 ktoe in 2000 to 11,796 ktoe in 2012.

Final energy consumption was 6,052 ktoe in 2012 compared to 5,285 ktoe in 2000,
representing the slowest final energy consumption increase in the region at 15 percent.
Final energy consumed in 2012 came from oil products (59 percent), natural gas (21
percent), and electricity (21 percent). The largest contributor to electricity generation was
natural gas at 99.95 percent in 2012, while the rest relied on other fuels and renewables.
Total electricity generated amounted to 1,547 ktoe in 2012, compared to 911 ktoe in 2000.

Figure 123 shows the energy consumed by sectors between 2000 and 2012. The largest
energy-consuming sector was industry, followed by transport, residential, tertiary, and
agriculture and fishing. The evolution between 2000 and 2012 saw a slight decrease in the
industrial sector (at 2,008 ktoe in 2012), constant for transport (at 1,878 ktoe in 2012), an
increase by 2 percent for residential (at 1,024 ktoe in 2012) and constant for tertiary and
agriculture and fishing (at 583 ktoe and 405 ktoe, respectively, in 2012).

It is worth mentioning that the political revolution in 2010 to 2011 had little impact on the
energy sector in terms of production, imports, exports, and consumption.

4.15.4.2 End-Use Sectors
      i. Industry

The final energy intensity of the industrial sector was 0.604 toe/1,000 USD in 2012. A
country-tailored benchmark of 0.45 toe/1,000 USD was set based on the structure of the
industry sector, its evolution, and other country performances. This benchmark estimated
the EE potential of the industry sector in terms of final energy at 511 ktoe in 2012, 26
percent of the total energy consumed by the sector. Out of the nine energy-intensive
industries, data was only available for cement, which has an estimated potential based on
specific energy at 398 ktoe in 2012.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 165 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total EE
potential for the sector at 677 ktoe.

The average emissions factor of the industry sector was 2.27 teCO2/toe in 2012, a decrease
of almost 9 percent since 2000. The CO2 intensity was 1.37 teCO2/1,000 USD, a 28 percent
decrease since 2000).

      ii. Transport

The final energy intensity of the transport sector was 0.09 toe/1,000 USD for 2012 while
the average energy unit consumption of cars was 1,136 kgoe/car/yr. EE potential in terms
of final energy was 251 ktoe for the transport sector based on the energy unit consumption
of cars and using a country-tailored benchmark of 950 Kgoe/car/yr. The EE potential for the
transport sector was based on road transport only due to lack of data for railways, air, and
maritime transport. The total EE potential represented 13 percent of total energy consumed
by this sector in 2012.

The average emissions factor for the transport sector was 3.6 teCO2/toe in 2012, and CO2
intensity of 0.33 teCO2/1,000 USD, down from 0.45 in 2000. On the other hand, the
motorization rate in Tunisia decreased from 12.74 persons per vehicle in 2000 to 8.01
persons per vehicle in 2012.

     iii. Tertiary

The final energy intensity of the tertiary sector in 2012 was 0.053 toe/1,000 USD. Using the
country-tailored benchmark based on the Plan Bleu study set at 0.035 toe/1,000 USD, the
EE potential in terms of final energy was estimated to be 195 ktoe in 2012. The EE potential
represented 33 percent of total energy consumed by this sector in 2012.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 155 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total EE
potential for the sector at 349 ktoe.

The average emission factor was 1.8 teCO2/toe in 2012, compared to 2 teCO2/toe in 2000.
The CO2 intensity of the tertiary sector was 0.1 teCO2/1,000 USD, compared to 0.2
teCO2/1,000 USD in 2000.


                                                                                             129

     iv. Residential

The energy intensity of the residential sector was 0.077 toe/1,000 USD in 2012, down from
0.101 toe/1,000 USD in 2000. The specific consumption of energy per unit area was 3.27
kgoe/m2/yr in 2012, increasing from 3 kgoe/m2/yr in 2000. The reference indicator—a
chosen-specific consumption of energy per unit area —combined with a country-tailored
benchmark based on the Plan Bleu study estimated the EE potential in terms of final energy
to be 209 ktoe in 2012. The total EE potential represented 20 percent of total energy
consumed by this sector in 2012.

In addition, the final electricity efficiency potential of the sector converted in primary energy
was 112 ktoe. This potential added to the EE potential in final energy estimated the total EE
potential for the sector at 321 ktoe.

The unit consumption of energy per dwelling decreased from 344 kgoe/Dw in 2000 to 327
kgoe/Dw in 2012. On the other hand, the average emissions factor was 2.1 teCO2/toe and
the CO2 intensity of the residential sector was 0.2 teCO2/1,000 USD in 2012.

      v. Agriculture and Fishing Sector

The final energy intensity of the agriculture sector was 0.18 toe/1,000 USD in 2012, while
the specific energy consumption for fishing was 0.88 toe/ton. The EE potential in terms of
final energy was 135 ktoe for 2012 for the agriculture and fishing sector using a country-
tailored benchmark based on estimations (0.14 for agriculture and 0.7 for fishing,
respectively).

4.15.5 Energy Efficiency Potential 2020 and 2025
The technical EE potential projected for 2020 and 2025 was 2,562 ktoe and 2,412 ktoe,
respectively. The EE potential was based on the annual sectoral variation for 2000 to 2012.
Based on the projected values of 2025, the total EE potential represents 14 percent of TPES.
Figure 129 shows the percentages of the subsectors with their projected EE potential, while

4.15.6 Cost of conserved energy
Table 39 below lists the available data on the electricity efficiency potential abatement cost
curve for Tunisia in 2020. It provides a combined estimation of electricity efficiency
potential and net abatement cost by end-use sectors for a set of EE technologies.

The total cost-effective electricity efficiency potential (659 ktoe) has been mostly identified
in the residential sector reaching 71 percent of the total identified electricity efficiency
potential36. Two technologies, efficient space heating in new buildings and efficient fridges,
accounted respectively for 39 percent and 50 percent of the total electricity efficiency
potential. The SWH contribution accounted for a small share of only 7 percent in the total
electricity efficiency potential which highlights the fact that is already greatly penetrated in
both sectors.

The needed annual investment cost to realise this electricity efficiency potential is estimated
to USD 64 million, most of it in the residential sector with 78 percent. Efficient space
heating and efficient fridges account for the largest shares of this cost with 20 percent and
62 percent, respectively. Over the period 2012 to 2020, the total investment cost of USD
695 million is largely compensated by the net (negative) abatement cost of USD 4,024
million.

  The industrial sector is not covered in the Budget Allocation Chart (BAC) owing to a lack of relevant data in this sector. At the
contrary, the availability and quality of detailed data in the residential sector BAC allowed to identify and detail various EE&RE
technologies, resulting in a higher coverage (ratio up to 3) of the total identified electricity efficiency potential.

Potential / Installed capacity
Notes:
(a) based on average avoided electricity cost in 2020: low voltage: 0,076 €/kWh or 1,148
USD/toe; medium voltage: 0,071 €/kWh or 1,073 USD/toe (BAC Tunisia, 2020)
(b) based on average electricity usage (hours/year)-without available data, hypothesis:
similar to power plant time usage-around 5,000 h/y (2012)
 Power plant time usage (hours/year): 4 430
(c) based on average investment cost of combined cycle (CCGT) of 850€/kW or 1,100
USD/kW (sources: IEA ETSAP, Fraunhofer Institut)


According to these results, the electricity efficiency potential over the period 2012-2020
would be equivalent for end-customers to an annual reduction of almost USD 756 million of
their electricity expenses. On the power generation side, the realisation of the electricity
efficiency potential would avoid to use a capacity of 1,730 MW or almost 43 percent of
Tunisia’s current existing installed power capacity. This would then avoid new investment of
almost USD 1,900 million (based on CCGT technology). Those savings consumption and
supply sides would then amount to USD 2,660 million or 12.7 percent of Tunisia’s actual
GDP at current price.

4.16 United Arab Emirates
The total energy production of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) amounted to 194,348 ktoe in
2012, compared to 156,403 ktoe in 2000. Much of this was due to an increase of crude oil
production from 123,013 ktoe in 2000 to 150,380 ktoe in 2012 and a parallel increase from
33,390 ktoe of natural gas production in 2000 to 43,968 ktoe in 2012. The country imports
and exports large quantities of fuel; for instance, the UAE imported natural gas (15,656
ktoe), oil products (17,628 ktoe) and coal (1,685 ktoe) in 2012 and exported crude oil
(120,593 ktoe), natural gas (6,154 ktoe), oil products (15,896 ktoe), and electricity (3
ktoe). Eight percent of produced energy was allocated for use in the petrochemicals sector,
compared to 5 percent in 2000, while 10 percent of produced energy was used for
international bunkers in the same year, up from 8 percent in 2000.

Total primary energy available for consumption was 67,402 ktoe for 2012, almost doubling
from 2000. Electricity generation relied on natural gas and oil products as fuel input, with
98 percent from natural gas and 2 percent from oil products. In 2000, 97 percent of
electricity generation was from natural gas and 3 percent from oil products. Total electricity
generated amounted to 8,680 ktoe in 2012, compared to 3,435 ktoe in 2000.

Total energy consumed in the UAE was 49,964 ktoe for 2012, an increase of 100 percent
from 2000. The main energy sources in 2012 were natural gas (29,015 ktoe), oil products
(10,990 ktoe), electricity (6,433 ktoe), and coal (1,685 ktoe).

The largest energy-consuming sector in 2012 was industry at 32,627 ktoe (compared to
16,614 ktoe in 2000), followed by transport at 14,372 ktoe (compared to 4,922 ktoe),
residential at 3,089 ktoe (compared to 1,284 ktoe), and tertiary at 2,852 ktoe (compared to
896 ktoe). Energy consumed for non-energy purposes was 1,841 ktoe in 2012, double that
in 2000.

4.17 Yemen

4.17.1 Overview of Energy Supply and Demand
The production of energy in Yemen mainly relied on crude oil until 2009, when the country
started producing natural gas, reaching a total of 8,604 ktoe in 2011. The production of
crude oil decreased from 21,952 ktoe in 2000 to 8,229 ktoe in 2012. Yemen imported 3,117
ktoe of oil products in 2012. The country exported crude oil and oil products until 2009,
when the export of natural gas started.

Electricity generated in Yemen is based on oil products only with a variation from 294 ktoe
in 2000 to 566 ktoe in 2012. Oil products were heavily consumed by end-use sectors,
representing about 90 percent of the total in 2012. Figure 139 represents the variation of
the energy consumed by end-use sectors between 2000 and 2012. The transport sector
consumed 45 percent of total energy available in 2000 and 43 percent in 2012, followed by
the residential sector from 22 percent in 2000 to 17 percent in 2012. Agriculture and fishing
sector decreased from 14 percent in 2000 to 13 percent in 2012.

Annex B: EE Potential Sectoral Assumptions


Energy sector: While data availability is generally higher in the MENA energy sectors, in
particular in the electricity sectors including in the GCC, the existence of EE indicators is less
common despite the significant or event dominant share of the sector in primary energy
consumption for hydrocarbon exporting countries. EE indicators measure the efficiency of
complex energy transformation processes of a relatively limited number of units such as
power plants and oil refineries. In most MENA countries, the energy sector accounts for a
large share of the primary energy consumption and is dominant in hydrocarbon exporter
countries.

Power generation: A synthetic and common EE indicator for this subsector is the power
generation efficiency, or the ratio between total fuel input and generated electricity,
including RE sources. It indicates the overall efficiency of the power generation system, not
only of thermal power plants.

While this indicator is relevant for an overall regional and international comparison of
thermal power generation, the specific structure (i.e. technology and fuels), base load, age
of the power plants stock, national power mix, and data and methodological issues such as
accounting of plant energy consumption accounted make difficult to adopt a regional
benchmark as a reference to estimate each country EE potential. This synthetic or
aggregated EE indicator as benchmark is more relevant when the structure and conditions
are comparable between countries. For instance, relatively high power generation efficiency
in a relatively new power generation sector, few large units, and stable base load may not
be a relevant benchmark for a sector with different structural characteristics.

Thus, country-tailored benchmarks for power generation efficiency have been set and are
based on the characteristics of the existing domestic generation system with a focus on the
most important or representative plants and its technical potential for improvements,
including fuel mix.

Electricity transmission and distribution: In a similar way, the electricity transmission
and distribution losses (i.e. the ratio between electricity generated or injected to the grid
and delivered) are frequently calculated and used. Nonetheless, some issues exist whether
to utilize this indicator as commercial losses or unpaid electricity may result in an erroneous
assessment and comparisons between countries. What is more, data may not be available
for transmission and distribution losses, although the respective EE potential and related
abatement measures are quite different.

While the characteristics of the electricity transmission, distribution systems, and load use
may differ between MENA countries in regards to power generation, the comparison of the
level of transmission and distribution losses is an effective measure to assess the grid
efficiency and its potential for improvements. Thus, instead of a MENA regional benchmark
based on the most performing system, it appears preferable to refine it by sub-region or
sub-groups. A first group may include relatively small and recent power grids (e.g. GCC)


                                                                                              154
         MENA – Delivery Mechanisms and Institutions to Realize Energy Efficiency Potential


while a second one would include established and developed medium to large power grids
(Maghreb countries).

In the case of Jordan, its electricity transmission and distribution losses reached 2.2 TWh or
199 ktoe in 2012, 17.3 percent of electricity generated. The actual transmission losses are
at 4 percent, while the sub-regional benchmark considered in this second group of countries
was set at 3 percent. The actual distribution losses were 13.3 percent while the benchmark
was set at 8 percent. This potential gain of 6.3 percent corresponds in 2012 to an EE
potential of 14.3 ktoe and 75.3 ktoe respectively.

An assumption in this case is that the EE potential applies simultaneously for the
transmission and distribution systems, as the gains on transmission shall increase the
electricity volumes injected to the distribution grid and thus the EE potential.

Oil refineries and gas treatment plants: The assessment of energy flows in an oil
refinery or a gas treatment plant for LNG differs considerably from the power sector. First,
processes of those units are much more complex and include for refineries multiple output
products. Additionally, auto-consumption of by-products and recovery of heat allow oil
refineries to reach total efficiency of around 95 percent while international data indicates up
to 97-98 percent in MENA and OECD countries. If the refinery purchases natural gas, then
the efficiency can reach up to 99 percent. The oil refining efficiency is generally estimated
based on the input crude oil and feedstock and oil product output derived from calorific
values. It is usually not available by oil product, which would inform deeper analysis of the
EE and thus its potential.

Further to the generic data uncertainty for narrow relative gains (95 percent to 96 percent
even if for significant energy input) and considering the diversity of refineries (size, age,
maintenance), of crude oil types and of oil outputs profiles in the MENA region, it seems
hazardous to make a comparable estimation of their efficiency and thus of EE potential.
Thus, it seems to be not possible to include this subsector in this transversal study with
insufficient data and methodological basis while it remains included in the energy balance.

For a precise assessment on this subsector, individual in-depth energy audits of oil
refineries gas and treatment plants are more appropriate tools to assess how energy is
consumed and thus its EE potential by energy use and products.

Energy end-use sectors: At the difference of the energy sector, EE indicators in end-use
sectors assess the efficiency of energy used by a large number of consuming units such as
households and individual cars for a broad range of products and services, providing a high
number of possible monetary and physical references but also potentially making complex
their elaboration and interpretation.

Industrial: A first EE indicator for the industry is the final energy intensity of the sector,
which consists of the ratio of total industrial energy consumption and total industrial added
value. While data availability is generally good in most MENA countries and it includes the
whole sector, this EE indicator appears too subject to the variations of the production value
and types of products (more or less energy intensive) to be reliably comparable over time
and between countries (owing to those structural sectoral differences). For instance, a light-
                                                                                          155
         MENA – Delivery Mechanisms and Institutions to Realize Energy Efficiency Potential


oriented industry would consume relatively less energy than heavy industry for generally
higher added value, translating into lower energy intensity. Nevertheless, it does not
indicate which industry uses energy more efficiently (at a thermodynamic level). Actually,
the heavy industry may be more energy efficient as energy accounts for a large share of its
costs and is used in large facilities (with economy of scale).

Such physical or thermodynamic efficiency is better assessed by the specific energy
consumption (generally in toe/ton of products). The RCREEE EE Indicators Study project
already identified seven energy-intensive and relatively standard products: cement, steel,
paper, sugar phosphate, super phosphate and phosphoric acid, the last three being more
specific to the South Mediterranean region. Two additional products are also considered in
this study: chemicals and glass. While specific energy consumption is a more reliable tool to
assess EE over time series and between individual plants and countries) they require
detailed data both on specific production and related energy consumption, which is rarely
available in multi-product plants. Data availability and the limited energy consumption
scope are the constraints of this indicator in this sector.

In Jordan, the specific energy consumption for steel was 0,067 toe/ton of steel in 2009. A
regional benchmarking indicates a target value of 0,055 toe/ton (based on three countries
only), or a potential gain of 18.1 percent or an EE potential of 4.7 ktoe.

Transport: Assessing EE in the transport sector is particularly complex owing to the
number and diversity of consuming units such as private and company cars, passenger and
freight vehicles, and local and international vehicles, as well as the lack of associated direct
and reliable metering of both energy consumption and services realized (e.g. number of
passengers and freight transported).

The final energy intensity of the transport sector has, as in the industry, the advantage of
covering the whole sector and modes but is constrained by similar weaknesses (evolution of
monetary values independently of the energy consumption, strong differences in transport
structure system between countries). Furthermore, the available final energy intensities are
related to total GDP (not total transport sector added value). Thus, the final energy intensity
of the transport sector appears as an insufficiently reliable indicator for this exercise at
national level and for country comparison purposes.

With road transport being the most important energy consumption and fastest growing
subsector, specific energy consumption ratios were prepared with a focus on personal or
private cars as data on commercial trucks and buses appear hardly available or reliable in
the MENA region. This ratio of the average energy unit consumption of cars (in
kgoe/car/year) include both gasoline and diesel private cars. Nonetheless, usually the
related gasoline and diesel are total data that also include consumption of commercial
vehicles, especially diesel for taxi, buses and trucks. Thus, as the diesel consumption is not
ventilated between those vehicle types, in some countries the average diesel unit
consumption of private cars may be significantly above the one for gasoline cars. Also, in
various countries, fuel smuggling can have significant and impacts consumption data
(underestimating when fuels illegally enter the country or the opposite when fuels are
smuggled abroad).

                                                                                             156
               MENA – Delivery Mechanisms and Institutions to Realize Energy Efficiency Potential


Despite those statistical limitations, a regional benchmark of 1,100 kgoe/car/year based on
five MENA countries and the EU average (750 kgoe/car/year) is proposed. This translates in
the case of Jordan for a potential gain of 17.4 percent and an EE potential of 169 ktoe in
2012 (equivalent to USD264 million).

For other transport modes as railways, air transport, and maritime transport for passenger
and freight, specific energy consumption ratios may also be prepared. Nevertheless, low
availability and reliability of data in MENA reduce its utility.

Tertiary: The definition of the tertiary sector in this study is based on the International
Classification of Industrial Statistics revision 4 (ISIC rev.4), which includes wholesale, retail
trade, restaurants, hotels (ISIC G-H), transport, storage, communication (ISIC I) and other
activities (ISIC J-P). For this reason, subsectoral energy data and activities are hardly
available without specific surveys. The energy balance provides energy consumption of the
entire sector, without disaggregation by branches. Because of this great heterogeneity,
activity data are either non-existent or scattered among a large number of institutions. Also,
there is clearly a significant lack of specific studies and surveys dedicated to the main
tertiary sector branches, which causes the partiality of available data.

The main indicator developed for the tertiary sector is the final energy intensity. In this
sector, the output is generally measured in monetary terms. Nonetheless, energy intensity
of the tertiary sector is influenced by many factors, including climate of the country and the
structure of the sector. For that reason, no firm conclusions are to be drawn from
comparisons between countries.

According to the study “Energy, Climate change and the Building Sector in the
Mediterranean: Regional Prospects” (Plan Bleu, 2010), the average intensity of the tertiary
sector for the southern Mediterranean region was 54 kgoe/1,000 USD 2000 in 2009
compared with 48 kgoe/1,000 USD 2000 in 2003, at an annual decreasing rate of 2 percent.

Lebanon, where bank activity is highly developed in the tertiary sector, presents the lowest
intensity (12 kgoe/1,000 USD of GDP41 in 2009). Banks have notably high added value with
low energy consumption compared with other activities, such as hotels or commerce. On
the opposite side of the spectrum, Morocco seems to have the highest energy intensity at
48 kgoe/1,000 USD of GDP in 2009. For the other countries, the intensities range from 33
to 57 kgoe/1,000 USD of GDP also in 2009.

Based on a 2 percent annual decrease of energy intensity of the tertiary sector with the
assumption that it may be uniform within this sub-region, the following country-tailored
benchmarks are proposed over the projection period in the following table:

For Jordan, the country-tailored benchmark of 40 kgoe/1,000 USD 2000 indicates a
potential gain of 27 percent, which when applied to a tertiary consumption of 0.6 Mtoe
indicates an EE potential of 164 ktoe in 2012.

In a complementary way, specific energy consumption ratios based on total or subsectoral
surface (kWh/m2/y) for the residential sector and on the number of employees
((kWh/emp/y) may be developed, taking into consideration the availability of related energy
and physical data. Sectorally, other specific energy consumption ratios have been developed
for specific sectors as for the hotels (kgoe/nigh guest) for several countries. Within the
specific energy consumption ratios for public lighting and water utilities (generally under the
administration responsibility or under concession) may also be prepared if coherent data are
accessible.

Residential: The residential sector generally includes as a large number of individual units,
which make complex effective and representative data collection.

For the residential sector, final energy intensity is defined as the ratio between the final
energy consumption of the sector and the private consumption of households at constant
prices (i.e. total households expenses). As for the other energy intensities, this sectoral
indicator has clear limitations as it is also influenced by external factors, this case being the
evolution of total household expenses, which are rarely connected with energy consumption.
On the energy side, this indicator is also influenced by climate conditions, building type,
appliance equipment rate, energy mix, or use of renewable energy. Thus, comparisons over
time and between countries of residential final energy intensities have to be carefully
reviewed.

Similarly as the tertiary sector and based on the same regional study, a set of country-
tailored energy intensity benchmarks for the residential sector is proposed in the following
table:




                                                                                             158

In addition, the specific consumption of energy per area unit is also used to assess the EE
potential (i.e. the ratio between the final energy consumption of the sector and the total
area of the dwellings). Based on four climatic zones and three socio-economic categories
developed by the study “Energy, Climate change and the Building sector in the
Mediterranean: Regional Prospects” (Plan Bleu, 2010), the following country-tailored energy
specific consumption country-tailored benchmarks for the residential sector are listed in this
table:

                                         Source: Plan Bleu


In the case of Jordan, the country-tailored benchmark implies a potential gain of 39.5
percent, which when applied to a residential consumption of 1.4 Mtoe indicates an EE
potential of 548 ktoe.

Agriculture and fisheries: For this relatively fragmented sector and multiple production
types, the use of final energy intensity appears as a good option to estimate the EE
potential. Final energy intensities of agriculture and fishing are based on those two sector’s
added values.


                                                                                          159
              MENA – Delivery Mechanisms and Institutions to Realize Energy Efficiency Potential


Additionally, when data is available and coherent, specific energy consumption for fishing is
a valuable indicator but only few countries have such detailed data.

Carbon dioxide intensity: The CO2 intensities of each sector and their average emission
factors are also included. The calculations are based on the IPCC emission factors for
primary energy sources such as crude oil, oil products, coal, and natural gas, while the CO2
emissions of the electricity sector are calculated through country electricity emission
factors (kgCO2/kWh) from the technical paper on electricity-specific emission factors for
grid electricity.42 For specific countries, such as Tunisia, CO2 emission data was provided by
a national organization. The purpose of calculating CO 2 emissions of each sector is to
identify the impact of using energy on the economy and the environment.

Annex D: Advisory group meeting results (Beirut and Marseille)


   1- Comments on the methodology, assumptions and interim results (energy projections
      and EE potential):

On data and definitions:

   - Definition of “tertiary” sector has to be clearly explained that it includes commercial sector as
     well;
   - Sources of data need to be clearly indicated in the final product;
   - Meaning of “EE potential for 2012” needs to be better explained;
   - The term “energy sector” in estimation of EE potential is misleading and needs to be replaced by
     more clear terminology to properly reflect power generation, transmission and distribution;


On methodology and assumptions:

   - On the results of EE potential, it would be more valuable to have break-down of sectors into
     more detailed subsectors and products;

   - It is important to look at the technical potential, but it is also important to see who is willing to
     pay for this potential;

   - Why 2025? That’s not long enough, perhaps it is better to stretch projections to 2030 as most
     infrastructure projects are long term;

   - Energy demand projections should take into account policy developments in the country;

   - It is important to have coherence in estimation of EE potential. It needs to be specified whether
     the potential is estimated using bottom-up or top-down approach;

   - Conversion or transformation sector seems to be missing in EE potential, which is an important
     sector. Production of fertilizers and liquefied natural gas is quite significant in our countries. All
     these two transformation industries used the natural gas as feedstock and as fuel. There are
     new industry processes to improve the auto consumption in these two obsolete technologies in
     some oldest plants. There are 18 countries that produce and export LNG worldwide, and 7 of
     them are in our region as in Algeria, Egypt, Qatar, UAE, Libya, Oman and Yemen.

   - Theoretically, the gas auto-consumption of an LNG plant is about 12%. In Algeria it’s reached
     25% to produce LNG before the launching of the revamping program in the 90s to improve EE in
     the existing LNG plants. This need to be followed in all LNG producers. In the other hand, the
     specific consumption to produce a ton of fertilizer is decreasing of -30% (from more1000 m3 to
     about 650-700 m3 by ton of fertilizer including feedstock and fuel).

   - Assumption on realization of EE targets in NEEAP in estimation of EE potential is invalid at least
     for Jordan because not much has been done and thus the potential might be underestimated.




                                                                                                      167

On interim results:

   - The results for Tunisia are somehow close to similar assessment done for the country. This study
     should not be granted the scope larger of what it actually is;

   - EE potential in the residential sector of Egypt is probably underestimated because of large
     amount of unofficial/informal settlements that are not reflected in the official statistics;

   - The estimations for the Iraq are reasonable as they are based on the IEA data and all IEA data
     comes from the official statistics;

   - In Maghreb region, a study on ‘’Planification energetique dans l’Union du Maghreb Arab e - UMA’’
     was performed in 1997 with the support of ESMAP program. The study covered Algeria, Tunisia
     and Morocco (named AL.TU.MA study). This study was based on MEDEE-Sud model and gave EE
     potential by country and by sector by 2000-2010-2020. For Morocco for example, the EE
     potential was estimated to 5.3 Mtoe by 2020 (23 Mtoe energy demand in BAU scenario
     compared to 17.7 Mtoe for alternative scenario). This result is not far from present estimation;

   - The results for Morocco are more or less similar with similar studies carried out for the country
     with difference of minus/plus 3-4%. Using results of the local studies for benchmarking would be
     a good thing.

                                                 - Lack of understanding of EE by industry groups
                                                 - building codes lack EE specifications by building
             - Sectors that are paying
                                                   types, there is lack of national capacity to work
               higher energy prices e.g.

                                                 - Lack of compulsory EE building code for
               (hotels, banks, hospitals etc)

             - If we take into account
               potential of energy saving, it
               appears that the leading
               sectors are residential and
               tertiary. If we take specific
               consideration, e.g.
               government policy of
               reducing subsidies, then we
               must help industrial sector
               and industrial sector
Tunisia        becomes a priority. Payback
               period is also attractive for
               EE measures in industrial
               sector.
             - There is a solid regulatory
               framework for EE in place.
               We need to launch different
               actions in different sectors
               in parallel, although some
               sectors are more difficult to
               address.



             - It is easier to target
               industrial, commercial
               and governmental
               sectors. Targeting
               residential sector is
               somewhat challenging due to
Kuwait
               very strong parliament in the
               country.
             - From appliances, the biggest
               energy consuming product is
               air conditioners that
               largely contribute to peaks.



             - The priority for EE is
               residential sector,
                                                  - Inefficiency and difficulty of the government

                                                  - Weak EE governance and institutions

               petrochemical)

            In Sudan priority sectors
            identified in NEEAP includes only
            electricity, although transport is a
            very large energy consuming
            sector. In NEEAP target sectors
Sudan       are network losses and
            buildings. The buildings have
            been chosen mainly for
            appliances (lighting and
            appliances). The peak is
            completely influenced by AC.

   4- General comments on priority sectors:

        -    Regardless of the identified priority sector, the focus should be on business case
             to make the priority happen;

        -    Sectors should be prioritized based on the pay-back time. In industrial sector
             there are many low-hanging fruits with short pay-back time;

        -    Appliances are easy to target and implement in the building sector through
             import regulations;

        -    Power generation (utility) sector should be a priority

5- General comments on challenges:

   -    Overall poor quality of data and lack of detailed data by sectors and subsectors

   -    Lack of one single focal point in some countries for data collection

   -    Lack of demand for EE services, and very little EE on the ground

   -    Regulatory and institutional frameworks are fragile and incomplete

   -    Lack of legal robust framework with sanctions and more targeted use of financial
        support to foster innovation in EE

   -    Transport remains a sector where actions are difficult to implement because
        there is no reliable good public transport alternative, also the climatic zone are
        too hot which definitely requires AC in the car and increases the use of energy.
        Transport is a biggest energy consuming sector, but it is at the same time
        difficult sector to tackle.

   -    Another sector with high EE potential is tourism sector. But this sector currently
        receives little attention in terms of policy and financial support

   -    Low awareness about benefits of EE, today we are still on a short term vision

   -    High initial capital costs and payback period is not sufficiently attractive

   -    Lack of technical professional trained to the needs of industries
