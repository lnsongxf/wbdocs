ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

T
      his report is a product of joint work by staff from the Kosovo Agency of Statistics (KAS) and
      the World Bank. Staff from KAS processed and analysed the data, technical support has also
      been provided by United Nations Development Program (UNDP), financed by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Finland and the World Bank for report preparation and ensuring accuracy in reported

                                                                          LABOUR FORCE SURVEY



PREFACE
The purpose of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) in Kosovo is to provide statistical data on labour market
indicators and enable comparisons with previous years. The methodology and definitions applied in
the 2015 LFS are the same as those used in 2012, 2013, and 2014 and are consistent with Eurostat
regulations. The LFS survey includes 600 Enumeration Areas (EA) throughout the territory of Kosovo
where 4,800 households were interviewed.

                                     This Labour Force Survey 2015 report contains data on employment
                                     and unemployment by age, gender, employment status, economic
                                     activities, occupations and other areas of the labour market.

                                     The employment rate rose slightly between 2012 and 2013, then
                                     falling in 2014 and in 2015. The LFS data show that the percentage
                                     of those employed in part-time jobs decreased from 11.1% in
                                     2013 to 5,3% in 2015. Self-employment (as a percentage of those
                                     employed) declined slightly from 2014 to 2015. The percentage of
                                     the employed in vulnerable jobs (persons who are self-employed
                                     without employees and those who work unpaid in a family business)
                                     declined from 24.9% in 2014 to 22.8% in 2015. Manufacturing,
                                     trade, education and construction continue to employ almost half of
 Mr. Isa Krasniqi                    all employed people.

 Kosovo Agency for Statistics



The unemployment rate fell slightly from 30.9% to 30.0% between 2012 and 2013, it increased in 2014
to 35.3% and then fell again to 32.9% in 2015. Between 2014 and 2015 the proportion of discouraged
workers (inactive people who are not looking for a job as they believe that there is no work available)
increased from 10.7% to 14.1%. The inactivity rate also increased between the two years.

The labour force participation rate decreased between 2014 and 2015 from 41.6% to 37.6%. Female
labour force participation and employment also decreased between 2014 and 2015. Youth unemployment
declined in 2015, from 61.0% to 57.7%. There was also a decrease in the long-term unemployment rate,
the percentage of the unemployed who had been unemployed for more than 12 months decreasing from
73.8% in 2014 to 72.2% in 2015. Youth NEETs (respondents aged 15-24 who are not employed, not in
education and not in training) increased from 30.2% in 2014 to 31.4% in 2015.

Gratitude is expressed to l participants and other stakeholders engaged in implementation of LFS
of 2015. At the same time, KAS would also like to inform users of KAS official statistics, that KAS
within available budget, in continuity is working in capacity development as to publish sustainable and
qualitative statistics.

According to the Law of Official Statistics No.04/L-034 the Kosovo Agency of Statistics is responsible for
producing the official statistics in the Republic of Kosovo and therefore when data are used the source
should be cited.

INTRODUCTION

T
      he Kosovo Agency of Statistics (KAS) began conducting the Labour Force Survey (LFS) in 2001
      and then undertook LFS on an almost annual basis until 2009. In 2011 KAS began planning for the
      updated Labour Force Survey which has several important improvements over previous surveys:

•	   Improved questionnaire (continuing to follow Eurostat guidelines)

•	   New sampling frame (based on the 2011 Census of Kosovo)

•	   Longitudinal sub-sample in which each household is interviewed four times (once every three months)

•	   Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) which enables data output to be generated faster
     than traditional paper and pencil interviews followed by data entry.

The main objectives of LFS are to collect information, mainly on the supply side of the labour market,
i.e., information on those who are working or who are actively looking for work. The LFS collects social
and economic information for use in the following areas:

Macro-economic monitoring: The change in the number of people employed is an indicator of
changes in economic activity. It is necessary to track these changes, specifically the types of jobs and
the industries in which people work.

Human resource development policies: The economy is changing all the time. In order to meet the
needs of the changing economy, people need to be vocationally trained. LFS enables the identification
of areas of training.

Employment policies: For an economy to work at its maximum potential, all those wanting to have
work should have jobs. Some people may wish to have full-time jobs and can only find part-time work.
Knowing how many of these people there are can enable the Government to design policies that
encourage full-employment.

Income support and social programmes: For the majority of people, employment income is their main
means of support. People not only need jobs but also productive jobs in order to receive reasonable
incomes. Government needs to know what levels of income are being earned by different groups of
persons.

                                                                            LABOUR FORCE SURVEY



DEFINITIONS

T
     he working age population includes people 15 to 64 years of age, inclusive. This measure is used
     to give an estimate of the total number of potential workers within an economy.

      The labour force comprises those who are employed and those who are unemployed, according to
the strict definitions given below. Inactive persons are not considered part of the labour force.

1. Employed: People who during the reference week performed some work for wage or salary, or
profit or family gain, in cash or in kind or were temporarily absent from their jobs.

2. Unemployed: People who during the reference week were:

•	 without work, that is, were not in paid employment or self-employment; and

•	 currently available for work, that is, were available for paid employment or self- employment within two
   weeks; and

•	 seeking work, that is, had taken specific steps in the previous four weeks to seek paid employment or
   self-employment.

3. Inactive: People who were neither employed or unemployed during the reference period.

Classification of the population into these three mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories depends
on the application of the activity principle – what a person was actually doing during the reference week
– and a set of priority rules regarding activity that give precedence to employment over unemployment
and to unemployment over economic inactivity. Classification also depends on a clear understanding of
which activities are to be considered as “employment”. It is important to note that employment includes
activities which are paid or unpaid and activities producing goods and services which are either sold in
the market or not.

The labour force participation rate is the proportion of a country’s working-age population that engages
actively in the labour market, either by being employed or unemployed. It is the ratio of the labour force
(employed plus unemployed) to the working-age population, expressed as a percentage.


                        Labour force           (Employed + Unemployed)
                        participation rate                                    X 100
                                                 Working-age population

The inactivity rate is the proportion of a country’s working-age population that is neither employed nor
unemployed. When added together, the inactivity rate and the labour force participation rate sum to 100
per cent.

The employment-to-population ratio, also known as the employment rate, is the proportion of a
country’s working-age population that is employed.


                        Employment-to-           Employed population
                                                                              X 100
                        population ratio        Working-age population

The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labour force that is not employed. It is the labour force
that serves as the base for this indicator, not the working-age population.

LABOUR FORCE SURVEY                                                                                        JUNE 2016




Discouraged workers are people without work who are currently available for work but who have
given up looking for work because they believe that they cannot find work. They are included within the
inactive category.

Youth unemployment refers to the unemployment of people aged 15–24 years.

Youth Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET) is the share of youth (15-24) that are not
employed, not in education and not in training.

Vulnerable employment refers to self-employed persons who do not have employees or unpaid family
workers. The vulnerably employed are less likely to have formal work arrangements and are more likely
to lack decent working conditions.

The following flow diagram illustrates the criteria used to classify the working age population as employed,
unemployed, or inactive.

                                                                              LABOUR FORCE SURVEY



KEY POINTS

F
        igure 1 provides a summary of the labour market status of Kosovo’s population based on the 2015
        Labour Force Survey. Among the main results of the 2015 LFS, as illustrated in Figure 1 and elaborated
        in greater detail in the body of this report, are the following:

• Almost two-thirds of Kosovo’s population is of working age (15-64 years). The working age population is
expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, as Kosovo has one of the youngest populations in Europe.

• Among those of working age, 62.4% are not economically active, meaning that they are not employed
and have not actively sought employment in the past four weeks and/or are not available to start work
within two weeks.

• Of the 37.6% of the population that is economically active, 32.9% (145,776 persons) are unemployed.
This implies that 67.1% (296,940) of economically active people are employed, yielding an employment-
to-population ratio (employment rate) of 25.2%.

• Of the 62.4% of the working age population that is inactive, 22.5% (165,700 people) did not seek a job
because they believed that there was no work available. Discouraged workers accounted for 14.1% of the
working age population, with similar levels for women and men.

• There are large gender differences in the labour market.

   •	     Nearly one in five (18.1%) women of working age are active in the labour market, compared to
          about three-fifths (56.7%) of the male working age population.

   •	     Among those in the labour force, unemployment is higher for women than it is for men (36.6%
          compared to 31.8%).

   •	     The employment rate among working age women is only 11.5%, compared to 38.7% for men.

   •	     Women’s extremely employment low rate stems from the combination of very low labour force
          participation and high unemployment.

   •	     Family responsibilities were the main reason for women’s inactivity in the labour market with 38.5%
          of female respondents giving this reason

   •	     Women were mostly employed in the education and health sectors (almost 40% of employed women).
          Men were mostly employed in the manufacturing, trade and construction sectors (employing more
          than 40% of employed men).

• Youth unemployment is very high in Kosovo

   •	     In 2015, youth in Kosovo were almost twice as likely to be unemployed compared to adults. Among
          those aged 15-24 years and in the labour force, 57.7% were unemployed. Unemployment is higher
          among young women (67.2%) than young men (54.2%).

   •	     Almost one third (31.4%) of Kosovo’s 15 to 24 year olds were not in education, employment or
          training. The figure among young women is 34.9%, compared to 28.3% for young men.

• The large majority of those who are employed report working full-time.

   •	     In their main job, 94.7% of respondents reported working full-time.

   •	     The reasons for working part-time were rather gender differentiated, with women taking more of a
          caring role within the family, thus reducing the hours available for employment.

                                                                                                            9

LABOUR FORCE SURVEY                                                                                           JUNE 2016




     •	   Both men and women working in private companies worked longer hours than their public sector
          counterparts.

     •	   22.8% of employed people belonged to the vulnerable employment category. This means that
          they are either employed in their own business (own-account workers) or contributing to a family
          business (paid or unpaid).

     •	   Only 28 % of those employed had a permanent contract for their main job while 72% had temporary
          contracts, with no significant difference between men and women. Those with temporary contracts
          were asked why they had this type of contract and 66.5% of respondents reported that no other
          type of contract was available.

     •	   The net salaries of most employees were between €300 to €400 a month. Very small gender
          differences were noted.

      f the entire working age population, 25.2% were employed (Figure 2). The employment rate
      was higher for men than for women: 38.7% of working age men were employed compared to
      11.3% among working age women. Over a four year period (2012 to 2015) the employment rate
has changed slightly with almost 3 percentage point increase from 2012-2013, a 1.5 percentage point
decrease from 2013-2014 and 1.7 percentage point decrease from 2014-2015 (Figure 2).

1.2. EMPLOYMENT BY AGE GROUP AND EDUCATION LEVEL
Across age groups, the employment rate was highest among people aged between 45-54 years old
(36.2%) and lowest among youth (15-24 years old) (8.5%).

The employment rate of women between the ages 25 to 44 years old ranges from 14.4% to 17.5%. Only
3.7% of young women and 9.5% of women aged between 55-64 years old were employed. For men
(Table 1.1) the employment rate was the highest for those aged between ages of 35 to 54 years (around
60%), and the lowest for young me (12.9%).

An examination of the highest educational level attained by the employed shows that nearly 60% of them
have completed secondary vocational education, whereas more than a quarter (27.5%) have completed
tertiary education (Table 1.2).

Table 1.3 illustrates that the requirements for getting a job are higher in government positions where over
half of all employees (58.4%) have completed higher education.

In 2015, 71.1% of the employed persons were employees, 6.2% were self-employed with employees,
14.8% were self-employed without employees and 7.9% were family workers (Table 1.4). The majority
of employed women had the status of an employee (79.4% compared to 68.6% for men). Nearly one
quarter of men were self-employed compared to 13.8% of women.

1.4. VULNERABLE EMPLOYMENT
In addition to the low employment rate in Kosovo, 22.8% of the employed were working in vulnerable
jobs. Vulnerable workers are either self-employed people without employees or those who work unpaid
in a family business. These two groups of workers have a lower likelihood of having formal work
arrangements as compared to wage and salaried workers.

Men are more likely to hold such vulnerable jobs (24% of employed men compared to 18.8% of employed
women). In absolute terms 67,700 out of 296,940 employed people belong to the vulnerable employment
category (Table 1.5). Employed people in professional fields are less likely to be vulnerably employed
(Table 1.6) as are those with a higher level of education (Table 1.7).

1.5. CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS
In terms of the type of contract that working respondents had, the majority (84.5%) had an individual
contract while the rest were working without a contract. For youth (15 to 24 years of age) the percentage
working without a contract was 38.5%.

Of those who had an employment contract, only 28.4% had a permanent contract for their main job while
71.6% had temporary contracts. These rates are similar for men and women. Those with temporary
contracts were asked why they had this type of contract and 96.3% of respondents reported that no
other type of contract was available.

When asked whether in their main job they were entitled to the benefits of a social security scheme in
the job, only 9.1% of employees responded affirmatively.


1.6. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
Manufacturing, trade, education and construction employed almost half of employed in 2014 (Tables 1.8A
& 1.8B). The trade sector employed 14.4%, manufacturing 13.8%, education 11.9% and construction
employed 10.9% of all the employed in Kosovo.

Education and healthcare were the two largest employers of women (employing almost 40% of employed
women). Manufacturing, trade and construction are the most common employment sectors for men
(employing more than 40% of employed men).

1.8. PATTERNS OF WORK
Only 0.9% of the employed population reported having a second job during the reference week, with no
statistically significant differences between genders.

In their main job, 94.7% of respondents reported working full-time and 5.3% part time. Gender differences
were noted with women more likely to work part time (7.6% compared to 4.7%). For those who worked
part-time the reasons for this were rather gender differentiated, with women taking more of a caring role
within the family, thus reducing the hours available to work (Table 1.10). The number one reason for men
not working full-time was the lack of availability of full-time work.

Nearly three-fifths of the employed worked between 40-48 hours per week. Over a tenth (12.2%) of
employed people worked 60 or more hours per week. Within a week 16.2% of employed people worked
less than 40 hours.

Men tended to work longer hours than women, with 29.5% of men working more than 48 hours per week
compared to 10.6% of women(Table 1.11). A greater share of employed women (26.4%) worked less
than 40 hours compared to 13.2% of men.

Respondents who were employees were asked about their net monthly pay from their main job (68% of
employed people responded to this question). Most monthly net salaries were situated between €300
and €400 among those who did respond. Very small gender differences were noted, with males having
a slight tendency to receive higher salaries.

2.2. UNEMPLOYMENT BY AGE GROUP AND EDUCATION LEVEL
Nearly 60% of the youth population in Kosovo was unemployed (Table 2.2). The lowest unemployment rate
was found among people aged 55-64 years old (12.6%). In terms of the distribution of the unemployed,
the majority are aged between 15 and 34 years old, accounting for 62% of the unemployed.

The unemployment rate was the highest for people who have no education (73.9% of this group are
unemployed) and lowest for people who had completed tertiary education (19%).

Education improves the labour market prospects particularly for men as 79.7% of men with no education
were unemployed compared to 13.7% of those that had completed tertiary education.


2.3. YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT
Based on 2015 LFS, 27.4% of the unemployed in Kosovo were young people (aged 15-24 years), with
an almost seven percentage point difference between males and females.

A significant share of the youth population is unemployed (57.7%) and the unemployment rate of women
is higher (67.2%) compared to men (54.2%).

In 2015, young persons in Kosovo were twice more likely to be unemployed compared to adults with
similar rates for men and women (Table 2.5).

2.4. DURATION OF UNEMPLOYMENT
Unemployed respondents were asked how long they had been unemployed. A large majority (72.2%)
reported that they had been unemployed for more than 12 months. Small gender differences were noted
(71.1% of men and 75.5% of women). Figure 8 shows that the likelihood of being unemployed for over
a year increases with age.

3. LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION

I
  n 2015, out of an estimated total population of 1,757,843, the total working age population (aged 15 to
  64) was 1,176,147 people. Of these working age people, 37.6% were participating in the labour force
  (economically active). This means they were either employed or unemployed (i.e., actively seeking work
and available to work). The remaining 62.4% were economically inactive (Figure 9). The economically
inactive include students, housewives, discouraged workers, and other people who were not actively
looking for work and they are examined in the next chapter.

Figure 9 points to a much lower labour force participation among women: 18.1% of females were active
compared to 56.7% of men. Figure 10 shows that from 2012 to 2014 the labour force participation rate
increased slightly whilst it declined from 2014 to 2015 by four percentage points.

The labour force participation rate was highest among people aged between 30-34 years (49.3%) and
lowest amongst people aged 15 to 19 years at 7.4% (Table 3.2). The low participation rate for young
people is not surprising because most of this group is in education.

Among men, those aged 40-44 years have the highest labour force participation rate (78.6%), whereas
for women it is the highest for those between 25 and 29 years (29%) (Table 3.2).

4. INACTIVE PERSONS
4.1. INACTIVITY BY GENDER


A
      lot of attention is given to describing and measuring the employed and unemployed populations
      which together form the Labour Force (or the economically active). However, the category
      “inactive” is equally important. Changes in activity rates are a key part of the impact of labour
supply on potential output growth. This is due to the large number of potential workers among those
currently inactive.

Personal or family responsibilities are the main reason for women’s inactivity in the labour market
(Table 4.1).


4.2. DISCOURAGED JOB-SEEKERS
In 2015 out of the 733,341 inactive population, 165,712 people did not seek a job because they
believed that there was no work available. This category is classified as “discouraged” job seekers
and in Kosovo they accounted for 14.1% of the working age population (Table 4.1). Looking at the
working age population the level of discouragement is higher for women than men (16.8% compared
to 11.4%).



4.3. INACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN EMPLOYMENT,
EDUCATION OR TRAINING (NEET)
The youth NEETs includes the young population that are not employed, not in education and not in
training, that is, totally disconnected from the labour market and not participating in the educational
system. High shares of this group in the youth population raise concerns about the future employability
of young people as it indicates detachment from the labour market. In addition, a large number of

number of unoccupied youth in countries with high youth unemployment, such as Kosovo, can put a
downward pressure on employment and earnings.

In 2015, 107,628 young people (aged from 15 to 24) in Kosovo were not in education, employment
or training and they represented 31.4% of the young population. The share of NEET women is 34.9%
compared to 28.3% of NEET men (Figure 11).

5. COUNTRY COMPARISONS

L
      abour market statistics of 2015 show that Kosovo still remains in the worst labour market
      situation in comparison to the Western Balkan countries.


The labour force participation rate in Kosovo is 37.6% while the participation rate in Western Balkan
countries ranges between 44.1% and 64.9% (Table 5.1).

Part of these differences is due to the fact that Kosovo has such a young population and many of these
young people are still in education (and therefore classified as inactive).

In Kosovo only 25.2% of the working age population is employed compared to a 52.9% in Albania (Table
5.1). This is a stark difference and requires further explanation (see box below).

  Methodological Note: Differences in definition of employment between Kosovo and Albania LFS.
  Employment and participation rates differ considerably between Kosovo and Albania. This is due to the fact that, while the definitions
  of employment are broadly similar between the two countries, there is one notable difference. In both countries employed persons
  are those who worked even for one hour with a respective salary or profit during the reference week, those persons who were
  receiving a salary or wage while they were in training during their work, as well as persons temporarily not at work during the
  reference week for some reasons: (1) maternity leave, illness, injury or temporary disability and expect to return to work, education
  / training directly related to the actual work; (2) salaried employees absent from work for some reasons other than the above that
  (a) lack of the duration is three months or less, and the person is not a seasonal worker or (b) the person takes 50% or more salary;
  (3) the self-employed who intend to return to the business / farm / or professional practice; (4) workers not being paid who expect
  to return to work in three months or less.
  In Albania, an additional category of employed persons is comprised of people who work on their small farm, who do not sell
  their products, but produce only for self-consumption. . In Kosovo, the definition is modified such that self-production on small
  farms is only considered as employment if it is considered to be an important source of consumption for the household. As many
  respondents declare that is it not an important source, this leads to differences in estimated employment rates across the two
  countries.


Currently Kosovo has the highest unemployment rate in the region, followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina.

        of dependents per 100 working-age population):


• Youth dependency ratio (respondents aged under 15/respondents aged 15-64)
• Old age dependency ratio (respondents aged 65+/respondents aged 15-64)
• Age dependency ratio (respondents younger than 15 or older than 64/respondents aged 15-64)

 2013                           41%                              12%                          52%
 2014                           38%                              12%                          51%
 2015                           36%                              13%                          49%

In terms of age dependency, the figure for Kosovo in 2010 was also 52% so there has been virtually no
change over the last few years. In 2014, the age dependency ratio in EU-28 was 51.8 %, indicating that
there were approximately two working age persons for every dependent person. In 2014, the lowest age
dependency ratio among the EU Member States was observed in Slovakia (40.6 %) and the highest in
France (57.6 %).

Another common ratio used, particularly in Eurostat publications, is the effective economic old age
dependency ratio. This is an important indicator for assessing the potential impact of ageing on social
expenditure related to employment (pensions etc.). This indicator is calculated as the ratio between the
65+ population (all classified as inactive) and total employment. For this ratio Eurostat set the age range
for the employed from 20 to 64 years. The effective economic old age dependency ratio is projected to
rise to 68% in 2060 in the EU28. In Kosovo for 2015 the ratio was 52%.

The total economic dependency ratio is calculated as the ratio between the total inactive population (15+)
and employment (aged 20-64). It gives a measure of the average number of individuals aged 15 and
above that each employed «supports». This ratio was 122% in the EU28 in 2013, while in 2015 in Kosovo
the ratio is 301%. It is projected that by 2023 this ration in EU will continuously increase, projected to
rise to 122.2 in 2023 and to 141.6 in 2060. The highest ratio in the EU28 in 2013 was Greece (172%).

ANNEX 1: SAMPLE DESIGN AND
CALCULATION OF WEIGHTS
1. INTRODUCTION
The total number of sample EAs was 600 each quarter; the panel of sample households in one replicate
of 150 sample EAs was rotated each quarter. For 2015 LFS a sample of 600 EAs was selected with
probability proportional to size (PPS) within each stratum, where the measure of size was based on
the number of households in the EA from the 2011 Kosovo Census frame. A sample of 8 households
was selected for the LFS in each sample EA, for a total original sample size of 4,800 households each
quarter. Since a few sample EAs were not enumerated some quarters and the non-interview households
are not replaced, the final effective sample size each quarter depends on the total number of sample
households with completed interviews.

The weighting procedures for the 2015 Kosovo LFS depend on the sample design, the number of
sample EAs covered each quarter, and the number of sample households with completed interviews
in each sample EA that appear in the final LFS data file. The sample design is summarized in the next
section. The basic LFS weighting procedures involved first calculating the weights for each quarter of
2015 based on the probabilities of selection and the distribution of the completed household interviews
by sample EA each quarter, so that the quarterly data were nationally-representative. Then the basic
quarterly weights were adjusted at the national level based on the projected total population for mid-
2015. Finally the weights for the annual LFS combined data from all four quarters were calculated by
dividing the quarterly weights by 4.


2. SUMMARY OF SAMPLE DESIGN FOR THE 2015 KOSOVO LFS
A stratified two-stage sample design was used for the 2015 Kosovo LFS. The sampling frame was based
on the data and cartography from the 2011 Kosovo Census. For the purposes of the census enumeration,
Kosovo was subdivided into enumeration areas (EAs), which are relatively small operational segments
defined for the census enumeration. A total of 4,626 EAs were defined for Kosovo, and these were
used as the primary sampling units (PSUs) selected at the first sampling stage for the LFS. The overall
average number of households per EA in the sampling frame was 67; the average size of the urban EAs
(103 households) was almost twice that for the rural EAs (53 households). One census enumerator was
responsible for enumerating the households and population in each EA. KAS used the 2011 Census data
to compile a sampling frame of EAs that was used for selecting the LFS sample.

Kosovo is divided geographically into seven regions, specified in Table A1. KAS uses these seven
regions for stratifying the sampling frame and for reporting the results from their household surveys.
Each region is divided into municipalities, which are further subdivided into towns or localities. The EAs
were defined within the smallest administrative units. Each EA was classified as urban or rural, and this
classification was used for defining sampling strata within each region.

At the time of the 2011 Census, KAS was not able to conduct the census enumeration in three
municipalities in the North (Leposaviq, Zubin Potok and Zveçan) as well as part of the municipality of
Mitrovicë, which have a high concentration of Serbian population. For this reason the final results from
the 2011 Kosovo Census exclude the households and population in those areas. However, KAS had
previously defined EAs for those areas, and these EAs had been listed in 2008 (in the case of a master
sample of 1,000 EAs for the national household surveys) or in 2009 (for the remaining EAs). Therefore
KAS was able to use the previous information for the EAs excluded in the 2011 Census, to complement
the frame for the rest of Kosovo with census information. A total of 257 EAs in the Northern municipalities
are in the frame with information from the 2008/09 listing. These EAs are integrated with the EAs for the
rest of Kosovo with information from the 2011 Census, for a total of 4,626 EAs in the combined frame.

It can be seen in Table A1 that the percentage of households varies by region, from 9.8% for Peja to
28.1% for Pristina. About 43.8% of the households are classified as urban.

For the Kosovo LFS, cut-off sampling was used to eliminate EAs with less than 10 households from the
sampling frame. One result of this approach is that it will produce slightly biased survey results given
that the households in the excluded areas are not represented in the survey data. A total of 160 rural
EAs were excluded from the frame in this case. These excluded EAs cover a very small percentage of
the total population, so the corresponding bias should also be very small.

In order to update the second stage sampling frame for selecting the sample households in each sample
EA for the 2015 LFS, KAS conducted a new listing of households in the 600 sample EAs at the end of
2013. As described later in the section on Weighting Procedures, the number of listed households was
also used in the calculation of the weights. This was an improvement over the 2013 LFS methodology,
which used the list of households from the 2011 Census for the sample EAs to select the households.
The previous lack of a new listing resulted in a corresponding small bias since new housing units were
not represented. In the case of a sample household that moved, if there was a new household living in
the same dwelling unit, it would be interviewed for the LFS.

The sampling frame of EAs was first divided into explicit strata based on the urban and rural areas in
each region. The sampling frame included information on ethnicity of the population in each EA, which
was also used for stratification. If all the households in an EA belonged to one ethnic group, the EA was
assigned to that ethnic stratum; there was also a category for mixed ethnicity. In the case of a region
with Serbian EAs in the urban or rural strata, these EAs were included in a separate stratum in which the
sample EAs were selected independently. Since the sample allocation was proportional to the number
of households, some of these small strata had only one EA selected. For the purposes of the weighting
procedures and the calculation of sampling errors, the stratification will be limited to the region, urban
and rural level.

A total of 600 sample EAs were selected for the 2015 Kosovo quarterly LFS, allocated to the strata
approximately in proportion to the number of households. Within each sample EA 8 sample households
were selected at the second stage, for a total original sample size of 4,800 households each quarter.
Table A2 shows the allocation of the LFS sample EAs and households by region, urban and rural stratum.
Given the proportional sample allocation, the smallest region of Peja has a sample of 58 EAs and 464
households. The nonresponse rate will further reduce the effective sample size, so it is important to
monitor the sampling errors for the estimates of key indicators by region in order to determine whether
the level of precision is sufficient for the smaller regions.

At the first sampling stage the EAs in each stratum were selected systematically with probability
proportional to size (PPS), where the measure of size was based on the total number of households
in each EA from the sampling frame. The number of EAs selected in each stratum was based on the
sample allocation presented in Table A2. At the second sampling stage 8 households were selected
systematically with equal probability within each sample EA.


3. SAMPLE ROTATION SCHEME
The 2015 Kosovo LFS is designed as a continuous household survey, with data collection throughout
each week of the year. The sample rotation scheme is based on Eurostat guidelines. For the fieldwork
and data analysis the year is divided into four quarters of 13 weeks each. The national sample of 600
EAs is divided into four nationally-representative replicates of 150 EAs each, which are used in the
sample rotation scheme. The panel of 1,200 sample households in each replicate is interviewed for four
consecutive quarters, and then replaced by a new panel of sample households. The panel households
in the other three replicates are kept in the sample for the next quarter, which ensures that there is a
75% overlap in the sample from one quarter to the next. This will improve the level of precision for the
estimates of trends (differences) in the unemployment rate and other labor force characteristics from one
quarter to the next.



4. GENERAL METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THE 2015
KOSOVO LFS WEIGHTS
In order for the sample estimates from the 2015 Kosovo LFS to be representative of the population, it
is necessary to multiply the data by a sampling weight. The basic weight for each sample household
is equal to the inverse of its probability of selection (calculated by multiplying the probabilities at each
sampling stage). A household weight is attached to each sample household record in the data files.

The probabilities of selection are based on the stratified two-stage sample design. At the first stage a
sample of EAs was selected with PPS within each stratum (region, urban/rural), and at the second stage
a sample of 8 households was selected in each sample EA from the new listing. Based on this sample
design, the probabilities of selection for the households in each sample EA can be expressed as follows:



where:

 hi = 	 probability of selection for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum (region,
		      urban/rural) h




32
                                                                     RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2015
                                                                            LABOUR FORCE SURVEY


nh = 	    number of sample EAs selected in stratum h for the LFS

Mhi = 	 total number of households in the sampling frame for the i-th sample EA in stratum h

Mh = 	 total number of households in the sampling frame for stratum h (that is, the cumulated measure
		     of size for the stratum)

mhi = 	 8 = number of sample households selected in the i-th sample EA in stratum h

M hi =	 total number of households in the updated listing for the i-th sample EA in stratum h

The basic sampling weight is calculated as the inverse of this probability of selection. Based on the
previous expression for the probability, the weight can be calculated as follows:



where:

Whi = 	 basic weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum h

Since the number of households listed in the sample EA (M ) is generally different from the corresponding
number of households in the EA from the frame (Mhi), the weights will vary by EA within a stratum.

It is important to adjust the basic weights for the sample households to take into account the nonresponse
of households in each sample EA. Since the weights are calculated at the level of the sample EA, it is
advantageous to adjust the weights at this level. The final weight (W ) for the sample households in the
i-th sample EA in stratum h can be expressed as follows:



where:

m’ hi =	 number of sample households with completed interviews in the i-th sample EA in stratum h



5. CALCULATION OF LFS WEIGHTS FOR EACH QUARTER OF 2015
The basic quarterly weights are calculated using the formula for the weight specified in the previous
section. However, the weights each quarter will vary based on the final number of sample EAs enumerated
and the number of sample households with completed interviews in each sample EA. Following the
adjustment of the quarterly weights to take into account any EAs that are not enumerated and any
sample households that cannot be interviewed, the LFS quarterly weight can be expressed as follows:




where:
W qhi =	 basic weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum h for quarter q

n qh =	   number of sample EAs enumerated for the LFS in stratum h for quarter q

m qhi =	 number of sample households with completed LFS interviews in quarter q for the i-th sample 	
    	    EA in stratum h


                                                                                                        33
RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2015

The value of n qh depends on the actual distribution of the enumerated EAs in the data file for each

distribution of the enumerated sample EAs and the number of households with completed interviews
by region, urban and rural stratum, in the Kosovo LFS data for each quarter of 2015.

The formula for the quarterly weights specified above was used for calculating a separate set of basic

6. ADJUSTMENT OF 2015 LFS QUARTERLY WEIGHTS BASED ON
POPULATION PROJECTIONS
In 2015, there has been a significant migration from Kosovo, particularly in the first quarter and
consequently there was a decline in the number of resident population.

The adjustment factor for the 2015 LFS weights each quarter was calculated as follows:




where:

A LFS2015q =	   weight adjustment factor applied to the preliminary 2015 LFS weights for quarter q

P 2015 =		      lower variant of the projected total population of Kosovo for the mid-point of 2015 		
    		          based on demographic estimation techniques, equal to 1,757,843

                                      = 	weighted estimate of total population of Kosovo from 2015 LFS 		
                                		       data for quarter q based on the preliminary quarterly weights 		
                                		       adjusted for nonresponse

P qhij =		      number of persons in the j-th sample household in the i-th sample EA of stratum h in 	
     		         the 2015 LFS data for quarter q



Table A7 shows the weighted estimates of the total population from the 2015 Kosovo LFS data by
quarter and the corresponding weight adjustment factors (ALFS2015q).

The final 2015 LFS weights for each quarter were calculated by multiplying the basic weight adjusted for
nonresponse by this population adjustment factor, as follows:



where:

W qhi =	 final adjusted quarterly weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in 			
   	     stratum h for quarter q

Table A7 shows that the average population weight adjustment factor is 1.0703.



7. CALCULATION OF 2015 LFS WEIGHTS FOR ANNUAL COMBINED
DATA FOR ALL FOUR QUARTERS
The data from different quarters are combined in order to increase the level of precision for the annual
indicators and to represent seasonality in the labor force and employment characteristics over a
12-month reference period. The Kosovo LFS data for all four quarters of 2015 were combined for the
analysis of the annual data, so weights were calculated for this combined data file. In this case we first
calculated the quarterly weights based on the sample EAs and households with completed interviews in
the LFS data for each quarter, as specified in the previous section. Since the weights for each quarter
expand the data to the national level, it is necessary to divide these weights by 4 in order to obtain the
annual weights for the combined data file for all four quarters. Therefore the annual LFS weights can be
expressed as follows:



where:

WAqhi = 	 annual weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum h for quarter q in the 	
   	      combined data file for the four quarters of 2015

W    qhi
           =	 final quarterly weight (including population adjustment factor) for the sample households in the 	
     	        i-th sample EA in stratum h for quarter q

This weighting procedure for the annual LFS estimates has the effect of averaging the results from all of the
quarters being combined, with annual weights being automatically consistent with total population at national
level.
