                                                               Unplanned development, competition for space in dense urban agglomerations,

                                                               For a long time, governments implemented hard engineering or gray solutions such as
                                                               dams and levees to mitigate food risk. However, with adverse impacts of floods growing,
                                                               interest in a more integrated approach to urban flood risk management is growing as well.

Six case studies from different countries provide insights into implementation of GI solutions in different settings. In
some settings, such as Portland, Oregon (in the United States), a comprehensive citywide approach is evident. The case
studies show that some locales explore GI options in direct response to increased flooding, while others do so as part of

                                       people, Portland is the 28th most populous city in the United States. The city has a history of
                                       major floods, including the great flood of 1894. To protect itself from flooding, the city built
                                       a seawall that stands at over 30 feet. A series of dams on the Willamette River also protects
                                       the city. In 1996, a massive flood struck Portland, caused millions of dollars in damage, and

                                       water into permeable surfaces such as lawns). These techniques are visible throughout the
                                       city and in many different settings such as apartment buildings, schools, parks, government

                                       for an increase in a building’s allowable area. Between 2009 and 2014, Portland’s “program
                                       included over 330,000 square feet of ecoroof installations with a total private investment of

                     vegetated facilities to capture some of the stormwater on site, which also helps overall
                     water quality and recharges groundwater. Green streets can be part of attractive, pedestrian-
                     and bicycle-friendly streetscapes that create pleasant environments and improve citizens’
                     quality of life.

Implementation
   		                A key part of implementing Portland’s comprehensive program has been to monitor progress
and Monitoring:      and compile good practices. Portland’s process of iterative learning from experience has
                     allowed the city to establish a highly functional hybrid stormwater system.
     Results and
     		              According to the U.S. EPA (2010, 53), Portland has “one of the most mature and
       Lessons:      comprehensive GI programs in the country.      ” The program has helped to mitigate the costs
                     of major gray stormwater infrastructure initiatives; city officials estimate that a mere US$9
                     million in GI investments saved US$224 million in combined sewer overflow costs, such
                     as repairs and maintenance. In terms of lessons offered by Portland’s experience, the EPA
                     suggests that while costs of implementing GI solutions are relatively straightforward,
                     enumerating monetary benefits is challenging. To address this difficulty, project proponents
                     should ascertain data on water storage and infiltration capacity of other GI solutions
                     projects. In addition, it is useful to have estimates of alternative engineering solutions that
                     decision makers can have for comparison. To estimate economic value of GI solutions, the
                     EPA recommends using a tool designed by the Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT 2010).




     CASE STUDY 2. SINGAPORE:
     ACTIVE, BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN (ABC) WATERS PROGRAM


 	Context: 	 In the 1960s and 1970s, Singapore witnessed frequent flooding, especially in the low-lying
                    city center. These floods caused widespread disruption and damage. To reduce the risk of
                    flooding, Singapore traditionally relied on a network of canals and rivers to channel water into
                    reservoirs and into the sea. The city launched major projects to enlarge natural waterways
                    such as the Kallang River and to line riverbanks with concrete to improve conveyance of water
                    and reduce bank erosion. However, concrete waterways came with their own disadvantages,
                    such as increased downstream peak flows and lack of habitat to support healthy aquatic
                    ecosystems.
 	    Approach: 	 The government decided that a more sustainable approach was
                    needed and developed a strategy to treat stormwater as close
                    to its source as possible before discharging the treated water
                    into public drains. A comprehensive, environmentally friendly
                    water management system starting taking shape at the turn
                    of the century. With a vision of transforming Singapore into a
                    “city of gardens and water,   ” the national water agency (PUB)
                    launched the ambitious Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Source:         PUB Singapore’s National
                                                                                         Water Agency. https://www.pub.gov.sg/

                    sparkling waters, landscaped banks, and clear water flowing
                    into picturesque lakes, the ABC Waters program is much more than that. It is a new model
                    for stormwater management as an integral part of overall sustainable water management.
                    The ABC Waters program encourages design features that mitigate the impact of urbanization.
                    These features, including rain gardens, bioretention swales, and wetlands, have not only improved
                    water quality but have also increased biodiversity in the surrounding areas. The rainwater harvesting
                    carried out under the program has allowed storage of water for later, nonpotable use such as
                    irrigation or washing clothes. Projects under the ABC program follow guidelines relating to surface
                    water drainage, flood control, stormwater quality, and public health risks. Projects are also guided by
                    specific regulations. Singapore has identified over 100 potential locations for the implementation of
                    the program by 2030.
10   ROLE OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS IN URBAN FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT




                 Results and An assessment of the Singapore ABC Waters program and similar initiatives found that the
                   Lessons: city “is well protected against floods” (World Bank 2012b, 43). The assessment found further
                              that flood-prone areas in Singapore have decreased substantially, from 629 ha (in 1989) to 56
                              ha (in 2011). By 2015, 32 ABC Waters projects were complete. Private developers completed
                              another 54 “ABC Waters certified” projects (PUB 2016). Singapore’s 3P (People, Public,
                              Private) Partnership program has also increased public awareness of flood risk and the need
                              for adaptive management (World Bank 2012b).
                              Cities around the world have much to learn from the Singapore experience. A total
                              water management strategy provides an integrated solution to multiple interconnected
                              water issues, and a well-designed and targeted program implemented by dedicated
                              institutions can deliver successful outcomes, such as reduced flood risk and adaptation
                              to climate change. Singapore’s 3P Partnership is a good example of how to involve
                              different stakeholders from civil society. Finally, restoring a natural water system can be
                              cost-effective because it lasts over a long period of time; this is evident in the
                              Sengkang floating wetlands and Kallang River–Bishan Park (World Bank 2012b).



               CASE STUDY 3 . SPONGE CITIES, CHINA:
               COUNTRYWIDE PROGRAM TO REDUCE FLOOD RISK THROUGH WATER ABSORPTION

               	Context: 	 Three decades of economic growth has transformed China’s cities. But this growth has
                              come with obvious risks. One major risk is that cities are more vulnerable to disasters such
                              as floods because the built-up environment is unable to absorb stormwater in the event of
                              major rainfall. Chinese cities are flooded regularly. In July 2012, a major flood struck Beijing,
                              killing 79 people and inflicting economic losses of almost US$1.9 billion. Overall, the flood
                              affected 1.6 million people. The Beijing example is not an isolated one. According to the
                              Economist, flood events in Chinese cities have doubled since 2008; and in 2013, almost 200
                              cities were flooded at one point or another. These occurrences highlight the risks faced by
                              almost 700 million people who call Chinese cities home.

                Approach: For many years now, China has been experimenting with
               		
                          low-impact designs that focused on absorbing, cleaning,
                          and draining water in areas of impact. Tianxu Garden,
                          a Beijing housing block, benefited from such design
                          considerations: in the 2012 flood, the apartments in this
                          area easily survived (O’Meara 2015). In September 2015,
                          the Chinese government approved the development of 16
                                                                                               A family at Cixi wetlands in Zhejiang Province.

                   Lessons:   arrangements. According to a report in the Guardian newspaper, the government’s goal is to
                              manage 60 percent of rainwater that falls in Chinese cities. The government wants to achieve
                              this goal—a major undertaking—in the next few years, even as questions have arisen about
                              financing arrangements needed to make investments in sponge cities sustainable. This concern
                              notwithstanding, the Chinese sponge city initiative provides very public support for exploring
                              alternative approaches, and does so as cities around the world work to reduce risks and avoid
                              losses that may increase as climate change intensifies flood events.

CASE STUDY 4. COLOMBO, SRI LANKA:
GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED FLOOD
RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

     	Context: 	 The Sri Lankan capital city, Colombo, faces an increasing risk of flooding. For national and local
                       officials alike, safeguarding the country’s economic engine as well as the health of the city’s 2.5
                       million inhabitants is now a top priority. After Colombo experienced severe flooding in 2010, the
                       city’s vulnerability to excessive rains was exposed. With experts linking shifting patterns of rainfall
                       to climate change, Colombo decided to look into longer-term measures to reduce risks of natural
                       disasters.
     	   Approach: 	 The Metro Colombo Urban Development Project is the
                       centerpiece of the city’s efforts to strengthen its resilience to
                       floods. Supported by the World Bank, the project has made a range
                       of improvements to the city’s flood and drainage management
                       system. What is different about this major project is its recognition
                       of another serious challenge facing the city, loss of water storage
                       capacity. Colombo, built on a low-lying river estuary overlooking
                       the sea, has lost 30 percent of its basin water storage capacity in
                       the last 10 years. The proximate cause is the growth of the city.       Baddagana Wetland Park.

                       plants, and help lower temperatures—could further increase the
                       city’s resilience to floods and potential climatic changes.
     		                One of the key concerns of the project has thus been to review investments in wetlands. In addition
                       to playing a role in flood management and water treatment, wetlands are also a recreational resource
                       for local residents and for tourists, who are a major source of revenue for Colombo. In this context,
                       the project provides US$11 million to complement flood mitigation measures in different areas,
                       including the Beddagana Park wetlands. The specific objective here is to explore ways to protect
                       the 32 ha wetlands from further encroachment due to urbanization, to preserve the water retention
                       capacity of the wetlands, and to enhance Beddagana Park’s recreational value.

CASE STUDY 5. BEIRA, MOZAMBIQUE:
ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN COASTAL ZONES 13



 	Context: 	 Mozambique is among the African countries hardest hit by extreme hazard events
             such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. With climate trends expected to worsen the
             situation in Mozambique, the government has teamed up with international partners
             such as the World Bank and KfW Development Bank to explore an integrated DRM

 	                    One of the areas where the Mozambique government is exploring use of GI
 	                    solutions is Beira Mozambique’s second biggest city. Some of the biggest ports in
 	                    the country are in Beira, which is just above sea level. Beira is also host to many

                               the Chiveve River. The mouth of the river is now blocked because of degraded drainage
                               channels, the result of sedimentation caused by rains and floods.
                  Approach: To support Beira and other cities in reducing climate-related risks, the World Bank and the Pilot
                               Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) are financing the Mozambique Cities and Climate Change
                               Project, with parallel financing from the German Cooperation through KfW. In Beira, the project’s
                               approach includes rehabilitation of the Chiveve River and development of urban GI to help restore the

               	Context: 	 In the 1980s and 1990s, Malmö, Sweden, was a physically dilapidated, economically challenged,
                               and socially deprived region. Floods routinely impacted the area because the drainage system was
                               inadequate. Health problems were severe and unemployment was high.

                  Approach:    In 1998, the Augustenborg District in Malmö initiated an extensive
                               urban renovation program under the name of Ekostaden (eco-
                               neighborhood). Under this approach, officials sought to recreate
                               the area as an integrated whole and to transform it into an
                               ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable city district.
                               Collaborating with area residents and other stakeholders,
