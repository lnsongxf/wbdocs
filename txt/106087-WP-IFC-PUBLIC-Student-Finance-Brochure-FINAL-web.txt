Eduloan’s Model

debenture bond sold to socially responsible investors. To provide a return to investors and make
the program sustainable, Eduloan has implemented a financing model that generates a return
based on inter alia low interest rates and low default rates. Universities, keen to fill marginal
seats in a highly competitive private tertiary education sector, provide marketing support and
financial aid counseling.

Ideal Invest’s Model
Ideal Invest is a private student loan management company that uses an asset-backed securities
fund to fund a strong and growing student loan portfolio of ~25,000 students. Ideal has loaned
over $240 million since 2006 through its main student lending product, Pravaler, which is
available to individuals enrolled in one of ~15,000 courses at ~200 TEIs. The loan covers up to
half of a student’s tuition and can be repaid in 2.5x the study period.


Ideal Invest’s high performance hinges on its university       Recognizing this, TEIs support the loan program through
partnerships, simple loan structure, and ongoing               covering a percentage of borrowers’ interest payments,
borrower support. Ideal Invest markets not only through        assuming some of the risk for loans, and/or supporting
its own sales team, website, and call center, but also         marketing. While Brazil’s government student loan program
through the websites and campuses of its partner               (FIES) is less expensive, it is not available to all students
universities, which are often the first point of contact       and in all TEIs. Many students choose Ideal Invest’s loans
for students. Brazil’s tertiary education market is highly     because they are easier to understand, less administratively
competitive, with institutions vying to fill seats. In this    cumbersome, and can be paid off more quickly.
context, Ideal Invest can help universities to fill excess
capacity with students who are on average higher
achieving, more likely to complete their degrees, and
enrolled in courses at higher tuition levels.

Duoc’s Model
Duoc is a non-profit, private Chilean vocational TEI founded in 1968. It has 16 campuses offering
two year technical degrees and four year professional degrees. Duoc UC now has ~88K students,
of whom three-quarters are from the lowest three income quintiles. In 2007, Duoc created a
student loan facility in partnership with IFC and Banco de Crédito e Inversiones. Students can
take out a maximum loan of $4,500 per year and must repay the loan within a period of years
commensurate to their study period.

Lessons from Experience



Lesson 1: Student lending is still a “push”
product in many developing countries
Unsurprisingly, nascent student lending markets require greater degrees of consumer education
and marketing. As consumer awareness grows, the external market stimulation required for
student lending decreases, shifting student lending to a “pull” product. Students in nascent
student lending markets are less likely to be aware of student loans and are more likely to learn
about them from friends, family, or their TEI rather than a financial institution.

Moreover, many private sector lenders struggle to reach                Lenders may need to educate

Lesson 2: The central role of TEIs in
student lending focuses on design and
implementation
In markets where awareness of education finance is low, the first port of call to reach
prospective borrowers is their current or prospective college or university. For this reason,
successful models cultivate close working relationships with tertiary institution partners,
even co-locating at university campuses and online. In seven out of the eight student finance
programs studied, students first learned of the opportunity to access a student loan through
their TEI.

Many private TEIs stand to benefit significantly from the           TEI participation in student finance commonly takes the
availability of student finance, which may support them to:         form of:

Lesson 3: Sustainability of the lending
product is driven by graduate employability
Graduate employability is a function of many factors which include: the match between
the graduate’s degree program and labor market needs; the reputation of the TEI; links to
industry within the TEI, including opportunities for internships; and the graduate’s academic
performance. Student loans are only sustainable if most borrowers can achieve a higher income
after completing their education, ensuring they can repay a loan on time and in full. Lenders
therefore have a vested interest in identifying strong candidates for “employable” degrees that
will meet market demand.

TEIs can support the sustainability of
loan programs by tracking metrics:
These data might include figures on alumni placement,
performance, and degree payback period. Donors and
lenders must have some confidence in the performance
of graduates from particular institutions and/or degree
programs. TEIs that gather this information will be
more likely to be able to forge partnerships to develop
student finance programs. Moreover, labor market data,
if it were publicly available, might inform student and
parent decisions about taking a loan.
