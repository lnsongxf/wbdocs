    Justice for the Poor is a World Bank research and development program aimed at informing, designing and supporting
    pro-poor approaches to justice reform. It is an approach to justice reform which sees justice from the perspective of the
    poor and marginalized, is grounded in social and cultural contexts, recognizes the importance of demand in building
    equitable justice systems, and understands justice as a cross-sectoral issue.

    Justice for the Poor research reports are aimed at development practitioners, partner governments, researchers, and others
    interested in justice reform. Research reports are reviewed by at least two external referees who are independent of
    the program.

Executive Summary

This Policy Note presents an analysis of and recommendations on the ongoing renovations of neighborhood
markets in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (PNG). It is part of a program of work under the Urban Safety and
Security Technical Assistance Activity that began in the National Capital District, Port Moresby, in late 2014 and
is currently continuing in Lae, PNG’s second-largest city.

This report is based on extensive fieldwork, interviews, and observations at three Port Moresby neighborhood
market sites conducted during 2015: Tokarara (unrenovated), Sabama (renovated 2013), and Gerehu (renovated
2011–14) (see Annex I for more information on the methodology involved).

Neighborhood markets are crucial for the economic vitality, safety, and social life of urban settlements. They need
to be safe and secure areas to buy and sell, especially as women have a dominant presence in marketplaces,
both as vendors and buyers. But they also need to function efficiently as markets, providing market sellers
and their families with a daily income and buyers with fresh, cheap, and abundant produce, and they need to
generate revenue to meet operating and maintenance costs.

Port Moresby’s markets are by definition sites of economic opportunity. Yet, though all have some leadership
structure, many struggle to enforce the rules and to access the resources required for safe, secure, and efficient
market business.

Recent renovations of a range of Port Moresby’s neighborhood markets have seen new citywide and national
leadership emerge that has been able to mobilize the resources needed for renovation and to ensure that safety
rules are enforced in and around market areas. They have also been able to bring together local leadership to
augment community safety. Although some market renovations have taken a deliberately “gender sensitive”
approach, in general, there has been a limited role for women leaders, despite the fact that the benefits from
women’s political empowerment in these kinds of reforms elsewhere are well documented.

These dramatic and powerful interventions have transformed markets, which are now far more highly regulated.
One consequence has been that the range of goods sold at some of the markets has been significantly reduced
in favor of fresh produce. Other goods that featured in the marketplace before renovation (hot food, snacks,
clothing, manufactures, cigarettes, and especially betelnut [Tok Pisin: buai] have been removed and relocated
to areas nearby. Renovations have also strongly discouraged men from socializing at markets, where they were
frequently gambling, playing games, smoking, and drinking.

These changes have undeniably improved personal safety inside market fences, but trade and patronage within
the renovated areas have declined. As a result, it now takes longer for the remaining sellers, predominantly
women selling produce, to clear their goods. To improve the viability of their businesses, some have moved
outside the market where produce can be sold more quickly and at better prices, but the risks are higher outside
too, and safety and security cannot be guaranteed.

The safety of vendors selling snacks, cigarettes, betelnut, and more outside the market fence—often those
who have relocated as a result of being expelled from inside the market—has been unevenly affected by the
renovations. In some cases, they have become more exposed to violence, including from police enforcing the
ban on the sale of buai. Some ethnic groups, especially Port Moresby’s Motu Koitabu peoples, also continue to
feel unsafe in the renovated market areas.




                               Promoting the Safety and Economic Vitality of Port Moresby’s Local Markets             V
     Reduced commercial activity also means that renovated markets have not yet become economically sustainable.
     Fees collected fall far short of expenses. The costs of market management, cleaners, and security workers are
     being met only through personal commitments and a special subsidy arranged by high-level leaders; it is not
     clear that either will be sustained if the political leadership changes.

     Building on the improvements in security and market conditions in renovated areas, the recommendations in
     this Policy Note aim to make both the markets more viable economically viable and the activities in and around
     them more diverse and attractive to vendors and buyers alike.

     The Policy Note draws conclusions and makes recommendations relevant to the challenges faced by market
     renovators, be they government leaders and administrative officials, donor partners, or local people on whom
     market renovations depend for success, for each of the three phases of market renovation.

  Port Moresby Residents Discussing Safety around a Renovated Market

  Sabama used to be the most notorious, the settlement and the market. A “red zone”—you couldn’t
  go in there, or work in there. Tokarara Village Court official

  Before, [the Sabama market] used to be too crowded. Buai [Betelnut], smokes, marijuana, a lot of
  people, gambling, abusing alcohol, abusing the mothers [vendors]. There were holdups, raskols
  [youth criminal gangs], going way back, 70s, 80s, 2000s. It was a no-go zone for some people. Drunks,
  bag-snatching, unemployed youth. There were some conflicts in the old market, [ethnic] Wabags,
  Taris, Keremas. Buai was the main cause of the problems. Soon as we established this [refurbished
  market] here, there’s no face of those doing those [criminal] things. People are safe getting off the
  bus. [The Moresby South MP] built the outside security fence, helped to rebuild. Round the shops,
  he extended the fence. He helped to renew, to repaint the shops. He sealed the carpark.
  Community policeman, Sabama

  Before there’s no law and order. Now with people [market staff and security] picked from the ethnic
  groups, Engan, Kerema... We stand together and work as a team. You talk together, that’s your way
  to do it. Sabama market security staff

  People have changed a lot. It’s a mindset change. I think part of it is because of what the minister is
  doing, especially with the market. I think the market security make a difference; with this development
  here, people look after the community. You’ve got the community leaders here, the community police
  that makes a difference. Market customer, Sabama

  A lot of the former young guys in trouble, raskols, they have work now, they are inside [the community].
  I am one. I’m inside [working as market security]. Former raskol leader, Sabama

  Inside there [the market], it’s safe. Outside, here, it’s not safe for anyone. Snack seller, across the
  road from Sabama market

  Inside, there’s plenty of security. This is how we travel, security. There’s no movement of criminals
  here. But the betelnut side [of the road], it’s not safe. Guys smoking marijuana, sometimes they come
  and “bighead” against the market. Sabama market security

  The buai sellers at the corner, sometimes, we just organize ourselves to push them back [away from
  the market]. In the morning, we are organized, we come here early, 5, 6 o’clock, and stand at the
  corner; as they arrive we push them back. In the afternoon, sometimes we’ll make a couple of requests
  to people from Badili [Police Station] to come and push them back. Once we’ve been there, later
  they see we’ve no pretense they will come back. If they are already sitting down, it’s harder; if we
  are community police, not regular police, they will go against us. “Ok, you guys come and feed us.
  We are just doing this to make our dinner.” Sabama community police

  The [local Motu Koitabu village] Kirakira people mostly don’t come in here. The place is changed;
  things have changed but you can’t change an adult mentality. They think they might get their bag
  snatched, ladies harassed. That corner there [across Gavimani road, including the illegal buai market]
  is bustling with life. You might get in trouble over there if you are a new person. The community police
  [working at the Sabama market] only go as far as the corner. Kirakira (Motu Koitabu) resident

  However, [Governor Parkop] has noticed that most of the markets in the Moresby South are always
  half empty “Sabama market is a good market but it is empty all the time. Vendors from Malaoro can
  move down to Sabama market. But the challenge is for the people of Sabama to change their attitudes
  and mindsets to attract vendors and customers.”1

Markets, Security, and Urban Development:
Learning from What Works

  Box 1. Crime and Violence Trends in Port Moresby Settlements: Views from Above and Below

  We can’t see any reason why things could be getting better. The police are still in serious crisis. Crime
  statistics are hopeless, and murder rates are high. Corruption is everywhere, and institutions are weak.
  The traditional and village authority breaks down in the urban context, into entrenched ethnic
  violence. The settlements are still growing, they are still no-go zones and hotbeds of crime and
  violence. If you think there’s any settlement that is getting better, what’s its name? What could possibly
  be improving things? Security researcher, Canberra

  Are things better here [in Sabama, a notorious, ethnically mixed “no covenant” neighborhood in Port
  Moresby] than they were 10 years ago? Of course. Look around. Ask people. Do you see any raskol
  gangs here? No, you see a few drunken youths. It’s mainly rats and mice we are chasing now. How
  is that? We did it. The community leaders did it—we cut them off. Community leader, Sabama,

4	 Citizens create physical or economic capital as they engage in markets and invest in private and public assets. They produce cultural
   or human capital when they invest in education and urban identities. They produce and exchange various kinds of legal, political, and
   social capital as they maintain relationships, represent and defend their interests, and resolve conflicts with kin, other communal groups
   and neighbors, traders, service providers, and public authorities. Bourke argues that the marketing of fresh food is one of PNG’s biggest
   economic success stories, one typically undervalued and overlooked by government and international organizations. See R. Bourke,

        that “55% of women and girls who participated in the Study reported that they have experienced some form of violence in the markets

       It’s always about buai. The fighting. There’s always a group who want to control the buai market. When
       they get drunk, they like to complain about the other people who come in. So a Wabag man is here,
       from here, but then he will also go outside and get his family from Wabag to come in and sell too. And
       the Wabags are selling cheaper, and it brings the price down—they want to get all the customers. So,
       the others don’t want the outsiders to come and steal their customers. And they try to challenge [the
       newcomers], physically. They kick over the stall. And then the situation becomes worse. The family come
       and join, and the fight gets going. Tokarara vendor

       •	   Trade at the beginning of the week is slow, the end is busiest. Sundays are quiet.

       •	   The morning: 5:30–8 a.m. 50–90 vendors (around twice that of Sabama, excluding the Sabama
            buai site), selling breakfast/convenience cooked food, buai to people on their way to work/
            school/study. Customers in the market at 7:30 a.m.: 300 (Monday), 320 (Wednesday, Friday); the
            majority are males earlier in the morning, with heavy buai sales from around 20 vendors.

       •	   The middle of the day slow time: 35–80 vendors, around 100 customers at 12 noon, for produce,
            cigarettes, marijuana, hot food, socializing. Buai sellers often dispersed by late morning, but sales
            continue from other stalls. Small majority of women customers.

       •	   The evening peak (especially at the end of the week): 80–150 vendors (around 50 percent more
            than Sabama), 250–300 buyers at 5 p.m., with the largest numbers coming and going between
            4:40 and 6:30 p.m.; a significant majority are male. Students and schoolchildren, people finishing/
            coming home from work, buying the day’s food on the way. Chicken, vegetables, evening meal
            herbs, convenience snacks (cucumbers, cans, fried food, hot food).

       •	   Unlike better-fenced markets, vendors cannot leave goods on site. Various adaptive measures are
            taken, including purchasing wholesale only small amounts of fresh vegetables daily; heavy
            discounting at day’s end; storage at home or in adjacent houses for a small fee.

        established already. People here assist themselves. We take responsibility, everybody is responsible. We

  Box 10. Mediators in the Market: Village Court Officials Talk about Public Order at Tokarara Market

  [The market] belongs to all of us. I say, “You didn’t bring this piece of land from outside. So you can’t
  say ‘no’ to this one or that one. It didn’t belong to your father’s grandfather.” We are very much aware
  as to the groups in the market. We take it on ourselves to mediate; we live together with them, we
  know them, we know those who only survive by selling betelnut.

  Lots of market issues come up [in mediation]: stealing, market spaces, jealousy. We have to go in
  between and make them understand competition in the market is a good business thing. If one
  person dominates the market it’s not good. We try to create this environment; people accept it with
  glee. But a stupid idiot with two cartons of beer can dismantle it all.

  The market’s safe on Mondays, because we [the Village Court people, magistrates, clerk] are there.
  Mark [the Village Court chair] is saying all the time, “this is a public space.” Ok, but it doesn’t always
  get in.

  now. We had minor problems in here, Christmas, New Year. But we did work together as a team, and
  tried to minimize law and order problems in the community. [In] 2008, 9, we had the Community
  Development Committee. There are 29 ethnic groups here in Sabama, mostly looking after themselves.
  The population is growing, but really there are no enemies here: the groups are friends, even best
  friends now. We are combined. We can come together, brainstorm, and make a toksave [announcement]

2.3 FUNCTION: SECURITY AND SAFETY
Physical renovation of the formal site has created
clean and secure spaces for vendors and customers.
The fence restricts access to two gated entrances
and thus secures the concession. The fenced market
is unanimously regarded as a safe zone for person
and property in Sabama; no respondent could recall
a serious security or theft incident inside the fence
since renovation. In areas immediately adjacent
to the market fence, in the carpark and bus stop,
harassment was reported to have significantly
declined.

  waiting. A car comes, two or three guys walk out on the crossing, the car stops, the gunmen come

  Headline lessons: Phase 2
  Urban leadership must build the right people into a “credible pact” that can include and protect all
  and bring the benefits of diversity into the market.
  •	  Bring together community leaders and organizations (from all ethnic groups) and include them
      in the staff
  •	 Especially, try to include representatives of the Village Courts and community police as well as
      women leaders, and make sure security is not just wansait [from one ethnic group]
  •	 Build a relationship with the police, so they come (and help) when needed
  Include multiple uses (snack food, or, as at Koki and other Moresby South markets, a special secure
  and separate place for buai selling, clothing, mini-goods stalls) in the reopened market: Don’t prune
  (or cut out) what doesn’t need pruning!!

  The market is not really safe. At night there is no security. We leave our leftover vegetables and go.

        The [renovated] market has advantages and disadvantages. Advantages are it’s public, it’s safe, it’s

        very strict. But this woman has a heart for people. At the end of the day, everyone reports to me. They
        all report. I hold each one of them accountable. The leadership roles we have, well, it all depends on
        trust: management trust, security trust. If you, me are playing games behind, it won’t work. People

        Yes, we pay the 2 kina [market fees], and we keep our tables inside the market at night. We were sick
        of getting chased away from outside, from the bus stop. We came to the sanctuary of the market.
        Inside [the market] it’s only garden vegetables. Out here it’s cigarettes, drink, snacks. We feel safe
        here. We keep the place clean, we are organized, we have our own security, our leaders in the market.
        We are the regulars, the ones who come here all the time. If some bigheads come, we get together
        and chase them out. Drunks too. The market security will help us sometimes.

        Before, the police came here and terrorized us, turned over the tables, stole the eskis [cool storage
        bins] and go. OK, some were selling drinks and buns, well… some were selling buai under the table.
        But the police beat all of us. If they come, I will try to protect what we have. We keep this place very
        clean, very tidy. We line up the firewood for sale. We are clean people—don’t threaten us!

        These are human beings in here. I am trying to indirectly deal with their difficulty, by finding a way for
        them to stay here. I can’t buy them a packet of rice, they have to eat. It’s negotiating; we say, you can
        do market here, but you have to take care of the rubbish. It’s proactive, not reactive. Sergeant Paulus,

  Headline lessons: Phase 3
  •	   Support market managers to enforce the rules, and include everyone in the market and keep it
       clean and worthy of pride
  •	   Be prepared to support the market financially while it recovers from the shock of renovation
  •	   Find new uses/producers/services/community groups to bring into the market to keep it busy all
       day long, a “one-stop shop” with different kinds of customers: fish, hairdressing, children’s health
  •	   Extend the “zone of security” provided by the market out into the surrounding vending and
       transport areas.

  Postscript
  The Return of Betelnut to Sabama market, January 2017
  In January 2017, the Member of Parliament for Moresby South and Chair of the Moresby South
  Markets Board oversaw the return of buai [betelnut] selling inside the Sabama market, just as he had
  done via a separate compound adjoining the larger Koki market where he had also led the renovation.
  The way this has been handled appears to be entirely consistent with the findings and the Phase 3
  recommendations made above.

  On a return visit to the market in February 2017, the authors observed what appeared to be dramatic,
  positive effects from these changes. As was the case before the renovation of the ‘buai and cigarette’
  Sabama market, more than thirty-five buai – predominantly male – sellers occupied a substantial
  section of the market, towards the rear. The market’s security people reported no issues: vendors (and
  observation) made it clear that a ban on consumption of buai within the market was being upheld.
  Vege and snack sellers reported increased sales: the market appeared to be much better subscribed
  than during the buai ban. Vendors said they were much happier and safe inside the fence than across
  the road. No complaints were heard, though the visit was brief, and certainly a number of market
  actors had previously expressed relief that buai had been excluded.

     Annex 1: Note on Methods


     This exploratory and formative piece of research used primary ethnographic and qualitative methods: observa-
     tion, participation, case studies, and group and individual interviews. It developed and validated initial findings
     through qualitative sampling strategies. These included snowball sampling and triangulation (deliberately
     seeking perspectives that are different from those already heard, with differences that are based on accepted
     social science parameters—see below); multiple points of entry and research team balance and splitting (not
     becoming dependent on or captured by one person, group, site); sampling to redundancy (pursuing these
     techniques until little or no new material and perspectives come to light); and sampling for difference (ensuring
     that the qualitative sample includes the full range of points of view). In urban PNG’s mixed settlements, research-
     significant differences include, at a minimum, ethnic, gender, age, and class, as expressed in roles within both
     the formal and informal economies.

     The study applied theoretical and analytic approaches (drawn largely from international/comparative political
     science, urban political economy, and historical institutional analysis) to inform the exploration of patterns
     of institutional development and capability. A further purposive sampling of respondents based on these
     approaches was a feature of interviews and observations throughout the research.

     Each site was visited and observed on multiple occasions over nine months of engagement, with each site
     the subject of 10–14 days initial intensive ethnographic observation. Extended series of interviews and focus
     groups were conducted with key actors in and around the markets, and with officials and others in government,
     administrative, and additional market contexts. Sites were also visited regularly as part of a parallel study of local
     mediation capabilities, involving many of the same local leaders. Ongoing monitoring of the situation into mid-
     2016, particularly with regard to the regulatory context of the buai ban and its policing, enabled reconsideration
     of both the analysis and recommendations.

     Altogether, more than 240 separate individuals and groups were interviewed across the three sites. Conversations
     occurred in the familiar mix of Tok Pisin (a pidgin that is a national language in Papua New Guinea) and
     English, within which much of this “local public” business is pursued. Translation was available on both sides.
     Confidentiality agreements have been honored in this report.

     These investigations enabled a wealth of empirical materials to be assembled. Only the most illustrative of
     these, however, could be used in the body of the report itself. Conclusions drawn in the report reflect the full
