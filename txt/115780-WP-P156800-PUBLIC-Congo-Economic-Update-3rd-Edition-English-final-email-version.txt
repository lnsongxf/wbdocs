As in the previous editions, the third Congo Economic Update presents an assessment of the current state of the
economy, before addressing a specific theme of significance for the country’s development. This edition argues that
the current fiscal crisis in Congo resulting from the decline in global oil prices will make it difficult for the country to
sustain fast growth unless the country adopts more prudent fiscal management and a balanced approach that builds
both physical capital and achieves significant improvements to human capital. Therefore, a deliberate effort has to be
made to ensure that the fiscal adjustments do not result in major decreases to the level of expenditure on health and
education. In addition, the Government must implement measures to improve the level of efficiency and effectiveness
of spending in these sectors.




PART 1: THE CONGOLESE ECONOMY TODAY

Congo’s rate of economic growth declined from 6.8 percent in 2014 to 2.6 percent in 2015. This deceleration in
economic growth was primarily due to the decline in global oil prices and to the associated decline in the level of Congo’s
production of oil. As a result of these factors, the rate of growth of the oil sector declined by 5.4 percentage points in
2015. Benefiting from recent efforts to diversify the economy, the non-oil sector grew at the rate of 4.9 percent, with
this growth primarily driven by the strong performance of the manufacturing, transportation, and telecommunications
sub-sectors. This notwithstanding, Congo’s economic performance has been more severely affected by low average
global oil prices than most other African resource rich countries, excluding South Sudan. This is mainly because
Congo’s economy is much more dependent on oil than many other countries.


Despite the low rate of inflation, liquidity conditions remained tight throughout 2015, acting as a constraint on
access to credit by the private sector. The tight monetary policy stance in Congo was consistent with the policy within
the Franc zone until the latter part of the year, when the benchmark interest rates were reduced by 50 basis points and
reserve requirements for Congolese banks were reduced from 14 percent to 7 percent.


With low oil prices, Congo economy is now faced with a twin-deficit. On the one hand, with the lower than
anticipated fiscal revenues and export receipts during 2015, Congo is faced with worsening deficit positions
on both the fiscal side and the external side. The value of the fiscal deficit has almost tripled over the past year,
increasing from the equivalent of 5.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 18.3 percent in 2015. The Government’s adjustment
measures have been insufficient to counteract the impact of the decline in oil revenues. The external current deficit also
deteriorated, from a value equivalent to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 13.2 percent in 2015. Part of the budget deficit
was financed by drawing on reserves saved by the state and through statutory advances from the Bank of Central
African State (BEAC). However, these sources of financing were inadquate and Government increased its external
borrowing by 14 percent, pushing Congo’s stock of external debt to a value equivalent to 52 percent of GDP by end
of 2015. This creates the risk of debt distress, despite Congo’s successful participation in the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) debt initiative only five years ago.


Congo’s outlook for growth in the short to medium-term future remains poor, with only a slow recovery to global
oil prices anticipated and with Congo’s oil production expected to lag even in the case of recovery. In 2016, the real
rate of GDP growth can be expected to increase to 3.8 percent. It is expected to remain at roughly this level at least until
the end of 2018. The expected increase in oil production should contribute to a stabilization in the rate of growth of GDP
growth in coming years, with this rate anticipated to reach 3.5 percent in 2017 and around 3.6 percent in 2018. With this
translating into only a modest per capita growth rate, the decline in the rate of poverty is also expected to be modest.
However, the anticipated continuation of low average global oil prices creates opportunities for reforms to eradicate
Congo’s deficits, placing the country in a better position to benefit from the eventual recovery in these prices, with a
more dynamic private sector and better systems of public finance management.

CONGO ECONOMIC UPDATE : Adjusting for better social and economic outcomes in an era of low oil prices




            The high degree of dependence on highly volatile oil revenues, the high level of domestic arrears, and Congo’s
            over-exposure to Chinese financing are key risks to realizing the growth forecast. These risks must be managed
            carefully, as must vulnerabilities related to the country’s high rate of urbanization, its large young population, and
            political and security related risks. The Government needs to implement serious reforms to increase the value of
            non-oil revenues, to rationalize expenditures, to generate fiscal savings that can act as a buffer that can be used
            in turbulent times. This would require that fiscal operations are based on fiscal rules that restrict spending to levels
            consistent with a healthy non-oil primary balance and allow for accumulation of an equity fund. Reforms are also
            crucial to improve efficiency and effectiveness of capital investments as well as the spending within the social sectors.
            Since 2012, imprudent economic management has not allowed the Congolese economy to minimize negative effects
            of volatile oil prices. Adopting these fiscal rules can help change this under the current crisis. Adopting these fiscal
            rules can help change this under the current crisis.


            Therefore, ensuring that recurrent expenditures are contained within reasonable levels, and that its investments
            in infrastructure and social sectors are balanced appropriately, will be crucial. As an example, expenditure on the
            public wage bill could be restricted so that it amounts to no more than the equivalent of 6.9 percent of non-oil GDP
            and government expenditure on goods and services to no more than 9.8 percent of non-oil GDP. In this context,
            reducing or eliminating fuel subsidies would create increased fiscal space for social spending combined with a
            positive environmental impact. In terms of capital investment, the Government should also change the composition
            and level to better balance the emphasis between infrastructure and the social sectors. This way the physical capital
            accumulation can come hand-in-hand with improvements in social service provision.


            The impact of declining oil prices on Congo’s economy underscores the fundamental need for economic
            diversification. The agriculture sector has significant untapped potential to support economic diversification, but will
            require key policy reforms (particularly in the area of land tenure), investment in infrastructure, and the development
            of capacities to facilitate participation in high potential value chains. At the same time, institutional reforms are
            necessary to improve the business climate. Some positive steps have been taken in this direction, such as when the
            Council of Ministers adopted a new hydrocarbons code on March 25, 2016, with this code defining a larger role for
            national firms and increasing the state’s share of oil profits. Even if the code’s adoption will have only a marginal impact
            on the Government’s revenues from the oil sector in the forecast period, with new investment being constrained by the
            slump in oil prices, just a slight increase in the Government’s share of oil revenues will play a positive role in restoring
            the fiscal surplus in 2017.




            PART 2: ADJUSTING FOR BETTER HUMAN CAPITAL

            Congo has struggled to achieve significant improvements in social outcomes for the majority of its citizens in
            recent years. This is in spite of its large endowment of natural resources, and despite benefiting from higher average
            oil prices over recent years at least to 2014 and from its participation in a major debt relief initiative, all of which enabled
            Congo to record high rates of economic growth and to generate significant financial resources for the Government.
            With a gross secondary school enrolment rate of 64 percent, with 75 percent of primary leavers not attaining sufficient
            foundational skills in literacy and numeracy, with a huge disease burden, and with high maternal and infant mortality
            rates, Congo’s social indicators are considerably worse than many other countries at the same level of income in or
            out of Africa.


            The moderate levels of public financing of social sectors and its inequitable allocation remain central policy
            problems that result in limited physical and economic access to quality services. The impressive plans within both
            the health and education sectors have to be funded for the anticipated socio-economic transformation to materialize.
            For instance, if fully rolled out, the universal health coverage system would ensure access to health for the entire
            population. With the current budget for the health sector reaching no more than 1.7 percent of GDP, allocating
            sufficient resources for such initiatives is impossible.



x
Furthermore, there are inherent inefficiencies in the way resources are spent and allocated for the priorities within
the sectors, as well as in the policies pursued. Within the education sector, for instance, the fast growing population and
grade repetition have put significant pressure on budget resources and caused overcrowding. There are also dysfunctions
in the management of human resources in the education sector. Moreover, this sector has been adversely affected by a
lack of well-formed plans to determine staffing levels. In terms of the demand, the poor quality of data related to actual
student numbers, unreliable demographic information related to incoming cohorts of school-age children, and the
lack of reliable data related to the number of out-of-school children make it impossible to clearly project how many
teachers will be needed to achieve universal primary enrollment. In terms of the supply, deployment decisions are not
implemented rigorously, with an almost complete lack of sanctions on teachers absent without approved leave. There are
no well-implemented controls on the movement of staff between regions or from teaching to administrative positions.
There are no well-implemented systems to ensure the removal of personnel from the Ministry responsible for education
budget once they leave the sector, with the Ministry itself lacking the authority to make decisions related to recruiting or
paying teachers. These issues make it difficult or impossible to prepare a rational human resource plan for the sector.
Without a sufficient basis to determine levels of teacher demand and teacher supply, the decisions made by the Ministry
responsible for education on matters related to the recruitment and deployment of personnel will remain fundamentally
flawed. Therefore, although Congo’s average pupil-teacher ratios are at acceptable levels compared with many other
Sub-Saharan Africa countries, the distribution of teachers is extremely uneven, with some classes being taught with more
than 80 students in a single classroom.




In view of the tight fiscal situation on account of the decline in oil prices, tough decisions have to be made with
respect to government spending, the allocations to the different sectors, and the efficiency and effectiveness of
policies pursued within these sectors. The fiscal adjustment made must ensure a balanced approach that allows for
building of physical capital and progress in the social sectors; and must be followed by non-fiscal measures that support
efficiency of use of resources. This would therefore encompass a multilevel adjustment as follows:


1. Adjustment of the overall budget

The first level of adjustment is at the overall budget allocation level through the following:

•	   Reducing non-essential spending to increase fiscal space for social services: Adopting measures to control
     the public wage bill (6.9 percent of non-oil GDP) and to contain government spending on goods and services (9.8
     percent of non-oil GDP) and reducing or eliminating fuel subsidies would create additional fiscal space to enable the
     Government to increase social spending.

•	   Changing the composition of public spending to support a more balanced development strategy: In the recent
     past, the Government has largely concentrated on the development of physical infrastructure. The Government should
     examine its prioritization towards a more balanced development approach that allows investments in infrastructure to
     be made concurrently with the development of the social sectors, to improve service provision.

•	   Improving the efficiency of public spending: The Government could implement a number of budget formulation
     and management reforms to promote decentralization, improved coordination and increased efficiency. In the
     health sector, for instance, allocating a greater proportion of the Government’s health budget to the regions with an
     emphasis on pro-poor expenditure may help reduce inequalities.

The second level of adjustment would have to be within the sectors. While the adjustment in the overall budget
allocation can realize more resources for the social sectors, these would have to be followed with improvements in
efficiency in the way resources are utilized within the sectors to realize more value for money.




                                                                                                                               xi
CONGO ECONOMIC UPDATE : Adjusting for better social and economic outcomes in an era of low oil prices




      2. Adjustment within the education sector

      Within the education sector, the areas in which efficiency gains can be made include the following:


      •	   Adopting a policy of automatic grade promotion: Introducing automatic grade promotion, at least between certain
           grades, could reduce spending and relieve overcrowding. Allocating an increased share of public financing to the poorest
           areas in the country and to urban areas with a high concentration of poor residents might be implemented to complement
           this policy by providing additional support to the most vulnerable. Global evidence indicates that grade repetition
           discourages families from keeping their children in school and does not lead to the gains in learning outcomes that might
           justify the costs and risks associated with a high dropout rate.

      •	   Enhancing human resource management through improvements such as better recruitment practices and better
           systems of remuneration and incentives: Improving the system of human resource management through sectoral civil
           service reforms, better recruitment practices, more efficient use of human resources, and improved management of
           the wage bill could greatly reduce wastage and facilitate the achievement of sustainable improvements into delivery of
           education services. In particular, there is a need to reduce the relative number of administrative staff, to improve salary
           transfers to rural areas, to ensure the payment of pensions within a reasonable time frame, and to ensure that “bénévoles”
           teachers are paid appropriately for their role in the effective implementation of the fee-free primary education policy.

      •	   Improving management of expenditure through better planning, and evidence-based management, and monitoring:
           To achieve this, it is necessary to invest in improving education data especially related to demographic information of the
           in-coming cohorts of school-age children, and the out of school children, in order to estimate the number of teachers
           needed in schools. Furthermore, the education system should adopt an incentive system that rewards good behaviors
           and punishes bad ones, together with a well implemented system of deployment of teachers and non-teaching staff
           across regions. This should facilitate formulation of a proper human resource plan for the sector to support a more
           efficient recruitment and deployment of personnel within the education sector and to distribute teachers more evenly and
           equitably across departments and to address intra-regional disparities between different schools.

      •	   Adopting measures to control the high unit costs of higher education and to reform the system of scholarships to
           ensure higher levels of equity and sustainability: A review should be conducted to ensure the adoption of measures
           to control the high unit costs of technical and vocational education and training and other forms of higher education. In
           addition, the scholarship system should be reformed to ensure that post-secondary education in Congo becomes more
           equitable and sustainable. Supporting more equitable access to post-basic education is a key element towards ensuring
           higher levels of equity and social mobility for the poorer segments of the population.




      3. Adjustment within the health sector

      Within the health sector, the low levels of public financing and its inequitable allocation constrain access to quality services.
      With the Government’s limited fiscal space, it is crucial that existing financial resources are used efficiently and effectively.
      Possible ways to achieve this include the following:


      •	   Pursuing a more balanced strategy with respect to financing construction of hospitals on one hand, and lower level
           facilities and recurrent expenses to support service delivery: Reducing expenditure on hospitals, including through the
           new provincial hospital construction program, and allocating a higher proportion of the health budget to the development
           of healthcare centers and other decentralized facilities could improve allocative efficiency. This would require shifting the
           emphasis away from the construction of health facilities to financing service delivery, which alleviates the high financial
           barriers to access services. Financing lower levels of care through the defined service packages are more pro-poor and
           much more cost-effective than financing tertiary care.




xii
•	   Improving quality of services by institutionalizing performance-based financing reforms: This would entail directly
     financing select health providers to deliver defined benefit packages under the output-based-financing modalities to
     accelerate achievement of Universal Health Coverage. Financing of decentralized facilities, including for accredited
     private providers, will strengthen public-private partnerships, and increase the focus on results. In addition, involvement
     of civil society in verification and client satisfaction surveys will enhance good governance.

•	   Improving the management of human resources to support better delivery of services in the health sector: This
     would require aligning human resource management reforms with the ongoing health financing reforms to enhance
     efficiency and effectiveness of available budgets while dovetailing with these reforms.

•	   Improving the management of the medicines and drugs: Access to good quality affordable generic pharmaceuticals
     needs to be strengthened. This will entail providing more resources to the central medical stores and strengthening
     partnerships between the public sector and private sector, in particular in the distribution of drugs and medicines.

•	   Streamlining the processes for flow of public funds by removing redundant controls to accelerate the rate of
     execution of investments within the health sector.

•	   Streamlining administration of the health system to raise its efficiency.

     •	 Congo’s rate of economic growth has declined sharply over the past year, dropping from 6.8 percent in 2014 to 2.6
         percent in 2015. This decline was primarily attributable to the sharp drop in global oil prices reaching 47.3 percent
         during the year, which in turn resulted into reduction in volume of oil produced in Congo. Economic activity in the oil
         sector declined by 5.6 percent.

     •	 The rate of economic growth of the non-oil sector stood at 4.9 percent in 2015, with growth driven by the good
         performance of the manufacturing, transport, telecommunications, commerce and restaurants sub-sectors.
         However, this sector’s rate of growth was also much lower than the figure of 7.9 percent recorded in 2014.

     •	 The average annual rate of inflation in 2015 stood at 2.7 percent, with this low  rate the result of deflationary pressures
         related to the low oil prices and to the implementation of the tight monetary policy.

     •	 The external current account deficit widened over 2015, reaching a value equivalent to 13.2 percent of GDP.
         Combined with a double-digit fiscal deficit, this has resulted in a serious twin-deficit problem that requires urgent
         attention and adjustment measures.

     •	 Congo’s outlook for growth in the short to medium-term future remains poor, with only a slow recovery to global oil
         prices anticipated and with Congo’s production expected to lag even in the case of recovery. In 2016, the real rate of
         GDP growth can be expected to increase to 3.8 percent. It is expected to remain at roughly this level at least until the
         end of 2018.

     •	 While continued low prices present an opportunity for reforms, it is also the most significant source of risk for the
         Congolese economy. Other risks include over-exposure to the Chinese economy, high level of domestic arrears,
         and vulnerabilities related to Congo’s high rate of urbanization, the youth of its population and political and security
         related risks.

1.0 Recent Economic Developments
In 2015, Congo’s economy grew by 2.6 percent, a far lower rate than the 6.8 percent recorded in 2014. This deceleration in economic growth
was primarily due to the decline in global oil prices and to the associated decline in the level of Congo’s production of oil. As a result of these
factors, the rate of growth of the oil sector declined by 5.6 percentage points in 2015. Benefiting from efforts to improve infrastructure, the non-
oil sector grew at the rate of 4.9 percent, with this growth primarily driven by the strong performance of the manufacturing, transportation, and
telecommunications sub-sectors. Despite the low rate of inflation, liquidity conditions remained tight throughout the year, acting as a constraint
on access to credit by the private sector. With lower than anticipated fiscal revenues and export receipts, Congo is faced with worsening deficit
positions on both the fiscal side and the external side. The value of the fiscal deficit almost tripled, increasing from the equivalent of 5.5 percent
of GDP in 2014 to 18.3 percent in 2015, with the Government’s adjustment measures being insufficient to counteract the impact of the decline in
oil revenues. The external current deficit also deteriorated, from a value equivalent to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 13.2 percent in 2015. Part of
the budget deficit was financed by drawing on reserves saved by the state and through statutory advances from the Bank of Central African State
(BEAC). In addition, external borrowing increased by 14 percent, pushing the Governments’ debt stock to 52 percent of GDP. This creates the
risk of debt distress, despite Congo’s successful participation in the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative only five years ago.
The failure to pay debt falling due in June 2016 generated anxiety as rating agencies downgraded Congo’s creditworthiness. While some rating
agencies reversed their actions after the payment was effected, Congo’s credit rating stands at levels far lower than what they were in 2015.

median level for Africa, which stands at 0.43.3 There is also an
increasing level of inequality in terms of the gap between urban
and rural areas. Unemployment is particularly high for women,
youth, and those living in the main cities, particularly Brazzaville
and Pointe Noire, with the rate of unemployment for those aged
from 15 to 29 years standing at about 32.7 percent, according to
the 2011 ECOM Survey. A large proportion of those living below
the poverty line depend heavily on subsistence agriculture or
from low-productivity livelihoods in the informal sector. The
formal sector is relatively small and dominated by the public
sector. There are also significant differences in the level of
participation in the labor force in terms of gender, with women
significantly less likely to be employed in the public sector or in
the formal private sector.


At the beginning of 2015, it was clear that the Congolese
authorities would need to manage a number of challenges
if the economy was to remain on a positive trajectory. The
first of these challenges related to the sharp decline in average
global oil prices over the preceding year, with prices forecast
to remain low into the medium-term future. This was expected
to have a number of impacts, including a reduction in Congo’s

    Box 1: Diversification drive revives cement manufacturing


    Under its economic diversification policy, included in the National Development Plan 2012-2016 (PND), the Government
    allowed significant investment in the cement industry and palm oil cultivation by private sector businesses. As a result of
    this policy, two new cement plants were installed during 2014. The first is the Forspak plant, located in Dolisie. This plant is
    financed by Chinese investors and is expected to produce 0.3 million tons of cement per year. The second plant is Cimaf,
    located in Hinda and funded by Moroccan investors, is expected to produce 0.5 million tons of cement per year to complete the
    first “Société nouvelle des ciments du Congo” (Sonocc) based in Loutété, with 0.22 million tons.


    With the installation of these facilities, it is estimated that total production of cement has reached 1.25 million tons per year,
    which helped to meet a large part of the domestic demand driven by the Government’s infrastructure development program,
    with the level of demand currently estimated to stand at 1.2 million tons per year. Consequently, the average price of cement
    per ton in the local market declined to almost half of previous levels, to XAF 136,000 per ton in late 2015.


    In order to close the remaining gap, it is envisaged that additional plants will come into operation. The next plant to come into
    operation will be Dangote Cement in Yamba, with Nigerian financing (with an output of 1.5 million tons per year) and Diament
    Cement in Mindouli (with 0.6 million per year). Once all these plants come into production, total cement output will increase to
    at least 3.35 million tons per year, sufficient to enable Congo to become a net exporter.

2.0 Congo’s economic outlook for 2016–2018
The expected increase in oil production should contribute to a stabilization in the rate of growth of GDP in coming years, with this rate anticipated
to reach 3.8 percent in 2016 and around 3.6 percent in 2017 and 2018. With this translating into only a modest per capita growth rate, the decline
in the rate of poverty is also expected to be modest. However, the anticipated continuation of low average global oil prices creates opportunities
for reforms to eradicate Congo’s deficits, placing the country in a better position to benefit from the eventual recovery in these prices, with a more
dynamic private sector and better systems of public finance management. However, the heavy dependence on highly volatile oil revenues and
over-exposure to the Chinese economy are key risks to realizing the growth forecast. These would have to be managed alongside vulnerabilities
arising from a high rate of urbanization, a large young population, and political and security related perils.




2.1 Moderate real sector growth expected within a gloomy international context
In the medium-term future, Congo’s economic outlook will be                  In this context, economic growth in Congo is expected to remain

    Box 3: Why the recent oil shock is more permanent than temporary


    The decline in oil prices since mid-2014 was partly a catching up to a broader trend of commodity price declines that had
    been well underway. After reaching deep lows during the global financial crisis, most commodity prices, including oil prices,
    peaked in the first quarter of 2011. Since then, prices of metals, agricultural and raw materials have declined steadily as a
    result of weak global demand and robust supplies. In contrast, oil prices fluctuated within a narrow band around $105/barrel
    (bbl) until June 2014. Through much of 2012 and 2013, the impact of softening global demand on oil markets was offset by
    concerns about geopolitical risks and pricing policies exercised by OPEC. As some of these factors unwound, oil price started
    to drop steeply in June 2014. By February 2015, the cumulative fall in oil prices was significantly larger than that in other
    commodity prices since their peaks in 2011.


    Oil prices have dropped by more than 70 percent since June 2014 and are expected to remain low for a long time. Underlying
    demand and supply conditions for oil determine long-run trends in prices, but short-run movements in market sentiment
    and expectations can play a major role in driving price fluctuations. In the recent oil price plunge, revisions of supply and
    demand expectations, while noticeable, were neither exceptional nor unusually large. However, the recent episode is unique
    in the sense that these changes in expectations coincided with three other major developments: a significant shift in OPEC’s
    objectives, receding geopolitical risks, and significant U.S. dollar appreciation. These factors together formed a “perfect
    storm” that was reinforced by longer-term shifts in supply and demand dynamics (see World Bank Group Policy research note
    entitled: “The Great Plunge in Oil Prices: Causes, Consequences, and Policy Responses » of March 2015)”. . In its April 2015
    WEO update, the International Monetary Fund also observed that on the supply side, the advent and relative resilience of
    shale oil production and increased oil production by OPEC members play an important role. The WEO continues to argue that
    on the demand side, lower GDP growth in emerging markets has tended to reduce oil demand growth, especially in light of
    the secular increase in global oil efficiency, and is expected to continue to do so. While the slow down can be counteracted by
    the fast increasing demand driven by industrialization as well as demand for transport services and car ownership, increasing
    exploration of other sources of energy including natural gas and coal will also reduce demand for oil. Indeed the share of oil
    in the world’s primary energy consumption has declined from 50 percent to 30 percent between 1970 and 2016, while that for
    natural gas and coal was increasing steadily over the same period and reached 30 percent and 25 percent, respectively.


    In view of these factors, many analysist forecast that commodity prices can be expected to remain low for a long time for a
    number of factors. According to the World Bank’s Commodity markets outlook of July 2016, oil prices are projected to rise
    only moderately in the medium to long term and may not increase above $70/barrel before 2020. It further indicates that there
    are upside risks to the price forecast including further supply outages in OPEC countries (Iraq, Nigeria, and Venezuela),
    larger non-OPEC supply declines, and stronger demand. Nonetheless, downside price risks also abound, centering on
    slower market rebalancing because of weak demand, the return of lost production, and persistent high stocks.




The Government should implement reforms that enable Congo to build a fiscal buffer if and when there is a recovery in global
commodity prices. This can be achieved by adopting fiscal rules that allow it to spend within reasonable limits while saving for hard
times, and also promote a culture of saving some of the resources from the future generations (see Box 4).

       To achieve sound management of its oil resources, the Government should do the following:


        (i) 	    The Government should implement fiscal rules based on the non-oil primary balance

        (ii)	    The fiscal rules should include a current and capital expenditure growth rule aimed at ensuring Congo maintains a
                 healthy ratio between its non-oil primary balance and its non-oil GDP.

                 ensure that these increases are consistent with the maintenance of the healthy Non-Oil Primary Balance /Non-Oil
                 GDP ratio and the budgeted oil price.

        (iv) 	   To achieve (iii) above, the Government should establish mechanisms to ensure a high level of transparency within
                 government institutions and to improve the management of its revenues.

        (v) 	    The Government should also adopt rules for the accumulation of savings in the stabilization fund. These riles
                 should be applied consistently. The level of the Government’s funds currently available at BEAC are insufficient to
                 effectively guarantee stabilization.

        (vi) 	   The government should adopt transparent mechanisms and stringent conditions to determine if and when it is
                 appropriate to transfer these funds to the Public Treasury.

        (vii) 	 Given that Congo’s oil resources are non-renewable, a mechanism to accumulate savings in an equity fund
                 to ensure that these resources continue to provide benefits for future generations should be developed and
                 implemented.

        (viii)	 The Government should also adopt well-designed and strictly implemented investment policies to manage
                 the equity fund. In particular, these policies should focus on the profitability of the fund’s investments and the
                 associated risk level. If, for instance, a portion of the funds are invested in Congo’s economy, the Government
                 should create an independent committee to assess the level of economic and social profitability of the associated
                 projects before they are allocated funding from this source.

        (ix)	    In general, a well-designed medium-term expenditure framework is essential for the appropriate management
                 of these resources to ensure that they provide ongoing benefits even after the eventual depletion of non-
                 renewable natural resources.

     •	 In spite of its large endowment of natural resources, in spite of benefiting from higher average oil prices over recent
         years, and in spite of benefiting from its participation in a major debt relief initiative, all of which enabled Congo
         to record high rates of economic growth and to generate significant financial resources for the Government, it has
         failed to achieve significant improvements in social outcomes for the majority of its citizens.

     •	 With a gross secondary school enrolment rate of 64 percent, with 75 percent of primary leavers not attaining sufficient
         foundational skills in literacy and numeracy, with a huge disease burden, and with high maternal and infant mortality
         rates, Congo’s social indicators are considerably worse than many other countries at the same level of income.

     •	 Congo has increased the level of resources allocated to both education and health sectors in recent years. However,
         allocations have varied significantly from year to year and budgets are often not efficiently executed. In addition,
         there are significant inefficiencies in the manner in which resources are expended and prioritized.

     •	 While the Government has formulated impressive plans to improve the performance of both the health and education
         sectors and to improve outcomes, such as through the implementation of a universal health coverage system, unless
         these plans are supported with the allocation of a sufficient level of funds, they will not be realized.

     •	 With the declining global oil prices, the Government has limited fiscal space in which to operate. In this context,
         fiscal adjustments are inevitable. However, given the importance of the development of the country’s human capital,
         it is vital that these adjustments do not adversely affect the social sectors.

     •	 Thus, while the Government must make adjustments to the overall budget to achieve a more balanced development
         for both physical and human capital, it should also prioritize implementation of measures aimed at improving the
         efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure.

drove a significant increase in the growth of per capita incomes, with the average per capita income standing at US$ 3,147 in 2014.


In spite of this strong economic performance, Congo failed to achieve significant improvements in social outcomes for the majority
of its citizens. A large proportion of the population (46.5 percent) still lives below the poverty line, and inequality persists. While there
has been some improvement in education and health outcomes in recent years, with the country recovering from previous social and
political unrest and the related plight of human capital, progress still lags.

the household level. At the primary level, according to a recent
MEPSA survey (June 2015), up to 40 percent of students attend
private non-religious schools. The high level of enrolment at
private institutions is the result of perceived gaps in the quantity
or quality of public educational services and of the high indirect
costs of public services. However, for those in the lowest income
brackets, the Government remains the primary provider of
services (see Figure 18). Even at public primary schools, parents
are often required to pay volunteer teachers or bénévoles,13
out of their own means, which can be a severe hardship for the
poor. With more than a third of the population living in extreme
poverty (below the $1.90 PPP a day benchmark), this suggests
that only a limited number of students, from rich households,
can access high-quality educational services. Thus, there has
been a significant failure to ensure effective access to affordable
services by those who need them most.

      Box 5: Performance Based Financing to improve service delivery in the health sector


      The Government has commenced with the implementation of performance based financing (PBF) program to improve the
      delivery of health services to its population. Implemented as a component of the second World Bank-funded Health Systems
      Strengthening Project (PDSS II), the implementation of the program commenced in June 2015. The first phase of the PBF
      program will be implemented in the period from 2014 to 2019 with a budget of US$ 120 million, of which 86 percent involves the
      Government’s own funds. The cost of implementing this program is estimated to reach US$ 5 per capita per year.

      What is the PBF program? The PBF program is an arrangement between service providers and the Government intended to
      revise the incentive structure to improve service delivery. The PBF program involves the contracting of selected public and private
      health facilities to deliver health services to the population, with the performance of these facilities judged in terms of indicators
      included in contracts signed with district health administrations, the provincial health administration, select central ministry of
      health departments, and the central medical stores. The program also facilitates targeted interventions in the pharmaceutical
      sector, including the introduction of a cloud-based revamp of the health management information system and reforms to the
      management of human resources to improve equity and to enhance allocative efficiency. At a later stage, a DHIS2-based software
      will be introduced to expand the capacity of the national health information system.

      Who benefits from the PBF program? The PBF targets seven of Congo’s 12 health departments. These include Brazzaville,
      Pointe Noire, Bouenza, Cuvette and the pilot departments of Niari, Pool and Plateau. The combined population of these
      departments is 3.8 million, or 86 percent of the country’s population. The program specifically targets 1.9 million women and
      children under 5, with a specific stated goal of the program being to increase the rate of utilization and quality of maternal and
      child health services. The program is intended to improve access to services by negotiating to reduce fees for services provided
      both by public and private service providers. In addition, the program facilitates the provision of technical assistance the Ministry
      of Health and Population to improve budget formulation and allocation. It is intended that the program will facilitate geographic
      and quality equity adjustments to ensure the improved allocation of health budgets, with a better distribution of resources between
      health centers and hospitals. Differential fees will be established on the basis of rural hardship criteria. In the future, the PBF will
      implement measures to improve governance through the use of a cloud-computing application with a public frontend, with the
      mobilisation of civil society for verification and community feedback.

      How does it work? The PBF program provides financing to frontline health services through a system of output-based payments
      based on the quantity and quality of health services provided by public and private health centers and first level referral hospitals
      included in the program. PBF subsidies are used to negotiate downwards the user fees charged to the clients. The PBF payments
      are intended to supplement the facilities’ revenues. Health facilities can use 50 percent of income earned from user fees and PBF to
      supplement their salaries.(Fritsche, György Bèla; Soeters, Robert; Meessen, Bruno. 2014. Performance-Based Financing Toolkit.

      The program also includes incentives for the provision of services to the poor, since it pays a higher fee for each unit of service
      delivered to a patient categorized as poor under the project, identified through community targeting and a proxy means test with
      the LISUNGI software. Twenty-five percent of the poorest beneficiaries will be issued with an identification card which exempts
      them from payment for all services under both packages at contracted health centers and hospitals, public and private. Since
      the performance bonuses are expected to be almost equivalent to the current out-of-pocket payments by poor households, it is
      expected that they will almost completely eliminate user fees for poor, which are still being supported by the project to meet the
      costs of the service.

      The non-poor may be required to make capped copayments for four services at public facilities and six at contracted private
      for-profit facilities. All other services are free of charge, being subsidized by PBF. This is intended to enable service providers to
      lower the fees imposed on the non-poor. The bonuses also cover a substantial portion of out-of-pocket payments for non-poor
      households.

      The program introduces a purchaser-provider split by establishing independent contracting agencies, though fund holding
      remains with the MOHP. Local civil society organizations are being mobilised to manage the contracts and to provide verification
      and counter-verification of the results and coaching, while grassroots organizations are being mobilised to measure service use
      and client satisfaction.

      How is quality of service assured? Quality is measured in terms of a quality check list, with this list providing a comprehensive
      quality assessment of more than a hundred items related to hygiene, drugs (availability, rational prescribing and management),
      clinical care, equipment availability, financial management and laboratory. The quality of health administration is also measured at
      district (CSS), departmental (DDS) and select departments at central (MOHP) level.
