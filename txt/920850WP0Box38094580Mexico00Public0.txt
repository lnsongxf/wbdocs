THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        The relevant agencies for this procedure are the Delegational One-Stop
        Shop (Ventanilla Única Delegacional), the Urban Development and
        Housing Ministry (Secretaría de Desarrollo Urbano y Vivienda), and the
        Federal District Department (Gobierno del Distrito Federal). Either a
        simple original copy or a certified one is acceptable.

        For the official number, the Federal District Department will assign a
        single official number for each property, at the request of the interested
        party, that has a front facing the public pathway. For the official
        alignment, the plot across the land indicates the restrictions or
        expropriation lines to be respected in the interaction between the
        property and the public pathway. Obtaining the single zoning
        certificate stating specific land use and feasibility is required.

        • Public deed certifying property or title ownership (original and copy)
        • Payment of all fees
        • Application form (original)
        • Identification of the person completing the procedure and document
        certifying the respective identity (original and copy)

        Payment is made the same day when the certificate is requested. At the
        same time, a date is set for the taxpayer to return to receive the
        certificate, generally within 3 or 4 working days. The certificate is valid
        for 2 years.

        The cost is established by the Financial Code of the Federal District,
        Articles 233 and 234. The official cost, as amended in December 2013,
        is the sum of the alignment at MXN 35.82 per linear meter in the front
        of the building, plus a general fee for the official number at MXN 233.

      In this case, the front of the building is assumed to be 22.5 meters, so
      the total cost would be MXN 1,038.95 (= 35.82 x 22.5 m+233) .

      license issuance fees if the application is required (simple original copy

      requires installation or modification of the water main and hook-up to

      corresponding fees are attached.

      After registration of the construction statement, the one-stop shop
      (Ventanilla Única Delegacional) reviews the submitted data and
      documents and verifies the progress of the construction work under
      the terms stated in the Administrative Verification Rules (Reglamento
      de Verificación Administrativa) for the Federal District.

      The director responsible for the construction work undertakes to post a
      signboard showing the registration number in the construction work
      statement and the general construction work data, including the
      location and statement validity. The signboard must be posted in a
      visible place and legible from the public pathway.

      The validity of the statement (for construction work completion) is as
      follows:
      • Up to 300 square meters: 1 year
      • 300 -- 1,000 square meters: 2 years
      • More than 1,000 square meters: 3 years

      The cost breakdown for obtaining the building permit is the following:

      • Register: MXN 524.50 (DF Tax Code 2013 Article 185, Sec. B, fr. I, p.a)
      • Analysis: MXN 76.50 x 1,300.6 m2 = MXN 99,495.9 (DF Tax Code 2013

Table 6.1 How has Mexico made getting credit easier—or not?
By Doing Business report year from DB2010 to DB2015

DB year            Reform

                    Mexico strengthened its secured transactions system by
DB2012              implementing a centralized collateral registry with an electronic
                    database that is accessible online.
                    Mexico improved access to credit by amending its insolvency
                    proceedings law and establishing clear grounds for relief from a
DB2015              stay of enforcement actions by secured creditors during
                    reorganization procedures. This reform applies to both Mexico

  The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is
defined as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution for all years included in the analysis. It is calculated and adjusted on a
yearly basis. The threshold is not based on any economic theory of an “optimal tax rate” that minimizes distortions or maximizes efficiency in the tax
system of an economy overall. Instead, it is mainly empirical in nature, set at the lower end of the distribution of tax rates levied on medium-size
enterprises in the manufacturing sector as observed through the paying taxes indicators. This reduces the bias in the indicators toward economies
that do not need to levy significant taxes on companies like the Doing Business standardized case study company because they raise public revenue
in other ways—for example, through taxes on foreign companies, through taxes on sectors other than manufacturing or from natural resources (all
of which are outside the scope of the methodology). This year’s threshold is 26.1%.

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a
sales contract between 2 domestic businesses. The           Enforcement costs
case study assumes that the court hears an expert on
the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
technology. Lower-income economies often work on                  recorded in Mexico (table 10.1)?

Social protection schemes and benefits & Labor disputes

Doing Business collects data on the existence of unemployment protection schemes as well as data on whether
employers are legally required to provide health insurance for employees with permanent contracts.


Doing Business also assesses the mechanisms available to resolve labor disputes. More specifically, it collects data
on what courts would be competent to hear labor disputes and whether the competent court is specialized in
resolving labor disputes.
