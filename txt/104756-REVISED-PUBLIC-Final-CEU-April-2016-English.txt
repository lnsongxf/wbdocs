The Cambodia Economic Update (CEU) is a product of the staff of the World Bank. It was prepared by
Sodeth Ly and incorporates contributions by Miguel Eduardo Sánchez Martín, both at the
Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global Practice (MFM GP). Linna Ky served as research
assistant. The team worked under the guidance of Mathew A. Verghis, Practice Manager, MFM GP.
Ratchada Anantavrasilpa and Colleen Mascenik, Finance and Markets (FAM) GP contributed the selected
issue on Recent Developments of the Financial Sector: Opportunities and Risks, which was reviewed by
James Seward, Practice Manager, FAM GP. The team is grateful for the comments, advice and guidance
provided by Ulrich Zachau, Country Director, and Shabih Ali Mohib, Program Leader.

The CEU is produced bi-annually to provide up-to-date information on macroeconomic developments
in Cambodia. It is published and distributed widely to the Cambodian authorities, the development partner
community, the private sector, think tanks, civil society organizations, and academia. The update is timed
to coincide with the six-monthly publication of the East Asia and Pacific Economic Update by the East
Asia MFM GP of the World Bank.

We received valuable inputs, comments and suggestions from Ahmad Ahsan, East Asia and Pacific Chief
Economist Unit, Sergiy Zorya, Agriculture GP, Carolina Mejia-Mantilla, Poverty GP, and Jose De Luna
Martinez, Finance and Markets GP. The report also benefited from the advice, comments, and views of
various stakeholders in the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), the private sector, development
partner institutions and academia. The team is very grateful for their time and inputs.

We are very grateful to the Cambodian authorities, in particular the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
and the National Bank of Cambodia for their cooperation and support in the preparation of this CEU.

The World Bank Cambodia Office Communications Team, comprising Saroeun Bou and Sophinith Sam

In order to remain competitive, the authorities
could also consider progressively increasing
budget allocations to productive and
competitive investment projects. In the
medium term, concessional borrowing may come
increasingly from regional sources, such as the
newly established Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank (AIIB), as well as from bilateral sources such
as Japan and China. Steadily declining
development partner-financed public investment
will also require a short-term response whereby
additional allocations come from the government
budget. Careful prioritization of expenditures and
continued buoyant revenue collection will help to
make this affordable, if increases in the wage bill
can be curbed. Meanwhile, it will also be necessary
to further strengthen the rules and regulations
governing the management of capital investment
projects, as envisaged by a public investment
management assessment currently under
discussion.

The World Bank/IMF debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) conducted in 2015 indicates
that Cambodia’s debt distress rating remain s
low, with all debt burden indicators projected to
remain below their respective thresholds. The
results also indicate that debt sustainability
continues to be vulnerable to shocks to economic
growth, exports and the fiscal position, calling for
continued structural reforms to bolster the
economy’s resilience against external shocks, and
to mobilize domestic revenues. At the end of 2014,
the estimated stock of Cambodia’s external public
debt, including arears, stood at around US$5.5
billion, or 33 percent of GDP.

Note that Cambodia’s debt distress rating has
been consistently low since 2011. This is mainly
underpinned by the overriding principle of
balanced budgeting of the fiscal position and
borrowing only on concessional terms.16

 E. Selected Issue – Financial Sector Developments: Opportunities and Risks

a) Financial sector overview and trends

Starting from a low base, Cambodia’s financial market is deepening quickly, underpinning robust
economic growth. The ratio of broad money (M2) to GDP increased from 53.4 percent in 2013 to 66.3
percent by end-2015.18 Financial institutions’19 assets, deposits and loans represented 109 percent, 57 percent,
and 54 percent of GDP, respectively at end-2015. Underpinned by improving confidence, the financial
sector20 has undergone a rapid transformation, with more financial products being developed and introduced.
While the banking sector continues to dominate the financial market, with a rapid increase in the number of
banks entering Cambodia in recent years, the microfinance sector is also expanding rapidly. As of February
2016, the financial system comprised 36 commercial banks;21 11 specialized banks;22 34 microfinance
institutions; seven microfinance deposit-taking institutions, together with 36 registered microfinance
operators; six financial leasing companies; and five third-party payments processors. The insurance sector
comprises nine insurance companies (six non-life and three life), one reinsurer and three micro-insurer.23
With the recent introduction of the Cambodia Securities Exchange, three companies have been listed, while
six securities underwriters, one securities dealer and three securities brokers have emerged. The number of
financial institutions has increased rapidly in the past few years and resulted in a six-fold increase in financial
inclusion data to 23 percent in Global Findex Survey 2014 (Figures S1 and S2) and increased to 51.41 percent
in 2015, based on the public data.24 However, interest spreads in the Cambodian riel and US dollar for one-
year maturity remain wide, at 9.43 percent and 7.16, respectively, in July 2015.

more than half of all banking sector assets. The banking
system experienced an asset growth rate of about 30 percent each year in the period 2010-14. Improved
confidence in the banking system encouraged private sector deposits, which grew at an average rate of 23
percent per year over the same period. Growth of banks’ assets and deposits, however, has moderated
recently, decelerating to 22.1 percent and 16.6 percent, respectively, at the end of 2015. Meanwhile,
outstanding credit provided by the banking system continues to increase rapidly, reaching about 30 percent
year-on-year in the past five years. Banks’ loan-to-deposit ratio, therefore, increased to 96 percent at end-
2015 from 87 percent at end-2014.

Credit growth continues to provide necessary financing to facilitate a surge in investment and an
increase in domestic consumption, with a growing middle-class in the context of a largely stable
political and institutional environment. The authorities are encouraged to pay particular attention to
credit for speculative sectors and/or possible weak-repayment-capacity borrowers. As at the third quarter of
2015, lending to the trade and construction26 sectors accounted for 34 percent and 20 percent of total credit,
respectively. As a percentage of GDP, lending to the construction sector (including real estate and mortages)
has tripled over the past five years, from 4 percent in 2010 to 13 percent in 2015 (Figure S3). Persistently
high credit growth also squeezes banks’ liquidity. Banks’ average liquidity ratio is, therefore, declining, and
fell from 85 percent in the second quarter of 2014 to 80 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.

To mitigate liquidity pressures, an inter-bank market was established by the authorities with the
introduction of negotiable certificates of deposit in 2013. However, in the absence of government bond
markets, this nascent inter-bank market, which is crucial for some banks that face liquidity shortages, remains
highly dependent on trust and collaboration among banks to further expand and deepen. The establishment
of a government bond market can benefit Cambodia in terms of better managing the Government’s fiscal
position, offering a wider range of investable financial products, better managing financial institutions’
liquidity, and setting up yield benchmarks.

The overall solvency ratio, mainly Tier 1, remains healthy, as it is higher than the prudential
requirement of 15 percent. The solvency ratio of the banking sector declined slightly to 21.50 percent in

the fourth quarter of 2014, from its peak in the second quarter of 2012. However, the financial condition of
some banks seems to be less satisfactory. The concentrated banking system has resulted in the top five
performing banks generating a return on equity (ROE) of over 25 percent, whereas the average ROE of the
banking sector was 16 percent as at the end of 2014.27

The rapid expansion of the banking system may entail some risks due to the reliance on foreign
funding. In terms of overall risk status, Standard and Poor’s classification of the banking sector in Cambodia
is in group “9” under its “Banking Industry and Country Risk Assessment”28 dated December 24, 2015. The
banking system receives increased foreign funding and is therefore exposed to greater volatility of
international capital markets. Foreign bank entrants, many of them are small and mid-sized banks, have
limited ability to mobilize domestic savings, and depend largely on injections of foreign funds. Nonetheless,
over the past two years they have grown rapidly and now account for nearly 40 percent of all new lending.
This triggered the introduction reserve requirements of 12.5 percent for foreign borrowing.

On the other hand, the reported level of non-performing loans remain stable at low levels. The current
reported level of non-performing loans (NPL) in banks has hovered below 3 percent of total loans since the
first quarter of 2011, and is not among the highest by international comparison.29 The NBC has improved
its supervisory oversight of credit risk by tightening the classification of NPL. However, more could be done
by requiring banks to establish prudential treatment for restructured loans and strengthening reporting and
disclosure requirements on NPLs. Table S1 below illustrates performance indicators of banks.

c) Microfinance sector

Microfinance institutions (MFI) have played a very important role, providing access to finance to a
mostly rural population that would otherwise have to rely on unregulated private money lenders.
The relatively nascent microfinance sector is experiencing explosive growth (Figure S4). The 34 microfinance
institutions and seven micro-deposit-taking institutions (MDI), accelerated their credit growth to 46 percent
year-on-year in 2015, and reached a record high of US$2.9 billion outstanding loans, catering to 2 million
borrowers, compared with only US$426 million and 0.9 million borrowers at the end of 2010.30 MFI
performance has been remarkable, with an average return on equity (ROE) of 22 percent, and continued
rapid lending growth.

    imbalances resulted from high credit growth while the latter considers regulatory & supervision framework, competitive dynami cs, and system-wide funding

    Pakistan 12.5%, Macedonia (FYR) 11.2%, Kazakhstan 9.2%, and the Russian Federation 7.4%.

The level of concentration of the microfinance sector is even higher than that of the banking sector.
The top 12 Cambodian MFIs/MDIs account for 98 percent of the microfinance market by loan portfolios,
and 97 percent by borrowers. Microfinance credit has grown rapidly in every economic sector (Figures S5
and S6). However, microfinance credit growth is uneven, with a few big players dominating.31 Meanwhile,
MFIs’ lending relative to bank lending grew from 16.2 percent in the first quarter of 2013 to over 20 percent
in 2015. This reflects the more competitive growth strategy of MFIs compared with commercial banks, and
probably the stronger preference for, and popularity of, MFI products compared with banks’ products.
Credit growth of MFIs was remarkable in the construction and household sectors.

This rapid MFI expansion has the potential to quickly improve access to finance, in particular for
the rural population. The expansion, however, contributes partly to the trend towards multiple loan-taking
that correlates with non-repayment among borrowers. The 2014 Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey found
increasing amounts of outstanding credit per household, in particular for rural households, while outstanding

credit owed by Phnom Penh households remained stable (Figure S7). A recent study by Oikocredit in
November 2015 highlights the likelihood of increasing multiple loans in Cambodia, suggesting a trend
towards consumer indebtedness that may not be sustainable. Furthermore, some micro-deposit-taking
institutions show declining solvency over the past two years and are very close to the prudential threshold.
This is happening in the context of no deposit protection scheme and rapid growth (45 percent in 2015) of
the deposit base, which topped US$1.3 billion from 1.4 million depositors. Indebtedness is rising, especially
in rural areas, and the information gap remains a challenge in Cambodia.
d) Insurance sector

Cambodia’s insurance sector is small but gradually expanding, with total premium revenues of
US$60 million in 2014. The majority of premium volume is from general insurance (property line) and life
insurance. There is very little health insurance, which is usually offered by companies with foreign ownership
and typically servicing foreign-owned corporates with operations in Cambodia. The largest insurer by
premium volume holds a 45 percent market share, with a leading position in general insurance.

The new Insurance Law enacted in July 2014 initiated compulsory Motor Third-Party Liability
Insurance (MTPL) and micro-insurance activities in Cambodia. In terms of MTPL, only a small
number of vehicles are covered under MTPL, even though Cambodia has seen a surge in motorists in recent
years, with an estimated 10 traffic fatalities occurring daily. In terms of micro-insurance, one of the leading
micro-insurers, achieving considerable success in a two-province pilot project, has rolled out nationwide
micro-insurance cover for death, accidental injury, and salary-replacement during hospitalization treatment.
The product’s strength lies in its simplicity, which enables easy sales with very basic information to
widespread lower-income markets. While the new law has undoubtedly opened up new opportunities in
Cambodia, the general challenges in the insurance sector remain to be addressed. For example, there are
limited long-term investment instruments for insurers to manage their assets and liabilities. In addition, the
risk-based supervisory practices need to be further enhanced.
e) Cambodia securities exchange, market infrastructure, anti-money laundering and reporting

The newly established stock market has a low trading volume.32 Trading on the new stock exchange is
thin, having as it does only three listed companies, which limits the scope for portfolio and risk diversification
by individual investors. Capital raised through the capital market remains modest, standing at 0.2 percent of
GDP, and market capitalization was 0.86 percent of GDP as at March 1, 2016. The Cambodia Securities
Exchange (CSX) index peaked on April 20, 2012 at 1,096.77, with trading volume of 488,000 shares, but the
index closed at only 390.73 on March 2, 2016, with trading volume of just 8,759 shares.

The information infrastructure for lending has been improved markedly, commensurate with the
rapid expansion of the financial sector. The successful introduction of a private credit bureau,33 the Credit
Bureau of Cambodia (CBC),34 with which all banks and MFIs must participate, underpins the improvement
in coordination and strengthened supervision. As of April 2015, the CBC covered 4.2 million individuals,35
including both positive and negative credit information, which licensed banks and MFIs are required to
share, and to check with in the process of credit decisions. As a result, banks and MFIs have reported

33 A Prakas on Credit Information System was adopted in 2011, and with a joint investment from some of the banks, the MFI association, and a New Zealand-
based technology company, together with IFC technical cooperation, the first private bureau was launched.

substantial improvements in credit quality since participating in the CBC, for example by reducing their
exposure to borrowers with multiple loans.

Cambodia was taken off the list of countries subject to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF)
monitoring process under its ongoing global Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combatting the
Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance process. Following a review of compliance with AML and
CFT standards, in February 2015, FATF observed significant progress in Cambodia’s AML/CFT regime
and noted that Cambodia had established the legal and regulatory framework to meet its commitments in its
action plan.36

Cambodia’s dynamic enterprise sector has spurred growth in accounting and auditing activities in
the past 10 years, albeit from a very low base. According to the National Accounting Council (NAC),37
since 2010 all public-interest entities should be reporting in line with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS),38 and other non-financial enterprises according to IFRS for Small and Medium-Sized
Enterprises (SMEs), a simpler financial reporting standard. The 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) highlighted some weaknesses in the accounting and auditing framework in Cambodia. It emphasized
the importance of improving the quality of data from financial institutions to enable the appropriate
assessment of risks and to implement a strategic plan for transition to IFRS. 39


f) Key messages

Authorities have recently introduced some important measures aimed at improving the resilience
of the financial sector. The implementation of the recent directive (Prakas) of March 22, 2016, on minimum
registered capital of banking and financial institutions issued by the NBC is key to further strengthen the
banking sector including microfinance. This will encourage consolidation and mergers in the banking
sector.40 The recent introduction of reserve requirements of 12.5 percent for foreign borrowing and the
liquidity coverage ratio will also support the strengthening of the banking sector. Other recent Prakas regulate
home-host relations related to information-sharing, as well as emergency liquidity assistance (ELA).

Additional measures that could help further to improve supervision and information exchange in the short
and medium term include the following:

        (i) Refining data collection. It is advisable to implement more conservative prudential treatment
        for restructured or re-scheduled loans and NPLs in each economic sector, large exposures, related-party
        exposures, banks’ top-20 exposures, and country-risk exposures. It would be beneficial to improve the
        analytical tools by recommending clarification of the provisions coverage ratio, the large exposure ratio
        and the liquidity ratio, and improved approaches to system-level analyzes.

36 Nevertheless, the Government of Cambodia continues to work with the Asia Pacific Group in ongoing efforts to address the full range of AML/CFT issues
identified in its mutual evaluation report. In addition, the NBC is conducting a self-assessment of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (ML/FT) risks
under the National Risk Assessment (NRA) process.
37 The National Accounting Council (NAC) within the MEF is the standard-setting body for the profession, and the Law of Corporate Accounts (2002) established
the legal framework for national standards of accounting.
38 The definition of public-interest enterprise, however, is not fully understood, and the implementation has been weak.
39
  The authorities plan on the phased introduction of IFRS by financial institutions, and are considering revisions to the prudential regulatory framework and
amendments to prudential regulations and financial reporting and external audit requirements to ensure alignment with IFRS.

40
     Since the framework for mergers is not well formed in Cambodia, the implementation of new capital requirements would need to be managed carefully to
       maintain confidence in the system.


Cambodia Economic Update April 2016 >> 30
     (ii) Ensuring that loan classification is consistently applied from bank to bank, while the
     existing rules allowing for immediate upward reclassification of restructured loans could be reviewed.
     These tasks can be done within a short-term timeframe.

     (iii) Revising the formula for calculating banks’ liquidity to capture the time dimen sion. It is
     advisable to improve the analysis of liquidity risk by re-examining the ratio indicator to include only
     highly-liquid assets, by working with financial institutions to improve asset classification. It is advised to
     monitor potential risks, such as the emergence of non-resident loans and deposits in the banking system.

     (iv) Additional prudential measures could instill further stability to the sector in the medium
     run. As banks have increased their concentration and increasingly rely on foreign funding they may be
     adding to systemic risks. This may be the case, in particular, for the banks that represent a large share of
     retail, corporate and inter-bank deposits. There is also a suspected large and increasing volume of
     “shadow-bank” lending to the construction and real estate sector. Therefore, further tools to moderate
     credit risk, such as required stricter loan-to-value ratios for collateralized lending to possible speculative
     businesses, would help to improve resilience. These tasks will likely require a medium-term timeframe
     to implement.

     (v) Limitations on consumer lending relative to portfolio size may also be warranted , to rein in
     possible overheating in the consumer credit market. In this regard, further attention to improving
     consumers’ financial literacy, in particular for the rural population.

     (vi) Further improving the credit information system by expanding the CBC to cover legal
     entities. In this regard, CBC is working with the Ministry of Commerce, which maintains a registry of
     some 500,000 enterprises, in order to link enterprise registration information to credit histories.

     (vii) Further improving data quality and encouraging disclosure policy. Market confidence can
     be further improved by public disclosure of the financial performance of the financial sector. This can
     be done by improving accounting and auditing practices in the financial sector.

     (viii) Conduct a high-level crisis simulation exercise. This exercise aims to create opportunities for
     the authorities to use their respective existing crisis-management arrangements in terms of legal
     instruments, operational framework, inter-agency and intra-agency information sharing and coordination
     arrangements, and communication with key stakeholders and the public.

The authorities are making efforts to close critical gaps in crisis preparedness and the country’s
crisis management framework, which are exacerbated by the dollarized structure of the economy
and financial system.41 The work to enhance the crisis management framework complements an expert
review of the National Bank of Cambodia Law and the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions, and
drafted amendments that provide, among other things, for the NBC’s ability to carry out bank resolution for
systemic and non-systemic banks. It is also recommended to set up a Committee for Financial Stability,42


41 In February 2014, the NBC, the MEF, and the SECC signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on est ablishing a policy level Working Group (WG),
    which also led to the formation of a technical Core Team.
42 The signing of an initial MOU among supervisory agencies enhanced cooperation at the policy and technical level s. However, collaboration among financial
regulators can be further improved. It is also important to have a clear legal mandate for macro -prudential oversight, and to consider adopting the proposed law
changes that would empower the NBC to carry out bank resolutions.

empowered to oversee financial stability and to deal with a systemic crisis.43 Given the time-consuming
process of amending laws, this would need to be a medium-term action.

For medium to long term, the authorities plan to update the 2011 Financial Sector Development
Strategy (FSDS) taking into account the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The
authorities may consider using the updated/revised FSDS as the basis for deciding future direction with the
aim of building a functioning financial sector, supporting future economic developments for the next 5-10
years. This would guide policy direction to enhance the following practices, in line with international
standards: regulatory and supervisory framework including insolvency regime, crisis management practice,
data quality, disclosure policy, corporate governance, risk management practices, accounting and auditing
practices, and consumer protection. In addition, the revised FSDS may address the high dollarization, asset-
liability mismatches both in terms of currency and maturity mismatches, limited financial instruments, and
more.




43   The committee may be co-chaired by the NBC and the MEF.
