I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Rwanda
        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Rwanda regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Rwanda;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Rwanda;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Rwanda; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Rwanda.
       Use data to help inform the Rwanda country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In February-March 2013, 826 stakeholders of the World Bank in Rwanda were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/ contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral
agencies1; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs/CSOs working in the areas of advocacy and implementation; community-based
organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based
groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 714
stakeholders participated in the country survey (86% response rate).
Some respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned them accordingly; other
respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Rwanda; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the
World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with
the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Rwanda; and the Bank’s communication and
information sharing in Rwanda.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Rwanda: Respondents were asked to indicate what they thought were
   the top three most important development priorities in the country, and which areas would
   contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic growth in Rwanda.

 Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies include international and local staff and consultants working on
bilateral/multilateral agency-supported projects/programs in different provinces in Rwanda, including a large
number of projects in rural areas.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Rwanda, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Rwanda solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner.
   Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
   productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in
   Rwanda, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Rwanda, the extent to which the Bank
   meets Rwanda’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s
   level of effectiveness across twenty-nine development areas, such as poverty reduction,
   economic growth, job creation, education, health, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult the Bank’s knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the Bank should focus
   its research efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/
   research, including how significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its
   technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Rwanda’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Rwanda: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Rwanda’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s website s.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Rwanda, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 412 respondents (69% response rate) who completed the survey
in FY 2006. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
    For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of a Minister were
       combined with those from the office of the President and the office of the Prime Minister;
       consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported projects were combined with
       respondents from PMUs; respondents from bilateral agencies were combined with those
       from multilateral agencies; respondents from private sector organizations were combined
       with those from the financial sector/private banks; respondents from NGOs/CSOs
       (advocacy and implementation), CBOs, trade unions, and faith-based groups were

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
    Across all respondents, familiarity with the World Bank received a mean rating of 5.5; this
     was significantly higher than the mean rating received in the FY ’06 country survey (5.0).
         Respondents from local governments and other organizations indicated the highest
            levels of familiarity with the Bank whereas respondents from PMUs/consultants/
            contractors on Bank supported projects indicated significantly lower levels.
         Respondents from Kigali Ville indicated the highest levels of familiarity with the
            Bank whereas respondents from Southern Province indicated significantly lower
            levels of familiarity.
         It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
            significantly, moderately correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
            effectiveness in Rwanda, the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results, and
            the Bank’s relevance to Rwanda’s development.

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the World Bank’s
        effectiveness across all of these twenty-nine development areas, except “Natural resource
        management” and “Social protection”. For the most part, respondents from CSOs,
        academia/research institutes/think tanks, and local governments tended to have the
        highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas whereas respondents from
        the media and the Office of Parliamentarian tended to have significantly lower ratings.
        (See Appendix B for full details.)

        twenty-nine development areas. For the most part, respondents from Southern Province
        and Eastern Province tended to have the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in
        these areas whereas respondents from Kigali Ville tended to have significantly lower
        ratings. Those areas with significant differences between geographic locations were:
             “Anti corruption”;

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Rwanda, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-nine specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results inc rease.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Rwanda. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                Equality of opportunity;
                Communicable/non-communicable diseases;
                Job creation/employment;
                Foreign direct investment;
                Natural resource management; and
                Food security.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Rwanda, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                Food security;
                Poverty reduction;
                Communicable/non-communicable diseases;
                Foreign direct investment; and

Knowledge: Qualities
        Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly lower ratings for the extent to
         which the Bank’s knowledge work and activities are useful and a source of relevant
         information on global good practices compared to respondents in the FY’06 survey.
        There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings across all of these
         aspects of the Bank’s knowledge work and activities (see Appendix B for full details).
         For the most part, respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks, private
         foundations, and other organizations tended to have the highest ratings for these aspects
         whereas respondents from the media and the Office of Parliamentarian tended to have
         significantly lower ratings.
        There were significant differences between geographic locations in their ratings across
         many of these aspects of the Bank’s knowledge work and activities (see Appendix C for
         full details). For the most part, respondents from Eastern Province tended to have the
         highest ratings for these aspects whereas respondents from Kigali Ville tended to have
         significantly lower ratings (including the indicator question).

VIII. How the World Bank Operates
The World Bank’s Work in Rwanda
       Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement
        that the World Bank’s work is aligned with respondents’ perceived development
        priorities and that the Bank supports realistic programs and strategies in the country
        compared to respondents in the FY ’06 country survey.
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement
        regarding all of these aspects of the Bank’s work in Rwanda. For the most part,
        respondents from private foundations and other organizations tended to have the highest
        levels of agreement with these statements, whereas respondents from the media and
        bilateral/multilateral agencies tended to have significantly lower levels of agreement.
       Respondents from Eastern Province had the highest levels of agreement that the Bank
        supports realistic programs and strategies in Rwanda whereas respondents from Kigali
        Ville had significantly lower levels of agreement.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
Overall Perceptions
    Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement
       that the World Bank treats clients and stakeholders in Rwanda with respect, that the Bank
       imposes reasonable conditions on its lending, and that the Bank disburses funds promptly
       compared to respondents from the FY ’06 survey. Respondents in this year’s survey had
       significantly lower levels of agreement that working with the Bank increases country’s
       institutional capacity and that the Bank effectively monitors and evaluates projects and
       programs it supports compared to respondents from the FY’06 survey.
    There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement
       regarding all of these aspects of how the Bank operates (see Appendix B for full details).
       For the most part, respondents from private foundations, academia/research institutes/
       think tanks, and other organizations tended to have the highest levels of agreement with
       these statements whereas respondents from the media, bilateral/multilateral agencies, and
       the Office of Parliamentarian tended to have significantly lower levels of agreement.
    There were significant differences between geographic locations in their ratings across
       many of these aspects (see Appendix C for full details). For the indicator question,
       respondents from all geographic areas had statistically similar levels of agreement that
       where country systems are adequate, the Bank makes appropriate use of them.

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Rwanda or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in Rwanda, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is
perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in Rwanda. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in Rwanda. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey,
please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a
question, please leave it blank.
