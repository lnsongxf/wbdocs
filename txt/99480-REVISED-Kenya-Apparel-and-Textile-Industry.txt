     The following charts illustrate Kenya’s export performance as compared to selected competitors in the top
     four apparel exports.

     Women’s Shirts of Knit Man-made Fiber (MMF): Kenyan exports of women’s shirts made of MMF have
     increased dramatically in the past five years, growing at a CAGR of 40 percent between 2009 and 2013.
     Although Kenya has pulled into the lead among its African competitors such as Egypt and Lesotho, its
     market share in the US (the primary destination of clothing exports) is still dwarfed by China and Vietnam.
     Moreover, while Chinese exports did not exhibit a large increase between 2012 and 2013 (only 1 percent),
     the country cannot be deemed as having pulled out of the women’s and girls’ MMF knit shirts market in
     such a way that leaves a sizeable gap for Kenya to exploit in the near future.

Men’s Cotton Shirts: Although the export value of men’s cotton knit shirts from Kenya has fluctuated
in the past five years, the 2013 export value has doubled since 2009. Currently on an upward trend
compared to 2012, Kenya is poised to overtake regional competitors as Egypt’s export value continues to
decrease, with similar downward trends in exports from Lesotho, Madagascar, and Mauritius. Despite this
promising regional outlook, exports from Asian competitors continue to dominate the market with no sign
of decreasing or levelling off.

     Babies’ Cotton Apparel: Following a sharp decrease in the value of babies’ cotton apparel from former
     regional leader Egypt, Kenya has emerged as the leading exporter among its African competitors. Although
     Asian competitors achieve significantly larger export values and market share as compared to Kenya, their
     exports show relatively flat growth, with China’s exports decreasing since 2011. This trend indicates that
     there is room in the market for Kenya to increase exports in babies’ cotton garments.

      Main constraints                                                 Specific sub-constraints
      Difficult business           •	 Kenya’s business environment is characterized by high electricity prices, limited access
      environment                     to finance, poor roads, challenging logistics, and for non-EPZ companies, complex
                                      regulations.
                                   •	 In 2014, electricity accounted for 25 percent and 5 percent of the costs of Kenyan textile
                                      mills and apparel manufacturers, respectively, putting Kenyan firms on a fundamentally
                                      unequal footing to firms in other countries.
                                   •	 Access to finance is challenging for Kenyan firms due to the high prevailing interest rates
                                      and the short time horizons available for loans.
                                   •	 Poor roads and logistics in Kenya impact export businesses which rely heavily on imported
                                      inputs. Kenya’s road transport costs are four times the globally competitive rate, and they
                                      fundamentally constrain time to market and limit the market segments in which firms can
                                      compete.

      Low labor productivity       •	 Labor prices in Kenya have increased over the past three years and these costs have not
      and a mismatch in the           been matched by improved productivity and quality.
      supply and demand for        •	 Kenyan labor has among the lowest value added per worker among select comparator
      relevant labor skills           countries, reflecting poor levels of productivity given current wage rates.
                                   •	 Firms do not perform training needs audits, which limits the information they have to
                                      conduct targeted training. In addition, the Training Levy firms must pay every month is
                                      not perceived to increase the quality and quantity of skills in the market.
                                   •	 Low firm productivity is partially due to limited availability of qualified staff, especially for
                                      managerial positions.
                                   •	 Training institutions suffer from insufficient funds for programs and students, lack of
                                      modern equipment and material, and low capacity levels of training staff. Secondary
                                      challenges are low enrollment, and the mismatch between manufacturers’ needs and
                                      training, largely due to the limited interaction between training institutions and the textile
                                      and apparel sector.
                                   •	 The lack of equipment-specific training programs in Kenya hinders multi-skilling of labor.

      Difficulties in              •	 Outdated equipment is pervasive across the sector and firms face major difficulties in
      maintaining and                 carrying out the needed upgrades.
      upgrading technology         •	 Equipment financing in Kenya is expensive and difficult to access.
      and equipment                •	 Most textile and apparel companies have not conducted thorough energy audits; given
                                      the old age of equipment, this constitutes a missed opportunity.

      Insufficient supply of       •	 Kenya suffers from an inadequate supply of locally produced cotton, and that which is
      quality raw materials;          available is of poor quality.
      coupled with high input      •	 Textile firms have to choose between the high-cost of imported material and the low-
      costs                           quality of local fiber which requires additional processing.
                                   •	 Apparel manufacturers have to choose between long order-to-delivery times for imported
                                      fabric or “faster” local fabric that is expensive and of varying levels of quality.
                                   •	 There is concern in the industry regarding the lack of customs enforcement and capability
                                      of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KBS) to regulate the inflow of inferior products.

      Challenges in increasing     •	 For non-EPZ firms, access to the domestic market is difficult because of the influx of
      demand in and                   second-hand clothing and because most public agencies, which could be very large
      accessing domestic              customers, primarily import to fulfill their needs.
      and international            •	 Firms feel that customs regulations are too restrictive and that Government incentives to
      markets                         expand market opportunities are insufficient.
                                   •	 For EPZ firms, AGOA’s late renewal represented a major source of market uncertainty.

                                 Annex 6: Detailed action plan for the recommendations


     1. Institutional support
     Recommendation: Create a dedicated private institution—the Institute for Textile and Apparel Development
     (ITAD)—to support the sector. The institute should act as the voice of the sector, play a strategic leadership role,
     and ensure responsiveness to ever-changing global market trends.

                 Goal                                                  Steps recommended
      Institutionalize support      •	 Develop draft framework, organizational structure, role, and mandate of the proposed
      for the textile and              ITAD. Special attention should be given to ensure that the ITAD becomes the central focal
      apparel sector through a         point for developing and promoting the Green Production Hub (see below).
      dedicated institute           •	 Based on the organization’s mandate, develop a draft budget required for the ITAD to
                                       support the textile-apparel sectors.
                                    •	 Once these drafts are completed, sponsor a workshop to bring together all of the
                                       stakeholders in the textile-apparel sector to present and validate the proposed
                                       organizational structure, role and mandate.
                                    •	 Based on inputs from the workshop, finalize the organizational structure, role, mandate
                                       and budget. Present the final version to MOIED for consideration.
                                    •	 Upon authorization by MOIED, invite foreign manufacturers and buyers to become
                                       sponsors of the ITAD, and invite key sector leaders from around the world to sit on the
                                       board of the ITAD to help guide the development and promotion of the Green Production
                                       Hub.

2. Skills to address productivity
Recommendation: Build skills to address productivity issues, at the managerial, technical, and factory floor
level. At the same time, recognize the need to import skills where these are not available, but impose term limits
on expatriate work permits. Draw upon institutions to play a leadership and convening role on issues specific to
the textile-apparel sector, to ensure public and private sector collaboration and coordination.


           Goal                                                  Steps recommended

 Improve the efficiency of   •	 Coordinate with NITA and improve the efficiency of the training levy by defining specific
 the Training Levy              training to be covered by the training levy.
                             •	 Prepare recommendations to this effect.
 Impose term limits on       •	 Identify specific skills not available through the Kenyan labor market, by contracting out a
 expatriate work permits        skills gap assessment. From this assessment, create a list of skills that require expatriate
                                recruitment.
                             •	 Set up in-house mentoring for companies that hire expatriates.
                             •	 Coordinate with the Department of Immigration Services to reduce cost and time required
                                for issuance of work permit. Agree to automatic work permit approvals for processes
                                taking longer than 30 days.

     3. Investment in equipment and technology
     Recommendation: Undertake new investments in equipment and technology to increase efficiency and reduce
     costs. These investments will have the added benefit of meeting growing consumer demand for environmentally-
     sustainable production processes.

                 Goal                                                   Steps recommended
      Encourage firms to            •	 Partner with existing SUNREF program (under KAM) to create a mechanism dedicated to
      conduct factory level            the textile-apparel sector, through which firms are made aware of the benefits arising from
      energy audits to see             energy audits – namely, that the cost savings generated from subsequent investments will
      how much energy (and             far outweigh the cost of the audit itself.
      money) could be saved         •	 Make KAM members aware that energy audits are offered at a heavily subsidized rate
      through equipment                through the SUNREF program.
      upgrading                     •	 Host workshops with KAM/SUNREF to achieve these objectives, for both KAM members
                                       and non-members.
                                    •	 Engage firms individually to cater to their specific needs.

      Develop sector-wide           •	 Identify and negotiate access to concessionary financing through programs such as
      promotion program                SUNREF. SUNREF is supported by AFD-funding and offers concessionary financing (around
      to encourage firms to            5 percent) for qualifying investments.
      upgrade technology            •	 Work with firms to prepare business plans that will qualify for this concessionary financing.
      and equipment through            SUNREF provides free business plan preparation.
