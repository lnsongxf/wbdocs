﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
he purpose of the Labour Force Survey in Kosovo is to provide statistical data on labour market
indicators and enable comparisons to be drawn with previous years. The methodology and
definitions applied in the LFS are the same as those used in 2012 and is consistent with Eurostat
regulations. The LFS survey includes 600 Enumeration Areas throughout the territory of Kosovo where
4,800 households are interviewed.
This Labour Force Survey 2013 report contains data on employment
and unemployment by age, gender, employment status, economic
activities, occupations and other areas of the labour market.
At the end of the report section 6 reports on changes of the main
indicators between 2012 and 2013. Overall there have not been
any dramatic changes, which is to be expected. The unemployment
rate has remained virtually unchanged between 2012 and 2013 and
it remains higher among women than men. The unemployment
rate is higher among young people. Kosovo continues to exhibit
challenging labour market performance despite a continued growth
rate. Kosovo is one of the transition countries least affected by the
global economic crisis, however if the economy slows down this
complicates the task of generating new jobs that are needed each
year in order to meet the growing number of new entrants into the
labour force.
It is important to realise that although the unemployment rate has
Chiefo Execvyf of thesnot changed, the actual number of unemployed people has grown by
9,129 people in the twelve month period (from 135,700 to 144,829
people). The youth unemployment rate has hardly changed in the
same period but the number of unemployed 15-24 years olds has
increased by 1,451 people in the 12 months. It also raises concern that that long term (over 12 months
and longer) unemployment is the common situation for unemployed people and has increased a further
9.1% in 12 months.
The activity rate has increased 3.6 percentage points between 2012 and 2013. This is due to a mixture
of more people reporting themselves as available and looking for work (unemployed) and some people
getting a job. In terms of the small rise in the employment rate there seems to be a tendency that these
new jobs are vulnerable jobs. Vulnerable workers are the self employed without employees and those
who work unpaid in a family business. The rate of vulnerable jobs has gone up almost five percentage
points from 2012 to 23.6% in 2013. The data also shows that the percentage of self employed people
has risen slightly over the one year period. Finally, it should be noted that the activity rate has increased
more for men (4.8%) than it has for women (3.3%) in the twelve month period. This means that the
gender participation gap is getting even larger.
KAS thanks UNDP, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Finland and the World Bank for the financial and
professional support they have provided to the LFS. KAS also thanks the LFS team for their contribution
in implementing this survey.
According to the Law of Official Statistics No.04/L-034 the Kosovo Agency of Statistics is responsible
for producing the official statistics in the Republic of Kosovo and therefore when data are used the
source should be cited.

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
NOVEMBER 2014
The Kosovo Agency of Statistics (KAS) began conducting the Labour Force Survey (LFS) in 2001
and then undertook LFS on an almost annual basis until 2009. In 2011 KAS began planning for the
updated Labour Force Survey which has several important improvements over previous surveys:
* Improved questionnaire (continuing to follow Eurostat guidelines)
* New sampling frame (based on the 2011 Census of Kosovo)
* Longitudinal sub-sample in which each household is interviewed four times (once every three months)
* Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) which enables data output to be generated faster
than traditional paper and pencil interviews followed by data entry.
The main objectives of LFS are to collect information, mainly on the supply side of the labour market,
that is, information on those who are working or who are actively looking for work. The LFS collects
social and economic information for use in the following areas:
Macro-economic monitoring: The change in the number of people employed is an indicator of
changes in economic activity. It is necessary to track these changes, specifically the types of jobs and
the industries in which people work.
Human resource development policies: The economy is changing all the time. In order to meet the
needs of the changing economy, people need to be trained. LFS enables the identification of areas of
training.
Employment policies: For an economy to work at its maximum potential, all those wanting to have
work should have jobs. Some people may wish to have full-time jobs and can only find part-time work.
Knowing how many of these people there are can enable the Government to design policies that
encourage full-employment.
Income support and social programmes: For the majority of people, employment income is their main
means of support. People not only need jobs but also productive jobs in order to receive reasonable
incomes. Government needs to know what levels of income are being earned by different groups of
persons.

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
he working age population includes people 15 to 64 years of age, inclusive. This measure is used
to give an estimate of the total number of potential workers within an economy.
The labour force comprises those who are employed and those who are unemployed, according to
the strict definitions given below. Inactive persons are not considered part of the labour force.
1. Employed: People aged 15-64 years who during the reference week performed some work for
wage or salary, or profit or family gain, in cash or in kind or were temporarily absent from their jobs.
2. Unemployed: People aged 15-64 years who during the reference week were:
* without work, that is, were not in paid employment or self-employment; and
* currently available for work, that is, were available for paid employment or self- employment within two
weeks; and
* seeking work, that is, had taken specific steps in the previous four weeks to seek paid employment
or self-employment.
3. Inactive: People aged 15-64 who were neither employed or unemployed during the reference period.
Classification of the population into these three mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories depends
on the application of the activity principle - what a person was actually doing during the reference week
- and a set of priority rules regarding activity that give precedence to employment over unemployment
and to unemployment over economic inactivity. Classification also depends on a clear understanding of
which activities are to be considered as "employment". It is important to note that employment includes
activities which are paid or unpaid, and activities producing goods and services which are either sold in
the market or not.
The labour force participation rate is the proportion of a country's working-age population that
engages actively in the labour market, either by being employed or unemployed. It is the ratio of the
labour force to the working-age population, expressed as a percentage.
Labour force  (Employed + Unemployed) X 100
participation rate - Working-age population
The inactivity rate is the proportion of a country's working-age population that is neither employed nor
unemployed. When added together, the inactivity rate and the labour force participation rate sum to 100
per cent.
The employment-to-population ratio, also known as the employment rate, is the proportion of a
country's working-age population that is employed.
Employment-to- _  Employed population  X 100
population ratio  Working-age population
The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labour force that is not employed. It is the labour force
that serves as the base for this indicator, not the working-age population.

Discouraged workers are people without work who are currently available for work but who have
given up looking for work because they believe that they cannot find work. They are included within the
inactive category.
Youth unemployment refers to the unemployment of people aged 15-24 years.
Youth Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET) is the share of youth (15-24) that are not
employed, not in education and not in training.
Vulnerable employment refers to self-employed persons who do not have employees or unpaid family
workers. The vulnerably employed are less likely to have formal work arrangements and are more likely
to lack decent working conditions.

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
Figure 1 provides a broad overview of the labour market status of Kosovo's population based on the
2013 Labour Force Survey. Among the more important results of the 2013 LFS, as illustrated in
Figure 1 and elaborated in greater detail in the body of this report, are the following:
* Almost two-thirds of Kosovo's population is of working age (15-64 years). The working age
population is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, as Kosovo has one of the youngest
populations in Europe.
* Of those who are working age, 59.5% are not economically active, meaning that they are not employed
and have not actively sought employment in the past four weeks and/or are not available to start work
within two weeks.
* Of the 40.5% of the population that is economically active, 30.0% (144,829 persons) are
unemployed. This implies that 70.0% (338,364) of economically active people are employed, yielding an
employment-to-population ratio (employment rate) of 28.4%.
* Of the 59.5% of the working age population that is inactive, 20.2% (143,700 people) did not seek a job
because they believed that there was no work available. Discouraged workers accounted for 12.1% of
the working age population, with similar levels for women and men.
* There are large gender differences throughout the labour market.
* Approximately one-in-five (21.1%) women of working age are active in the labour market, compared
to three-fifths (61.2%) of the male working age population.
* Among those in the labour force, unemployment is much higher for women than it is for men (38.8%
compared to 26.9%).
* The employment rate among working age women is only 12.9%, compared to 40.0% for men.
* Women's extremely low rate stems from the combination of very low labour force participation and
high unemployment.
* Women were mostly employed in the education and health sectors (almost 40% of employed
women). Men were mostly employed in the manufacturing, trade and construction sectors
(employing more than 40% of employed men).
* Youth unemployment is very high in Kosovo
* In 2013, youth in Kosovo were almost twice as likely to be unemployed compared to adults.
Among those aged 15-24 years and in the labour force 55.9% were unemployed. Unemployment is
higher among young women (68.4%) than young men (50.5%).
* More than one third (35.3%) of Kosovo's 15 to 24 year olds were not in education, employment or
training. The figure among young women is 40.9%, compared to 30.0% for young men.
* The large majority of those who are employed report working full-time.
* In their main job, 87.8 percent of respondents reported working full-time, with no major gender
differences.
* The reasons for working part-time were rather gender differentiated with women taking more of a
caring role within the family, thus reducing the hours available for employment.
* The number one reason for men not working full-time was the lack of availability of full-time work.
* Respondents working in the government sector reported working fewer hours than those in the
private sector. Gender differences were small, especially in the government sector where hours
seemed more fixed. Men and women working in private companies worked longer hours.

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
NOVEMBER 2014
* 23.6% of employed people belonged to the vulnerable employment category. This means that they
are either employed in their own business (own-account workers) or contributing to a family business
(paid or unpaid).
* Only 31.2% of those employed had a permanent contract for their main job while 68.8% had
temporary contracts. Those with temporary contracts were asked why they had this type of contract
and 90.5% of respondents reported that no other type of contract was available.
* The net salaries of most employees were between E300 to E400 a month. Very small gender
differences were noted.
* Family responsibilities were the main reason for women's inactivity in the labour market with 35.9%
of female respondents giving this reason.

1.1. EMPLOYMENT BY GENDER
QOf the entire working age population, 28.4% (338,364) were employed (Figure 2). The employment
rate was higher for men than women: 44.0% of working age men was employed compared to
12.9% working age of women (Figure 2).

1.2. EMPLOYMENT BY AGE GROUP AND EDUCATION LEVEL
Across age groups the employment rate was highest among people aged between 45-54 years old and
lowest among youth (15-24 years old).
The employment rate of women remained at a fairly steady percentage (around 16%) between the
ages to 25 to 54 years old. Only 4.6% of young women and 12.2% of women aged between 55-64 years
old were employed. For men 62% belonging to 45-54 age groups were employed whereas the lowest
employment rate was present among young men with an employment rate of 15.1% (Table 1.1).
An examination of the highest educational level reached by the employed is interesting (Table 1.2) as
it shows that over a quarter of all the employed were educated up to tertiary level. However Table 1.3
illustrates that the requirements for getting a job are higher in government positions where over half of
all employees in these jobs are educated up to tertiary level.

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
1.4. VULNERABLE EMPLOYMENT
In addition to the low employment rate in Kosovo, 23.6% of employed people were working in vulnerable
jobs. Vulnerable workers are either self employed people without employees or those who work unpaid
in a family business. These two groups of workers have a lower likelihood of having formal work
arrangements as compared with wage and salaried workers.
Men are more likely to hold such vulnerable jobs (25.0% of employed men compared to 18.9% of
employed women). In absolute terms 80,700 out of 338,364 employed people belong to the vulnerable
employment category (Table 1.5).
Vulnerable employment by gender
Male                                                             66,0

1.5. CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS
In terms of the type of contract that working respondents had, the majority (81.2%) had an individual
contract while the rest were working without a contract. For youth (15 to 24 years of age) the percentage
working without a contract rose to 41.0%.
Of those who had an employment contract, only 31.2% had a permanent contract for their main job
while 68.8% had temporary contracts. These rates are similar for men and women. Those with temporary
contracts were asked why they had this type of contract and 90.5% of respondents reported that no
other type of contract was available.
When asked whether in their main job they were entitled to the benefits of a social security scheme in
the job only 12.6% of employees were entitled.
1.6. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
Among the sectors in which people were employed in 2013, manufacturing, trade, education and
construction employed almost half of employed people (Tables 1.6a & 1.6b). Manufacturing employed
12.6%; trade 12.8%; education employed 11 .1% and construction employed 11.4% of employed people.
Women were mostly employed in the education and health sectors (about 40% of employed women).
Manufacturing, trade and construction are the most common employment sectors for men (employing
more than 40% of employed men).

1.8. PATTERNS OF WORK
Only 2.9% of the employed population reported having a second job during the reference week. Men
were slightly more likely than women to have a second job (3.2% to 1.9%).
In their main job, 87.8%     of respondents reported working full-time and 12.2%              part time3. Small gender
differences were noted with women slightly more likely to work part time (14.8% compared to 11.4%).
For those who worked part-time the reasons for this were rather gender differentiated with women taking
more of a caring role within the family, thus reducing the hours available to work (Table 1.8). The number
one reason for men not working full-time was the lack of availability of full-time work.

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
NOVEMBER 2014
Three-fifths of employed people worked between 40-48 hours per week. Over a tenth (12%) of employed
people worked 60 or more hours per week. Within a week 17% of employed people worked less than
40 hours.
Men tended to work longer hours than women, with 7.7% of women working more than 48 hours per
week compared to 26% of men (Table 1.9). A greater share of employed women worked less than 40
hours (23.8%) compared to men (15%).

Respondents working in the public sector reported working fewer hours than those in the private sector
(Table 1.10). Gender differences were small, especially in the government sector where hours seem more
fixed (around 38-39 hours a week). Men and women working in private companies worked the longest
hours.

1.9. NET MONTHLY SALARY
At the end of the interview respondents who were employees were asked about their net monthly pay
from their main job. They were given a number of salary range categories and the responses can be seen
in Figure 3. It should be noted that approximately 35% of respondents refused to answer this question.
However, we can see that most monthly net salaries were situated between E300 and E400 among
those who did respond. Very small gender differences were noted, with males having a slight tendency
to receive higher salaries.

The unemployment rate was highest for people who have no education (59.9%                 of this group are
unemployed) and lowest for people who had completed tertiary education (15.5%).
Education improved the labour market prospects particularly for women as 67.9% of women with no
education were unemployed compared to 20.3% of those that had completed tertiary education.
2.3. YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT
Based on 2013 LFS, in Kosovo 31% of the unemployed were young people (aged 15-24 years), with
similar shares for males and females.
A significant share of the youth population is unemployed (55.9%) and the unemployment rate among
females is higher (68.4%) than that among males (50.4%).

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
In 2013, young persons in Kosovo were twice as likely to be unemployed compared to adults with similar
rates for men and women (Table 2.5).

2.4. DURATION OF UNEMPLOYMENT
Unemployed respondents were asked how long they had been unemployed. A large majority (68.9%) of
the unemployed had experienced unemployment for longer than 12 months. Small gender differences
were noted (71.0 of men and 64.8% of women). Figure 5 shows that the likelihood of being unemployed
for over a year increases with age.

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
NOVEMBER 2014
n 2013, out of a total population of 1,811,372, the total working age population (aged 15 to 64)
was 1,191,630 people. Of these working age people, 40.5% were participating in the labour force
(economically active), this means they were either employed or unemployed (i.e., actively seeking
work and available to work). The remaining 59.5% were economically inactive (Figure 6). The
economically inactive include students, housewives, discouraged workers, and other people who were
not actively looking for work and they are examined in more detail in the next chapter.

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
The labour force participation rate was highest among people aged between 30-49 years and lowest
amongst people aged 15 to 19 (Table 3.2). The low participation rate for young people is not surprising
because most of this group is in education.
The highest labour force participation rate is present among men aged between 40-44 years whereas
for women it is among women aged between 25-29 years. Only 10.4% of women aged between 60-64
years old are part of the labour force compared to 51.2% of men of the same age group (Table 3.2).

4.1. INACTIVITY BY GENDER
A lot of attention is given to describing and measuring the employed and unemployed populations
"inactive" is equally important. Changes in activity rates are a key part of the impact of labour
supply on potential output growth. This is due to the large number of potential workers among
this group.

Personal or family responsibilities are the main reason for women's inactivity in the labour market
(Table 4.1). Overall low participation of women in the labour force in Kosovo may also be linked to
stereotypical gender roles.
4.2. DISCOURAGED JOB-SEEKERS
In 2013 out of the 708,436 inactive population, 143,700 people did not seek a job because they
believed that there was no work available. This category is classified as "discouraged" job seekers and
in Kosovo they accounted for 12.1% of the working age population (Table 4.1). Looking at the working
age population the level of discouragement is higher for women than men (14.4% compared to 9.7%).
4.3. INACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN EMPLOYMENT,
EDUCATION OR TRAINING (NEET)
The youth NEETs includes the young population that are not employed, not in education and not
in training, that is, totally disconnected from the labour market and are also not participating in the
educational system. High shares of this group in the youth population raise concerns about the future
employability of young people as it indicates detachment from the labour market. In addition, a large
24


﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
number of unoccupied youth in countries with high youth unemployment, such as Kosovo, can put a
downward pressure on employment and earnings, as well as possibly contributing to social problems.
In 2013, 124,500 young people (aged from 15 to 24) in Kosovo were not in education, employment
or training and they represented 35.3% of the young population. The share of NEET women is 40.9%
compared to 30.0% of NEET men (Figure 7).

Labour market statistics of 2013 show that Kosovo still remains in the worst labour market situation
in comparison to the Western Balkan countries and the 28 European Union member countries.
The labour force participation rate in Kosovo is 40.5% while the participation rate in Western Balkan
countries ranges between 43% to 68% and it is 71.8% in European Union countries7 (Table 5.1).

Part of these differences is due to the fact that Kosovo has such a young population and many of these
young people are still in education (and therefore classified as inactive). A concern is that over time the
potential for the inactive population to grow remains high as each year approximately 36,000 young
people will enter the working age population (i.e., 14 year olds will become 15 year olds) while only
approximately 10,000 will leave the working age population (i.e., 64 year olds becoming 65 year olds).
Very strikingly, the labour force participation rate of women is significantly lower in Kosovo than its
neighbours.
In Kosovo only 28.4% of the working age population are employed compared to a 44% simple average
employment rate for Western Balkan countries and 64.1% for European Union countries (Table 5.1).
After Macedonia, the unemployment rate in Kosovo is the highest in the region. The female unemployment
rate in Kosovo is the highest among the European Union and Western Balkan countries.

Table 6.1 shows that most of the key labour market indicators have remained very similar over the
past two years. This is not surprising given the absence of major changes in the Kosovo economy from
2012 to 2013 and the modest economic growth rate over that period. The unemployment rate fell only
slightly, from 30.9% to 30.0%. The most significant change is in the labour force participation rate,
which increased from 36.9% to 40.5%. From 2012 to 2013 the working age population increased by
only 2,611 persons, but the number recorded as economically active increased by almost 45,000. The
number of persons recorded as employed increased by about 35,000, increasing the employment rate
(or employment to population ratio) by almost three percentage points, from 25.6% to 28.4%.
It is possible that the gains in labour force participation and employment in 2013 are overestimated. These indicators
appear to have been underreported in the 2012 LFS, and the 2013 LFS was more thorough in recording small jobs,
including unpaid family work. Therefore some of the apparent increases in 2013 are likely to be attributable to this
improvement in survey methodology. Even so, it is also likely that some of the recorded increase in employment
is genuine job growth, supported by the increase in registrations for new businesses in 2013.
The LFS data indicate that much of the gains in employment come from lower quality employment. For
instance, the percentage of those employed in part-time jobs increased from 11.1% to 11.9%. Perhaps
more significantly, nearly one-half of the increase in employment is in self-employment, increasing the
share of self-employed (as a percentage of those employed) from 19.8% to 22.9%. Furthermore, the
percentage of the employed in vulnerable jobs (persons who are self-employed without employees and
those who work unpaid in a family business) increased from 16.8% in 2012 to 23.6% in
27

NOVEMBER 2014
2013. This is also consistent with the observation that some of the reported increase in labour force
participation and employment could be because of better recording of small jobs.
Finally, the overall increase in employment had little or no impact on the employment situations of women,
youth, or the long-term unemployed. Female labour force participation and employment increased in
2013, but at a rate slower than that for men. Only 40% of the employment gains were among women,
compared to 60% among men, thus widening the gender gap in employment. Youth unemployment was
virtually unchanged, increasing slightly from 55.3% to 55.9%. In contrast, there was a sharp increase
in the long-term unemployment rate: the percentage of the unemployed who had been unemployed for
more than 12 months increased from 59.8% in 2012 to 68.9% in 2013.

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
1. INTRODUCTION
The procedures used for calculating the quarterly and annual weights for the 2013 Kosovo LFS are
similar to those used for the 2012 LFS. However, one difference between the 2012 and 2013 Kosovo
LFS is that for the 2012 LFS the number of EAs selected at the first sampling stage was different
each quarter. A nationally-representative sample of 150 enumeration areas (EAs) was selected for
the first quarter, and the panel of sample households selected for the first quarter was kept in the
sample for the remaining quarters of 2012. Then a new sample of 150 EAs was added each quarter,
until a full sample of 600 EAs was enumerated for the fourth quarter of 2012. In the case of the 2013
LFS, the total number of sample EAs was 600 each quarter; the panel of sample households in one
replicate of 150 sample EAs was rotated each quarter. Another difference between the 2012 and
2013 Kosovo LFS sampling procedures is that the 2012 LFS sample design involved selecting the
EAs with equal probability within each stratum. However, for the 2013 LFS a new sample of 600 EAs
was selected with probability proportional to size (PPS) within each stratum, where the measure of
size was based on the number of households in the EA from the 2011 Kosovo Census frame. This
resulted in a considerable improvement in the efficiency of the sample design for the 2013 LFS. A
sample of 8 households was selected for the LFS in each sample EA, for a total original sample
size of 4,800 households each quarter. Since the non-interview households are not replaced, the
final effective sample size each quarter depends on the total number of sample households with
completed interviews.
The weighting procedures for the 2013 Kosovo LFS depend on the sample design, the number of
sample EAs covered each quarter, and the number of sample households with completed interviews
in each sample EA that appear in the final LFS data file. The sample design is summarized in the next
section. The basic LFS weighting procedures involved first calculating the weights for each quarter of
2013 based on the probabilities of selection and the distribution of the completed household interviews
by sample EA each quarter, so that the quarterly data were nationally-representative. Then the basic
quarterly weights were adjusted at the national level based on the projected total population for mid-
2013. Finally the weights for the annual LFS combined data from all four quarters were calculated by
dividing the quarterly weights by 4.
2. SUMMARY OF SAMPLE DESIGN FOR THE 2013 KOSOVO LFS
A stratified two-stage sample design was used for the 2013 Kosovo LFS. The sampling frame was
based on the data and cartography from the 2011 Kosovo Census. For the purposes of the census
enumeration, Kosovo was subdivided into enumeration areas (EAs), which are relatively small operational
segments defined for the census enumeration. A total of 4,626 EAs were defined for Kosovo, and these
were used as the primary sampling units (PSUs) selected at the first sampling stage for the LFS. The
overall average number of households per EA in the sampling frame was 67; the average size of the
urban EAs (103 households) was almost twice that for the rural EAs (53 households). One census
enumerator was responsible for enumerating the households and population in each EA. KAS used the
2011 Census data to compile a sampling frame of EAs that was used for selecting the LFS sample.
Kosovo is divided geographically into seven regions, specified in Table Al. KAS uses these seven
regions for stratifying the sampling frame and for reporting the results from their household surveys.
Each region is divided into municipalities, which are further subdivided into towns or localities. The EAs
were defined within the smallest administrative units.

NOVEMBER 2014
At the time of the 2011 Census, KAS was not able to conduct the census enumeration in three
municipalities in the North (Leposaviq, Zubin Potok and Zvegam) as well as part of the municipality
of Mitrovicb, which have a high concentration of Serbian population. For this reason the final results
from the 2011 Kosovo Census exclude the households and population in those areas. However,
KAS had previously defined EAs for those areas, and these EAs had been listed in 2008 (in the case
of a master sample of 1,000 EAs for the national household surveys) or in 2009 (for the remaining
EAs). Therefore KAS was able to use the previous information for the EAs excluded in the 2011
Census, to complement the frame for the rest of Kosovo with census information. A total of 257 EAs
in the Northern municipalities are in the frame with information from the 2008/09 listing. These EAs
are integrated with the EAs for the rest of Kosovo with information from the 2011 Census, for a total
of 4,626 EAs in the combined frame.
Table Al shows the distribution of the census EAs and total households from the 2011 Kosovo
Census by region, urban and rural areas, including the information from the previous frame for the
Northern municipalities with predominantly Serbian population.

It can be seen in Table Al that the percentage of households varies by region, from 9.8% for Peja to
28.1% for Pristina. About 43.8% of the households are classified as urban.
For the Kosovo LFS, cut-off sampling was used to eliminate EAs with less than 10 households from
the sampling frame. One result of this approach is that it will produce slightly biased survey results given
that the households in the excluded areas are not represented in the survey data. A total of 160 rural
EAs were excluded from the frame in this case. These excluded EAs cover a very small percentage of
the total population, so the corresponding bias should also be very small.
In the case of the second stage sampling frame for selecting the sample households in each sample
EA for the 2013 LFS, KAS used the list of households from the 2011 Kosovo Census. In the case of a
sample household that moved, if there was a new household living in the same dwelling unit, it would be
interviewed for the LFS. However, one problem with using the list of households from the 2011 Census
at the second sampling stage is that any households living in new housing units constructed after the
census will be excluded from the frame, thus introducing a small bias in the survey results.
The sampling frame of EAs was first divided into explicit strata based on the urban and rural areas in
each region. The sampling frame included information on ethnicity of the population in each EA, which
was also used for stratification. If all the households in an EA belonged to one ethnic group, the EA was
assigned to that ethnic stratum; there was also a category for mixed ethnicity. In the case of a region
with Serbian EAs in the urban or rural strata, these EAs were included in a separate stratum in which the
sample EAs were selected independently. Since the sample allocation was proportional to the number
of households, some of these small strata had only one EA selected. For the purposes of the weighting
procedures and the calculation of sampling errors, the stratification will be limited to the region, urban
and rural level.

﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
A total of 600 sample EAs were selected for the 2013 Kosovo quarterly LFS, allocated to the strata
approximately in proportion to the number of households. Within each sample EA 8 sample households
were selected at the second stage, for a total original sample size of 4,800 households each quarter.
Table A2 shows the allocation of the LFS sample EAs and households by region, urban and rural stratum.
Given the proportional sample allocation, the smallest region of Peja has a sample of 58 EAs and 464
households. The nonresponse rate will further reduce the effective sample size, so it is important to
monitor the sampling errors for the estimates of key indicators by region in order to determine whether
the level of precision is sufficient for the smaller regions.

At the first sampling stage the EAs in each stratum were selected systematically with probability
proportional to size (PPS), where the measure of size was based on the total number of households
in each EA from the sampling frame. The number of EAs selected in each stratum was based on the
sample allocation presented in Table A2. At the second sampling stage 8 households were selected
systematically with equal probability within each sample EA, from the list of households enumerated in
the 2011 Census.
3. SAMPLE ROTATION SCHEME
The 2013 Kosovo LFS is designed as a continuous household survey, with data collection throughout
each week of the year. The sample rotation scheme is based on Eurostat guidelines. For the fieldwork
and data analysis the year is divided into four quarters of 13 weeks each. The national sample of 600
EAs is divided into four nationally-representative replicates of 150 EAs each, which are used in the
sample rotation scheme. The panel of 1,200 sample households in each replicate is interviewed for four
consecutive quarters, and then replaced by a new panel of sample households. The panel households
in the other three replicates are kept in the sample for the next quarter, which ensures that there is a
75% overlap in the sample from one quarter to the next. This will improve the level of precision for the
estimates of trends (differences) in the unemployment and other labor force characteristics from one
quarter to the next. It takes a full year for this rotation scheme to be implemented, since the sample
rotation began in the second quarter of 2013. Therefore in the case of the 2013 LFS some of panels of
sample households will be interviewed less than four times.
4. GENERAL METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THE 2013
KOSOVO LFS WEIGHTS
In order for the sample estimates from the 2013 Kosovo LFS to be representative of the population, it
is necessary to multiply the data by a sampling weight. The basic weight for each sample household
is equal to the inverse of its probability of selection (calculated by multiplying the probabilities at each
sampling stage). A household weight is attached to each sample household record in the data files.
31


﻿RESULTS OF THE KOSOVO 2013
NOVEMBER 2014
The probabilities of selection are based on the stratified two-stage sample design. At the first stage
a sample of EAs was selected with PPS within each stratum (region, urban/rural), and at the second
stage a sample of 8 households was selected in each sample EA. Based on this sample design, the
probabilities of selection for the households in each sample EA can be expressed as follows:
P   fnh X Mhi Mhi flh X Mhi
Mh    Mhi    Mh
where:
phi = probability of selection for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum
(region, urban/rural) h
n=    number of sample EAs selected in stratum h for the LFS
Mhi = total number of households in the sampling frame for the i-th sample EA in stratum h
Nh = total number of households in the sampling frame for stratum h (that is, the cumulated measure
of size for the stratum)
Mhi= 8 = number of sample households selected in the i-th sample EA in stratum h
The basic sampling weight is calculated as the inverse of this probability of selection. Based on the
previous expression for the probability, the weight can be calculated as follows:
FJh-Mh
Whi  M
nh X Mhi
where:
Whi=  basic weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum h
Since the sample households are selected from the 2011 Kosovo Census frame at the second sampling
stage and the number of households selected in each sample EA is constant (mhi = 8), the sample is
approximately self-weighting within each stratum (that is, the weights do not vary within stratum).
It is also important to adjust the basic weights for the sample households to take into account the
nonresponse of households in each sample EA. Since the weights are calculated at the level of the
sample EA, it is advantageous to adjust the weights at this level. The final weight (W>hi) for the sample
households in the i-th sample EA in stratum h can be expressed as follows:
8
W'hi = Whi X ,
m'hi
where:
m'hi= number of sample households with completed interviews in the i-th sample EA in stratum h
5. CALCULATION OF LFS WEIGHTS FOR EACH QUARTER OF 2013
The basic quarterly weights are calculated using the formula for the weight specified in the previous
section. However, the weights each quarter will vary based on the final number of sample EAs enumerated
and the number of sample households with completed interviews in each sample EA. Following the
adjustment of the quarterly weights to take into account any EAs that are not enumerated and any
sample households that cannot be interviewed, the LFS quarterly weight can be expressed as follows:
Wqhi  Mh    flh  8     Mh
nh x 8 nqh Mqhi fqh X Mqhi
32

Wqh =   basic weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum h for quarter q
nqh =    number of sample EAs enumerated for the LFS in stratum h for quarter q
m,,, =   number of sample households with completed LFS interviews in quarter q for the i-th sample
EA in stratum h
The value of nqh depends on the actual distribution of the enumerated EAs in the data file for each
quarter. For the first and second quarters of 2013 all 600 sample EAs were enumerated, but some EAs
were missed in the third and fourth quarters. Tables A3 to A6 show the distribution of the sample EAs
and the number of households with completed interviews by region, urban and rural stratum, in the

The formula for the quarterly weights specified above was used for calculating a separate set of basic
weights for each quarter.
6. ADJUSTMENT OF 2013 LFS QUARTERLY WEIGHTS BASED ON
POPULATION PROJECTIONS
The weighted estimate of the total household-based population of Kosovo using the original weights
for each quarter will vary slightly by quarter due to sampling error. These estimates do not reflect the
growth of the households and population in Kosovo following the 2011 Census, since no new listing of
households was conducted in sample EAs to update the frame. Therefore it was decided to adjust the
2013 Kosovo LFS weights for each quarter using the projected total population of Kosovo for mid-2013
based on demographic techniques. This will also make the weighted estimate of the total population
using the annual weights consistent with the projected total population. The projected total population
of Kosovo for the mid-point of the 2013 LFS data collection period (1 July 2013) is 1,811,372.
The adjustment factor for the 2013 LFS weights each quarter was calculated as follows:
ALFS2013q  A P2013 >I
PLFS2013q
where:
ALFS2013q =  weight adjustment factor applied to the preliminary 2013 LFS weights for quarter q
P2013 =     projected total population of Kosovo for the mid-point of 2013 based on demographic
estimation techniques, equal to 1,811,372

The final 2013 LFS weights for each quarter were calculated by multiplying the basic weight adjusted
for nonresponse by this population adjustment factor, as follows:
W'qhi = Wqhi x ALFS2013q
where:
WEqhi =     final adjusted quarterly weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in
stratum h for quarter q
Table A7 shows that the average population weight adjustment factor is 1.031018509, indicating that the
preliminary weights underestimated the total population by about 3 percent. There were also discussions
about whether to adjust the quarterly weights based on population projections at the regional level.
However, generally it is difficult to obtain accurate population projections at the regional level, since this
would require information on the internal and external migration rates as well as the differential fertility
and mortality rates by region. If we only adjust the weights based on the national-level projections, the
constant weight adjustment factor each quarter will not affect the estimates of any relative quarterly
indicators such as the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate.
7. CALCULATION OF 2013 LFS WEIGHTS FOR ANNUAL COMBINED
DATA FOR ALL FOUR QUARTERS
The data from different quarters are combined in order to increase the level of precision for the annual
indicators (especially for the regional-level estimates), and to represent seasonality in the labor force and
employment characteristics over a longer reference period. The Kosovo LFS data for all four quarters of
2013 were combined for the analysis of the annual data, so weights were calculated for this combined
data file. In this case we first calculated the quarterly weights based on the sample EAs and households
with completed interviews in the LFS data for each quarter, as specified in the previous section. Since
the weights for each quarter expand the data to the national level, it is necessary to divide these weights
by 4 in order to obtain the annual weights for the combined data file for all four quarters. Therefore the
annual LFS weights can be expressed as follows:
WAqhi = Wqhi
4
where:
WAqhi = annual weight for the sample households in the i-th sample EA in stratum h for
quarter q in the combined data file for the four quarters of 2013
WEqhi = final quarterly weight (including population adjustment factor) for the sample
households in the i-th sample EA in stratum h for quarter q
This weighting procedure for the annual LFS estimates has the effect of averaging the results from
all of the quarters being combined. Since the weights for each quarter were adjusted based on the
projected total population for mid-2013, the annual weights will automatically be consistent with this
total population at the national level.

The weighted distribution of the total number of households and population by region, urban and rural
strata based on the annual LFS weights depends on the distribution of the 2011 Kosovo Census frame,
as well as variability in the average number of persons per household by region from the survey data.

It can be seen in Table A8 that the weighted total population at the national level (1,811,372) is the same
as the projected total population of Kosovo for mid-2013 used for the adjustment of the weights. The
relative distribution of the total number of households by stratum is consistent with that in the frame,
given that there was no new listing of households to update the frame. The weighted percent of urban
households at the national level is 43.8%, which is the same as the corresponding percent of urban
households in the 2011 Census frame. The weighted percent of urban population at the national level is
40.0%. One reason for the different percentage of urban households and population is that the average
household size is 5.19 persons for urban households and 6.06 for rural households.
