1.	 DATA RESOURCES FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (ANNEX FOR CHAPTER 2)

1.1	 Data Utilization

1.1.1	 Data received from the Government of Malaysia

      »» Population Census: for 2000 and 2010, disaggregated to the mukim level. [data and shape files]

      »» Household Expenditure Survey: for 2009/10, data at the conurbation level provided recently.

      »» Household Income Survey: for 2012, data at the conurbation level provided recently.

      »» Economic Census: for 2010, at the conurbation level, for manufacturing and services.

      »» Labor Force Survey: for 2008-2012, at state-level, with rural-urban differentiation.

1.1.2	 What have we done with the government data?

      1.	 Population Census:

      »» Calculated population density at conurbation level;

      »» Constructed the density gradient of each conurbation, which exhibits the population density by distance from
         the city center;

      »» Density gradients reflect the spatial form of cities, shaped by interactions between land markets, public
         investment, and regulations;

      »» Spatial structure can have important impacts on economic efficiency of cities — deficient spatial structure
         fragments labor and consumer markets, contributes to higher transactions costs by unnecessarily increasing
         distances between people and places, and increases the length of infrastructure network and as a result raises
         capital and operating costs.

      2.	 Household Expenditure Survey:

      »» Calculated the cost of living in terms of share of transport and housing cost in total household expenditure;

      »» Association with productivity of conurbations.

      3.	 Economic Census:

      »» The total factor productivity (TFP) by conurbation and industry, and its relation with economic density,
         education attainment, employment structure (ratio of non-Malay employees), ownership and legal status;

      »» Labor share and production structure;

      »» Capital intensity, return to capital and access to capital;

      »» Industrial specialization of conurbations using location quotient;



                                                                                                                                     
                                                                               Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  7 
      »» Clustering of the six selected conurbations in the “sunset” and “sunrise” industries.

      4.	 Labor Force Survey:

       »» Combined with Economic Census data;

       »» Analyzed education attainment by conurbation and industry (2-Digit level);

       »» Examined how it is related to productivity and household income in respective conurbation and industry.

      5.	 Other data sources: Oxford Economics Global Cities Dataset, World Bank East Asia Urban Expansion Dataset,
          CEIC Malaysia data, and Global Risk Data Platform from United Nations Environment Programme for calculat-
          ing:

       »» Benchmarking with other large cities in the region;

       »» Economic density (measured by value of production per km2 and jobs per km2), industrial structure and
          productivity;

      »» Relation between public amenities and productivity;

      »» Capital investment at the state level;

      »» Built-up land in urban agglomerations with populations of 100,000 or more from satellites image data;

      »» Economic density as measured by GDP per km2.



2.	 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON SPATIAL ANALYSIS (ANNEX FOR CHAPTER 3)

2.1	 Standardized Groupings of Land Use Classes

      6.	 GIS data on current (“semasa”) land use were obtained as follows:

      »» Greater Kuala Lumpur: from DBKL for the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (FTKL), and JPBD Selangor for the
         eight local authority areas adjacent to FTKL

      »» Johor Bahru: from JPBD Johor

      »» George Town: from JPBD Pulau Pinang

      »» Kota Kinabalu: from DBKK

      7.	 As the land use classes used by each of these data sources varied somewhat, the classifications were
          standardized as shown in the table below.

2.2	 Technical Recommendations on the Management of GIS Data in Malaysia

         8.	 Based on the experience of working with GIS data on land use from five different sources in Malaysia, the
             World Bank team offers the following technical recommendations for improving the management of GIS data
             in Malaysia:

         »» Standardize the land use classifications, ideally using nested classifications that allow for aggregation (see
            Annex 3-1 for a summary of the non-standardized nature of classifications currently).

         »» Standardize the map projections used. Currently, different data sources use different map projections.

         »» Synchronize the data collection schedule across the country, so that data for the same year(s) is available for
            each city. For example, DBKL has land use data for 2000 and 2010, while JPBD Selangor has data for 2002
            and 2008.

     9.	 When editing land use files, make sure that the integrity of the typology remains intact. For example, to add
         water bodies, avoid drawing polygons on top of an existing layer, which results in overlapping polygons that
         will create area calculations errors later; instead, water bodies need to be integrated into the layer.


2.3	 Modelling the impact of Malay Reserve Land on housing affordability in Johor Bahru

    10.	 “Malay Reserve Land,” detailed under the Malay Reservation Enactment or ERM, refers to a special category of
         land situated within the territorial boundaries of a state, which can be owned and dealt over only by Malays
         or the natives of the state. Limiting access to Malay Reserve Land undervalues the prices of these properties,
         and puts unnecessary upward pressure on neighboring land prices. As a result there is a limited market for the
         trading of Malay Reserve Land. Reports suggest that, when the government acquires such land for development
         or when Malay developers buy the land, they are reluctant to pay a high price or compensation because of the
         limited market and the lack of financial resources. These buyers may lose interest in the deal since landowners
         set high prices. As a result, the land remains undeveloped (Omar, 2002).

    11.	 To understand how the segregation of MRL from the land market could potentially affect housing and land
         affordability, a theoretical framework that reflects the interplay between households’ localization decisions,
         project developers’ construction decisions and transport costs is required. The standard urban economics
         model as defined by Fujita (1989) based on the pioneering works of Alsonso (1964), Mills (1967) and Muth
         (1969) is well suited to conduct such a study. The aim of this study is precisely to evaluate the impact of
         excluding Malay reserves from urbanization in relative terms compared to a situation where Malay reserves
         are entirely available to urbanize.

    12.	 In this exercise we use such a standard model and inform it by using real world inputs from Malaysia and Johor
         Bahru in particular. First, we calculate how much space MRL occupy, identify their locations within the city,
         and exclude these areas from potential urbanization. According to the data provided by the local government,
         approximately 14.5% of the land within the conurbation line is MRL, as shown in the map below.

                                                                             Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  11 
     13.	 This model aims to explain the variation in land costs in cities and level of real estate prices together with
          the distribution of households and buildings in an urban area. Classically, it is based on two very simplified,
          yet realistic, fundamental mechanisms. First, households, when choosing where to live, trade-off between
          the proximity to the city centre and the level of real estate prices (or equivalently between the proximity to
          the city centre and the size of the dwelling they will occupy). Second, the project developers (or landowners)
          maximise their profits and choose to build more or less housing surface in a given place depending on the
          level of real estate prices. The higher the real estate prices, the denser the developers choose to build. In this
          model version, landowners are assumed to live outside the city, which means that land rents are not recycled
          into the local economy as income.

     14.	 In the present study, we use this model with a certain number of simplifying hypotheses. First, we assume
          that all households commute every day to the centre of Johor Bahru, where jobs are assumed to be located.
          Second, the model also relies on the hypothesis that all households within the urban area earn the same
          average income.

     15.	 With a limited amount of data describing the size of the population, average households’ income, the transport
          system (in this case in a very simplified manner), land use, construction costs, and households and developers’
          behavior, the mechanisms described above can reproduce the main features of an urban area in a schematic
          way. The main outputs of such a model are: rents expressed in currency/sq meter of housing space, dwelling
          size in sq meters, housing density or equivalently building heights in number of floors and population density
          expressed in households/sq km. Other outputs can be computed such as land values expressed in currency/sq
          meters of land. See charts below that exhibit the main outputs of the model.

    16.	 In this simplified representation of Johor Bahru and without detailed calibration data, the outputs of the model
         should be considered with precaution. However, although the actual value of each output variable is unlikely
         to match real values (because calibration is very basic and real world features such as transport networks are
         absent), their variation when a shock is introduced in the urban system (such as excluding land from potential
         urbanization) is meaningful and likely to change only marginally with more spatially detailed information.

    17.	 The table below presents the modelling results on the increase in rents and land values for the scenario when
         MRL is excluded from urbanization. The first row presents the result when the value of ß (the share of income
         devoted to housing expenditures) is set as 0.16, which is based on existing data for Johor Bahru. The impacts
         are increase in rents of 1.30% and increase in total land values of 4.60%. The increase is not huge, but neither
         is it negligable. This is not only related to the size of the MRL in Johor Bahru, but also the location – some of the
         MRL areas are located quite close to the city center where the rents are high. The following rows in the table
         present results of the sensitivity analysis with different values of ß.

3.3	 Institutional Analysis: Selected Global Case Studies

3.3.1	 Case study one: Decentralization in Indonesia

Case summary

      18.	 Indonesia began the process of decentralization in 1999, and it became effective in 2001. The move towards
           decentralization was motivated by the desire to enhance public services, community empowerment, and
           local competitiveness. Political crisis and demand from local areas that were dissatisfied with the centralized
           system prompted this reform. Since decentralization, power sharing has been based on criteria including
           the incidence of externalities, accountability, and efficiency. The central government retains authority over
           foreign affairs, defense, security, judicial affairs, monetary and fiscal policy and religion. Decentralization has
           had some positive outcomes including increasing economic growth and enhancing public services such as
           education, health and general administrative process.

Country profile

     19.	 Indonesia is a populous lower middle income country, with nearly 250 million people and a GDP of USD 868
          billion in 2013 (World Bank Data n.d.). Indonesia is the largest economy in Southeast Asia. The country’s
          gross national income per capita has steadily increased from US$4,010 in the year 2000 to US$9,260 in
          the year 2013(World Bank Data n.d.). Indonesia has managed to fulfill many of its fiscal targets, including a
          significant decrease in Debt-to-GDP ratio from 57 percent in 2004 to 28 percent in 2009 (World Bank Data
          n.d.).

     20.	 Geographically, the Indonesia archipelago stretches between Asia and Australia, with a total area of around
          1.9 million sq km (CIA n.d.). Indonesia comprises many ethnic groups and religions, and has more than 300
          local languages. Indonesia consists of 31 Provinces, one Autonomous Province, one Special Region and one
          National Capital District (CIA n.d.). Every province is made up of districts and municipalities.

Motivations for decentralization

     21.	 After the economic crisis began in 1997, the politics of Indonesia became unstable. Mass protests forced the
          Suharto government to undertake democratic reform and a succession of national leadership. Reforms were
          initiated in 1998 when Suharto relinquished the presidency, and Habibie, the former vice president, became
          president.

     22.	 During the Habibie period, many local regions called for more autonomy. Some regions even called for
          secession, which was supported by local officials who want to gain greater control of resources. This pressure
          made Habibie adopt a decentralization policy that was expected to maintain national unity through the
          promotion of more democratic government and increased participation of the local people.

The situation prior to decentralization

     23.	 Prior to decentralization, administrative powers were held by the central government in a top-down system.
          Local governments did not have independence in policy making. Development planning and budget allocations
          were provisioned by the central government. All provincial and local expenditures were earmarked and were
          administered through line ministries’ offices at the provincial and district/municipality level (Sjahrir and
          Katos 2011).

     24.	 The central government assigned local political leaders. Local public participation was weak because policies
          were created by elites in the central government and sometimes did not suit local needs and cultures.

     25.	 The central government controlled most resources including funding, human resources, and natural resources.
          The perceived unfairness of natural resources allocations encouraged resource-rich regions to demand
          secession from Indonesia.

The process of decentralization

     26.	 Indonesia underwent political, fiscal and administrative decentralization. The central government led the
          process by issuing local governance and fiscal balance laws. These laws made districts and municipalities the
          key administrative units responsible for providing most government services. The districts and municipalities
          have no hierarchic relationship to the provincial level. The Provincial governors acted as the central
          government’s representatives in the region. The full autonomy given to the districts and municipalities limited
          the power of local regions that might otherwise have had separatist demands if the power had shifted to
          the provincial level. Politically, decentralization gave autonomy to the newly democratically elected local
          parliaments (DPRD) to choose the heads of local governments, who would be responsible to DPRD.

     27.	 After three years, the central government reviewed these regulations and their implementation, and later
          revised them to refine and to clarify the relationship and sharing of responsibilities between the central
          government, provinces and district/municipalities. The revised law introduced local direct elections to
          strengthen local accountability, gave provinces supervisory powers instead of powers of coordination, and
          strengthened their role as representatives of the central government, particularly in the area of planning and
          budgeting.


                                                                                                                                     
                                                                              Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  83 
The current system

      28.	 Power sharing between the central, provincial and district/municipality governments is based on the following
           principles1:

             a.	 The externality criterion is the approach of distributing governmental functions by considering the
                 impacts/consequences that arise in the execution of those distributed functions. When impacts that arise
                 are local in nature, then the governmental function in question comes under the authority of the regency/
                 city; when regional in nature, then under provincial authority; and when national in nature, then under
                 authority of the central government.

             b.	 The accountability criterion is the approach of distributing governmental functions by considering that
                 the level of government that handles a certain function is the level that is closest to the impact or conse-
                 quence of that function. Accordingly, accountability for delivering those distributed governmental func-
                 tions to the people will be better guaranteed.

             c.	 The efficiency criterion is the approach of distributing governmental functions by considering the avail-
                 ability of resources (personnel, funds, and equipment) to obtain the accuracy, certainty and speed of
                 results that need to be achieved in the execution of distributed functions

      29.	 Based on the criteria above, the central government only retains six authorities and responsibilities: foreign
           affairs, defense, security, judicial affairs, monetary and fiscal policy and religion. However, local governments
           participate even in these functions. Leaders are elected locally, and local governments have full control of
           local policies, laws and budgets.

      30.	 Fiscal decentralization has made local government fully independent in allocation of its budget and raising
           local government revenues. However, most revenues, [e.g. in 2004, 92 percent for districts/municipalities
           and 51 percent for provinces (Kajian Pengeluaran Publik Indonesia 2007)], are still from central government
           resources, which makes the decentralization more administrative than fiscal in nature. Since decentralization,
           local governments have full authority over most sectors, excluding the six central government responsibilities
           mentioned above. Most aspects of education2, health3 and infrastructure4 sectors became the responsibility
           of the local government (Sjahrir and Katos 2011). Consequently, local governments have increased spending
           responsibility without the additional locally controlled revenue base necessary to support extra spending. This
           creates a gap between revenues and expenditures at the local level. To fill this gap, the central government
           implements three instruments: (i) resources revenue sharing, (ii) general purpose grants (known as Dana
           Alokasi Umum - DAU), (iii) special purpose grants (known as Dana Alokasi Khusus - DAK).

      31.	 Revenue sharing comprises tax and non-tax revenue. Local governments have total discretion over the use of
           allocated funds.

      32.	 DAU is calculated based on the fiscal gap plus base allocation that is determined by local government officer
           wage. The fiscal gap is calculated from fiscal needs minus fiscal capacity. Fiscal needs are calculated based

           encompasses local revenue and revenue sharing.

     33.	 DAK is given by the central government for specific tasks, particularly for development expenditure such as
          education, health, agriculture, forestry and infrastructure. The implementation of DAK is based on the central
          government’s ministerial guidelines. DAK cannot be used for research, training, administration and official
          travel.

The outcomes of the decentralization effort so far

     34.	 Decentralization has promoted democracy and increased the ability of local regions to manage their own
          economic development, through bottom-up planning in keeping with local people’s aspirations. This has
          increased local public participation and fostered partnerships between stakeholders. Decentralization has
          increased economic growth significantly (Adi 2005), as well as development expenditure. Decentralization
          has also delivered more efficient and responsive public services such as education, health, infrastructure and
          general administrative services. After decentralization, local governments became responsible for the first
          nine years of education, and expenditures on primary and investments in secondary education became the
          first and second largest budgetary items for local governments (Sjahrir and Katos 2011). As a result, there
          has been an increase in literacy rates and years of schooling (Simatupang 2009). Decentralization improved
          health services, with one additional health clinic (Puskesmas) built per 10,000 of population on average
          (Sjahrir and Katos 2011). Mortality rates and life expectancy have also significantly improved (Simatupang
          2009). Infrastructure development has also increased slightly (Sjahrir and Katos 2011). However, none of
          these achievements were caused by decentralization alone; they required well-functioning local political
          institutions, better informed citizens, transparent local government, and effective channels for political
          participation.

     35.	 The greater amount of power at the district /municipality level encourages local elites to create new district/
          municipalities. The central government tends to accommodate the interests of local elites in order to avoid
          ethnic conflicts spurred by local elites. Between 1999 and 2010, there were 7 new provinces, 164 new
          districts and 34 new cities (Imron 2011). The proliferation of new local administrative units in the region has
          had some negative impacts. For example in the forestry sector, decentralization allows a local government
          to make its own laws and regulations, such as those relating to issuing logging permits. This has caused a
          proliferation of permits, with little regard for the effect on forest resources. As a result, large forest areas
          have been destroyed and threatened with conversion to other uses for which local people are not the primary
          beneficiaries (Resosudarmo 2004).

3.3.2	 Case study two: Decentralization in Mexico

Case summary

     36.	 Mexico started decentralization reform in 1983 in response to a debt crisis that left the federal government
          unable to provide adequate public services, and also to encourage development beyond Mexico City.
          Studies suggest that decentralization is more successful in areas where local regions have full control over
          budgeting and less central government funding. Decentralization provides better allocation of local services
          due to an information advantage through being closer to the recipient. In addition, decentralization also
          promotes good governance in rural local governments by increasing accountability and entrepreneurship.




                                                                                                                                     
                                                                              Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  85 
Country profile

     37.	 Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and is a major oil producer and exporter. Even though
          production of oil has fallen in the last few years, about one-third of government revenue still comes from the
          oil industry. Mexico’s economy suffered during the financial crisis of 2008, but its economy has recovered
          since then through substantial foreign investment. Mexico’s population and GDP are respectively 122.3 million
          (2013) and USD 1.261 trillion (2013) (World Bank Data Bank n.d).

     38.	 Mexico is a federal country with 32 states and nearly 2,500 municipalities. Local leaders are elected
          democratically for 3 years and cannot be re-elected. Between 1929 and 1997, the country had a single majority
          party. Since 1997, there have also been some opposition parties represented in the parliament.

Motivation for decentralization

     39.	 The President Miguel de la Madrid led decentralization reform in 1983, for two main reasons. First, the
          debt crisis meant the federal government was unable to provide adequate public services, and second,
          over-crowding of population in the Federal District placed considerable strain on urban infrastructure and
          the ecological environment. President de la Madrid’s administration hoped that sharing administrative
          functions and responsibilities with states and municipalities would allow the federal government to
          simultaneously increase administrative efficiency and decrease its own accountability by shedding
          bureaucratic responsibilities (Elias 1997).

Situation prior to decentralization

     40.	 Prior to the mid-1980s, although Mexico had a federal system of government, there was in fact no autonomy at
          the level of states and municipalities. This was because Mexico lacked a strong parliament that could balance
          the president, who dominated almost all aspects of the political process. The president could control all levels
          of government, including proposing candidates for the head of local government. In turn, these local leaders
          ensured the continued power of the incumbent government. The parliament was only able to pass laws that
          maintained the domination of the government.

The process of decentralization

     41.	 Decentralization reform in 1983 had 3 goals: (i) to decentralize all federal agencies, both administratively and
          geographically; (ii) to strengthen federalism by increasing the power of states and local government; and (iii)
          to promote regional economic development (Elias 1997).

     42.	 The first goal was accomplished by the decentralization of all ministries. The process of decentralization was
          coordinated by the Ministry of Budget and Planning. The second goal was implemented by reforming the
          Mexican constitution to strengthen federalism. Lastly, the third goal was accomplished by promoting industrial
          investment in places outside of Mexico City and by providing municipalities the legal and financial capabilities
          to operate without interference from the federal government.

     43.	 Decentralization granted the municipalities the responsibility for potable water, drainage, sewerage, public
          lighting, refuse collection, cemeteries, streets, public parks, public safety, and slaughter houses. In addition,
          the central government also shared revenues through an ‘unconditional fund’ for each state. In 1997 the
          central government significantly increased the budgets of states and municipalities through a conditional fund
          that could be used on specific sectors such as social infrastructure, public safety and financial obligations.




86 Annexes
The current system

     44.	 The states’ and the municipalities’ budget revenues consist of unconditional and conditional funds from the
          central government, local taxes, fees and surcharges, grants and loans. The share of the municipality’s revenue
          is, on average, 63 percent from unconditional funds from the central government (participaciones), 11 percent
          from local taxes, 10 percent from surcharges and 16 percent from unconditional funds and sale or lease of
          state owned property (World Bank 1991).

     45.	 Unconditional funds are assigned through the General Participatory Fund (GPF). The central government
          allocates at least 20 percent to the states and each state allocates at least 20 percent to municipalities.
          Conditional funds consist of FISM (Fund for Social Infrastructure) and FORTAMUN (Fund for Strengthening
          Municipalities). FISM is allocated by a formula through the Secretary of Social Development and FORTAMUN
          is distributed on a discretionary basis.

The outcomes of the decentralization effort so far

     46.	 The overall impact of the 1983 reforms is mixed. Decentralization was more successful in those areas that did
          not require that the federal government to relinquish its hold on political power (Elias 1997). Consequently,
          local autonomy over resources was greater in areas that did not require large amounts of federal funding
          (Elias 1997). For instance, the decentralization of the Ministry of Education greatly improved the ability of the
          states to establish schools and provide teacher’s education by transferring material and financial resources
          from the federal to the state governments (Rodriguez 1987). Other research found that fiscal decentralization
          has been associated with changes in patterns of accountability and entrepreneurship, which tend to promote
          good governance in rural local governments (Moreno 2013). Conditional funds were found to be important
          in promoting both accountability and entrepreneurship, while unconditional funds had a negative effect on
          accountability and no effect on entrepreneurship. Being closer to local populations has allowed for more
          efficient allocation of resources in rural municipalities (Moreno 2013).

3.3.3	 Case study three: Decentralization in Spain

Case summary

     47.	 Spain began decentralization after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The new democratic
          constitution that was enacted in 1978 offered Spanish provinces the right to to establish autonomous regions,
          and specified the division of competences between the central government and these autonomous regions.
          The degree of autonomy in each region is different but generally decentralization gives them full control
          of education and health. By bringing decision making closer to the people, decentralization has improved
          efficiency as well as equity.

Country profile

     48.	 Spain’s location between the Atlantic and Mediterranean Oceans and the European and African continents gives
          it a diverse history and culture. Spain’s total area is around 505,370 sq km, which consists of 17 autonomous
          communities and 2 autonomous cities (CIA n.d.). Its population and GDP are around 46.65 million (2013) and
          1.4 trillion (2013) respectively (World Bank Data n.d.). The country’s GDP steadily increased until 2008, but
          after the global financial crisis it dropped 3.7 percent in 2009 and continued contracting through the middle
          of 2013(World Bank Data n.d.). The unemployment rate increased from 8 percent in 2007 to more than 25
          percent in 2012 (World Bank Data n.d.).

     49.	 After the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, under King Juan Carlos as head of state, Spain made
          a transition from dictatorship to democracy. General elections took place in June 1976. During the campaign,
          all of the political parties included in their programs the elaboration of a new democratic constitution and the
          establishment of autonomy for the regions (Sanz n.d.).

     50.	 Initially, the idea of decentralization was seen as a solution to the separatist demands of Basque and Catalan
          nationalities, including Galicia, but was also widely supported by the public. Eventually, the new democratic
          constitution converted Spain to a parliamentary monarchy in 1978.

Situation prior to decentralization

     51.	 Spain was under Franco’s rule for 36 years following his victory in the Spanish Civil War. During this period,
          government was highly centralized and the constitution gave the central government ultimate authority to
          pass all laws. As the chief of state and government, Franco not only appointed and dismissed ministers but his
          government appointed mayors as well. Local municipal councils were effectively appointed by the heads of
          families and heads of local corporations.

The process of decentralization

     52.	 The implementation of decentralization was driven by the approval of the new Spanish constitution in 1978.
          This constitution made Spain one of the most decentralized economies in Europe. It gave the right to Spanish
          provinces to establish autonomous regions, and specified the division of competencies between the central
          government and these autonomous regions.

     53.	 The decentralization process in Spain was unique in its asymmetric nature. Every region approved their
          autonomy statutes and received local responsibilities separately. Regions that had common historic, cultural
          and economic characteristics, such as Catalonia, Basque, Galicia and Andalusia, received local autonomy
          immediately after their statutes were approved, while other regions had to wait up to 5 years after the approval
          of their statutes.

     54.	 The decentralization process can be categorized into 4 phases (Sanz n.d.):

             a.	 First phase (1979-1982): The statutes for 17 autonomous regions issued and commencement of decen-
                 tralization process

             b.	 Second phase (1983-1992): Some responsibilities such as university education transferred

             c.	 Third phase (1993-2002): Transfer of education and health; the central government budget allocation for
                 education and health decreased significantly

             d.	 Fourth phase (2002-2008): Local autonomy reinforced; Basque proposal for new political statutes and
                 the reform of Catalonia statutes

The current system

     55.	 Responsibilities have shifted from the central government to the Autonomous Communities (ACs), which vary
          in level of autonomy. Every AC has its own statute of autonomy law that outlines the responsibilities of that
          AC. For example, Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia have special status, with their own languages

               and other rights. Andalusia, Navarre, Valencia and the Canaries have more extensive powers than some other
               regions. Asturias and Aragon have taken steps to acquire language rights.

        56.	 Decentralization creates functional specialization between the central government and the autonomous
             regions, as follows (Sanz n.d.):

               a.	 Central Government: The functions performed by the central government are social security, transfers to
                   the local regions, defense, foreign policy and justice

               b.	 Autonomous Communities: The functions performed by ACs are health and education

               c.	 Shared authority: The shared activities consist of 2 clusters. The first cluster, which accounts for roughly
                   13 percent of the central government's budget and 17 percent of the combined autonomous regions'
                   budget, are “infrastructure”, “agriculture, fishing and nutrition”, “employment fostering” and “research,
                   development and innovation”. The second cluster, accounting for roughly 5 percent of the central gov-
                   ernment's budget and 8 percent of the combined autonomous regions' budget, are “housing”, “citizens´
                   safety”, “trade, tourism and small and medium enterprise”, “culture”, “industry and energy”, and “grants
                   for transport”.

The outcomes of the decentralization effort so far

        57.	 Fiscal decentralization had a positive impact in the health sector. An empirical study found that decentralization
             was one of the factors that had an influence on the effectiveness of public policies on infant mortality and life
             expectancy (Cantarero and Pascual 2008). Based on data from 1992 to 2003, infant mortality has decreased
             and life expectancy has increased. The education sector has also had a positive impact from decentralization.
             Improvements in efficiency in education have been greater in Autonomous Communities with good fiscal
             discipline and high level of per capita public revenues (Pena 2009). Decentralization has increased the ‘survival
             rate’ in school (i.e. the proportion students enrolled in the last course of Obligatory Secondary Education who
             move on to post-secondary education). The study also found that cost efficiency in Spanish local government
             increased when the local government had more responsibilities devolved to it (Ballaguer-Coll 2006). This
             research also found that the decentralization gains improved over time5.


3.4	 Metropolitan Management – Approaches and Implications6

3.4.1	 Why metropolitan management matters for Malaysia

        58.	 In Malaysia, as in most urbanized countries, many large cities have become more economically interdependent
             with their surrounding settlements. These areas are often referred to as a metropolitan (metro) area or region,
             constitute a single economy and labour market, and share a community with common interests. The economic
             links between the core and the periphery can become so close, that one part cannot succeed without the

             other. While political boundaries tend to be fairly stable, urban growth often changes the character of an area.
             Therefore, a metropolitan area usually includes a number of local government jurisdictions.

     59.	 This mismatch between functional integration and political fragmentation creates a need for metropolitan-
          level management; to seize opportunities for collaboration, and prevent wasteful competition between local
          governments. Lack of any formal or informal governance arrangements at the metropolitan scale tends to
          create fragmentation of services (inefficiencies); “free ridership” by some jurisdictions (due to spillovers);
          environmental degradation; and underutilization of land with potentially higher value from a regional
          perspective.

    60.	 Better metropolitan management would help make Malaysian cities more competitive. Currently, local
         governments are relatively weak, and unable to solve metropolitan-scale problems independently. Urban areas
         have been growing rapidly, but have struggled to keep up with citizen demand for services. At the same time,
         Malaysia has a complex, multi-tier system of government that makes it difficult for neighboring jurisdictions to
         coordinate to provide these services efficiently.

     61.	 The six conurbations examined in this report are spread across multiple jurisdictions, indicating the need for
          a system of coordination at the metropolitan scale. The Greater Kuala Lumpur conurbation crosses 15 districts
          or federal territories and almost as many local authorities, the George Town/ Penang conurbation also crosses
          15 districts and a few local authorities across three states, the Johor Bahru/ Iskandar conurbation crosses four
          districts and several local authorities, and Kuantan crosses three districts across two stastes. Each of these
          districts in turn is made up of multiple mukims. While there are no official conurbation boundaries for the
          remaining conurbations, looking at the spread of built-up areas suggests that the Kuching conurbation crosses
          at least two districts, while Kota Kinabalu crosses at least four. While these conurbations typically work as
          integrated units from the point of view of their economy, housing market, labor market, and mobility patterns,
          they are not recognized as such from an administrative point of view, as there is no administrative level
          between the individual districts and local authorities, and the states. Official conurbation boundaries indicate
          the general extent of a metropolitan area, but do not definitively enumerate which local authorities would
          need to be involved in metropolitan decision-making, as they do not align with district or mukim boundaries
          (e.g. see Figure 3-1).

     62.	 A number of metropolitan areas around the world have tried to address similar problems, with varying degrees
          of success. This annex provides a typology of the main metropolitan-level governance approaches applied
          internationally, with their pros and cons, and related city examples. It concludes with a summary of lessons
          learned.

     63.	 Malaysia’s jurisdictions, like Greater Kuala Lumpur in Figure 3-1, are highly multi-jurisdictional, and require
          collaboration between many local governments in order to function efficiently. Official conurbation boundaries
          do not clearly indicate which local authorities, or districts, fall within the conurbation.

3.4.2	 The need for metropolitan governance through political transformation

    64.	 As metropolitan areas in Malaysia grow, there is an increasing need for coordination and joint decision-
         making by the area local governments, and management at a metropolitan scale of some functions and
         services. For example, while activities to retain businesses should normally be left to the lowest level of
         government, attracting new firms is usually best pursued at a regional level. Strong interdependencies also
         exist in tourism promotion and management. Solid waste disposal is a typical joint function for efficiency,
         while waste collection may be managed locally. Environmental impacts transcend jurisdictional boundaries,
         and inadequate maintenance of storm drains in one area can cause flooding in another (spillover effects).

    65.	 International experience has shown that “there is not one size that fits all” due to local and national
         differences. (Slack 2007) Some institutional arrangements are established “bottom up”, i.e. through initiatives




                                                                                                                                    
                                                                             Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  91 
               and agreements among the local governments in the area; some “top down”, i.e. by a provincial or national
               government. The arrangements often evolve, moving from one approach to another over time.7

        66.	 While the system of local administration has a significant impact on the efficiency and equity of a regional
             economy, it also impacts the accessibility of residents to their local governments, the degree of public
             participation in decision-making, and the accountability and responsiveness of the governments. Efficiency,
             equity, and voice are essential for good metropolitan governance (Klink 2008). Slack concludes that the
             optimal design of government structure depends on which criteria are to be satisfied. Economies of scale,
             externalities, and equity lend themselves to large government units over an entire metropolitan area; the
             criteria of local responsiveness and accessibility and accountability point towards smaller government units.
             The challenge is to find the right balance between those criteria; this may be different in different metro
             areas.” (Slack 2007) Political factors often determine the choice of governance structure though.

        67.	 Financial considerations are often prime incentives for creating special metropolitan arrangements.

               a.	 Pooling financial or human resources: When synergy will be achieved through joint efforts (area promo-
                   tion, procurement, borrowing, etc.);

               b.	 Cost sharing: When scale economies will be gained by sharing costs for an investment (e.g. specialized
                   equipment) or delivering a service;8

               c.	 Management of Spillovers: When spillovers (externalities) across jurisdictions need to be addressed; e.g.
                   air or water pollution (negative spillover); or if attractions are in one area while visitors stay and spend
                   in another (positive spillover);

               d.	 Reducing Disparity: When significant income and/or service inequality exist between jurisdictions (e.g.
                   different tax base).

3.4.3	 Metropolitan governance models

        68.	 The main institutional approaches applied internationally to address these needs are categorized, described,
             and exemplified in Table 3-10. They range from: (a) ad hoc cooperation, and joint (temporary or permanent)
             coordination initiatives or arrangements; through (b) metropolitan planning and/or service delivery authorities;
             (c) a metropolitan-level / regional government; to (d) a consolidated local government through amalgamation
             of jurisdictions or annexation of adjacent areas by a city. While a municipal government covering most of its
             metro area facilitates coordination, local offices or sector arrangements may still be needed for efficiency and
             resident accessibility; cooperation across the area is often still a challenge.

3.4.4	 Global experiences

        69.	 International experience demonstrates a great diversity of metropolitan models, particularly across North
             America (Dodge 1996) and Europe (OECD 2006). Although many megacities are in South Asia, few examples
             exist of well-established and functioning approaches. Many metropolitan development authorities exist, but


7	
     Metropolitan management can be viewed as teamwork among local governments, particularly when a bottom-up approach is applied.
     Effective teamwork requires: (a) a common objective; (b) trust; and (c) that differences among members are viewed as strength, not as a
     weakness.

     Alternatively it may be provided by one of the local governments, charging the others a fee.

      these tend to mostly be focused on investment planning and land development. In East Asia, China, Japan
      and South Korea have consolidated and comprehensive metropolitan governments for their megacities (Yang
      2009), while in the Philippines, Manila has had various regional governments with strong local government
      representation and the chair appointed by the President (Laquian 2005).

70.	 Where institutional arrangements at local levels are lacking or weak, coordination tend to be exercised by
     national or provincial/state governments (e.g. Lagos State). In Australia public transportation and other
     local functions are managed by the provincial governments. (Abbott, 2011) While an inter-governmental
     transfer system can be a powerful tool by a national government to influence inter-municipal affairs, it can
     also have unintended consequences if not carefully designed. Policies in Mexico in the 1990s, for example,
     unintentionally exacerbated the level of fiscal disparity in the metro area of Mexico City due to indirect negative
     effects of transfers on local tax collection, causing further disparity of infrastructure. Mitigating efforts proved
     to be constrained by legal and political complexities. (Raich 2008)

71.	 Often local governments do not evolve or cooperate unless they are required to do so by a higher level
     government, for example to be eligible for certain funding. Many regional planning councils were created
     following the availability of EU regional economic development grants (OECD 2006). However, this does not
     always create lasting arrangements. In the United States, it was for many years a pre-requisite for obtaining
     certain grant funding from the US federal government that the local governments present their needs and
     solutions through a regional plan. When these requirements ended, the effectiveness of many regional bodies
     that had been created diminished. (Post 2004) Other incentives for local/regional coordination have been
     through inter-governmental systems (e.g. in India), enabling legal frameworks (e.g. in France, Poland and
     Italy), and through financial incentives and political influence (e.g. in the Netherlands).

      If local governments are mostly funding the authority, they need to be adequately represented on its board or council to ensure the
      accountability of decisions.
 11 	
      The areas and average populations of French local governments are small by international standards. They therefore make extensive use of
      cooperative arrangements for their service provision. France has a particular legal framework for inter-municipal cooperation (‘syndicats
      intercommunaux’). The syndicates are similar to cooperatives or federations of local governments to carry out single or multiple functions.
      A local government may be involved in several syndicates.
12 	 	
      Some argue that large-scale metropolitan governments lead to greatly reduced citizen participation, and weakened democratic
      accountability. (Oakerson, 2004).
13	
      The Ministry of Nairobi Metropolitan Development, Kenya can be considered a variation of this although with no direct authority over the
      area local governments.

Variety of approaches for a metropolitan authority

      72.	 Planning and service consolidation through a metropolitan authority can generate efficiency gains, particularly
           for smaller local governments in a metro area to remain independent yet efficient, signing service delivery
           contracts with the metro authority or utility company.15 Characteristics of a metro authority are reflected
           in Table 3-11, distinguishing options for each dimension. For example, some transport authorities are
           characterized by items in bold.

 Board16                      the Area


Tax sharing agreements

      73.	 Tax competition is sometimes tempting for local governments to attract business and high-income residents.
           However, reduction of tax rates sometimes becomes “a race to the bottom” and loss of revenues.

      74.	 Communauté Urbaine of Marseille, France is a consortium of seventeen cities which uses a joint system for
           collection of a business tax with common tax rate, avoiding tax competition and achieving more cost-effective
           tax collection. It is governed by a body of the mayors and councilors of the municipalities, responsible for
           regional economic development, transport, land use and housing, crime prevention, waste disposal and

           subsidies. This council evolved into a Regional Government appointed by the Minnesota state government,

Flexible arrangements

      77.	 The metro governance in Bologna, Italy was established on a voluntary basis in 1994 by forty-eight local
           governments and the province of Bologna. A metropolitan council is composed of all the mayors and presided
           over by the provincial president. Each local government is free to withdraw at any time and may participate in
           some or all activities of the council; a low-risk approach for the governments in the area.

      78.	 A metropolitan authority needs to be properly funded. Greater Vancouver Regional Service District (GVRD),
           Canada finances its services through user charges, a share of property tax, and annual contributions from
           the member local governments, but has also been given authority to collect a road and gasoline tax in the
           metropolitan area. This metropolitan administration is now a public corporation with a Board composed of
           representatives of the eighteen member local governments; another flexible, demand-driven organization
           providing different services to its members through individual agreements. Since its establishment in 1965
           numerous services have been added, including human resource management services on a contract basis. It
           does not have any strong land use planning powers though. GVRD was initially established by the provincial
           government, but has evolved to a corporation governed by the member municipalities. (See Box 3-1 to learn
           more about the GPVD’s history and approach).

          information on the RPA’s role in planning for the New York metro area.)

      81.	 Although a new constitution in Brazil (1989) increased the autonomy of local governments and delegated
           responsibility for designing metropolitan structures to the state legislatures, relatively few examples of formal
           inter-municipal cooperation exist except in the São Paulo ABC Region17. This metro organization has had
           particularly active engagement of the civil society and the local private sector, and has played important roles
           in the economic development of the area (the City of São Paolo does not participate however). It was created
           to reinvent the region with a new economic vision after a period of very high unemployment.

        82.	 A separate agency for planning and development has been established for some cities; some with a mandate
             focused on land use and master planning (Delhi Development Authority in India, and Dhaka Capital Development
             Authority (RAJUK) in Bangladesh)18 (Siddiqui, 2004), others with broader city development mandates such
             as Lagos Mega-City Development Authority in Nigeria, and London Development Agency in the UK, recently
             incorporated into the Greater London Authority to which the Mayor of London reports. These regional
             authorities combine some governing authority with development and service functions. They often receive
             state or municipal land to develop and sell.

     Box 3-1	 Greater Vancouver Regional District: An evolutionary approach to regional, district-based
              metropolitan planning & management

     The Greater Vancouver Regional Districts (GVRD) was established in 1965; it now encompasses 21 municipalities that make up
     the metropolitan area of Greater Vancouver, an area that is home to 2.1 million people (2005), forecast to reach 2.7 million by
     2021. The GVRD was originally constituted to deliver services most efficiently accomplished at a regional level, namely sewerage,
     drinking water, health/hospitals, and industrial development services. It has added functions over the years, including recycling,
     affordable housing, regional parks, air quality control, labor relations, and emergency communications (911). GVRD’s mandate
     is to cost-effectively deliver utilitiy services at the regional scale, to plan and manage regional growth and development, and to
     protect and enhance the quality of life in the Region. The GVRD’s Board of Directors is the primary decision-making body and
     collective voice in regard to regional development issues. The Board of Directors is comprised of mayors and councilors from the
     member municipalities. Board meetings are held once a month and are usually open to the public.

     The GVRD stresses the involvement and participation of interested members of the general public. Under the umbrella of the
     GVRD, there are four separate legal entities: the GVRD/University of British Columbia (UBC) Joint Committee, the Greater Van-
     couver Water District (GVWD), the Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District (GVS&DD), and the Greater Vancouver
     Housing Corporation (GVHC). In addition, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority (Trans Link) was formed in 1998 as
     a body associated with the GVRD to coordinate and implement transportation plans and services for the movement of people
     and goods in the Region. Trans Link also operates the Air Care program, which aims to improve air quality by reducing harmful
     emissions from automobiles. From 1992 to 2002, the program is credited with reducing air emissions in the urban area by thir-
     ty-five percent. Vancouver has received numerous international awards, and ranks amongst the most livable cities in the world,
     according to premier media, such as, The Economist. Maintaining this quality of life is a significant challenge particularly in the
     face of population pressures, changing demographics, and economic re-structuring, plus demands for housing and employment
     associated with rapid growth.

     In 1990, the GVRD Board produced Creating our Future: Steps to a More Livable Region to respond to challenges facing the region.
     It engaged more than 4,000 residents in a public consultation process. The over 200 issues identified in the process resulted
     in agreement to take 54 actions, incorporated in the Livable Region Strategic Plan introduced in 1996. Importantly, like most
     metropolitan agencies worldwide, the regional strategy advocates development of Regional Towns to minimize urban sprawl,
     commuting, and air pollution.

  Other agencies, the private sector, and residents use the plan to understand and contribute to Greater Vancouver’s vision for its
  future development. It helps all stakeholders “to face in the same direction”.

  To improve metropolitan governance, the GVRD set up the Sustainable Region Initiative Forum. Regular discussion and meetings
  such as sustainability community breakfasts and regional dialogues are organized. In addition, the Greater Vancouver Economic
  Council (GVEC) has been established as the catalyst to deepen high promise industrial clusters and thereby enhance the regional
  economy. An important mandate of the GVEC is to take the lead in attracting investment to the Region through marketing and
  branding. GVEC’s mission is to support development, positioning the Region as the West’s Gateway to Asia and Canada’s “Cre-
  ative City”.

  Much can be learned from the GVRD case. Of note is its evolutionary character. Although originally created to deliver “routine”
  functions such as sewerage, it has steadily added functions over the years as confidence in its role has increased. It does this in
  two ways: (i) internally, e.g., through agencies such as the GVHC, which operates within the GVRD’s institutional framework, and
  (ii) by spinning off entities such as the GVEC. Although it increasingly appears to be a regional government, it denies this role,
  being careful to allow constituent municipalities to maintain their autonomy. Important in this regard is the fact that municipali-
  ties can choose to opt out of any function or service provided by the GVRD. Much of GVRD’s success can be explained by its ability
  to mediate tensions between the British Columbia Provincial Government (Provincial governments are very powerful in Canada)
  and constituent municipal governments.

     83.	 International experience suggests that flexibility of governance arrangements over time is advisable as the
          local and regional circumstances change. The following examples have all had a local metropolitan government
          at some time, but have evolved between different models. (Slack, 2007)

     84.	 Toronto, Canada operated under 13 independent municipalities until 1953, when a two-level system with an
          elected Metro Toronto and six additional independent local governments were established (each level with
          separate functions). In 1995 these seven entities were merged into one local government for the City of Toronto
          (still only representing about 50 percent of the population in the metropolitan area). The changes were made
          to increase effectiveness in service delivery and harmonize service levels across the area, and the provincial
          government played an important role in the institution's evolution.

     85.	 London, UK was governed by a two-level structure from 1964 to 1986, the Greater London Council (GLC)
          and 32 local governments (each with its own mayor and council). In 1986, the GLC was abolished and
          governance of London became the responsibility of central government ministers, using ad hoc arrangements
          for regional planning. Since 2000, London again has a city-wide government with elected members of a
          Greater London Authority (GLA) and since 2002 also a directly elected mayor. GLA is a higher-level strategic
          authority to promote sustainable development and define strategy, particularly for transport, police, economic
          development planning, fire and emergency planning, land use planning, culture, environment, health, and
          coordination of London-wide events. GLA and local governments have little fiscal autonomy; more than 80
          percent of their revenues come from central government grants.

Box 3-2	 New York Metropolitan Region: A legitimized civil society approach to megapolitan planning:
         the pioneering role of the regional planning association

The New York metropolitan region (NYMR) is the most populated urbanized area in the U.S. (2005 U.S. Census Bureau CSA pop.
21.9 million), and based on the UN urban agglomeration classification, the third largest in the world (after Tokyo and Mexico City).
It covers 31 counties of the tri-state New York- New Jersey-Connecticut region encompassing 33,670 sq km. New York City, the
core of the metropolitan region has a population of over 8.1 million with an area of 830 sq km, only 2.5% of the land area of the
metropolis. A global city, New York is known for international finance, fashion, entertainment and culture. New York City itself
has been a metropolitan municipality with a strong mayor-council government since its creation, the product of a consolidation
of a number of autonomous local governments in 1898. The mayor is elected to a four-year term while 51 councilors are elected
to two-year terms, strengthening the power of the mayor.

There is no “official” regional planning organization for the NYMR, but the Regional Plan Association (RPA), as an independent,
not-for-profit regional planning organization is highly influential in planning both the region and its component jurisdictions. It
is the de facto Regional Planning agency for the NYMR, having more power and a more impressive track record than virtually
any metropolitan planning organization in the United States. This civil society based approach to planning in the NYMR is not
regarded as a stepping stone to legal formalization, but a more advanced approach to regional planning based on collaborative
planning, currently in vogue in both governmental and academic circles. Collaborative planning involves bringing representatives
of key interests to the table, governments being only one of the parties involved, although they are expected to legalize most
outcomes of the process (some initiatives can be implemented purely through non-governmental means). The RPA’s de facto
legitimacy and stellar reputation is the product of two factors, its long history, and the high quality of its work. It was established
in 1922.

RPA has played a key role in shaping the Region’s transportation systems, protecting open spaces, and promoting high quality
urban development. The First Regional Plan completed in 1929 set the form for the Region’s growth over the next several decades,
correctly identifying transportation and open space networks as the key levers to shape the Region. The Second Regional Plan in
1968 successfully targeted: (i) restoration of the Region’s deteriorated mass transit system, and (ii) revitalization and strength-
ening of urban centers to make mass transportation more viable, preserve natural resources, and create areas of high urban
intensity within the vast Region. The Third Plan, in 1996, A Region at Risk, addressed the Region’s extreme fiscal problems. In the
post 9/11 period, RPA has been involved in the redevelopment of lower Manhattan, seriously damaged by the terrorist attacks, as
well as strengthening disadvantaged communities such as East Harlem, through community based activities.

As well as being a world-class regional research and planning organization, RPA has considerable strengths as an advocacy
organization, an educational and awareness agency (working with local governments, communities, and the public), the lat-
ter strengthened by partnerships such as with the Institute on Community Design at Princeton University. One of the greatest
strengths of the RPA is its links with leading US professional groups such as the American Institute of Architects (AIA), the Amer-
ican Institute of Planners (AIP), and the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA). Strong professional connections
enable the RPA to access some of the best talent in city building, at affordable rates, or even on a voluntary basis.

RPA always takes an interdisciplinary perspective that integrates economic development (competitiveness), human resources
and the human condition, land use, transportation, and environmental and design expertise. To implement, RPA’s main strategy
is to build an alliance of various stakeholders, including local governments, interest groups (e.g., environmental), professional
groups, and the business community. Given the enormous power of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, RPA has long
worked closely with them, using the Authority as a lever to shape the Region.

           many local functions, with a council of the City mayor and four councilors from each local government. The
           mayor of the City was indirectly elected by the ten mayors. This system functioned for over 20 years, but the
           local governments were constrained by the national government in carrying out some functions, and the City
           had little influence over its finances. National government collected property taxes and remitted them to the
           local governments which then paid (often delayed) a portion to the City. (Stren, 2007) In 2001, the City of
           Abidjan was replaced by a Regional Government, or “District” of Abidjan. The post of City Mayor was replaced
           by a District Governor appointed by the President of the country. The original ten local governments were
           maintained and three suburban jurisdictions and some rural areas were added.

          with eleven councils, through a stage with one Metro Council plus four subordinated Local Councils, to the
          current one single-level city government covering the main part of the metropolitan area. It has been innovative
          in shaping its internal governance by issuing management contracts for water and sanitation services;
          corporatizing road and solid waste functions; and moving to private management of its real estate.

     Regional Government Established by a Provincial or National Government

     88.	 Metropolitan governance reforms have rarely emerged purely from local government initiatives; rather, a
          national or provincial government has usually either imposed or encouraged it (OECD 2006).

     89.	 Portland, Oregon, USA. Initially Portland had a COG/planning authority for primarily land use management. It
          took on additional functions, and eventually was elevated to a directly elected regional government established
          by the Oregon State Government. It may now levy property, sales, and income taxes, and issue Metro bonds
          for investments.

     90.	 Verband Region Stuttgart, Germany was created by the Baden-Wurtenberg state government in 1993 as a
          directly elected higher-level metropolitan entity for an area with 179 local governments. Its main responsibility
          at present is serving as a public transport authority. For its broader purposes it has become fairly weak, in
          large part because it has no authority to levy taxes or user charges. Its funding is derived about equally from
          local government contributions and the state government. (OECD 2006)

     91.	 Metro Nairobi, Kenya (a different approach). A Ministry of Nairobi Metropolitan Development was established
          in 2008 by presidential decree to facilitate implementation of a development strategy for this, extremely large

3.4.8	 Consolidated local government: city examples

     92.	 Annexation or amalgamation of jurisdictions may sometimes be the most effective approach to achieve
          needed scale and equity in public service provision. Yet, this tends to be the most politically controversial,
          usually requiring active involvement of a national or provincial government. Few amalgamations have
          achieved coverage of an entire metropolitan area. However, in those cases where local governments do indeed
          cover their economic region, coordination is less challenging in terms of institutional complexity. However,
          allocation of resources and services to the residents across the area still often presents challenges.

           subordinated district and county governments. Districts are the more urban ones, and counties the more rural
           ones. Coordination is often still challenging due to counties being quite independently governed; an example
           where political economy and legacy may influence how an area is functioning in practice. In this case, the
           municipal government tend to limit its involvement with how the county governments run their affairs in order
           not to interfere with how they meet their performance targets.

3.4.9	 Large infrastructure projects: special situations

      98.	 Managing and funding infrastructure projects that benefit various local jurisdictions needs special

           and maintain the assets. A higher tier government often has a key role to play, as exemplified below.

3.4.10	 Lessons learned and policy implications

    101.	 Lessons from international experience in metropolitan management for Malaysian policy makers include the
          following:

              »» When the population of one local government is dominant in a metro area, this tends to be an additional
                 challenge for achieving joint actions (e.g. Nairobi, Sao Paolo, Paris). Care should be taken so that each of
                 the jurisdictions is able to voice its needs.

              »» Few cities cover their entire metropolitan area. While having one local government covering most of its
                 metro area may facilitate coordination, government accountability and accessibility by residents may
                 suffer; and area-wide coordination may still be a challenge (South Africa, China).

              »» Evolution from one model to another is not uncommon as local and regional circumstances change and
                 learning takes place (London, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Portland, Toronto).

              »» Active involvement of a higher level government is often required to ensure arrangements for reasonable
                 coordination of public services and area-wide development (Abidjan, Manila, Stuttgart, Toronto).
                 However, metropolitan arrangements created in a “top-down” manner by a provincial or national
                 government will often be weak unless they are actively supported by the area local governments (Dar es
                 Salaam, Stuttgart).

              »» Cost savings is often an argument for amalgamation or annexation. However, as the case of Toronto has
                 shown, by unifying salaries and services across the earlier local government areas, the overall costs may
                 go up.

    102.	 The implications for policy and practice in a particular metropolitan area include:

              »» Determine where are the largest gains from joint or coordinated actions (“differences which would make a
                 difference”).

              »» Engage stakeholders thoroughly.

              »» Find a balance between achieving efficiency and social equity, and ensuring voice and accountability.

    103.	 Given the large number of agencies at various levels that already exist in the Malaysian context, creating
          new government bodies (e.g. London, Nairobi) may simply add to the complexity, making coordination even
          more difficult. Consolidation of local governments (e.g. Cape Town, Istanbul, Chinese cities) may work in
          the case of smaller conurbations. Systems by which local governments can coordinate on individual services
          (e.g. transportation planning in US metro areas) or metropolitan-scale investments (Madrid, Washington),
          or flexible, voluntary arrangements as in Bologna, Italy, could benefit Malaysian metro areas without the
          disruption of creating new agencies or consolidating jurisdictions. These could be encouraged by the national
          or state governments by linking metropolitan coordination with funding opportunities. Such arrangements
          could gradually formalize and take on more re sponsibilities over time, as in Greater Vancouver. Lastly, support
          for long-term strategic planning at the metropolitan scale, separate from day-to-day urban service delivery,
          provided by a non-governmental organization (e.g. RPA in New York) could help guide local governments act
          in a more coordinated manner.

Box 3-3	 Seoul Metropolitan Government: Leadership from the metropolitan core

The Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) constitutes the core of the Seoul Metropolitan Region (SMR), the latter a megapolitan area
containing 48% of South Korea’s population (23 million). The SMR typifies extended urban regions in East Asia, it is nineteen
times as large in area as the SMA, with an area of 11,773 square kilometers. Over time, an increasing proportion of the SMR’s
population lives outside the SMA; in part because SMA’s area has been extended only slightly between 1963 and 2004 (from 595
to 605 sq. kms.), combined with the fact that the population of the SMA peaked in 1992 at 11 million, declining to 10.3 million by
2004 through suburbanization and peri-urbanization processes.

Within the SMA, the city’s efficiency has been increased substantially through the establishment of public corporations, e.g., the
Seoul Metro Corporation and the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation, which are responsible for 9 subway lines, the
Seoul Housing Corporation responsible for low income housing, and the Seoul Metropolitan Facilities Management Corporation,
responsible for car-only roads and parking facilities. The SMG is now focused on quality of life, given that efficiency objectives
have largely been achieved. This shift is described as a shift from a growth oriented (quantitative) model to a growth management
(quality) model. The latter includes restoration of historic, cultural, and natural environments. Related to the latter, Seoul has
attracted global attention by restoring Cheonggyechon Stream which runs through the heart of the city. This has involved removal
of an expressway (that covered it) – a cost deemed acceptable, given the shifting values of increasingly wealthy SMA residents.

Megapolitan governance is based on three tiers: the SMR, SMG and the Districts. Typical of extended urban regions such as Bang-
kok and Toronto, the SMR has limited powers, especially in terms of service delivery. The national government takes the lead in
economic, demographic, and spatial planning for the SMR, through the Capital Region Management Committee, chaired by the
Prime Minister. At present, the second Capital Region Management Plan 1997-2011, based on the Capital Region Management
Act of 1982, establishes basic parameters for the region, e.g., land use and urban form (promoting a multi-nuclei structure),
industrial distribution, and national government capital investments. The twenty-five Autonomous Districts undertake their own
locally derived projects under a certain scale (e.g., roads less than 20 meters wide, sewage pipes under 900 mm), plus those
commissioned by the SMG. The mayor of each District is also elected.

Cooperation between the SMG and surrounding jurisdictions has resulted in positive outcomes, e.g., the establishment of the
Capital Region Transport Association, which co-ordinates 397 bus routes carrying 8.8 million riders daily in Seoul, Gyonggi and
Inchon. Of particular note is the initiative to improve water quality in the Han River, which flows through Seoul. The Committee
for the Management of the Han River Water Quality allocates zero costs to the two furthest upstream jurisdictions (Gangwon,
Chungchung), whereas downstream communities share the vast majority of costs, aided by a matching grant from the Korea
Water Resources Corporation. In effect, the downstream communities provide upstream jurisdictions with a subsidy for perform-
ing environmental services.

From 1998 to 2001, SMG implemented a series of reforms such as the citizen evaluation system, online procedures to handle civil
service applications (the open system), and performance based budgeting. The reforms were implemented immediately after the
East Asian financial crisis of 1997, when people were receptive to change. The citizen evaluation system (requiring quick internet
response from the responsible official) and anti-corruption index were recognized as “the most valuable reform” by the Presiden-
tial Commission on Governmental Innovation in Korea.

Metropolitan Seoul indicates that even when the metropolitan area cannot be expanded to keep up with peripheral population
expansion and movement of population to suburban and peri-urban areas, coordination of development can be successful. In the
Seoul case this coordination was catalyzed by the national government.

3.5	 Mayor’s Wedge Analysis for Greater KL/KV PBTs

Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) and Ampang Jaya Municipal Council (MPAJ)
Summary

     104.	 Local authorities (PBTs)21, the unit of institutional analysis for city governments in Malaysia, appear to have a
           very limited direct role in impacting the competitiveness of their city. Cities worldwide have different degrees
           of influence in such economic development activities, which relate to both intergovernmental structures and
           the involvement of stakeholders at the city level. Throughout Malaysia, economic development initiatives are
           carried out by national agencies, state-level agencies and regional corridor authorities. In addition, in several
           city-level functions—such as infrastructure and land use and planning—operations and decision-making are
           spread across levels of government, with limited local government influence. Both Kuala Lumpur City Hall
           (DBKL) and Ampang Jaya Municipal Council (MPAJ) function as local authorities throughout the country, with
           DBKL under the Ministry of Federal Territories, and MPAJ under the Selangor state government.

     105.	 The national government has led the targeting of proactive economic interventions in the Greater KL/KV
           metro area, identifying is as one of its National Key Economic Areas (NKEA) and as part of its Economic
           Transformation Programme (ETP). This has seen various government agencies tasked to carry out the entry
           point projects (EPPs) to fulfill the 2020 vision for Kuala Lumpur. DBKL and MPAJ’s roles in these initiatives are
           limited to areas outside of economic development. Investment attraction and talent formation and attraction
           are carried out by national agencies, while the city governments have a role for revitalizing the area along the
           Klang River, greening the city and developing a pedestrian network.

     106.	 Cities worldwide provide different approaches and institutional typologies for tackling the most pressing policy
           issues of their city or metropolitan area. Seoul and Los Angeles led reforms to reduce automobile congestion
           and increase public transport use, and in Seoul’s case, revitalize urban areas. Manchester’s success has earned
           it more responsibilities from an otherwise very centralized U.K. central government. The Manchester Combined
           Authority also offers a successful example of government collaboration within a metropolitan area.

     107.	 This institutional analysis of DBKL and MPAJ identifies the limited role of city government in economic
           development and service delivery overall, and it also presents the myriad of institutions at the national and
           state level that coordinate service delivery in cities. The complexity that arises from this arrangement is being
           addressed by the Malaysian government, which has done this by creating national agencies around certain
           government functions and to oversee performance.22 However, it may be the case that greater centralization
           only increases the current institutional complexity. Cities coordinate and carry out services for both national
           and state government bodies, and designated national level agencies such as SPAD, InvestKL, and Talent Corp.

3.5.1	 The Mayor’s wedge framework: a standardized framework for city governments

     108.	 As a starting point on implementation, the “mayor’s wedge” is defined as the “range of interventions that city
           leaders can influence, compared to those that are predetermined by higher levels of government” (Competitive
           Cities Knowledge Base Concept Note). The mayor’s wedge framework is being developed as standardized
           approach to measuring the role of city governments worldwide, with a particular emphasis on a city’s role
           in economic development. The city government role is framed through the city’s scope—government powers,

 	 Local governments, pihak berkuasa tempatan (PBT) in Malay, are commonly referred to as PBTs.
21

 	 PEMANDU, the national delivery unit, is the most obvious example, but the creation of the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) for
22

   all levels of government also attests to this.


                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                       Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  107 
           functions and funding—and capacity—the financial (systems and processes) and technical (staff expertise)
           ability to perform its functions.

   109.	 The framework includes city scope components of institutional and economic development context, functional
         assignments, budget and staffing discretion and expenditures, revenue discretion and politics. A city’s capacity
         is further disaggregated in terms of human resource management; public financial management; controlling
         corruption; and building “growth coalitions”. While these are the standardized components, certain scope
         components such as the political system, and capacity components have not been applied here to the context
         of the Greater Kuala Lumpur/Klang Valley area governments. Figure 3-2 below is a visualization of the mayor’s
         wedge framework.


                       Figure 3 2: The Mayor’s Wedge Framework (scope and capacity)




    110.	 For the Greater Kuala Lumpur/Klang Valley (Greater KL/KV) metropolitan area, the objective is to identify
          the role of public sector institutions in creating an enabling environment for economic development, and
          distinguish which of those institutions are at the city or local level as compared to other levels of government.
          While the mayor’s wedge identifies the role of the city government in particular, it expands to include those
          public sector actors that carry out economic development if these functions are beyond the city’s administrative
          remit. Additionally, it is often city actors from the private sector or other stakeholder groups either working
          with, or in place of, the city government in leading proactive economic development initiatives. The following
          is the mayor’s wedge analysis of the Greater KL/KV metropolitan area local governments of Kuala Lumpur
          City Hall (Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur - DBKL) and Ampang Jaya Municipal Council (Majlis Perbandaran
          Ampang Jaya - MPAJ).

3.5.2	 Overview: Greater Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley PBTs

    111.	 Greater Kuala Lumpur/Klang Valley is composed of 10 local governments, including three city councils and
          seven municipal councils—these are listed in the graphic below (along with their population) (Ministry of


108 Annexes
             Federal Territories).23 Greater KL/KV is within Selangor State; however the Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya are
             autonomous federal territories, administered by the Ministry of Federal Territories. Federal territories are
             administered as local governments, and have almost all of the attributes of PBTs, but differ in that they report
             directly to the national government24, namely to the Ministry of Federal Territories.



                                  Figure 3-3: Greater Kuala Lumpur/Klang Valley PBTs25




     112.	 While Greater KL/KV has no overarching governance structure for the entire metropolitan area, the territory’s
           inclusion as a National Key Economic Area (NKEA) outlines several metro area-wide priorities in investment
           attraction, mass public transportation, and urban regeneration and livability.26 The National Key Economic
           Areas are part of the national government’s “national transformation program” (NTP)—composed of a
           “government transformation program” (GTP) and “economic transformation program” (ETP). The Greater KL/
           KV NKEA initiatives, as noted in the ETP Annual Report (2013), are led by the Ministry of Federal Territories
           and involve several government agencies and private sector firms. The report states that the NKEA “involves
           the efforts of more than 40 Government agencies and private sector firms to transform the Greater KL/Klang
           Valley region into a vibrant, world-class hub for residents and visitors alike to live, work and play (ETP Annual
           Report 2013: 42).”27

   	 The metropolitan area has a total population of about 5.7 million (2010).

                                                                                          Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  109 
3.5.3	 Malaysia’s intergovernmental environment

        113.	 A review of Malaysia’s broad governance environment illustrates that while the country has a federal structure,
              it is highly centralized. The federal and state governments in Malaysia retain the majority of government
              resources and decision-making powers. Furthermore, local government bodies must seek the approval of their
              respective states28 to carry out several of the functions that they are assigned.

Mayor’s wedge typologies – Malaysia, South Africa and Indonesia

       114.	 Malaysian cities may have either of two types of government administration: city halls/councils for large
             urban centers and municipal councils for large towns. Cities fall in either of the two tiers depending on a
             combination of population, revenue and economic output criteria (CLGF 2013: 90-91). Other countries, such
             as South Africa and the Indonesia, also have several local government types—South Africa has metropolitan,
             district and local municipalities, and Indonesia has cities and districts (Smoke 2013: 61). South Africa follows
             a model of devolution, with city governments wielding more influence over policy levers and being answerable
             to their constituents as opposed to higher tiers of government (Smoke 2013: 60). Indonesia has moved from
             deconcentration to provinces to devolution to cities (Smoke 2013: 62). The chart below compares aspects
             of the mayor’s wedge for South Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia, discussing decentralization context, policy
             levers and revenue raising power. Essentially, the countries fall into three typologies, with South Africa having
             an enlarged mayor’s wedge, Malaysia a constrained mayor’s wedge, and Indonesia falling somewhere in the
             middle.

City government spending, budgeting and staffing discretion

     115.	 Proxies for decentralization to city governments include both the degree to which cities are involved in resource
           mobilization (this includes local taxation), on the revenue side, and the breadth and depth of their service
           delivery responsibilities, on the expenditure side (Frank 2014). At the aggregate level, local government
           spending in Malaysia is rather low as a percentage of total government spending—it stands at less than 5
           percent (UCLG 2011: 87). The aggregate local government spending in South Africa stands at 17.4 percent,
           although metropolitan cities account for 57 percent of municipal spending (UCLG 2011: 336) (Smoke 2013:
           66). Indonesia local government spending is 28 percent as a share of total government spending, and 80
           percent of this spending comes from cities and districts (UCLG 2011: 87) (Smoke 2013: 66).

     116.	 While Kuala Lumpur City Hall is able to prepare its own budget, it is not able to determine the overall allocations
           for either its development (capital) expenditures or its operational expenditures. The Economic Planning Unit
           sets DBKL’s development expenditures, while the Ministry of Finance determines its operational expenditures.
           DBKL’s budget is approved by the Ministry of Federal Territories. Likewise, MPAJ’s budget is approved by the
           Selangor State Government. Both DBKL and MPAJ are able to increase their budget spending by borrowing from
           the state and/or national government, pending higher-level government approval.30 In addition to DBKL and
           MPAJ having little influence over development expenditures, development expenditures are not adequately
           aligned with operational expenditures. Thus, PBTs often do not have the necessary increases in operational
           expenditure financing in order to account for development expenditures.

     117.	 Malaysian cities have a two-tier civil service, with seconded staff from the federal civil service and local civil
           service staff. Federal civil service staff is paid for and controlled by the federal government, and the local
           staff is paid from the city budget—this applies to all Malaysian local authorities, thus to both DBKL and MPAJ.
           However, even for staff paid for from the city budget, staff numbers must be approved by the Public Service
           Commission (PSC), and also the relevant higher tier of government. For DBKL, appointments to the civil service
           and the creation of new positions must be approved by the PSC and then by the Ministry of Federal Territories.
           This is similar in the case of the MPAJ, except that, appointments and the creation of new positions must be
           approved by the PSC and then the Selangor State Government. The National Institute of Public Administration,
           an extension of the Public Service Commission, is responsible for the training of all local government staff in
           Malaysia. South African municipalities develop their own budgets, which are approved at the municipal council
           level. Budgets and hiring are subject to relevant laws and regulations (Smoke 2013: 76). In Indonesia, cities
           initially had more autonomy in both budgets and the civil service; however, recent legislation has increased
           higher-level government control over budgeting and decisions on the civil service (Smoke 2013: 76).

Revenue discretion

     118.	 Malaysian city governments have a limited role in resource mobilization, and similar to expenditure
           assignments, there is a dependency relationship of cities to higher tier governments. As shown in Table 312,
           Malaysia is relatively more constrained in its revenue discretion than both South Africa and Indonesia. Tax
           collection in the Kuala Lumpur jurisdiction is collected by DBKL and the Ministry of Federal territories—
           DBKL collects the property assessment tax, while the Ministry collects the quit rent property tax. No other
           taxes, besides the assessment property tax, are raised or administered by the city government, or any city
           government in Malaysia. MPAJ collects the property assessment in Ampang Jaya while the Selangor State
           Government collects rent. While city governments formally have the ability to request to set a new tax rate, in
           practice these requests are always rejected. Tax rates have not been reassessed in the country for decades.
           The inefficiencies of the property tax system ultimately constrain the own-source revenues of DBKL and MPAJ,
           which depend heavily on the collection of property taxes.



 	 DBKL must seek approval from the Ministry of Federal Territories, while MPAJ must receive Selangor State Government approval.

                                                                                       Malaysia: Achieving a System of Competitive Cities  111 
     119.	 Local government revenue, as a percentage of total government revenue, is very low in the country, at less
           than 1 percent (UCLG 2011: 87). This would suggest that most expenditure for cities do not go through the city
           government budget, but are financed by higher tiers of government. DBKL’s rather low revenue is made up of
           90 percent own source revenues (of which 70 percent come from property taxes, and 20 percent from user
           fees), and 10 percent intergovernmental transfers.

3.5.4	 Economic development strategy

     120.	 The National Key Economic Area for Greater KL/KV is the only one with a geographic as opposed to an industry
           focus31, and this is due to the particular role that cities play in shaping and driving economic development
           (Economic Transformation Programme 2010: 125). The NKEA functions like the economic development strategy
           for the city, identifying economic dynamism and livability goals to be achieved by 2020. As aforementioned,
           these goals are implemented through the entry point projects (EPPs), of which there are nine for the Greater
           KL/KV NKEA.

     121.	 Several national government agencies are responsible for economic policymaking32 on Greater KL/KV, and
           this includes the Economic Planning Unit (EPU), the Performance Management Delivery Unit (PEMANDU), the
           Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Malaysian Investment
           Development Authority (MIDA) and InvestKL (which is under the purview of MITI, PEMANDU and the Ministry
           of Federal Territories). In terms of the implementation of the Greater KL/KV NKEA, responsibility is shared by
           InvestKL and TalentCorp on attracting investment and talent, while DBKL and other area local governments
           have roles in urban regeneration and beautification (ETP Annual Report 2013).

Implementing economic development

     122.	 Malaysia focuses on economic development through focusing on general business environment improvements,
           targeting specific sectors and prioritizing inventions. The Greater KL/KV NKEA targets the following priority
           economic sectors: financial services, business services, education, tourism and retail.33 InvestKL was
           established in 2011 with the mandate to attract 100 multinational corporations (MNCs)—in the priority
           sectors—to set up regional headquarters in Greater KL/KV by 2020. InvestKL works closely with Talentcorp,
           the main implementing body of the EPP on attracting external and internal talent, so that it can offer talent
           with specialized skills for targeted new services industries and for commodities-based industries. Talentcorp
           works to build a local ecosystem in order to create a large number of jobs, develop a talent attraction program,
           attracting skilled and qualified Malaysians living abroad, and retain foreign talent currently residing in
           Malaysia (ETP Annual Report 2013: 28-29).

     123.	 A recent report by Brookings analyzed unemployment of youth and teen adults in the U.S.’s 100 largest
           metropolitan areas, recognized worsening job prospects from 2000 to 2011 (2014). This of course is an issue
           among cities worldwide, and one Kuala Lumpur is facing as it looks to build talent to support its labor market
           demand. Box 3-4 presents the main recommendations from the Brookings report.



31
  	 Malaysia’s NKEAs include: Greater KL/KV, Oil, Gas and Energy, Financial Services, Wholesale and Retail, Palm Oil and Rubber, Tourism,
     Electrical and Electronics, Business Services, Communications Content and Infrastructure, Education, Agriculture, Healthcare (ETP Annual
     Report 2013).
32
  	 This includes economic strategies and planning, investment promotions, investment incentives, and monitoring of economic strategies.

   	 Combined, they contributed to 41% of Greater KL/KV’s GNI in 2009


112 Annexes
124.	 DBKL and the other local governments of Greater KL/KV appear to have a limited, or perhaps indirect, role in
      economic development. According to the NKEA, DBKL’s Physical Planning Department drives the planning and
      implementation of beautification works on the Klang-Gombak River (EPP 5). Additionally, DBKL’s Economic
      Planning and Development Coordination Department will make recommendations on the development of the
      land along the river corridor. Ampang Jaya Municipal Council (MPAJ) is tasked with and has reduced oil and
      grease levels along the portion of the river that falls under its jurisdiction. DBKL leads EPP 6 on a greener Kuala
      Lumpur, planting and maintaining trees and attempting to increase participation of public and private sector
      companies in the overall greening effort. DBKL also leads the efforts on identify iconic city attractions (EPP 7)
      as well as improving pedestrian connectivity (EPP 8) (ETP Annual Report 2013: 33-39).

  Box 3-4	 Selected recommendations for teen and young adult unemployment in U.S. cities

  Enrich high school and college education with work-based learning opportunities and expand apprenticeships
  ›› Work-based learning provides a practical and applied setting for students to learn employability skills (e.g. problem-solving,
     communication), highlight the relevance of education, and provide students networks to employers and employment that they
     would otherwise not be able to access.
  ›› Examples:
     •	 The Christo Rey Network of high schools places students in “work-study” programs during their academic year.
     •	 U.S. States Wisconsin and Georgia have created youth apprenticeship programs for their high school students, linking
        together high schools, businesses and community colleges.

  Link high schools to post-secondary education
  ›› About two-thirds of 24 to 29 year olds do not have either two or four year post-secondary education credentials. Dual enroll-
     ment and early college programs allow students to take college classes in high school, and increase the likelihood that they
     will continue on to college.
  ›› Examples:
     •	 Launched in 2002, the Early College High School Initiative has created and modified 240 high schools nationwide to blend
        high school and college into one rigorous program.
     •	 North Carolina’s Career and College Promise program creates several alternatives for high school students to earn college
        credit, also including paths to transfer to four-year degree programs.

  Increase the emphasis on career and technical education, career counseling and job placement
  ›› This refers to better preparing and planning for high school students to directly start in the entry-level workforce, such as
     through attaining the necessary workplace skills in high school.
  ›› Examples:
     •	 Jobs for America’s Graduates (JAG) provides students at risk of dropping out with help to graduate from high school, enroll
        in post secondary education, and/or find a job.
     •	 Year Up, a program in 12 cities across the United States, provides training on information technology skills and college
        credits to young adults ages 18-24.

  Provide those who have dropped out opportunities to get a high school diploma and access to post-secondary education
  ›› Example:
    •	 Gateway to College programs are found at community colleges around the U.S. work with young adults ages 16-21, to help
       them earn a diploma and/or college credits, while providing a very supportive environment.

3.5.5	 City service delivery

    125.	 Service provision in Malaysia is largely held at the federal government level and this is exclusively the case on
          areas such as general administration (policing, criminal justice), education (pre-school to higher education), and
          health (primary care and hospitals) (CLGF 2013: 92). Service areas including urban transport and housing and
          urban planning have greater involvement of city administrations; economic planning (strategies, investment
          promotion, investment incentives and monitoring) falls entirely outside of the city government’s scope (CLGF
          2013: 92). There are differences between DBKL and MPAJ, however, as DBKL shares its responsibilities with
          federal agencies—particularly the Ministry of Federal Territories—and MPAJ shares responsibilities both with
          federal and Selangor state government agencies.

    126.	 The federal government united public transportation under one roof in 2010, by creating the Land Public
          Transport Commission (SPAD). SPAD comes directly under the purview of the Prime Minister and designs the
          policies, planning and regulating of all aspects of train, bus and taxi services, as well as road and rail-based


114 Annexes
             freight transport (SPAD).34 SPAD designs policy and planning for bus network and stations, rail network and
             stations, taxis and other land transport for the DBKL and MPAJ jurisdictions. It is also responsible for the NKEA
             priorities on a High Speed Rail to connect Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, and on coordinating with Mass Rapid
             Transit (MRT) Corp (created in 2011) in order to integrate existing rail networks and transit and develop a new
             MRT system for Greater KL/KV.

     127.	    One of Kuala Lumpur’s transportation issues is the emphasis on automobile use as opposed to mass transit.
             Besides the implications this has on traffic congestion and the environment, this underutilizes the effects of
             agglomeration at the city level and the economic benefits created by dense urban networks. Box 3-5 describes
             the experiences of Los Angeles and Seoul in addressing the challenges caused by extensive car use, and
             increasing urban density.

     128.	 While not applicable to Greater KL/KV, Malaysia has elsewhere in the country established Regional Corridor
           authorities, such as with the Iskandar Development Region (IRDA) authority. The box below discusses the
           Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), which has been successful in uniting several service delivery
           functions under one institution while streamlining as opposed to adding complexity to governance arrangements.
           The GMCA in many ways is moving towards the Greater London Authority in assuming more strategic functions
           for its metropolitan area (Wilcox et. al. 2014). Cities receiving more authority—if they can “prove their worth”—
           remains a novel concept for the United Kingdom, as the U.K. is considered “one of the most centralized OECD
           countries” (BBC 27 January 2014) (Wilcox et. al. 2014: 2)35. Indeed, Manchester ranks among the “least powerful”
           cities in the European Union index of city power, scoring low in several indicators similar to those included in this
           mayor’s wedge framework (European Union 2007: A5).36

  	 The European Union’s index of city power is a weighted index based on: city population (2001), administrative structure, expenditure per

  Box 3-5	 Polycentricity and public transport: Los Angeles and Seoul

  What do Los Angeles and Seoul have in common? Both cities are world leaders in population density, and density takes a
  polycentric form in the two cities—increasing the likelihood of driving and automobile dependency, as opposed to transit use.
  Residents are forced to visit multiple locations to run multiple errands, as opposed to accomplishing multiple errands at a single
  location (Rand 2008: xxxiii).

  Los Angeles was built around the car, offering a stark contrast to U.S. cities like New York and Chicago, which had much more
  concentrated urban density. However, while Los Angeles has an identity for sprawling development, it is quite densely populated
  at the regional level. The cities’ surrounding suburbs are much denser than those of other cities. Compounding this issue for
  Los Angeles, a 2007 study found that jobs in the region are decentralizing over time, with employment clusters increasing by
  10-15% from 1980 and 2000, and jobs in downtown Los Angeles decreasing by 20% during the same time period (Rand 2008:
  63). Figure 34 below presents the density of jobs versus parking spaces per job (among central business districts of major world
  cities), to reinforce the argument that “A big reason Angelenos drive everywhere is that they can park everywhere, generally free”
  (Rand 2008: 74). Figure 35 looks at the relationship between high-speed transit and population per square mile, suggesting a
  positive relationship between dense metropolitan regions and high-speed transit options and that Los Angeles may be lagging in
  this regard (Rand 2008: 70).


                                  Figure 3-4: Density compared to two transit factors
                 (a) Density of Jobs versus Parking Spaces per Job (Central business districts of major world cities);
                          (b) Population Density and High Speed Transit Density (Major U.S. Metro Areas)




  Tackling these issues requires that Los Angeles continue to employ a combination of strategies, which include land-use reforms
  related to zoning, density, parking supply and the mixing of uses, and major infrastructure investments to improve transit options
  (Rand 2008: xx). Los Angeles has employed significant capital investments in infrastructure in the last few years, pursuing devel-
  opment along new transit options. Metro Rapid, the city’s BRT line, has achieved success in ridership along its corridor, but is yet
  to attract major corridor development. The LA Metro Gold Line, however, has seen strong developer interest and is increasingly
  a destination for future housing and mixed-use development (TCRP 2004: 430-434). The city will need to continue to connect
  major employment clusters to the rapid transit network and improve intermodal connections between light rail, subway and bus,
  and at the same time re-zone areas around transit stops for increased development (CTOD 2010: 61) (TCRP 2004: 434).

     Box 3-5	 Continued

     Seoul experienced rapid economic growth and urbanization in the second half of the 20th century, going from a population of 1.6
     million in 1955 to 10.6 million in 1990. The number of registered cars in the city also substantially increased, from 27,000 in
     1967 to 2.9 million in 2008. Decentralization efforts from 1990 to 2005 sought to reduce the population increase, and relieve
     the city of its problems of overconcentration (Kim & Han 2011: 146-147). Korea adopted a national government act, the Capital
     Region Readjustment plan, which limited the establishment of new factories and new universities in the Capital Region and
     promoted the building of urban sub-centers (Kim & Han 2011: 147). In terms of the latter, 26 new towns were built in the Seoul
     Metropolitan Area in the last three decades, increasing the usage of cars and demand for highway infrastructure (World Bank
     2013: 64). Seoul has a road network of 8093 km as of 2008, and its subway network coverers 64.4% of its territory (Kim & Han
     2011: 147). Notwithstanding the extensive public transit network, job concentration in districts throughout the Seoul region, and
     excessive development around Seoul, led to long distance commuting and increased car usage, causing traffic congestion and
     pollution (Kim & Han 2011: 152).

     Mayor Myung-bak Lee, Seoul mayor from 2002-2006, sought to “make a city where people come first, not cars” (World Bank
     2013: 66). His administration did this by removing highways in the city center, and regenerating the areas for public use. Seoul
     also encouraged households to settle in the central city and redevelopment districts, reversing the flow of residents to Seoul’s
     outskirts and beyond. The city offered transit options to offset the decreased roadway capacity, partly by extending subway lines
     and, more importantly, opening seven new lines for median-lane buses (as part of its BRT network) (World Bank 2013: 66-67).
     Bus operating speeds in the city have nearly doubled as a result, reaching 21 kilometers per hour. BRT buses have been more
     reliable than those on nonexclusive lanes (in terms of traffic time variation) and ridership on BRT buses increased 60% faster
     than that for non-BRT buses (from 2004 to 2005). Other significant transit transformations included introducing a semi-public
     transit organization to enforce rules and standards on bus routes, schedules and private operating practices. A smart fare card
     was introduced to allow for integrated bus-rail fares and efficient distance-based pricing (World Bank 2013: 68).

     Land markets responded to the BRT investments, intensifying land uses along BRT corridors and mainly converting single-family
     residences to multi-family units and mixed-use projects. Land price premiums were observed within 300 meters of BRT stops and
     prices as well as development increased along high-amenity corridors. The concentration of high-value-added industries, employ-
     ing a “creative class”, increased in the converted areas and the “freeway-to-greenway” initiatives reflected indirect environment
     benefits (World Bank 2013: 68-69).

  Box 3-6	 Greater Manchester Combined Authority

  Manchester is emerging as a viable alternative to London in the areas of services, culture and arts (European Union 2007: 65).
  The city is famously known as one of the main trade centers of the Industrial Revolution, becoming home to a thriving textile
  economy and then one based on heavy industry in the 1970s. The city faced decline in both textiles and heavy industry, but
  experienced resurgence thanks to significant public and private investment, council leadership and, importantly, the close collab-
  oration of the metropolitan area’s ten local authorities. This collaboration has undergone several iterations, first as a city region
  and most recently as a combined authority. While it has endured and been relatively successful, regional coordination has had a
  number of difficulties including appearing overly complex (and difficult to engage with) to the public, and political disagreements
  between different local authority councils stalling joint decisions and initiatives (World Bank 2008).

  The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) was established in 2011 to cover ten local authorities (see the figure
  below on Greater Manchester). The GMCA works with its constituent authorities in a set of powers and responsibilities in eco-
  nomic development and transport. This includes for example developing a Greater Manchester Strategy, an economic strategy,
  and establishing Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) as GMCA’s executive body with respect to transport functions (Smith
  July 2012). The GMCA, TfGM and other Greater Manchester institutions have clearly defined roles that are based on agreements
  between the area local authorities. Notable achievements for GMCA include: major refurbishment of the Bolton and Rochdale
  railway stations as part a city region transport investment program; raising an annual “Revolving Infrastructure Fund” worth £30
  million and permission for the building of up to 7,000 new homes by 2017. It is also a testament to the GMCA’s success that
  London-style powers are now being recommended to Manchester, as the first U.K. city to follow London’s regional government
  model (Wilcox et. al. 2014: 11).

Regional authority typologies for local service provision in the UK

The United Kingdom has recently instituted two programs of regional coordination, uniting local governments in regions
around certain service delivery functions. There are 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) that cover all English local
authorities. LEPs are meant to provide strategic leadership in local economic priorities. Figure 3-6 shows the geography
of the 39 LEPs. As a more formal alternative, Combined Authorities are legal bodies that can be set up by two or more
contiguous local authorities. The box below presents the two institutional alternatives.




118 Annexes
  Box 3-7	 Regional arrangements for local authorities in the UK

  Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) were created in                           Figure 3-6: LEPs in the UK
  2010, in order to “provide the strategic leadership in their
  areas to set out local economic priorities” and “create the
  right environment for business and growth” (Bolton June
  2012). LEPs are informal structures governed by a board
  of volunteers, which includes a private sector chair and
  members from local authorities, business based in the LEP
  area, public bodies including universities and third sector
  representatives. LEPs now receive grant funding by the
  central government in order to identify and carry out their
  objectives. Figure 3-6, to the right, represents the 39 local
  enterprise partnerships (Bolton June 2012).

  Combined authorities are formal regional bodies encom-
  passing two or more local authorities (and usually coincid-
  ing with a natural economic area) that wish to collaborate
  closely on economic development and transport-related
  initiatives. Combined authorities are assigned functions
  by their constituent local authorities, in the areas of eco-
  nomic development, regeneration and integrated public
  transport. Among the intended benefits of such structures
  are: improved alignment, coordination and delivery of
  economic development and transport-related initiatives,
  as well as a means of steering significant streams of work (Smith July 2012). According to the Centre for Cities, the combined
  authorities are an effective route to implemented economic development policies at a spatial scale that matches cities’ economic
  footprints—as this spatial scale often covers more than one local authority (Smith 2012).




3.5.6	 Business regulations and licensing

   130.	 Malaysia ranks among the top countries in the World Bank Group’s Doing Business survey, showcasing its
         continued emphasis on maintaining a superior general business environment. Malaysia’s regional comparator
         economies also perform very well. At 18th worldwide in ease of doing business, Malaysia is behind Singapore
         which ranks first, Hong Kong which ranks third and Korea which ranks fifth (World Bank 2014: 8). Starting a
         business is done through the Companies Commission of Malaysia one-stop shop, a national agency under the
         Ministry of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism (World Bank 2014: 20). Development approval,
         or obtaining a construction permit, is carried out through an application at a One Stop Center (OSC)—every
         local government in Malaysia should have its own OSC. The OSC refers approval submissions to all necessary
         government departments, including the Planning Department, Building Department, Engineering Department,
         Fire and Rescue Department, Sewerage Agency and Water Agency. Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s One Stop Center
         manages this process in Malaysia’s capital (World Bank 2014: 27-30).

    131.	 DBKL, MPAJ, as well as all Malaysia local governments, have responsibility over zoning and land use
          regulations. However, land titles are granted by land offices at higher tiers of government—the Ministry of
          Federal Territories for DBKL and Selangor State Government for MPAJ. Kuala Lumpur has also been able to
          perform rather well in terms of urban regeneration, through its repurposing of land throughout the city. Most
          notably this has included redeveloping the city center and revitalizing the area along the Klang River, with the
          latter efforts aimed at creating a waterfront of high economic value.

3.6	 Examples of Formulae for Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers

3.6.1	 Formulae for Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers in Australia

Background: Federal-State Financial Relations

     132.	 Australia is notable for the centralization of revenue-raising and a comprehensive system of intergovernmental
           fiscal transfers. To address both vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances, the federal government makes a
           large amount of intergovernmental transfers. The bulk of transfers are from the federal government to state
           governments. Local government, the third tier of government, is a state responsibility and has the service
           delivery and revenue raising powers given to it by the states38. The federal government collects 81 percent
           of all government revenue but is responsible for only 61 percent of outlays, while states collect 17 percent of
           revenue and incur 33 percent of outlays (CGC 2008).

     133.	 Fiscal transfers are administered by Australia’s Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC), an independent
           statutory advisory body established in 1933. CGC members are appointed by the federal government. The
           Commission makes recommendations in consultation with the federal government and the states. It aims to
           ensure that each state has the fiscal capacity to provide the same standard quality of public services39. Three
           equalization pillars are used to achieve equalization: reflect what States collectively do, be policy neutral
           and be practical (Morris and others 2004). The Commission reviews the methodology for transfers and make
           adjustments every five years.

     134.	 The major reform of Australian federal fiscal relations happened in 2000. With the introduction of the goods
           and services tax (GST) and a new intergovernmental agreement (IGA 2000), certain state taxes were abolished.
           All revenue from the GST would be shared among the states on the basis of horizontal fiscal equalization. GST
           became the main source of general revenue assistance from the federal government to the states (CGC 2008).

     135.	 Fiscal transfers take two main forms (Commonwealth of Australia 2015):

             A.	 General Revenue Assistance: untied monthly funding that the states may use as they see fit. Over 98% of
                 general revenue assistance is the allocation of GST revenue, which is based on a comprehensive formula.
                 Other general revenue assistance includes payments to the Australian Capital Territory, and royalty pay-
                 ments to Western Australia and Northern Territory.

             B.	 Specific Payments: including specific purpose payments (SPPs) and national partnership payments (NPPs)
                 sourced from the national budget to achieve national aims or provide funds for particular purposes.
                 The SPPs mainly support services of workforce development, health and housing. They are distributed
                 amongst the states in accordance with population shares of that year and the growth in services provision
                 activity such as hospital and school services in that jurisdiction. The NPPs facilitate reforms or specified
                 projects, where payments are aligned with project achievements.

     136.	 In 2015-2016, the federal government is providing the states with A$107.7 billion in total payments, accounting
           for around 5.8% of GDP and 45% of state revenues (Commonwealth of Australia 2015). The total payments
           include specific payments of $50 billion and general revenue assistance of $57.7 billion.



38
  	 Local governments are responsible for services such as local roads, building standards and waste disposal. They raise revenue through
    rates on property in their jurisdiction and various fees and fines. Transfers from the federal government to municipal governments are
    channeled through the states (Searle 2002: p17-18).
39
  	 The transfers aim to equalize State fiscal capacities, not the actual fiscal outcomes because States choose to provide different levels of
    service, impose different tax rates or acquire different levels of assets. (CCG 2015)


120 Annexes
Formulae Used for Transfers

     137.	 Fiscal equalization in Australia aims to achieve a situation where, after distributing the GST, each state has
           the fiscal capacity to provide the same services, charge the same taxes and achieve the same per capita budget
           result (CGC 2014a). Since states differ in fiscal circumstances such as size of the tax base and the unit cost of
           providing services, the actual GST entitlement of each state varies.

     138.	 According to the Commonwealth of Australia’s Update Report (2014b), a state’s GST allocation is calculated as:

                                                        assessed GST requirementi=
                                       assessed expensesi + assessed investmenti + assessed lendingi
                                                   - assessed revenuei - other paymentsi

             »» assessed expenses: the expenses state i would incur to provide average services. It is the sum of 11
                categories of expenses that the Commission defines that all states incur to provide general services. Each
                category assessed expenses is estimated by multiplying the national average expense per capita by its
                category disability factor and its population. The disability factor is calculated by relating its position to
                the average position40.

             »» assessed investment: the investment state i would make to have the infrastructure required to provide
                average services. It is calculated by subtracting the assessed level of infrastructure required at the start
                of the year from the assessed level of infrastructure required at the end of the year and multiplying the
                result by the state’s unit cost disability41.

             »» assessed net lending: the net lending state i would make to finish the year with the average per capita net
                financial assets. It is calculated by subtracting the state’s population share of the total net financial worth
                at the start of the year from its population share of total net financial worth at the end of the year.

             »» assessed revenue: the revenue state i would raise if it made the average revenue raising effort. It is the
                sum of assessed revenue for seven categories that the Commission determines as revenue sources in
                the estimation42. For each category, it is calculated by multiplying the national average tax rate and the
                state’s tax base.

             »» other payments: revenue from Commonwealth payments including SPPs and NPPs.

     139.	 The calculation is compiled using data from the annual operating statements of the states’ general government
           sectors sourced from the ABS Government Finance Statistics.




40
   	 For service delivery expenses component, if the proportion of a state’s population aged 15 to 64 is 10% above the average, it is assumed
     the state’s per capita expenses on vocational education would be 10% above average. The disability factor for a category is estimated
     combining each component. Factors are added if they are independent and multiplied if they interact (CGC 2014b).
41
  	 The disability here is estimated in a similar way with expense disability factor, by relating its position to the national average position.
42
   	 The categories for revenue include payroll tax, land tax, stamp duty on conveyances, insurance tax, motor taxes, mining revenue and
     other revenue (CGC 2014b).

3.6.2	 Formulae for Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers in Indonesia

        140.	 Intergovernmental fiscal transfers in Indonesia consist of three main components: Dana Alokasi Umum (DAU),
              Dana Alokasi Khusus (DAK) and Dana Bagi Hasil (DBH). DAU and DBH are unconditional grants, while DAK
              finances subnational projects based on national priorities. DAU and DAK are formula-based transfers; DBH is
              based on fixed percentage shares. Transfers from the central government are still the largest source of revenues
              for subnational governments in Indonesia.

Dana Alokasi Umum (DAU)

         141.	 DAU aims to balance the fiscal capacities of subnational governments. It is transferred directly to subnational
               governments on a monthly basis, and subnationals have complete discretion over the use of DAU received.

         142.	 According to Law 33 (2004), DAU should be provided in a “proportionate, democratic, fair and transparent manner”
               by taking into account “local potential (fiscal capacity and conditions and local needs)” (Shah and others 2012). The
               grant allocation is calculated as the sum of a basic allocation (PWBA) and a fiscal gap allocation (FG).

                                              DAUi = Basic Allocationi + Fiscal Gap Allocationi

                    allocated by the relative percentage share of each local government or provincial government in the total

                    of human development index, and inverse of relative nominal per capita GRDP (gross regional domestic
                    product). The weights for the above mentioned factors are assigned to achieve a given numerical value for
                    the Williamson’s Index44, as shown in Table 1 (Shah and others 2012).

                 »» Fiscal capacity (FC) is the sum of weighted own-source revenues, non-resource tax sharing as well as
                    resource and mining tax sharing45. The weights for individual revenue sources are assigned to achieve a
                    given numerical value for the Williamson’s Index for each year. Table 1 provides the index values for the
                    year 2011 (Shah and others 2012).

                                                           Fiscal Capacityi = ∑ ( Rij * Ij)


 	 The wage bill variable in the equation uses the actual wage bill from the previous year.

 	 Williamson’s Index is a regional inequality index developed by JG Williamson (1965). It is an aggregate measure of the dispersion
44

   of regional levels of per capita income about the national mean. Each regional observation is weighted by its share in the national
   population.

                Dana Alokasi Khusus (DAK)

                     143.	 DAK is a capital grant sourced from the national budget (Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara, APBN) and
                           finances subnational projects that the central government deems are of national priority. DAK funds capital
                           spending and cannot be used for research, training, administration, or official travel. DAK accounts for around 5%
                           of the national budget and funds activities across 22 sectors. Funds are transferred each year in three tranches.
                           The first tranche depends on a subnational government’s submission of its budget to the central government, and
                           the latter two tranches depend on the depletion of funds from the previous tranche. (World Bank 2012)

                     144.	 The allocation of DAK is a two-fold process. First, there is a system for determining a subnational government’s
                           eligibility to receive DAK, based on fiscal capacity, regional characteristics and special criteria such as regional
                           autonomy and disadvantaged regions, as shown in Figure 1.

                     145.	 Second, once eligibility for DAK is established, the atual allocation is based on a comprehensive formula. The
                           total DAK allocation that subnational government i receives from the central government is the sum of DAK
                           allocated for each sector (e.g. education, health, agriculture, etc.) for that subnational government. The DAK that
                           subnational government i receives for sector j is calculated by multiplying its weighted share by the total DAK
                           allocated to the sector. Mathematically the process is presented as below (Ministry of Finance 2015):

                                             DAK allocationi = DAKieducation + DAKihealth + DAKiagriculture + ⋯ + DAKitrade

              »» Fiscal capacity index (IFN) is the ratio of a subnational government’s fiscal capacity to the national average
                 fiscal capacity. A subnational government’s fiscal capacity is calculated by subtracting its wage bill for
                 civil servants from the sum of its own-source revenue and all other transfers received from the central
                 government.

              »» Construction cost index (IKK): reflects varying levels of the costs of construction across the country. The
                 index for each jurisdiction is determined by the Ministry of Public Works based on recent actual data of
                 the value of construction contracts for civil works across all provinces.



Dana Bagi Hasil (DBH)
     146.	 DBH is the mechanism for revenue sharing. The central government raises revenue and returns part of this revenue
           by allocating a predefined share of revenues to the originating jurisdiction. Distributions are by provincial point
           of origin; producing districts within provinces receive larger portions than non-producing districts. Subnational
           governments have total discretion over the use of allocated funds (World Bank 2012). These transfers accounted
           for 25 percent of total central transfers in 2010 and financed 20 percent of subnational expenditures (Shah and
           others 2012).

     147.	 DBH includes both shared tax and non-tax revenues. Shared tax revenue comes from property tax, taxes on the
           transfer of property titles and personal income tax. Non-tax revenue sharing is based on revenues from natural
           resources, including oil, natural gas and geothermal energy, mining, forestry and fisheries. For each type of
           revenue, the central government and subnational government share in accordance to predefined percentages. For
           instance, DBH from general mining is shared between central, provincial, and local governments at 20 percent,
           16 percent, and 64 percent, respectively (Dyah 2012).

 	 For example, IT for education sector is determined by components such as classroom conditions, school toilet conditions, etc. Each
46

   component is scored by the relevant national line ministry.

4.1.3	     Focus group discussion questionnaire

    148.	 The study team was guided by a page long simple questionnaire, which helped them gather the basic information.
          Guidance was also developed to help navigate the focus group discussions. Activity based discussions were used
          as an ice-breaker and helped put young people at ease. As the participants worked in small groups of about five
          people, they answered key questions, which they then presented using the papers and colors given to them.
          During these presentations the research team also asked questions and clarifications. The sessions were informal
          as well as lively and lasted for about two hours. There was good participation among the young people. In a
          number of groups multiple languages were used.

4.1.4	 Guidelines for focus group discussions

    149.	 Target group: At risk youth (between 15-30 years old) in six urban centers:

              a.	 Youth who have been detained at juvenile or correction centers or prisons

              b.	 Living in high rise flat or low cost public housing or squatters

              c.	 Dropped out of school or educational underachievers within the school system

              d.	 At high risk groups to drugs, alcohol, abuse & gangs

              e.	 Homeless youth and living on the streets

              f.	 Youth who are drug addicts and those in drug rehabilitation centers

              g.	 Youth on motor cycle racing gangs

              h.	 Youth out of prison, juvenile centers or detention or rehabilitation centers

              i.	 Youth in informal groups or gangs in the low income neighborhoods

    150.	 Overall objective of the work on social exclusion as part of the broader study on competitive cities: To better
          understand the nature and mechanisms of the challenges faced by the socially excluded (focusing on at risk
          youth) in urban areas in Malaysia, as it relates to Competitive Cities.

    151.	 Overall objective of the Focus Group Discussions: By listening to the voices of at risk youth, identify the key issues
          they face and the factors contributing to their social exclusion and vulnerability, as it relates to Competitive
          Cities.

    152.	 Areas of inquiry: The following areas of inquiry related to social exclusion should be explored through the FGDs:

              »» Economic aspects: such as limited access to labor markets, financial resources and basic services (including
                 Government programs). Are they able to access: Jobs, education, social services, financial services, training,
                 and government services? Why/why not? What are the main challenges in accessing them?

              »» Political aspects: such as limited opportunities to participate in decision-making, make their voices heard.
                 What are the obstacles they face in making their voices heard?

              »» Socio-cultural aspects: such as the isolation of specific groups through education, language and ethnic
                 practices.

              »» Spatial aspect: How does your housing impact your situation (positively or negatively) location,
                 mobility (access to jobs, education not in your neighborhood), physical housing, neighborhood set up/
                 accessibility, social dynamics (eg. gangs, crime, peer pressure), opportunities to engage in criminal, anti-
                 social activities, and other public safety concerns

              »» General Perceptions about inclusion/exclusion: Do they perceive themselves as included or excluded from
                 society/culture/government systems; Do they feel the government is addressing your needs? How do you
                 feel about your future prospects in life?

4.3	 Case Study: England supports affordable housing through land planning and policy

     153.	 Land planning and policies are the primary tools used in England to facilitate the construction of affordable
           housing. England has a number of policies that are designed to contribute towards the provision of affordable
           housing and social inclusion. The most prominent are the Planning and Policy Statement 3 (PPS3) (DCLG 2011)
           which deals with Housing, and Section 106 (S106) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990,(GoUK c.1990)
           which provides guidance to local authorities regarding development of affordable housing. The combination of
           these enables local authorities – the bodies which review, negotiate and approve development proposals – to
           ensure affordable housing is built in compliance with national guidance on mixed housing.

     154.	 Given the PPS3s objective to provide “sustainable, inclusive, mixed communities in all areas, both urban and
           rural” (DCLG 2011), the main focus of S106 planning achievements has been to facilitate tenure mix in new
           developments. By 2008 S106 had been successful in securing more than half of all affordable housing built
           in England (Monk 2010). Case studies show that successful S106 developments hold a range of tenure types
           and are home to a social mix of tenants. One example - Imperial Warf development in London – designed a
           development that would include 1,065 residential units, 515 of which were affordable housing. Subsequent
           revisions to the plan that reduced the number of affordable units were rejected by the planning authority, and the
           515 affordable unites were eventually built and finalized before any of the market rate units were allowed to be
           rented or sold. Among these 515 homes, the units were designed to have: 275 units for social rent, an additional
           50 units for social rent to the ‘frail elderly’ (i.e. specially adapted units), 75 shared-ownership units, 40 student
           accommodation units, 50 key worker47 units for rent, and 25 key worker unites for sale. Adhering to the principles
           of mixed use, this same building included 8,000 square meters of office floor space, 6,600 square meters of
           retail and restaurant floor space, 2,000 square meters for non-residential institution (the medical facility), a
           175 bedroom hotel, 3,000 square meters for a health and fitness club. In addition, planning permission was
           contingent of the development of a park, and a riverside walk, transport access and a parking strategy (Monk
           2010).

     155.	 Evidence, such as the above, suggests that S106 has been successful in facilitating the creation of mixed
           communities as well as meeting affordable housing needs (Monk 2010). One study asked “how far does
           the provision of ‘on-site’ affordable housing contribute to the government’s objectives of creating mixed
           communities?” and concluded that it did a reasonable job in achieving this. It found that many of the affordable
           housing sites were in more expensive areas that had not traditionally been associated with affordable housing.
           It was highlighted that the most successful buildings in terms of harmonious communities and market sales
           were those in which one couldn’t tell which units were social housing and which were market housing. This
           is important as perceptions of social housing are rather negative and respondents fear the potential knock-on
           effects that low-income residents may bring, such as antisocial behavior, that could affect the market rates of
           their property. The study was unable to conclude whether mixed tenure has had a positive effect on the social
           outcomes of social housing beneficiaries.48

     156.	 It is often argued that simply mixing tenure and ethnicity will not necessarily lead to most positive social
           outcomes for the disadvantaged. One researcher argues that creating mixed neighborhoods treats a symptom
           of inequality, not its causes. One study of mixed tenure in urban Scotland found no consistent pattern in health
           outcomes according to tenure type, but in areas with a large number of social housing tenants, some specific
           health issues had worse outcomes than in areas with a lower concentration of social housing (Lawder et al 2014).
           On employment, another, longitudinal study (Feng et al 2013), examined the neighborhood effects of ethnic
           inequality on economic activity. The study found that, overall, ethnic minorities were, more likely to become
           unemployed and less likely to become employed. It also concluded that living in a deprived neighborhood was

           especially among men. Ethnic diversity was negatively associated with job loss among employed women, but
           also for homemaking women and their chances of finding employment.

Malaysia’s cities are dynamic centers of innovation and have much potential to play an

increasingly important role as drivers of economic growth for the country. Yet, cities can grow

in different ways that will affect their competitiveness and livability, requiring policies that

create opportunities, foster productivity, minimize environmental degradation and ensure

social equity. This study focuses on understanding three key aspects of city competitiveness:

economic growth, urban governance, and social inclusion, through extensive analysis and

field work in six urban centers of Malaysia. Based on the analysis, the study lays out a set of

policy recommendations that aim to address existing challenges and create opportunities for

achieving a system of competitive cities.
