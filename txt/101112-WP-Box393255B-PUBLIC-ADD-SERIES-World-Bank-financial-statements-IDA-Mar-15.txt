 2    IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2015
Introduction
This document should be read in conjunction with the International Development Association’s (IDA)
financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis issued for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.
IDA undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Box 1 provides IDA’s selected
financial data as of and for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 (FY15 YTD) and March 31, 2014 (FY14
YTD) as well as for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.

I.     Organizational Overview and Business Model
IDA is an international organization established in 1960 and is owned by its 173 member countries. It is the
world’s largest multilateral channel for providing concessional financing and knowledge services to the
world’s poorest countries.
IDA complements the other institutions within the World Bank Group (WBG1), that share the overarching
goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. IDA plays a pivotal role in the global aid
architecture and pursues these goals by providing concessional development credits, grants and guarantees to
its recipient member countries for programs and operations that help meet their development needs. IDA
provides technical assistance through reimbursable advisory services and policy advice, and global knowledge
services through economic sector work and country studies. In addition, IDA facilitates financing through trust
fund partnerships with bilateral and multilateral donors. IDA also supports member countries with disaster risk
financing to help increase their resilience against natural disasters, as part of their broader disaster risk
management agenda.
The resources available to IDA for funding its lending activities constitute its commitment authority. IDA
finances its development credit, grant and guarantee commitments primarily from partner contributions, funds
from its internal resources, as well as transfers from IBRD’s net income, and grants designated out of IFC’s
retained earnings. Since IDA’s lending is highly concessional, its resources are periodically replenished. Since
its inception, IDA’s resources have been replenished seventeen times, complemented by an additional
replenishment agreed to in 2006 for financing the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Details of the
Seventeenth Replenishment of IDA’s Resources (IDA17), which is effective from July 1, 2014 to June 30,
2017, are provided in Chart 1.

II.    Funding and Resource Allocation
The funding of IDA’s lending, grant financing and guarantee activities are presented and discussed below.
Sources of Funds
Partner Resources (Subscriptions and Contributions and Borrowings from Partners): IDA finances its
commitments for development credits and development grants primarily through partner resources. The partner
resources that are in the form of subscriptions and contributions are assigned voting rights. Prior to IDA17,
IDA had not entered into long-term borrowings, even though it is allowed to do so under its Articles.
Contributions from members remain at the core of IDA’s financing framework, however due to a number of
exceptional circumstances, a limited amount of concessional debt funding, “borrowings from partners”, are
used to increase the commitment authority for IDA17. These circumstances include the current low interest
rate environment, unique resource constraints for a number of contributing partners, and the provision of
transitional support for eligible new graduating countries during IDA17.
Internal Resources: These primarily comprise contractual principal repayments (including any accelerated
repayments and voluntary prepayments), interest income on blend term credits, income from the investment
portfolio and any carryover of residual resources from previous replenishments.
Transfers and Grants from affiliated organizations: These are transfers from IBRD’s net income and grants
from IFC’s retained earnings.



1 The other institutions of the World Bank Group are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the
 International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre
 for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Each of these organizations is legally and financially independent from IDA,
 with separate assets and liabilities, and IDA is not liable for their respective obligations.

Applications of Funds
Disbursement of development credits and grants: IDA’s development credits, grants and guarantees benefit
the poorest and least creditworthy countries, which are eligible to borrow from IDA.
Administrative Expenses: IDA’s policy is to maintain its service and commitment charges at a level that will
cover its administrative expenses. Commitment charges are set annually and take into account the extent to
which service and certain interest charges, and partner compensation for development grant financing and
forgone charges on development credits forgiven under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC)
and the MDRI, cover administrative expenses. For FY15, commitment charges are set at nil.
Commitment Authority
The IDA17 Commitment Authority Framework amounts to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 33.7 billion (U.S.
dollar equivalent $50.8 billion). It became effective on November 5, 2014, when Instruments of Commitment
(IoC’s) and loan agreements received exceeded the effectiveness threshold of SDR11.7 billion (U.S. dollar
equivalent $17.6 billion).
Chart 1 provides a breakdown of the principal sources making up the total lending envelope under IDA17 and
the extent to which these sources have been used for commitments of development credits, grants and
guarantees through March 31, 2015.

a. Commitment Authority is measured and monitored in SDR. The chart represents the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts for
   presentational purposes only, based on the IDA17 foreign exchange reference rate of U.S. dollar/SDR 1.50718. Actual
   commitments are recorded based on historical U.S. dollar rates.
b. Amounts may not add due to rounding.
c. Includes U.S.dollar equivalent 4.5 billion of partner commitments for compensation of debt relief provided under MDRI.



III. Basis of Reporting
IDA prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the “reported basis”. The financial statements
provide a basis upon which users are able to analyze IDA’s sources and applications of resources. Under the
reported basis, IDA’s Statement of Income does not reflect the full economic results of IDA due to a number of
asymmetries, which are explained in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2014.

IV. Statement of Activities Analysis
The Statement of Activities (Table 1) is designed to reflect how IDA manages its sources and applications of
funds in executing its operating activities. It presents the flows associated with IDA’s operating activities and
the impact of these activities on the net asset value of IDA’s investment portfolio. This presentation addresses
the majority of the asymmetries (explained in IDA’s June 30, 2014 MD&A) embedded in IDA’s reported basis
results.

Results from Operating Activities
IDA’s operating activities resulted in a net inflow of $4,393 million for FY15 YTD. The main drivers of the
$3,792 million variance as compared to FY14 YTD are the $1,836 million increase in borrowings from
partners and the $1,379 million increase in subscriptions and contributions.
IDA’s core liquidity position as of March 31, 2015 is sufficient to cover approximately 11 months of average
monthly gross disbursements, which is consistent with the historical range of 9 to 14 months for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 2010 through 2014. The negative impact on IDA’s liquidity position as a result of the
depreciation of the non U.S. dollar component currencies of the SDR against the U.S. dollar, has been offset by
the positive impact of note encashments, which usually occur in the second six months of the fiscal year. See
Section VII for more details on IDA’s core liquidity position.
IDA’s funding position at March 31, 2015 was 83%, as compared to 71% at June 30, 2014. The remaining
funding gap will primarily be covered by future receipts of cash, demand notes already committed by partners,
and repayments on outstanding credits by recipient countries. At all times, IDA enters into new commitments
based on the commitment authority available. See Section II for further details on IDA’s Commitment
Authority.
The following are additional details of the key drivers of IDA’s results from operating activities:

Members’ Subscriptions and Contributions
The subscriptions and contributions of $6,648 million represent the cash contributions received from members
and the encashment of demand notes. This excludes $199 million of member contributions received to finance
foregone charges for debt relief and development grant financing, which is reflected as part of administrative
activities.
Borrowings from Partners
Concessional partner loans were introduced in IDA17 to increase the lending envelope available to recipient
countries by incorporating a limited amount of debt funding into the financing framework in a sustainable
manner. Five partners have agreed to provide loans totaling $4.4 billion.
As of March 31, 2015, IDA had signed loan agreements totaling $3.8 billion with four of the five partners and
had received loan proceeds of $1,836 million under those agreements. One agreement comprises a loan of $1
billion and a grant of $179 million. As part of the overall arrangement, the proceeds have been invested in a
fixed rate instrument with the IFC.
Transfers and Grants from Affiliated Organizations
On October 10, 2014, IBRD’s Board of Governors approved a transfer to IDA of $635 million, under IDA17.
This transfer was received on October 14, 2014.
On January 23, 2015, IDA received a $340 million grant from the IFC under IDA17.
Development Credit and Grant Disbursements
Gross disbursements of development credits and grants
during FY15 YTD were $8,447 million, which is in line
with FY14 YTD. Africa and South Asia together
accounted for 78% of the total gross disbursements
during FY15 YTD.
Of the $6,809 million in development credit
disbursements, 6% related to commitments made under
IDA17, 50% under IDA16, and 44% related to
commitments made under earlier replenishments.
As of April 30, 2015 the WBG has mobilized $1.62                       (Includes adjustments for certain PPA activity)
billion in financing for the countries hardest hit by the
Ebola crisis, this includes $1.17 billion from IDA. Of the $1.17 billion, $518 million in emergency funding has
already been committed , primarily through grants from IDA’s Crisis Response Window, of which $363
million has already been disbursed to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Development Credits Outstanding and Accumulated Provision for Debt Relief
and for Losses on Development Credits
Development credits outstanding decreased by $10,443 million during FY15 YTD, primarily due to negative
translation adjustments of $14,242 million resulting from the 10.8% depreciation of the SDR against the U.S.
dollar. This was partially offset by positive net disbursements of $3,809 million.

Investment Assets, net of related Liabilities
The net investment portfolio increased from $28,300 million as of June 30, 2014 to $30,095 million as of
March 31, 2015, an increase of $1,795 million. The main driver for the increase was the net result of IDA’s
operating activities as reflected in the Statement of Activities (Table-1). This was partially offset by the $2,785
million negative impact of exchange rate movements, reflecting the depreciation of the non U.S dollar
component currencies of the SDR against the U.S dollar. See Section IV for variance analysis of operating
activities.
Subscriptions and Contributions
The $6,205 million increase in subscriptions and contributions paid-in is primarily attributable to the receipt
from members of $4,427 million of demand notes and $3,384 million of cash contributions which was partially
offset by a negative translation adjustment of $1,606 million.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
The $16,523 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income is due to translation adjustment
losses, $14,242 million of which relates to translation adjustment losses on development credits outstanding
resulting from the 10.8% depreciation of the SDR against the U.S. dollar.

VI. Financial Risk
IDA is subject to four main types of financial risk: funding risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk.
Funding Risk is managed using the Commitment Authority Framework and monitored, in part, by the funding
position ratio, see Section II, Funding And Resource Allocation and Section VII, Funding and Liquidity
Positions.
Liquidity Risk is managed through a combination of cash flow monitoring, timing of partner contributions
and investment policies. IDA’s liquidity position is a key indicator of liquidity management; see Section VII,
Funding and Liquidity Positions.
Credit Risk includes two types: Country credit risk and Commercial credit risk.
Country credit risk is primarily managed by regular reviews of the credit risk of IDA recipient countries in
terms of their debt sustaining capacity. These reviews provide an input into the composition of development
credits versus grants for new operations. Reviews are also performed to determine the adequacy of provisions
for losses on credits and other exposures.
Table 4 provides details of the top five borrowers with the largest development credits outstanding as of March
31, 2015. These borrowers represented 50% of total development credits outstanding as of that date.

8   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2015
Commercial Credit Risk: The monitoring and managing of this risk is a continuous process due to changing
market conditions. IDA's commercial counterparty credit risk is concentrated in investments in debt
instruments issued by sovereign governments, agencies, corporate entities and banks, as shown in Table 5. The
credit quality of IDA’s investment portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit spectrum, with
78% of the portfolio rated AA or above, reflecting IDA’s continued preference for highly rated securities and
counterparties across all categories of financial instruments. The reduction in AA rated and the increase in A
rated counterparties from June 30, 2014 to March 31, 2015 is primarily due to a rating downgrade of one
country to single A. Total commercial counterparty credit exposure, net of collateral held, was $32.6 billion as
of March 31, 2015.

a. Excludes IFC investment

Market Risk: IDA faces foreign exchange risk on its future partner contributions, which it manages by
economically hedging using currency forwards and by rebalancing the currency composition of its investment
portfolio. Interest rate risk on its investment portfolio is managed by aligning the duration of the investment
portfolio with that of the projected net cash requirements. The impact of these strategies is shown on IDA’s
Statement of Income, however, the economic offset is not evident. Further details can be seen in IDA’s June
30, 2014 MD&A. The analysis below discusses the impact of these activities on IDA’s Statement of Income
and the economic offset.
Foreign Exchange Risk
IDA conducts its operations in SDR and its component currencies of U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen and pound
sterling. These constitute the functional currencies of IDA, and all other currencies are considered non-
functional currencies. Any translation adjustments due to exchange rate movements against the U.S. dollar for
non-functional currencies and functional currencies, are reflected in the Statement of Income, and in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Equity section of the Balance Sheet, respectively.
IDA faces foreign exchange rate risk exposure as a result of the currency mismatch between its commitments
for development credits and grants, which are denominated in SDRs; partner contributions, which are typically
denominated in national currencies; and the portion of IDA’s internal resources and expenditures that is
denominated in U.S. dollars. To manage this risk, IDA uses currency forward contracts to convert partners’
encashments provided in national currencies into the four currencies of the SDR basket. The payable legs of
these currency forward contracts economically hedging partner pledges are denominated in non-functional
currencies. As a result, appreciation (depreciation) of these currencies against the U.S. dollar results in
exchange rate losses (gains), which are reported in the Statement of Income.
The translation adjustment gain on non-functional currencies of $1,055 million in FY15 YTD was due to the
depreciation of the non-functional currencies against the U.S. dollar. This was offset by the effect of foreign
exchange movements on the economic offset to the currency forward contracts, i.e., the future inflows from
partners, which was a loss of $1,350 million in FY15 YTD. In contrast, the translation adjustment loss on non-
functional currencies of $38 million in FY14 YTD was due to the appreciation of the majority of the non-
functional currencies against the U.S. dollar. This was offset by the effect of foreign exchange movements on
the economic offset to the currency forward contracts; i.e.,the future inflows from partners, which was a gain
of $36 million in FY14 YTD. The difference between the reported translation adjustments and the effect of
foreign exchange movements on the economic offsets, primarily represent the effect of foreign exchange
movements on the partner contributions in non-functional currencies that are not economically hedged through
forward contracts due to their relatively small contribution amount or the unpredictability of the expected
payment date. These residual partner contributions are hedged using a currency correlation methodology under
the overall currency management framework.


                                   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2015                9
Interest Rate Risk
The primary objective in the management of IDA’s investment-trading portfolio is to provide a ready source of
liquidity to meet projected net cash requirements. Accordingly, IDA’s assets are invested so that their duration
closely matches the duration of these projected net cash requirements. Given IDA’s lengthy disbursement
profile, the duration of IDA’s investment-trading portfolio is therefore relatively long. This long duration,
combined with volatility in market interest rates, results in significant year-on-year variability in unrealized
mark-to-market gains/losses on the portfolio. The economic offset to the unrealized mark-to-market
gains/losses on the investment portfolio would be the change in the present value of the projected net cash
outflows.
IDA’s investment-trading portfolio had a duration of approximately 3 years as of March 31, 2015. During
FY15 YTD, the investment-trading portfolio experienced unrealized mark-to-market gains of $378 million,
due to the decline in the yield curves for the major currencies. In contrast, during FY14 YTD, the investment
portfolio experienced net unrealized mark-to-market losses of $4 million, resulting from the offsetting
movements of the yield curves for the major currencies.
During FY15 YTD, IDA purchased a debt security issued by the IFC. While IDA intends to hold the security
to maturity, IDA elected to measure the security at fair value, so that the measurement method (fair value)
could be consistently applied to all its investments. The changes in fair value for this security are reflected in
the Statement of Income. This security is being held in the non-trading investment portfolio.
The non-trading portfolios incurred unrealized mark-to-market losses of $162 million during FY15 YTD,
principally consisting of i) unrealized mark-to-market losses of $164 million on the currency forward contracts
during FY15 YTD, as compared to unrealized mark-to-market losses of $31 million in FY14 YTD, resulting
from the more pronounced downward movement of yield curves of the majority of the payable currencies
during FY15 YTD; and ii) unrealized mark-to-market gains of $2 million during FY15 YTD on investments
with IFC. See Section IV.

VII. Funding and Liquidity Positions
Management monitors IDA’s funding and liquidity positions to assess IDA’s ability to conduct its operations.
Since IDA has not borrowed from the capital markets, even though it is allowed to do so under its Articles of
Agreement, it is important that IDA has sufficient funding resources and liquidity to meet its contractual
obligations to disburse approved development credits and grants in a timely manner.
Funding Position                                         Liquidity Position




As of March 31, 2015, the investment portfolio and     As of March 31, 2015, core liquidity accounted for
unrestricted demand notes covered 83% of all           $11,980 million (June 30, 2014 - $9,902 million),
undisbursed commitments of development credits         comprising short-term and medium-term investments.
and grants as compared to 71% at June 30, 2014.        IDA’s liquidity position was sufficient to cover
                                                       approximately 11 months of average monthly gross
In the last 5 years, IDA’s funding position has ranged
                                                       disbursements, relatively stable in line with the 5 year
from 71% to 81%.
                                                       historical range of 9 to 14 months of average monthly
                                                       gross disbursements since FY10.

NOTES TO CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2014
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been
derived from the June 30, 2014 audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management, the
condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IDA’s financial
position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP).
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for debt relief and losses on development credits and other
exposures, and valuation of certain financial instruments carried at fair value. The results of operations for the first
nine months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full
year.
Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation.
These financial statements were approved for issuances on May [ ], 2015 which was also the date through which
IDA’s management evaluated subsequent events.
Accounting and Reporting Developments
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IDA continues to assess the impact
on its business. As of March 31, 2015, IDA believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its business.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The ASU
provides a common framework for revenue recognition for US GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards, and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance in US GAAP. The core principle of the
guidance is that an entity recognizes revenue when it transfers control of promised goods and services to customers
in an amount that reflects consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled. The ASU also requires additional
quantitative and qualitative disclosures to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing,
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. For IDA, the ASU will be
effective in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, with early adoption permitted. IDA is currently evaluating the
impact of this ASU on its financial statements.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity
Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. The ASU requires repurchase-to-maturity transactions and
some repurchase financing arrangements to be accounted for as secured borrowings. It also requires additional
disclosures about certain transactions accounted for as sales and about the nature of collateral pledged for
transactions accounted for as secured borrowings. IDA has elected to adopt the ASU from the quarter ended March
31, 2015, as permitted by the ASU. The ASU does not have an impact on IDA’s financial statements since all
repurchase agreements are already accounted for as secured borrowings. Moreover, IDA will need to include
additional disclosures required by the ASU in the financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements (Subtopic 205-40): Going
Concern – Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The ASU
provides guidance on management’s responsibilities in evaluating the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern
and for the related financial statement disclosures. Until now, guidance related to this topic was provided under U.S
auditing standards, which do not govern management’s disclosures. Under this ASU, each reporting period,
management would be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about
the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued
(or available to be issued). For IDA, the ASU will be effective beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.
IDA is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements, but does not expect the ASU to have
a significant impact.


16    IDA CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2015 (UNAUDITED)
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation
Analysis. This ASU makes amendments to the current consolidation guidance focusing on targeted areas for certain
legal entities. For IDA, the ASU will be effective beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, with early
adoption permitted. IDA is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements.

During the nine months ended March 31, 2015, IDA encashed demand obligations totaling $3,464 million.
NOTE C—INVESTMENTS
The investment securities held by IDA are designated as either trading or non-trading. These securities are carried
and reported at fair value, or at face value which approximates fair value.
As of August 25, 2014, IDA purchased a debt security issued by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). While
IDA intends to hold the security to maturity, IDA elected to measure it at fair value, so that the measurement method
(fair value) is consistently applied to all its investments. The changes in fair value are reflected in the Condensed
Statement of Income. This security is being held in the non-trading investment portfolio. For details regarding this
transaction, see Note G – Affiliated Organizations.
As of March 31, 2015, IDA’s investments primarily comprised government and agency obligations (80%), with all
the instruments being classified as either Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
A summary of IDA’s Investments at March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2014 is as follows:

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of investments.
Investment securities
Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include
futures contracts and most government and agency securities.
For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined based on model-based
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and prepayment spreads. Where
applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default, and loss severity are used.

20        IDA CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2015 (UNAUDITED)
Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are reported at face value which approximates fair value.
Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and securities lent
under securities lending agreements
These securities are of a short term nature and are reported at face value, which approximates fair value.
Commercial Credit Risk
For the purpose of risk management, IDA is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve
elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible nonperformance
by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IDA limits trading to a list of
authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, credit limits have been established for counterparties by type of
instrument and maturity category.
Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through a credit approval process, volume limits, monitoring procedures
and the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements. IDA may require collateral in the form of cash or other
approved liquid securities from individual counterparties to mitigate its credit exposure.
IDA has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting provisions.
These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk with financial
assets subject to a master derivatives arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the extent that
payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a result of these
netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new transactions. The
extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of time following the
balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions, see note E-Derivative Instruments.
As of March 31, 2015, IDA received total cash collateral of $113 million ($1 million-June 30, 2014), of which $109
million ($1 million - June 30, 2014) was invested in highly liquid instruments.

Securities Lending: IDA may engage in securities lending and repurchases, against adequate collateral, as well as
secured borrowings and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations and ABS.
These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow IDA to
reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. As of March 31, 2015, amounts which could
potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master netting arrangements were $536 million ($497 million -
June 30, 2014).
Transfers of securities by IDA to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as the accounting criteria for the
treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase
date.
The following is a summary of the carrying amount of the securities transferred under repurchase or securities
lending agreements, and the related liabilities, as of March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2014:

As of March 31, 2015, the liabilities relating to securities transferred under repurchase or securities lending
agreements did not include any repurchase agreement trades that had not settled at that date ($415 million—June
30, 2014). As of March 31, 2015, there were no replacement trades entered into in anticipation of maturing trades of
a similar amount ($159 million—June 30, 2014).

In the case of resale agreements, IDA received collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to repledge
these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the securities

received are not recorded on IDA’s balance sheet as the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have not been
met. As of March 31, 2015, securities purchased under resale agreements included $467 million of securities which
had not settled on that date ($1,156 million—June 30, 2014). For the remaining purchases, IDA received securities
with a fair value of $458 million ($746 million —June 30, 2014). Out of this amount, $20 million of these securities
had been transferred under repurchase or securities lending agreements ($70 million—June 30, 2014).
 
NOTE D—BORROWINGS
IDA’s borrowings comprise concessional partner loans which were introduced for the first time under the
Seventeenth replenishment (IDA17), which started on July 1, 2014. These borrowings are unsecured and
unsubordinated fixed rate debt in SDR component currencies. IDA may prepay some or the entire outstanding
amounts without penalty. These borrowings are carried and reported at amortized cost.
As of March 31, 2015, IDA had borrowings outstanding of $1,807 million, related to concessional partner loans
which have original maturities of 25 and 40 years, with the final maturity being 2054.

Fair Value Disclosures
The table below presents the fair value of IDA’s borrowings for disclosure purposes, along with their respective
carrying amounts as of March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2014:

As March 31, 2015, IDA’s borrowings were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.


Valuation Methods and Assumptions
The fair value of IDA’s borrowings is calculated using a discounted cash flow method which relies on market
observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and proxy funding spreads.

NOTE E—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

required to post collateral as long as it maintains liquidity holdings at pre-determined levels that are a proxy for a
AAA credit rating. As of March 31, 2015, IDA had not posted any collateral with IBRD in accordance with the
agreement.

Offsetting assets and liabilities
IDA enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IDA the
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in
the event of default by the counterparty.
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.

The following table summarizes information on derivative assets and liabilities (before and after netting
adjustments) that are reflected on IDA’s Condensed Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2014. Total
derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally
enforceable master netting agreements. The net derivative asset positions have been further reduced by the cash and
securities collateral received.

Inter-level transfers
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, there were no inter-level transfers in
the derivatives portfolio.
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, interest swaps and currency swaps, and TBA securities.
These are valued using the standard discounted cash flow methods using market observable inputs such as yield
curves, foreign exchange rates and basis spreads and funding spreads.
NOTE F—DEVELOPMENT CREDITS AND OTHER EXPOSURES
Development credits and other exposures are generally made directly to member countries of IDA. Other exposures
include irrevocable commitments, guarantees and repaying project preparation facilities.
Development credits are carried and reported at amortized cost. Of the total development credits outstanding as of
March 31, 2015, 90% were to the South Asia, Africa, and East Asia and Pacific regions combined.
Based on IDA’s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of the development credits outstanding are in the
Medium and High risk classes.
As of March 31, 2015, development credits outstanding totaling $2,514 million (representing about 2% of the
portfolio) from five borrowers, were in nonaccrual status. 
Credit Quality of Sovereign Development Credits
Based on an evaluation of IDA’s development credits, management has determined that IDA has one portfolio
segment — Sovereign Exposures. Development credits constitute the majority of sovereign exposures.
IDA’s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay IDA on time and in
full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of
both quantitative and qualitative factors. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IDA’s exposures,
exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the
likelihood of loss: Low, Medium and High risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status.
IDA’s borrowers’ country risk ratings are key determinants in the provisions for development credit losses.
IDA considers a development credit to be past due when a borrower fails to make payment on any principal, service,
interest or other charges due to IDA, on the dates provided in the contractual development credit agreements.
The following tables provide an aging analysis of development credits outstanding as of March 31, 2015 and June
30, 2014:

Accumulated Provision for Losses on Development Credits, Debt Relief (HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI)
and Other Exposures
Provision for Losses on Development Credits and Other Exposures
Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provision for losses, which reflects the probable losses
inherent in IDA’s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of losses arising from default and nonpayment of
principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Management reassesses the adequacy of the accumulated
provision on a periodic basis and adjustments are recorded as a charge against or addition to revenue.
Provision for Debt Relief
HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI provisions are based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of various factors,
including estimates of Decision Point and Completion Point dates. These factors are reviewed periodically as part of
the reassessment of the adequacy of the accumulated provision for debt relief. Provisions are released as qualifying
debt service becomes due and is forgiven under the HIPC Debt Initiative, and are reduced by the amount of the
eligible development credits written off when the country reaches Completion Point, and becomes eligible for
MDRI debt relief.
Changes to the accumulated provision for losses on development credits and other exposures, as well as the debt
relief under HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 and the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2014 are summarized below:

(Nil - June 30, 2014).

Subsequent Event

Development credits to be written off under MDRI
On April 28, 2015, Chad reached the Completion Point under the HIPC Debt Initiative, allowing for the cancellation
of eligible development credits totaling $516 million on July 1, 2015. The accumulated provision for debt relief
under HIPC and MDRI of $2,573 million as of March 31, 2015 includes a provision for this amount.
Overdue Amounts
As of March 31, 2015, there were no principal or charges under development credits in accrual status which were
overdue by more than three months.
The following tables provide a summary of selected financial information related to development credits in

During the nine months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, no development credits were placed into
nonaccrual status.
For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015, service charge revenue recognized on development credits in
nonaccrual status was less than $1 million and $1 million, respectively (less than $1 million— three and nine months
ended March 31, 2014, in each period).

Guarantees
Guarantees of $418 million were outstanding at March 31, 2015 ($424 million—June 30, 2014). This amount
represents the maximum potential undiscounted future payments that IDA could be required to make under these
guarantees, and is not included on the Condensed Balance Sheet. The guarantees issued by IDA have original
maturities ranging between 9 and 23 years, and expire in decreasing amounts through 2035.
As of March 31, 2015, liabilities related to IDA’s obligations under guarantees of $33 million ($35 million—June
30, 2014), have been included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These include the accumulated

provision for guarantee losses of $5 million ($7 million—June 30, 2014).
During the nine months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, no guarantees provided by IDA were called.
Segment Reporting
Based on an evaluation of its operations, Management has determined that IDA has only one reportable segment.
Charge revenue comprises service charges and interest charges on outstanding development credit balances and
guarantee fee revenue. For the nine months ended March 31, 2015, charge revenue from two countries of $155
million and $90 million, respectively were in excess of ten percent of total charge revenue.

Buy-down of Development Credits
There were no development credits purchased under the buy-down mechanism by the Global Program to Eradicate
Poliomyelitis Trust Fund (buy-down mechanism) during the nine months ended March 31, 2015.

During the nine months ended March 31, 2014, two development credits were purchased under the buy-down
mechanism. These development credits had a carrying value of $134 million, and were purchased for a present value
equivalent of $67 million, resulting in a $67 million write-off. A total provision of $67 million was recorded when
all performance goals as well as conditions necessary to effect the buy-downs were completed.

Discount on Development Credits prepaid under the Seventeenth Replenishment of IDA’s Resources (IDA17)

During the nine months ended March 31, 2015, as part of IDA17, one IDA graduate country prepaid development
credits with an outstanding carrying value totaling $30 million. The total amount prepaid of $28 million reflected the
present value of the development credits as of the date of prepayment, resulting in an aggregate discount of $2
million to expenses in the Statement of Income.

During the nine months ended March 31, 2014, there were no prepayments of development credits.

NOTE I—PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
IBRD, along with IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, sponsor a defined benefit Staff
Retirement Plan, a Retired Staff Benefits Plan and a PEBP that cover substantially all of their staff members.

While IDA is not a participating entity to these benefit plans, IDA shares the benefit costs and reimburses IBRD for
its proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD, as part of IBRD’s allocation of staff and
associated administrative expenses to IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio.

During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2015, IDA’s share of IBRD’s benefit costs relating to all the
three plans totaled $69 million and $205 million, respectively (three and nine months ended March 31, 2014—$75
million and $224 million, respectively).

The cost of any potential future liability arising from these plans would be shared by IBRD and IDA using the
applicable share ratio.

NOTE J—ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Comprehensive income consists of net income (loss) and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S.
GAAP, are excluded from net income (loss). For IDA, comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income
(loss) and currency translation adjustments on functional currencies. These items are presented in the Condensed
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
