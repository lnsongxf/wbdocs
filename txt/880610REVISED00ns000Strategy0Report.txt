 The state and local governments that govern the Sundarbans in West Bengal are heavily dependent on the central government for most of their
development activities. Key central schemes implemented in the Sundarbans in India include: the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment
Guarantee Scheme; Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (program for providing road connectivity in rural areas); Indira Awas Yojana (program for
providing rural housing to the poor), National Rural Health Mission, Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme, Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidhyautikaran
Yojana (program for providing access to electricity to rural households); Mid-Day Meals Program, and the National Social Assistance Program.

  The Rural Household Survey (RHS) of 2005-09 also finds that there is substantial out-migration from the Sundarbans, on a permanent, seasonal, or
temporary basis. Over 25 percent of the principal earners of individual families in the RHS out-migrated on a temporary basis in search of work and over
24 percent did so on a seasonal basis. Temporary migration is the out-migration of a single male (or sometimes female) member of a family, for a few days
up to a year, to a particular location to work, save and to return home for a while until such savings run out.

  The Periodic Review 2011 of the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve submitted to the Man and the Biosphere Programme of UNESCO mentioned the
following: “During the 16th century, the flow of the Ganga shifted almost Eastwards into river Padma, as a result of tectonic plate movement towards
the East. This has resulted in cutting off the Matla and Bidyadharu river systems from the sweet water source and is presently fed by the backwater of
the sea and thereby salinity of the Indian part of Sundarbans is more when compared to the Bangladesh part. The higher salinity might have affected the
mangrove diversity in the Indian SBR.”

 The Government of India and the Government of West Bengal requested World Bank support to design a comprehensive program that responds to the
29

development challenges of the Sundarbans area of West Bengal. As part of the NLTA, various studies were carried out that would enable the
Government of West Bengal to develop a strategic action plan that addresses three main objectives: (a) protection of life, property, and assets; (b) income
growth and poverty reduction; and (c) biodiversity conservation. Studies conducted as a part of the NLTA used a variety of methodologies to compile
data on different sectors, which were then synthesized into an overarching spatial planning approach for the Sundarbans that would take better account
of the unique geographic realities of the Sundarbans area, and recognize interlinkages among sectors in the area.
 As a part of the NLTA, a comprehensive household survey of more than 2,000 households was commissioned to understand the demographic and
30

socioeconomic profile of households in the Sundarbans districts, and to better understand the dynamics of migration, livelihoods, and vulnerability to
natural disasters (see Annex 1 on methodology for further details on the survey of 2,188 households).

  The West Bengal experience with local development programs has spanned a quarter century. (Bardhan and Mookherjee 2006). In 1950, the Indian
Constitution set the foundation for decentralization in the country. The state of West Bengal developed a three-tier system of self-government under the
1957 Panchayat Act and the 1963 Parishad Act. The Left Front government successfully implemented the three-tier local government system in the late
1970s, and established the GP as the lower level of the three-tier system. The other two levels are the Panchayat Samiti and the Zila Parishad. The former
are councils at the block level with jurisdiction over 115 villages, while the latter are councils at the district level. The GP is elected every five years, and
includes roughly eight to 15 villages. Source: Bardhan, Mookherjee and Torrado, 2010). The main responsibilities given to the GPs of West Bengal include
the selection of beneficiaries for government welfare programs, distribution of agricultural kits, and investments in public infrastructure (Ibid).

 The main goal of the short-term migration approach presented in this report is to encourage outward migration of the residents of the Sundarbans by

educating them about the dangers of living in the area and providing them with incentives to migrate to other areas far from the Sundarbans Reserve
Forest. However, those who choose not to migrate could continue to stay in the region. The approach described in this report does not provide
educational human development services (health, education, and so on) in the short run. Moreover, institutional change is not feasible in the short-term
migration approach. The financial compensation component in the approach and restriction of settlement and movement into the Sundarbans is based
on the approach presented in Danda et al. 2011. Despite financial compensation, the population could continue to live at their current locations should
they choose to do so.

  In the context of this report, the “core zone” refers to all the legally protected areas of the Sundarbans (the National Park, wildlife sanctuaries, and the
Reserve Forest) and not just the National Park and Tiger Reserve. Roughly 40 percent of the Reserve Forest area has been brought under protected area
status. For more information, see http://www.sundarbanbiosphere.org/html_files/sunderban_biosphere_reserve.htm.

  In the Sundarbans, reference is sometimes made to a “high-risk zone,” which is an area that overlaps with both the core area and the transition zone.
The high-risk zone includes all legally protected areas, the Reserve Forest, and the fringe area (a belt on the periphery of the forest and the area impacted
by Cyclone Aila). Legally, there should be no residents of the core area. Thus the concern is with removing people from the parts of the transition zone
impacted by Cyclone Aila.
 Scientists distinguish between isostatic and eustatic sea level rise. The term “eustatic” refers to a global rise in sea level (for example, an alteration to the
41

global sea levels due to changes in the volume of water in the world oceans). The term “isostatic” refers to a sea level change that is localized, such as the
change in the relative sea level caused by deltaic subsidence.

  The area of land involved in the erosion is estimated to be approximately 15,000–25,000 ha; or a maximum area approximately equivalent to that of
Sagar Island. This can potentially be offset by reclamation of lands under accretion or by channel closures that will also make available new land. The loss
of significant areas of agricultural land points to the need for adopting some climate-resilient agricultural practices (for example, adoption of salt-
resistant varieties) so that basic food needs can be met.

  “Agglomeration economies” include within-industry and inter-industry economies. Within-industry economies arise when a large number of firms in the
same industry locate in the same place. Locating near competitors allows firms to “stay abreast of market information in negotiating with customers and
suppliers… [and] share a larger and more dependable pool of specialized labor.” Inter-industry economies occur when large numbers of different industries
locate in the same area. This allows them to benefit from locating near large suppliers of complementary services usable by firms in different sectors, such
as banking and legal services, and marketing and advertising agencies; they can also benefit from being near universities and vocational training centers.

 The Sundarbans Tiger Reserve comprises a total area of 2,585 km2 and constitutes a major part of the 4,260 km2 Indian Sundarbans forested area.
52

Situated in the West Bengal coastal district known as South 24 Parganas, it is one of the first of 27 tiger reserves established in 1973 by the Indian
government as part of its globally renowned Project Tiger conservation efforts. See http://projecttiger.nic.in/index.asp.
 The Sundarbans National Park is an area that is designated within the core area of the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve, where visitors are not allowed.

 Mass tourism has been shown to be not sustainable, as it rapidly degrades natural and cultural resources. Mass tourism approaches tourism as a

commodity, and emphasizes marketing. Growth takes precedence over all other considerations, including the welfare of local people and environmental
conservation. According to Seema et al. 2006: “Mainstream tourism is geared towards tourist satisfaction and sustainable ecotourism, on the other hand,
has conservation (of nature and culture) and livelihoods (economic and educational benefits) as essential constituents.” Understanding the results of
mass tourism provides further support for adopting a high-end, environmentally sustainable ecotourism approach in the Sundarbans, an especially
sensitive area with unique and precious assets.

  As part of the analytic work a total of 96 visitors were surveyed in three different locations: Sundarban Tiger Camp (private); Sajnekhali Tourist Lodge
(government owned); and Sundarban Jungle Camp (private). The survey questionnaire contained 24 questions on visitors’ demographics, perceptions
about the location, suggestions for improvements, and other matters.

  According to MoEF (2013), as far as legal protection of the Sundarbans area is concerned, GoI notified the Wetland (Conservation Management)
Rules-2010 vide notification no. GSR-951 (E), dated December 4, 2010. Sundarban has not yet been notified under the said rules, but options exist to
notify Sundarban under this specific rule. As per the Wetlands Rules, some activities are prohibited in the notified wetlands and some are allowed with
the approval of the Central Wetland Regulatory Authority (CWRA) which need to be taken into account while synergizing activities in the area; details
of prohibited activities and those with approval of CWRA are:
Prohibited Activities:
Reclamation of wetlands; Setting up of new industries and expansion of existing industries; Manufacture or handling or storage or disposal of
hazardous substances; Solid waste dumping: existing practices to be phased out within a period not exceeding six months; Discharge of untreated
wastes and effluents from industries, cities or towns and other human settlements: prevailing practices to be phased out within a period not exceeding
one year; Any construction of a permanent nature, except for boat jetties, within 50 m from the mean high flood level observed in the past 10 years,
calculated from the date of commencement of these rules; and Any other activity likely to have an adverse impact on the wetland to be specified in
writing by the Authority.
Activities with Approval of CWRA:
Withdrawal, impoundment, diversion or interruption of water sources; Harvesting of living and nonliving resources; Grazing to the level not to have
an adverse effect; Treated effluent discharges from industries, cities or towns, human settlements and agricultural fields falling within the limits laid
down by the Central Pollution Control Board/State Pollution Control Boards; Plying of motorized boat not detrimental to the nature and character
of the biotic community; Dredging only in areas impacted by siltation; Construction of boat jetties; Activities that may directly affect the ecological
character of the wetland; Aquaculture, agriculture, horticulture activities within the wetland; Repair of existing buildings or infrastructure; and Any
other activity to be identified by the Authority
·    Notwithstanding anything in sub-rule (1) or sub- rule (2), the Central Government may permit any of the prohibited activities or nonwetland use
     in the protected wetland on the recommendation of the Authority.
·    No wetland to be converted to nonwetland use without the approval of the central authority.
 The problem of unregulated aquaculture in the Sundarbans is described in GoWB. 2009 (Chapter 7). See also Knowler et al. 2009. For evidence of

  Bangladesh relies extensively on the use of polders, which are protected by embankments (also referred to as dykes). Although construction of
embankments in Bangladesh has a history that extends over centuries, that activity increased during the latter half of the 20th century.

  Under the amended Wildlife (Protection) Act, 2002, “the State Government may, where the community or an individual has volunteered to conserve
wild life and its habitat, declare any private or community land not comprised within a National Park, sanctuary or a conservation reserve, as a community
reserve, for protecting fauna, flora and traditional or cultural conservation values and practices.” Once such a reserve is declared, its land use cannot be
changed, except in accordance with a resolution passed by the management committee and its approval by the state government. A community reserve
management committee is constituted by the state government, which shall be the authority responsible for conserving, maintaining, and managing the
community reserve. This committee has five representatives nominated by the Village Panchayat (institution of local self-governance) or, where such a
Panchayat does not exist, by the members of the Gram Sabha (village assembly) and one representative of the state forest or wildlife department under
whose jurisdiction the community reserve is located. This committee is the competent authority to prepare and implement the management plan for the
community reserve and to take steps to ensure the protection of wildlife and its habitat in the reserve. Source: Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, as
amended in 2002.

concurrence shall be obtained before making such declaration.” A conservation reserve management committee is constituted by the state government
to advise the chief wildlife warden to conserve, manage, and maintain the conservation reserve. This committee consists of a representative of the forest
or wildlife department, who shall be the member secretary of the committee, one representative of each Village Panchayat in whose jurisdiction the

reserve forests, wildlife habitats, and biosphere reserves, all of which exist in the forested part of the Sundarbans.

  In 2008, the Delta Committee completed its report, with proposals for long-term planning (Delta Committee 2008). The report called for an increasing
reliance on natural systems (dunes, tidal dynamics, bioshields) to protect high-value areas while abandoning some productive but lower-value areas; it also
identified an extensive set of enabling laws and regulations that would need to be implemented to realize this vision. A related report also promoted a
“Faster and Better” principle as a means to address the problem that “the need in our consensus-based culture to unite the virtually irreconcilable in many
cases […] does not advance because of the administrative and political incapacity to take decisions or, once a decision has been taken, to actually
implement it” (Elverding et al. 2008).
96
  Deelstra et al. (2009) observe that rather than postponing decisions until negotiated alternatives have been elaborated and evaluated, the approach
involves identifying and exploring strategic alternatives early on and then selecting one to be advanced on a fast track. See also Werners, van de Sandt,
and Jaspers 2009.

 The term zamindars is defined as follows: “In India, a holder or occupier (dâr) of land (zamîn). The root words are Persian, and the resulting name was
widely used wherever Persian influence was spread by the Mughals or other Indian Muslim dynasties. The meanings attached to it were various. In Bengal,
the word denoted a hereditary tax collector who could retain 10 percent of the revenue he collected. In the late 18th century, the British government
made these zamindars landowners, thus creating a landed aristocracy in Bengal and Bihar that lasted until Indian independence (1947).” From website of
Encyclopaedia Britannica http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/655661/zamindar.
Taluqdar is a term used for an Indian landholder in Mughal and British times, responsible for collecting taxes from a district.

 The Indian Sundarbans is spread over two districts of southern West Bengal, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas, adjoining the neighboring
country of Bangladesh. There are 19 administrative blocks in these two districts, of which six are in North 24 Parganas and 13 in South 24 Parganas. The
blocks in South 24 Parganas are Sagar, Namkhana, Kakdwip, Patharpratima, Kultali, Canning I & II, Basanti, Gosaba, Mathurapur I & II, and Jaynagar I
& II. The blocks in North 24 Parganas are Haroa, Sandeshkhali I & II, Hingalganj, Hasnabad, and Minakhan.

 The 19 blocks spread over two districts were divided into four regions for the purposes of this study, primarily in terms of access to the main urban
centers, which act as magnets for the entire region.

 Sixty-eight survey personnel were selected locally through personal interviews. They were mostly undergraduate students pursuing or having recently
completed their studies. The selected individuals were trained in administering the survey questionnaire in day-long workshops conducted in each of four
locations. The survey was monitored in the field by supervisors in each location. Data gathered from the survey were further analyzed and refined, and
given a human dimension by using trigger question-based focus group meetings and collecting life histories of selected individuals to trace migration and
livelihood histories. This was supplemented by interviews with key informants and experts, including civil society and government representatives,
scientists, officials of Project Tiger, and members of NGOs (who have been active in some parts of the study area for decades).

 Chowdhury (2002) provides this global estimate. More recent valuation efforts that pertain just to the Sundarbans (conducted under this NLTA)
considered economic losses across a number of categories – cyclones, by-catch losses, carbon revenue losses, salinization, biodiversity loss – and showed
that cyclones alone account for about 45 percent of all losses in the Sundarbans. The estimated total cost of environmental damage associated with
ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss in the region is about INR 6.7 billion annually, accounting for about 5 percent of the estimated Sundarbans
GDP in 2009.

                                    weakened, though torrential rain continued to wreak havoc in the region. The storm caused rivers
                                    to burst their banks, prompting floods and landslides that damaged crops, roads, and houses. The

                                    during the storm. The storm dissipated by May 26. (Sources: Associated Press/BBC News/Reuters/

 Preliminary results from the 2011 India Census became available at state and district levels during the preparation of this report, although information
at the block level was not available at the time of completion of the NLTA. The preliminary results, however, suggest that the aggregate population
growth of the Sundarbans blocks over the previous decade was about 16 percent. The state of West Bengal had a decadal growth rate of 13.9 percent, and
for India as a whole the growth rate was 17.6 percent. The population of Kolkata, in fact, declined by 2 percent over the decade, showing net out-
migration. South 24 Parganas recorded an 18 percent decadal growth rate and North 24 Parganas a 13 percent decadal growth rate. The estimated 16
percent decadal population growth for the Sundarbans region corresponds to an annualized population growth of approximately 1.5 percent.

  Although historical background documents for the inhabited Sundarbans areas routinely mention “54 islands,” this specification was difficult to
operationalize during the studies because of historical changes relating to channel closures, changes in estuaries and rivers, and other natural and
anthropogenic influences. The analytical unit was thus redefined to specific “designated areas” (some of which were islands, others being multiple islands
or existing low-lying polders within circle embankments). In total, 70 designated areas (or “clusters”) were digitized, with each cluster linked to the 2001
Census database related to villages; this also permits links to more aggregated block profiles that contain more recent economic data for blocks. The
general operational definition of a “cluster” is an area encircled completely by a system of embankments, or by a system of embankments and high
ground not directly vulnerable to tidal influences. Some areas are quite small while others are spread over two or more community development blocks;
the 70 separate areas have a total area of 4,275 km2 and a total perimeter of 2,833 km. The database links 1,071 distinct villages to the 70 clusters within
13 blocks in South 24 Parganas district and six blocks in North 24 Parganas district.
 No areas have been identified for immediate resettlement or abandonment beyond those already designated (in some cases) as “abandoned” or
11

“uninhabitable” within current government mappings. There are, however, about 20 marginal areas where their size is too small to warrant long-term
defenses by themselves but vulnerable populations require near-term support.

zone has been extensively eroded so that it is narrow and steep             Figure A5.18. Areas of Aquaculture Ponds (Shaded)
and its embankments are undercut to the point of incipient                  Mapped from Satellite Imagery (2004)
collapse, suggesting that the apparent equilibrium here is merely
superficial. Although bathymetric data are not available for the
embanked Matla, field observation suggests that, in the most
seaward sections, the embankments are similarly undercut.

It is concluded that these estuaries have experienced sea level rise
over the past 100 to 150 years since embankments were constructed,
resulting in gradual widening of the channels. Model predictions
indicate that channels would have widened by between 10 m and
60 m for a 1 m sea level rise. As the channels are constrained by
the embankments, this widening has resulted in loss of intertidal
area and channel bed scour, as shown in Figure A5.3. This means
that there is no accommodation space within these channels and
that any further sea level rise will result in embankment collapse.

5.7.3 Undersized Channels
The model predictions for the estuaries in the east of the study
area – the upper Bidya and Raimangal – contrast with those from
the Saptamukhi estuary in the western Sundarbans. The two
channels known as the Pathanakhali Nadi and the Bhanga Khal/
Jhila River are both significantly undersized when compared to
their predicted equilibrium morphology. The Pathanakhali Nadi
in the upper Bidya is 340 m narrower than its predicted
equilibrium, while the Bhanga/Jhila in the upper Raimangal
estuary is 420 m narrower.

One possible explanation for this discrepancy might be failure
of these channels to erode quickly enough to keep pace with
the rise in sea level since embankment construction. However,
as pointed out above, a rise of 1 m in sea level over the past
150 years would only account for a potential maximum increase
of 60 m in channel width and could not explain the 300–400 m
discrepancy noted for these estuaries. Instead, a radical alternative
explanation is proposed: that an increase in tidal prism in these
eastern estuaries has been caused by the recent proliferation of
aquaculture in the region.

Aquaculture is an increasing landuse practice within the Sundarbans.       Calculation of the contribution made to the tidal prism of each

 Defined broadly, an incentive is a factor (financial or nonfinancial) that motivates a particular course of action. It is a factor that attempts to encourage
people to behave in a certain way. In terms of biodiversity conservation in the Sundarbans, incentive measures can be implemented in order to conserve
or restore valuable biological ecosystems and increase the cost to programs that have adverse environmental impacts. For example, landowners who are
given financial compensation if they adopt sound management practices that protect the environment will be more willing to use sustainable farming
practices than they otherwise would.
· Positive incentives. Monetary or nonmonetary inducements that lead to positive behavioral change (for example, reduction of overexploitation
    of forest resources) and contribution to long-term vulnerability reduction, socioeconomic development, and biodiversity conservation;
· Disincentives. Policies, programs, and mechanisms that penalize people when they engage in certain activities that have negative consequences (for
    example, harming biodiversity by overexploiting forest resources and aquatic species), and thus discourage them from engaging in such activities; and
· Indirect incentives. Programs, policies, and mechanisms that change the costs or benefits of engaging in activities indirectly, encouraging positive
    behavior by setting in place general enabling conditions that will cause people to change their economic behavior.

 The National Food Security Mission and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana were both introduced in 2007–08 to provide states with additional resources
on a 100 percent grant basis. States were afforded the flexibility to address priorities in agriculture, choose interventions, and set targets through these
two programs. In West Bengal, however, the goal of the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana was not met; the state made an average allocation of less than
4 percent to agriculture and allied sectors (3.2 percent) during the period 2007–10. Other states, such as Himachal Pradesh (11.1 percent) and Nagaland
(9.7 percent), allocated relatively higher expenditures to agriculture during the same period (Planning Commission 2011).

  As the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan has limited financial provisions for girls’ education in the form of free textbooks and innovations at the district level, the
National Program for Education of Girls at Elementary Level has been formulated for providing additional support for the education of underprivileged
and disadvantaged girls at the elementary level. The program is a part of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and will be implemented under its umbrella, though
as a distinct and separate gender component. For more information see http://www.education.nic.in/npegl.asp.

  The Kasturba Gandhi BalikaVidyalaya scheme introduced by GoI aims to provide educational facilities for girls belonging to Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes, and other underprivileged classes.

  The Mid-Day Meals Program began in 1995 to support the universalization of primary education by enhancing enrollment, retention, and attendance,
and simultaneously improving the nutritional status of primary school children. By 2004, the program was providing hot cooked meals to all children in
primary classes. It was extended to include upper primary (classes 6–8) children in 3,479 educationally disadvantaged blocks in October 2007 and then
universalized at the elementary level in 2008–09. Implementation of the Mid-Day Meals Program rests with the states, while the central government
provides food grains free of cost, transport assistance, and financial assistance for the construction of kitchen sheds and stoves (Planning Commission
2011).

  In the Sundarbans, the government is the primary service provider for institutional delivery. Privately operated facilities remain scarce in the region.
Block primary health centers and subdivisional hospitals are being developed as first referral units with the human resources to handle caesarian deliveries.
In the Sundarbans, six facilities have been upgraded to first referral units, four in the south and two in the north. However, none of the rural hospitals
has been allocated a gynecology and obstetrics specialist, an anesthetist, or a pediatrician. In general, institutional deliveries increased between 2007 and
2009 but none of the rural hospitals upgraded to first referral units is capable of performing caesarian sections.

  The Integrated Child Development Services Program is committed to improving the welfare of pregnant and lactating women, and children below six
years of age in India. The primary objective of the program is to improve the nutritional status of children less than three years of age. The major focus
is on children suffering from Grade I and Grade II category malnutrition, who constitute more than 50 percent of children enrolled under this scheme.

  In the Sundarbans, the referral of patients from basic to more sophisticated levels of care is considered an integral part of the allopathic health system,
which follows a hierarchical pattern of healthcare delivery. Health cases beyond the scope of treatment provided in a lower-tier (primary) health facility
are referred to a higher-tier (tertiary) facility. The block-level facilities serve as the referral hubs, or the gateways to higher levels of care.

  The engineering wing of SDB comprises five divisions and nine subdivisions. The chief engineer heads the engineering wing. Of the five divisions, four
are working divisions that directly implement the civil works scheme of the Board. The fifth division – the Survey, Investigation, and Design Division
– was created in 2003 to prepare drawings, designs, and estimates for different schemes and projects undertaken by the Board. Although most of the
technical staff members are deputed from other agencies, they usually remain there for a long time (having the opportunity to live in Kolkata with family
and commute to the work site daily). The chief engineer and his or her staff are responsible for the survey, design, and implementation of all
communication infrastructure projects, and the budget allocation to the area is increasing.

 The estimated health effects and associated costs do not include impacts from arsenic contamination in the groundwater. These health impacts are of
undetermined magnitude as data are not readily available to estimate the impacts. Also not included in the estimates are parasite infestations, typhoid, and
other diseases related to inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene, cardiovascular morbidity from household air pollution, and health effects among
adult males from household air pollution. In this respect, the estimates of health effects and their social cost should be considered conservative.

 Annual mortality among children under five is estimated based on a mortality rate of 60 per 1,000 live births, a crude birth rate of 23 per 1,000
population, and a total population of 4.4 million in the Sundarbans. The crude birth rate in the Sundarbans is assumed to be the same as reported for rural
West Bengal in NFHS 2005–06, adjusted to the year 2008. The cause-specific structure of child mortality is for all of India, as estimated by WHO (2010)
for the year 2008.
9
 Mortality caused by the effect of diarrhea on child nutritional status (child underweight) is estimated based on methodologies in World Bank 2008 and
Fishman et al. 2004. Prevalence of severe, moderate, and mild underweight among children under five years of age in the Sundarbans is estimated at 11
percent, 37 percent, and 32 percent, respectively, based on data in IIPS/Macro 2008, IIPS/MoHFW 2006, and IIHMR 2010.
10
  Diarrheal mortality among the population five years and older is estimated by applying the diarrheal mortality rates in India reported in WHO 2009 to
the population in the Sundarbans.
11
    Years of life lost are estimated according to WHO’s calculation of DALY using age weighting and a discount rate of 3 percent.
12
  Annual cases of diarrhea among children under five years of age are estimated from IIHMR 2010 and IIPS/Macro 2008 (NFHS 2005–06, rural West
Bengal). These two sources provide almost identical estimates of cases of diarrhea. Annual cases among the population five years and above are estimated
from international survyes, indicating that incidence of diarrhea among this population group is one-fifth of the incidence among children under five.
13
  The lower bound reflects valuation of health effects using the human capital value (HCV) for mortality and cost-of-illness (COI) aproach for morbidity.
The upper bound reflects using HCV for child mortality, VSL for adult mortality, and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for morbidity. HCV is estimated at INR
1.4 million for children under five and INR 0.39 million for adults. VSL for adults is estimated at INR 1.9 million. COI includes cost of medical treatment,
medicines, and time losses due to diarrhea. Cost of medical treatment and medicines is from IIHMR 2010. Cost of time losses is estimated at a rate of
50 percent of average hourly wage rate. Hourly wage rate is estimated at INR 19.8 (calculated based on an estimated annual income of INR 41,000 per
working person, 260 work days per year, and an eight-hour working day). WTP to avoid a case of diarrhea is assumed to be twice the estimated COI.
14
  GDP per capita in South 24 Parganas is estimated at INR 29,000 (US$725) in the year 2007-08, or approximately 85 percent of GDP per capita in West
Bengal (see http://www.indiastat.com). It is assumed here that GDP per capita in the Sundarbans is the same as in South 24 Parganas. GDP of the
Sundarbans in the year 2007-08 is, therefore, estimated at INR 125 billion, assuming a then population of 4.3 million.

  Key parameter values applied for estimating benefits and costs are: health effects from the use of an improved wood/biomass stove are 50 percent of
the effects from the use of an unimproved stove. Use of LPG eliminates the health effects from the use of unimproved wood/biomass stoves. Biomass
consumption when using an improved wood/biomass stove is 40 percent lower than when using an unimproved stove, resulting in an annual saving of
INR 900 per household per year. Use of an improved wood/biomass stove or LPG stove saves 30 or 45 minutes per household per day, respectively, in
cooking time compared to the use of an unimproved stove, resulting in annual time savings per household per year worth INR 1,810 for an improved
wood/biomass stove and INR 2,710 for an LPG stove (time savings valued at 50 percentof average wage rates). It is assumed that a program to promote
improved wood/biomass stoves (or LPG stoves) costs INR 200 per household adopting improved wood/biomass stoves or LPG stoves. The cost of an
improved wood/biomass stove is INR 300 (three years useful life; 10 percent discount rate). The cost of an LPG stove is INR 2,400 (10 years useful life;
10 percent discount rate). Estimated LPG consumption for cooking is 108 kg per household per year at an economic price of US$1.3 per kg.

  Key parameter values applied for estimating benefits and costs are: reduction in incidence of diarrhea is 32 percent from the use of an improved toilet
facility, 25 percent from provision of piped and treated water supply for drinking, 30 percent from household treatment of drinking water (by boiling),
and 45 percent from handwashing with soap at critical junctures. The cost of piped water supply ranges from INR 1,650 (low capital cost) to INR 3,600
(high capital cost) per person depending primarily on distance from the water source to served communities (20 years useful life; 10 percent discount
rate). The operations and maintenance cost is about INR 75 per person per year.The benefit of reduced water collection time is about INR 115 per person
per year (10 minutes per household per day, valued at 50 percent of average wage rate). Nonhealth benefits of increased water quantity for nondrinking
purposes from piped water supply compared to spot sources is valued at INR 20 per m2, or INR 255 per person per year. The cost of an improved pit
toilet with slab is about INR 2,500 per household (five years useful life; 10 percent discount rate). The operations and maintenance cost is about INR 25
per person per year. The benefit of reduced access time to place of defecation (relative to open defecation) is about INR 200 per person per year (five
minutes per person per day, valued at 50 percent of average wage rate for the household members 15 years of age and over). The annualized program cost
for promotion of handwashing with soap and household treatment of drinking water is nearly INR 200 per household adopting these practices, assuming
that these practices are sustained for two years. For handwashing, the cost of soap, incremental water consumption, and time used for handwashing (five
minutes per person per day, valued at 50 percent of average wage rate) is about INR 180, INR 40, and INR 300 per person per year, respectively. For
household treatment of drinking water, the cost of boiling water is about INR 60 for children under five years of age (0.5 liters per day), nearly INR 120
for the population five years and over (1 liter per day), and cost of time used for boiling of water (10 minutes per household per day, valued at 50 percent
of average wage rate) is INR 115 per person per year.

  In the Sundarbans, transport by waterway is often so challenging that students miss school regularly because of the poor reliability of the transport

 There is much literature pointing to the strong positive association between education and income. See, for example, Sianesi and Van Reenen 2000 and

Psacharopoulos 1985. There is a consensus in the existing literature that education is an important determinant of individual earnings in the long run as
well as long-term economic growth.

 Cropping intensity represents the number of crops that are harvested in a year from a given piece of land and is calculated as the ratio of gross cropped
area to net cropped area, expressed as a percentage. The higher the cropping intensity, the higher the gross returns to the farmer.

 Irrigation intensity is calculated as the ratio of net irrigated area to net sown area, expressed as a percentage. The higher the irrigation intensity, the higher
the cropping intensity, yield, and thereby the gross returns.

explicitly recognizes ecological mangrove restoration techniques through its definition of “planting,” which it defines to mean: “propagation of mangroves
or other tree species on land subject to project activity, and includes propagation using any of the following: (i) nursery raised seedlings or saplings;
(ii) propagules; (iii) direct sowing of seeds; (iv) human induced promotion of natural regeneration.”

  The Sundarbans Tiger Reserve’s transition and core areas include several wildlife sanctuaries. The Sajnekhali Wildlife Sanctuary, covering an area of
362.42 km2, is known as the transition zone (sometimes called the “buffer” zone), an area outside and north of the core area. In addition, there is the
Basihrat range, a subsidiary wilderness zone comprising 892.33 km2. The Forest Directorate has designated the transition zone as a multiple use zone to
allow tourist visitation and for regulating the harvest of resources to meet the needs of nearby residents. There are two additional wildlife sanctuaries
located to the southwest of the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve: Lothian Island Wildlife Sanctuary (38 km2) and Haliday Island Wildlife Sanctuary (5.95 km2).
The gateways to the Tiger Reserve and National Park at Canning, Sonakhali-Basanti, and Gosaba (Gadkhali) are located on the islands of Sandeshkali,
Basanti, and Gosaba, and form the northern boundary of the Tiger Reserve. There is a less frequented entry point at Bagna via Dhamakhali (Luna-Kelser
and Heyniger 2010).

 Mass tourism has been shown to be unsustainable in that it rapidly degrades natural and cultural resources. Mass tourism approaches tourism as a
22

commodity. It emphasizes marketing, with growth takes precedence over all other considerations, including the welfare of local people and environmental
conservation. According to Seema et al. (2006): “Mainstream tourism is geared towards tourist satisfaction and sustainable ecotourism, on the other hand,
has conservation (of nature and culture) and livelihoods (economic and educational benefits) as essential constituents.” Understanding the effects of
mass tourism provides further support for adopting an ecotourism approach in the Sundarbans, an especially sensitive area with unique and precious
assets.

  As part of the analytic work, a total of 96 visitors were surveyed. They stayed in three different locations: Sundarbans Tiger Camp (private); Sajnekhali
Tourist Lodge (government owned); and Sundarban Jungle Camp (private). The survey questionnaire contained 24 questions on visitors’ demographics,
perceptions about the location, suggestions for improvements, etc.

 In terms of a “trickle down [multiplier] effect”, the study revealed that the households who gained income from tourism did not contribute to the

economic growth of the village economy. For the tourism multiplier to have a wider economic impact, more local jobs need to be created in the area to

 Seasonal migration refers to migration during a work season. Occasional migration (for short periods of time) refers to migration when it is required (but
less than 90 days/year). Temporary migration is the out-migration of a single male (or sometimes female) member of a family, for a few days up to a year,
to a particular location to work and save, and to return home for awhile until such savings run out.

share a larger and more dependable pool of specialized labor.” A second subclass of agglomeration economies consists of “urbanization economies” (also
called inter-industry or between-industry economies). These “arise from a larger number of different industries in the same place…. [For example, a]
management consulting company can benefit from locating near business schools, financial service providers, and manufacturers” (World Bank 2009, p.

 Glaeser elaborates on the importance of cities in building human capital as follows: “People who come to urban areas don’t experience higher wage gains
overnight.Year by year, workers in cities have higher wage growth as they accumulate the skills that make them successful. Wage growth is particularly
faster in cities with more skilled workers. Two decades of extra job-market experience is associated with 10 percent more wage growth in skilled
metropolitan areas than in nonmetropolitan America, but only 3 percent more wage growth in less skilled metropolitan areas” (p. 36).

  In general, the term “economies of scale” is defined as follows: “The increase in the efficiency of production as the number of goods being produced
increases. Typically, a company that achieves economies of scale lowers the average cost per unit by increasing output, which spreads fixed costs over an
increased number of goods produced. There are two types of economies of scale: (1) external economies – the cost per unit depends on the size of the
industry, not that of the firm; and (2) internal economies – the cost per unit depends on the size of the individual firm” (http://financial-
dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Economies+of+Scale). Here is how a recent World Bank report defined the term: internal scale economies “arise from
the larger size of a plant to better exploit fixed costs…. [For example, a] larger steel mill can get volume discounts from suppliers – implying fixed costs
of transport and trade – and reap the benefits of dividing labor within the firm” (World Bank 2009).

 One of the major rail routes is between Baruipur station and Namkhana station via Kakdwip (83.3 km); it is the gateway to the southwestern part of
the Sundarbans, especially for access to Sagar Island. There are 17 railway stations on the route from Sealdah to Namkhana. The rail route between
Sonarpur station and Canning (29 km) is the gateway to the tourist attraction areas towards Gosaba. Five railway stations are on the route between
Sealdah and Canning. Most rail lines were built to meet the official needs of the British administration in the late 1800s.

 The engineering wing of SDB comprises five divisions and nine subdivisions. The chief engineer heads the engineering wing. Of the five divisions, four
are working divisions that directly implement the civil works scheme of the Board. The fifth division – the Survey, Investigation, and Design Division
– was created in 2003 to prepare drawings, designs, and estimates for different schemes and projects undertaken by the Board. Although most of the
technical staff members are deputed from other agencies, they usually remain there for a long time (having the opportunity to live in Kolkata with family
and commute to the work site daily). The chief engineer and his or her staff are responsible for the survey, design, and implementation of all communication
infrastructure projects, and the budget allocation to the area is increasing.

  Indoor air pollution due to use of traditional biomass-based stoves for household cooking is associated with harmful health effects that include acute
respiratory illness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, tuberculosis, and other diseases. Also, household smoke, from use of wood,
charcoal or coal, dung, and straw for cooking causes an increase in blood pressure, which, in turn, increases risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.

  The India Ministry of Power launched the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana as its flagship program in March 2005 with the objective to
electrify over 100,000 unelectrified villages and to provide free electricity connections to 23.4 million rural BPL households. Under the program, an
electricity distribution infrastructure was envisaged that would establish a rural electricity distribution system with 33/11 kilovolt substations, a village
electrification infrastructure with at least a distribution transformer in each village or hamlet, and stand-alone grids with generation where grid supply
was not feasible.

  According to MoEF (2013), as far as legal protection of the Sundarbans area is concerned, GoI notified the Wetland (Conservation Management) Rules-
2010 vide notification no. GSR-951 (E), dated December 4, 2010. Sundarban has not yet been notified under the said rules, but options exist to notify
Sundarban under this specific rule. As per the Wetlands Rules, some activities are prohibited in the notified wetlands and some are allowed with the
approval of the Central Wetland Regulatory Authority (CWRA) which need to be taken into account while synergizing activities in the area; details of
prohibited activities and those with approval of CWRA are:
Prohibited Activities:
- Reclamation of wetlands;
- Setting up of new industries and expansion of existing industries;
- Manufacture or handling or storage or disposal of hazardous substances;
- Solid waste dumping: existing practices to be phased out within a period not exceeding six months;

  Under the amended Wildlife (Protection) Act, 2002, “the State Government may, where the community or an individual has volunteered to conserve
wildlife and its habitat, declare any private or community land not comprised within a National Park, sanctuary or a conservation reserve, as a community
reserve, for protecting fauna, flora and traditional or cultural conservation values and practices.” Once such a reserve is declared, its land use cannot not
be changed, except in accordance with a resolution passed by the management committee and its approval by the state government. A community reserve
management committee is constituted by the state government, which shall be the authority responsible for conserving, maintaining, and managing the
community reserve. This committee has five representatives nominated by the village Panchayat (institution of local self-governance), or where such a
Panchayat does not exist by the members of the Gram Sabha (village assembly) and one representative of the state forests or wildlife department under
whose jurisdiction the community reserve is located. This committee is the competent authority to prepare and implement the management plan for the
community reserve and to take steps to ensure the protection of wildlife and its habitat in the reserve. Source: Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, as
amended in 2002.

  “The State Government may, after having consultations with the local communities, declare any area owned by the Government, particularly the areas
adjacent to National Parks and sanctuaries and those areas which link one protected area with another, as a conservation reserve for protecting landscapes,
seascapes, flora and fauna and their habitat. Provided that where the conservation reserve includes any land owned by the Central Government, its prior
concurrence shall be obtained before making such declaration.” A conservation reserve management committee is constituted by the state government
to advise the chief wildlife warden to conserve, manage, and maintain the conservation reserve. This committee consists of a representative of the forest
or wildlife department, who shall be the member secretary of the committee, one representative of each village Panchayat in whose jurisdiction the
reserve is located, three representatives of NGOs working in the field of wildlife conservation, and one representative each from the department of
agriculture and animal husbandry. Source: Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, as amended in 2002.

  In the Sundarbans, reference is sometimes made to a “high-risk zone,” which is an area that overlaps with both the core area and the transition zone.
The high-risk zone includes all legally protected areas, the Reserve Forest, and the fringe area (the belt on the periphery of the forest and the area
impacted by Cyclone Aila). Legally, there should be no residents in the core area. Thus, the concern is with removing people from the parts of the
transition zone impacted by Cyclone Aila.

 According to North (1990), “Institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human
interaction.” Institutions can be formal (such as laws) and informal (including conventions and codes of behavior). North further states that “the formal
and informal rules and the type and effectiveness of enforcement shape the whole character of the game.” Organizations, which are different from
institutions, can be thought of as the players of the game.

    The extent of mangrove reserve forests in the Sundarbans is
    approximately 4,260 km2, of which 55percent is land and the

    natural or near-natural areas set aside to protect large-scale ecological
    processes, and the species and ecosystems characteristic of the
    area. Indian national parks also provide a foundation for

    of an area of ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural,
    or zoological significance that is adequate for the purposes of
    protecting, propagating, or developing wildlife or wildlife habitat.
    Protection measures are stringent in wildlife sanctuaries and

the low tide line and the high tide line, are designated as CRZ-I. This zone includes areas containing mangroves, national parks, sanctuaries, reserve
forests, wildlife habitats, and biosphere reserves, all of which exist in the forested part of the Sundarbans.

 In 2008, the Delta Committee completed its report, with proposals for long-term planning (Delta Committee 2008). The report called for an increasing
reliance on natural systems (dunes, tidal dynamics, bioshields) to protect high-value areas while abandoning some productive but lower-value areas; it also
identified an extensive set of enabling laws and regulations that would need to be implemented to realize this vision. A related report also promoted a
“Faster and Better” principle as a means to address the problem that “the need in our consensus-based culture to unite the virtually irreconcilable in many
cases […] does not advance because of the administrative and political incapacity to take decisions or, once a decision has been taken, to actually
implement it” (Elverding et al. 2008).

 As part of the NLTA, a study tour was organized in 2010 for GoWB officials to visit the area affected by Hurricane Katrina in the United States;
participants met in New Orleans with experts from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other organizations engaged in post-Katrina follow-up work.
Participants in the study tour learned about use of storm prediction systems and disaster management response methods, as well as measures to expand
protection against hurricanes and associated floods. Participants found the tour informative. Some of the risk management systems that were discussed
have been considered as potential candidates for future use in West Bengal.

 NGOs and civil society have argued that the said act was in contravention of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972, which requires critical tiger habitats
to be kept “inviolate,” including through removal of people from areas notified as tiger habitats. Identification of people living in forests, including those
who depend on forest produce or are members of Scheduled Tribes, is supposed to be done through the Gram Sabha of the respective area, before an
area is notified as a tiger habitat. However, there are allegations that authorities have used this tool to deny the rights of individuals and communities
to access forests and their produce.
