2   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014
Introduction
This document should be read in conjunction with the International Development Association’s (IDA)
financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis issued for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.
IDA undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Box 1 provides IDA’s selected
financial data as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2014 (FY15 YTD) and September 30, 2013
(FY14 YTD) as well as for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.

I.            Organizational Overview and Business Model
IDA is an international organization established in 1960 and is owned by its 173 member countries. It is the
world’s largest multilateral channel for providing concessional financing and knowledge services to the
world’s poorest countries.
IDA complements the other entities within the World Bank Group (WBG1), which share the overarching goals
of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. IDA plays a pivotal role in the global aid
architecture and pursues these twin goals by providing concessional development credits, grants and
guarantees to its recipient member countries for programs and operations that help meet their development
needs. IDA provides technical assistance through reimbursable advisory services and policy advice, global
knowledge services through economic sector work and country studies. In addition, IDA provides or facilitates
financing through trust fund partnerships with bilateral and multilateral donors.
IDA also supports member countries with disaster risk financing to help increase their financial resilience
against natural disasters, as part of their broader disaster risk management agenda.
The resources available to IDA for funding its lending activities constitute its commitment authority. IDA
finances its development credit, grant and guarantee commitments primarily from partner contributions, funds
from its internal resources, as well as transfers from IBRD’s net income, and grants designated out of IFC’s
retained earnings. Since IDA’s lending is highly concessional, its resources are periodically replenished. Since
its inception, IDA’s resources have been replenished seventeen times, complemented by an additional
replenishment agreed to in 2006 for financing the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative ( MDRI). Details of the
Seventeenth Replenishment of IDA’s Resources (IDA17), which commenced July 1, 2014, are provided in
Chart 1.

II.           Funding And Resource Allocation
The funding of IDA’s lending, grant financing and guarantee activities are presented and discussed below.
Sources of Funds
Partner Resources (Subscriptions and Contributions and Borrowings from Partners): IDA finances its new
commitments for development credits and development grants primarily through partner resources. The partner
resources that are in the form of subscriptions and contributions are assigned voting rights. Prior to IDA17,
IDA had never entered into long-term borrowings, even though it is allowed to do so under its Articles.
Contributions from members remain at the core of IDA’s financing framework, however a number of
exceptional circumstances, have created a case for using a limited amount of concessional debt funding,
“borrowings from partners”, to ensure sufficient commitment authority for IDA17. These circumstances
include, the current low interest rate envirornment, unique resource constraints for a number of contributing
partners, and the transitional support for eligible new graduating countries during IDA17.
Internal Resources: These primarily comprise contractual principal repayments (including any accelerated
repayments and voluntary prepayments), interest income on blend term credits, income from the investment
portfolio and any carryover of residual resources from previous replenishments.

    The other institutions of the World Bank Group are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance
    Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).



                                                                          IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014                    3
           Transfers and Grants from affiliated organizations and trust funds: These are primarily transfers from
           IBRD’s net income and grants from IFC’s retained earnings.
           Applications of Funds
           Disbursement of development credits and grants: Through its development operations, IDA’s development
           credits, grants and guarantees benefit the poorest and least creditworthy countries.
           Administrative Expenses: IDA’s policy is to maintain its service and commitment charges at a level that will
           cover its administrative expenses. Commitment charges are set annually and take into account the extent to
           which service and certain interest charges, and partner compensation for development grant financing and
           forgone charges on development credits forgiven under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC)
           and the MDRI, cover administrative expenses. For FY15, commitment charges are set at nil. Management is
           undertaking an expenditure review to help identify how resources can be redirected to more effectively support
           the WBG strategy.
           Commitment Authority
           On May 5, 2014, the Board of Governors adopted the resolution approving IDA17, under which a global
           coalition of 46 developed and developing countries pledged contributions toward the total IDA17 lending
           envelope. The revised IDA17 lending envelope amounts to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 33.54 billion (USD
           equivalent $50.56 billion). IDA17 will become effective when Instruments of Commitment (IoC’s) and loan
           agreements for SDR11.66 billion (USD equivalent $17.57 billion) are received. At September 30, 2014, SDR
           8.45 billion (USD equivalent $12.73 billion) had been received.
           Subsequently, on November [ ], 2014, IDA17 became effective when receipts of IoCs and loan agreements
           exceeded the effectiveness threshold.
           Chart 1 provides a breakdown of the principal sources making up the total lending envelope under the revised
           IDA17 Commitment Authority Framework and the extent to which these sources have been used for
           commitments of development credits, grants and guarantees through September 30, 2014.
           Chart 1 : IDA17 Commitment Authority Status
                                                    a
           In billions of U.S. dollars equivalent




           a. Commitment Authority is measured and monitored in SDR. The chart represents the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts for presentational
               purposes only, based on the IDA17 foreign exchange reference rate of USD/SDR 1.50718. Actual commitments are recorded based on
               historical USD rates.
           b. Amounts may not add due to rounding.
           c. Includes U.S.dollar equivalent 4.5 billion of partner commitments for compensation of debt relief provided under MDRI.


           III.       Basis of Reporting
           IDA prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
           States of America (U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the “reported basis”. The financial statements
           provide a basis upon which users are able to analyze IDA’s sources and applications of resources. Under the
           reported basis, IDA’s Statement of Income does not reflect the full economic results of IDA due to a number of
           asymmetries, which are explained in detail in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the
           fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.

IV.       Statement of Activities Analysis
The Statement of Activities (Table 1) is designed to reflect how IDA manages its sources and applications of
funds in executing its operating activities. The Statement of Activities presents the flows associated with IDA’s
operating activities and the impact of these activities on the net asset value of IDA’s investment portfolio. This
presentation addresses the majority of the asymmetries (explained in detail in IDA’s June 30, 2014 MD&A)
embedded in IDA’s reported basis results.

Results from Operating Activities
IDA’s operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of $220 million for FY15 YTD. This primarily reflects
the $612 million of cash receipts relating to members’ subscriptions and contributions, $1,000 million of cash
receipts relating to borrowings from partners, $953 million of cash receipts relating to principal repayments,
partially offset by $2,462 million of outflows for disbursements.
IDA’s core liquidity position as of September 30, 2014 is sufficient to cover approximately 7 months of
average monthly gross disbursements, which is below the historical range of 9 to 14 months for the fiscal years
ending June 30, 2010 through 2014. The primary driver for the decline in IDA’s liquidity position was the
depreciation of the SDR against the USD. See Section VII for more details on IDA’s core liquidity position.
IDA’s funding position at September 30, 2014 was 72%, as compared to 71% at June 30, 2014. The remaining
funding gap will primarily be covered by future receipts of cash, demand notes already committed by partners
and repayments on outstanding credits. At all times, IDA enters into new commitments based on the
commitment authority available. See Section II for further details on IDA’s Commitment Authority.

           The following are additional details of the key drivers of IDA’s results from operating activities:
           Members’ subscriptions and contributions
           The subscriptions and contributions of $612 million represent the cash contributions received from members
           and the encashment of demand notes. This excludes $66 million of member contributions received to finance
           foregone charges for debt relief and development grant financing, which is reflected as part of administrative
           activities.
           Borrowings from Partners
           Concessional partner loans were introduced in IDA17 to increase the lending envelope available to recipient
           countries by incorporating a limited amount of debt funding into the financing framework in a sustainable
           manner. Five partners have agreed to provide loans totaling US$ 4.4 billion.
           As of September 30, 2014, IDA had signed loan agreements totaling $3 billion with three of the five partners
           and had received all of the loan proceeds under one of those agreements. That agreement comprises a loan of
           $1 billion and a grant of $179 million. In order to comply with the interest rate terms under the IDA17
           concessional loan framework, the proceeds have been invested in a fixed return instrument with the IFC over
           the life of the loan.
           Transfers and Grants from Affiliated Organizations and Trust Funds
           On October 10, 2014, IBRD’s Board of Governors approved a transfer to IDA of $635 million, under IDA17.
           This transfer was received on October 14, 2014.
           Development Credit and Grant Disbursements
           Gross disbursements of development credits and
           grants during FY15 YTD were $2,462 million,                                    Gross Disbursements
                                                                      USD Mns
           an increase of $168 million from FY14 YTD. In
           terms of regional focus, disbursements to Africa          FY 15 YTD                1,901           561
           and South Asia cumulatively increased by $443
           million, while disbursements to East Asia and             FY 14 YTD               1,749         545
           Pacific decreased by $221 million. Africa and
           South Asia together accounted for 80% of the                          0             1,000      2,000              3,000
           total gross disbursements during FY15 YTD.
                                                                                 Development Credits    Development Grants
           Of the $1,901 million in development credit                (Includes adjustments for certain PPA activity)
           disbursements, 51% related to commitments
           made under IDA16, 39% under IDA15, 9%
           under IDA14 and the remaining 1% related to commitments made under earlier replenishments.
           The $16 million increase in development grants disbursed in FY15 YTD as compared to FY14 YTD was
           driven by increases to the Africa region.
           The WBG is mobilizing a financing package of more than $500 million for the countries hardest hit by the
           Ebola crisis, including $230 million towards emergency funding, through IDA’s Crisis Response Window. Of
           the $230 million in emergency funding, $117 million has already been disbursed, comprised of $58 million for
           Liberia, $34 million for Sierra Leone and $25 million for Guinea.

                                                                     IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014             7
           Development Credits Outstanding and Accumulated Provision for Debt Relief and for Losses on
           Development Credits
           Development credits outstanding decreased by $4,417 million during FY15 YTD, primarily due to negative
           translation adjustments of $5,362 million resulting from the 4.1% depreciation of the SDR against the U.S
           dollar. This was partially offset by net positive disbursements of $948 million.
           Investment Assets, net of related Liabilities
           The net investment portfolio decreased from $28,300 million as of June 30, 2014 to $27,276 million as of
           September 30, 2014, a decrease of $1,024 million. The main driver for the decrease was the $1,068 million
           negative impact of exchange rate movements, reflecting the depreciation of the Euro, JPY and GBP against the
           USD. The remaining difference reflects the net results of IDA’s cash related operating activities, including the
           borrowings from partners and subsequent investment with the IFC, and the effects of non-operating items
           (primarily unrealized mark to mark gains/losses). See Section IV for variance analysis of operating activities.
           Subscriptions and Contributions
           The $37 million increase in subscriptions and contributions paid-in is primarily attributable to the receipt from
           members of $373 million of demand notes and $217 million of cash contributions. This was substantially offset
           by a negative translation adjustment of $553 million.

           VI.       Financial Risk
           IDA is subject to four main types of financial risk: funding risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk.
           Funding Risk is managed using the Commitment Authority Framework and monitored, in part, by the funding
           position ratio, see Section II, Funding And Resource Allocation and Section VII, Funding and Liquidity
           Positions.
           Liquidity Risk is managed through a combination of cash flow monitoring, timing of partner contributions
           and investment policies. IDA’s liquidity position is a key indicator of liquidity management; see Section VII,
           Funding and Liquidity Positions.
           Credit Risk includes two types: Country credit risk and Commercial credit risk.
           Country credit risk is primarily managed by the IDA Resource Mobilization Department which regularly
           reviews the credit risk of its recipient countries in terms of the country’s debt sustaining capacity. These
           reviews provide an input into the composition of development credits versus grants for new operations. The
           credit risk department is responsible for determining the adequacy of provisions for losses on credits and other
           exposures.
           Table 4 provides details of the top five borrowers with the largest development credits outstanding as of
           September 30, 2014. These borrowers represented 50% of total development credits outstanding as of that date.

8   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014
Commercial Credit Risk: The monitoring and managing of this risk is a continuous process due to changing
market conditions. IDA's investments commercial counterparty credit risk is concentrated in investments in
debt instruments issued by sovereign governments, agencies, corporate entities and banks, as shown in Table
5. The credit quality of IDA’s investment portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit
spectrum, with 96% of the portfolio rated AA or above, reflecting IDA’s continued preference for highly rated
securities and counterparties across all categories of financial instruments. Total commercial counterparty
credit exposure, net of collateral held, was $29.7 billion as of September 30, 2014.

Market Risk: IDA faces foreign exchange risk with respect to its future partner contributions, which it
manages by economically hedging using currency forwards and by rebalancing the currency composition of its
investment portfolio. Interest rate risk on its investment portfolio is managed by aligning the duration of the
investment portfolio with that of the projected net cash requirements. The impact of these strategies is shown
on IDA’s Statement of Income, however, the economic offset is not reported. Further details on these
asymmetries can be seen in IDA’s June 30, 2014 MD&A. The analysis below discusses the impact of these
activities on IDA’s Statement of Income and the economic offset.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The payable leg of the currency forward contracts economically hedging partner pledges are denominated in
non-functional currencies. Appreciation (depreciation) of these currencies against the U.S. dollar results in
exchange rate losses (gains), which are reported in the Statement of Income.
The translation adjustment gain on non-functional currencies of $389 million in FY15 YTD was due to the
depreciation of the non-functional currencies against the U.S. dollar. This was offset by the translation
adjustment on the economic offset to the currency forward contracts; the future inflows from partners, which
was a loss of $479 million in FY15 YTD. In contrast, the translation adjustment loss on non-functional
currencies of $88 million in FY14 YTD was due to the appreciation of the non-functional currencies against
the U.S. dollar. This was offset by the translation adjustment on the economic offset to the currency forward
contracts; the future inflows from partners, which was a gain of $90 million in FY14 YTD.
The differences between the reported translation adjustments and the related translation adjustments on the
economic offsets primarily represent the translation adjustments on the partner contributions in non-functional
currencies that are not economically hedged through forward contracts.
Interest Rate Risk
The primary objective in the management of IDA’s investment-trading portfolio is to provide a ready source of
liquidity to meet projected net cash requirements. Accordingly, IDA’s assets are invested so that their duration
closely matches the duration of these projected net cash requirements. Given IDA’s lengthy disbursement
profile, the duration of IDA’s investment-trading portfolio is therefore relatively long. This long duration,
combined with volatility in market interest rates, results in significant year-on-year variability in unrealized
mark-to-market gains/losses on the portfolio. The economic offset to the unrealized mark-to-market
gains/losses on the investment portfolio would be the change in the present value of the projected net cash
outflows.



                                                          IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014     9
           IDA’s investment-trading portfolio had a duration of approximately three years as of September 30, 2014, and
           has two components: core liquidity and partner asset and liability management. During FY15 YTD, the
           investment-trading portfolio experienced unrealized mark-to-market gains of $53 million, compared with gains
           of $14 million experienced in FY14 YTD. The higher gains in FY15 YTD were due to the more pronounced
           flattening of the yield curves for the major currencies.
           During FY15, IDA purchased a debt security issued by the IFC. While IDA intends to hold the security to
           maturity, IDA elected to measure the security at fair value, so that the measurement method (fair value) could
           be consistently applied to all its investments. The changes in fair value for this security are reflected in the
           Condensed Statement of Income. This security is being held in the non-trading investment portfolio.
           The non-trading portfolios, incurred mark-to-market losses of $91 million during FY15 YTD, principally
           consisting of i) unrealized mark-to-market losses of $56 million on the currency forward contracts during
           FY15 YTD, as compared to losses of $4 million in FY14 YTD, resulting from the more pronounced downward
           movement of yield curves of the majority of the payable currencies during FY15 YTD; and ii) unrealized
           mark-to-market losses of $34 million on investments with IFC during FY15 YTD. See Section IV.

           VII.     Funding and Liquidity Positions
           Management monitors IDA’s funding and liquidity positions to assess IDA’s ability to conduct its operations.
           Since IDA has not borrowed from the capital markets, even though it is allowed to do so under its Articles of
           Agreement, it is important that IDA has sufficient funding resources and liquidity to meet its contractual
           obligations to disburse approved development credits and grants in a timely manner.
           Funding Position                                          Liquidity Position




           As of September 30, 2014, the investment portfolio        As of September 30, 2014, core liquidity accounted
           and unrestricted demand notes covered 72% of all          for $8,376 million (June 30, 2014 - $9,902 million),
           undisbursed commitments of development credits and        comprising short-term and medium-term investments.
           grants as compared to 71% at June 30, 2014.               IDA’s liquidity position was sufficient to cover
           In the last 5 years, IDA’s funding position has ranged    approximately 7 months of average monthly gross
           from 71% to 81%.                                          disbursements, below the 5 year historical range of 9
                                                                     to 14 months of average monthly gross disbursements
                                                                     since FY10. The primary driver for the decline in
                                                                     IDA’s liquidity position was the depreciation of the
                                                                     SDR against the USD.

14      IDA CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 (UNAUDITED)
NOTES TO CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2014
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been
derived from the June 30, 2014 audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management,
the condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IDA’s
financial position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for debt relief and losses on development credits and other
exposures, and valuation of certain financial instruments carried at fair value. The results of operations for the first
three months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full
year.
Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation.
These financial statements were available for issuances on November 12, 2014, which was also the date through
which IDA’s management evaluated subsequent events.
Accounting and Reporting Developments
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IDA continues to assess the impact
on its business. As of September 30, 2014, IDA believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its
business.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The ASU
provides a common framework for revenue recognition for US GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards, and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance in US GAAP. The core principle of the
guidance is that an entity recognizes revenue when it transfers control of promised goods and services to customers
in an amount that reflects consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled. The ASU also requires additional
quantitative and qualitative disclosures to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing,
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. For IDA, the ASU will be effective
in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, with early adoption permitted. IDA is currently evaluating the impact of this
ASU on its financial statements.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity
Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. The ASU requires repurchase-to-maturity transactions and
some repurchase financing arrangements to be accounted for as secured borrowings. It also requires additional
disclosures about certain transactions accounted for as sales and about the nature of collateral pledged for
transactions accounted for as secured borrowings. For IDA, the ASU will be effective during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2016, with early adoption permitted. IDA is currently evaluating this ASU but does not expect the ASU
to have a significant impact on its financial statements since all IDA’s repurchase agreements are already
accounted for as secured borrowings.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements (Subtopic 205-40): Going
Concern - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The ASU provides
guidance on management's responsibilities in evaluating the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and for
the related financial statement disclosures. Until now, guidance related to this topic was provided under U.S.
auditing standards, which do not govern management’s disclosures. Under this ASU, each reporting period,
management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued (or available
to be issued). For IDA, the ASU will be effective from the quarter ending September 30, 2016. IDA is currently
evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements.

     a. Includes restricted cash subscriptions of less than $1 million as of June 30, 2014.

     During the three months ended September 30, 2014, IDA encashed demand obligations totaling $461 million.

     NOTE C—INVESTMENTS
     The investment securities held by IDA are designated as either trading or non-trading (with fair value option).
     These securities are carried and reported at fair value, or at face value which approximates fair value.
     On August 25, 2014, IDA purchased a debt security issued by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). While
     IDA intends to hold the security to maturity, IDA elected to measure the security at fair value, so that the
     measurement method (fair value) is consistently applied to all its investments. The changes in fair value for this
     security are reflected in the Condensed Statement of Income. This security is being held in the non-trading
     investment portfolio. For details regarding this transaction, see Note G- Affiliated Organizations.
     As of September 30, 2014,IDA’s investments primarily comprised government and agency obligations (84%),
     with all the instruments being classified as either Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
     A summary of IDA’s Investments at September 30, 2014 and June 30, 2014, is as follows:

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of investments.
Investment securities
Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include
futures contracts and most government and agency securities.
For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined based on model-based
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and prepayment spreads. Where
applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default, and loss severity are
used.
Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are reported at face value which approximates fair value.
Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and securities lent
under securities lending agreements
These securities are of a short term nature and are reported at face value, which approximates fair value.

     Commercial Credit Risk
     For the purpose of risk management, IDA is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve
     elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible
     nonperformance by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IDA limits
     trading to a list of authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, credit limits have been established for
     counterparties by type of instrument and maturity category.
     Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through a credit approval process, volume limits, monitoring
     procedures and the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements. IDA may require collateral in the form of cash
     or other approved liquid securities from individual counterparties to mitigate its credit exposure.
     IDA has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting provisions.
     These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk with financial
     assets subject to a master derivatives arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the extent that
     payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a result of these
     netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new transactions.
     The extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of time following
     the balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions, see note E-Derivative
     Instruments.
     Securities Lending: IDA may engage in securities lending and repurchases, against adequate collateral, as well as
     securities borrowing and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations and ABS.
     These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow IDA
     to reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. As of September 30, 2014, amounts which could
     potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master netting arrangements were $723 million ($497
     million-June 30, 2014).
     Transfers of securities by IDA to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as the accounting criteria for the
     treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase
     date.
     The following is a summary of the carrying amount of the securities transferred under repurchase or securities
     lending agreements, and the related liabilities, as of September 30, 2014 and June 30, 2014:

     As of September 30, 2014, the liabilities relating to securities transferred under repurchase or securities lending
     agreements included $318 million ($415 million—June 30, 2014) of repurchase agreement trades that had not
     settled at that date. As of September 30, 2014, there were no replacement trades entered into in anticipation of
     maturing trades of a similar amount ($159 million—June 30, 2014).

     In the case of resale agreements, IDA received collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to repledge
     these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the securities received
     are not recorded on IDA’s balance sheet as the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have not been met. As of
     September 30, 2014, securities purchased under resale agreements included $383 million of securities which had
     not settled on that date ($1,156 million—June 30, 2014). For the remaining purchases, IDA received securities
     with a fair value of $709 million ($746 million—June 30, 2014). Out of this amount, $20 million of these securities
     had been transferred under repurchase or securities lending agreements ($70 million—June 30, 2014).

Offsetting assets and liabilities
IDA enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IDA the
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in
the event of default by the counterparty.
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.
The following table summarizes information on derivative assets and liabilities (before and after netting
adjustments) that are reflected on IDA’s Condensed Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2014 and June 30, 2014.
Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of
legally enforceable master netting agreements. The net derivative asset positions have been further reduced by the
cash and securities collateral received.

Inter-level transfers
During the three months ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013, there were no inter-level transfers in
the derivatives portfolio.
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, interest swaps and currency swaps, and TBA securities.
These are valued using the standard discounted cash flow methods using market observable inputs such as yield
curves, foreign exchange rates and basis spreads and funding spreads.

NOTE F—DEVELOPMENT CREDITS AND OTHER EXPOSURES
Development credits and other exposures are generally made directly to member countries of IDA. Other
exposures include irrevocable commitments, guarantees and repaying project preparation facilities.
Development credits are carried and reported at amortized cost. Of the total development credits outstanding as of
September 30, 2014, 90% were to the South Asia, Africa, and East Asia and Pacific regions combined.
Based on IDA’s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of the development credits outstanding are in the
Medium and High risk classes.
As of September 30, 2014, development credits outstanding totaling $2,660 million (representing about 2% of the
portfolio) from five borrowers, were in nonaccrual status.
Credit Quality of Sovereign Development Credits
Based on an evaluation of IDA’s development credits, management has determined that IDA has one portfolio
segment — Sovereign Exposures. Development credits constitute the majority of sovereign exposures.
IDA’s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay IDA on time and in
full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of
both quantitative and qualitative factors. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IDA’s exposures,
exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the
likelihood of loss: Low, Medium and High risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status.
IDA’s borrowers’ country risk ratings are key determinants in the provisions for development credit losses.
IDA considers a development credit to be past due when a borrower fails to make payment on any principal,
service, interest or other charges due to IDA, on the dates provided in the contractual development credit
agreements.
The following tables provide an aging analysis of development credits outstanding as of September 30, 2014 and
June 30, 2014:

     Accumulated Provision for Losses on Development Credits, Debt Relief (HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI)
     and Other Exposures
     Provision for Losses on Development Credits and Other Exposures
     Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provision for losses, which reflects the probable
     losses inherent in IDA’s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of losses arising from default and
     nonpayment of principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Management reassesses the adequacy of the
     accumulated provision on a periodic basis and adjustments are recorded as a charge against or addition to revenue.
     Provision for Debt Relief
     HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI provisions are based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of various factors,
     including estimates of Decision Point and Completion Point dates. These factors are reviewed periodically as part
     of the reassessment of the adequacy of the accumulated provision for debt relief. Provisions are released as
     qualifying debt service becomes due and is forgiven under the HIPC Debt Initiative, and are reduced by the
     amount of the eligible development credits written off when the country reaches Completion Point, and becomes
     eligible for MDRI debt relief.

     Changes to the accumulated provision for losses on development credits and other exposures, as well as the debt
     relief under HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and the fiscal year
     ended June 30, 2014 are summarized below:

Investments: See Note C

Due from Banks: The carrying amount of unrestricted and restricted cash is considered a reasonable estimate of the
fair value of these positions.
