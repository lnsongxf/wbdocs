        The Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and the Value Added Tax (VAT) constitute the workhorse of
the Vietnam tax system and each generates about 7% of GDP in revenues. Together they account for
almost two-thirds of the total tax revenues. Their revenue performance compares well with most of the
neighboring ASEAN countries.

        Prior to the introduction of a VAT, Vietnam had adopted a turnover tax in October 1990 which
was replaced by a VAT in 1999. Several rounds of amendments have been carried out since then with
some major changes adopted in 2003, 2006, and 2008. Further changes have been recently approved by
the National Assembly (NA) in 2013 and are due for implementation. Similarly, a profits tax was first
introduced in 1990 and was subsequently replaced by CIT in its present form in 1999. It has since been
amended in 2003, 2008 and the NA has again legislated some changes in 2013 with a view to removing
some anomalies and providing a more business-friendly tax environment.

        The government of Vietnam has thus made great strides in putting into place a modern tax
system. The tax structure however is still evolving to keep pace with continued changes in domestic
economy as well as the global environment. The recent amendments approved in 2013 by the National
Assembly in the two tax laws are meant to further rationalize the tax system, make it more transparent in
order to enhance Vietnam’s investment friendly image while at the same time maintaining revenue
adequacy and buoyancy of the revenue system.

        This report was prepared as a collaborative product of the World Bank in Vietnam and the Tax
Policy Department (TPD) of Ministry of Finance (MOF) in the context of preparation for amending the
Corporate Income Tax Law and the Value Added Tax Law. The report focuses not only on evaluating the
corporate income tax and the value added tax as they stand today, but also going a step further offering
comments on addressing pending issues for the subsequent deliberations by the authorities in the future
and in particular in view of the international experience to contribute to the implementation of the
Government’s Financial Development Strategy and Tax Reform Strategy 2011-2020. The report is
expected to deepen analysis, in particular in policy area of enabling business environment, to justify the
World Bank’s support through series of Economic Management and Competitiveness Credit (EMCCs), as
well as maximize synergy with the implementation of Tax Administration Modernization Project
(TAMP) financially and technically assisted by the World Bank.

         The study is in two parts, part one covering the various policy aspects of Corporate Income Tax
(CIT) and includes issues such as expenses and deductions to determine the tax base, transfer pricing, thin
capitalization, taxation of special entities, and tax incentives. All this is done in the backdrop of
international experience of corporate income taxes applied globally. Finally, alternatives for rate
rationalization and their impact on CIT revenues using a forecasting model are examined. The existing
provisions of the law are referenced in this part of the study as well, and further scope for reform
discussed as necessary.

         Part two of the study presents a similar analysis of value added tax as well as forecasting of VAT
revenues. This chapter examines the present rate structure including zero-rating, exemptions and
exclusions from VAT, and VAT refunds. Taxation of some special sectors such as agriculture, real estate
and exports is also analyzed. All this is again done in the milieu of international experience of value
added taxes in OECD countries, BRICS countries and the countries of ASEAN so as to get a practical and
realistic picture. Finally, a revenue forecasting model for VAT is presented with a guideline for
estimating VAT threshold for exempting small traders. All the chapters make reference to the present
provisions in law and also the way forward to further strengthen and streamline the VAT.
        As mentioned earlier, tax reform is more of an evolutionary rather than a onetime exercise. This
study should therefore be read as a reference document for the existing tax laws of CIT and VAT, their
strong and weak points and what remains to be done. The international experience included in both parts
helps validate the suggestions and proposals for future tax reform.

        The executive summary presents the findings of the study along with the way forward for both
the taxes, first CIT and then VAT.

The Corporate Income Tax (CIT)

        The latest amendments in the CIT law were made recently in June 2013. Following the
World Bank’s policy dialogue with the Government of Vietnam, the CIT Law of 2008 was revised in
June, 2013. The revised law includes the following significant changes.

Expansion in Tax Base and Exemptions

         All resident establishments of a foreign enterprise are liable to pay CIT tax in Vietnam
          irrespective of source of income.
         “Other income” in category of taxable income now includes income from the transfer of
          investment projects, transfer of the right to participate in investment projects, to do
          exploration, mining and processing and right to utilize assets including intellectual property.
         There are now four new tax exempt categories including incomes from the transfers of the
          Certificates of Emission Reduction (CERs). Incomes of the State Development Bank of
          Vietnam (VDB) and the Vietnam Social Policy Bank (VSPB) are also tax-exempt.


                                                    5
Deductible Expenses

         Bank transfer vouchers are required for deductibility of expenses over of VND 20 million,
          while the cap for advertisement/promotional expenses has been increased from 10% to 15%
          for all enterprises.
         Funding for only certain categories of donations are allowed, all others are denied.
         A new category of non-deductible expenses has been added: voluntary contributions to the
          pension fund or social security to employees of the businesses are non-deductible in excess of
          certain norms.

Tax Rates

         A significant change has been made in tax rates: the standard CIT rate has been reduced from
          25% to 22% and further reduced to 20% from January 1, 2016.
         Enterprises with total revenue of less than VND 20 billion (US$1 million) are liable to pay
          CIT at a lower rate of 20%, rate for minerals income remains in the range 32%- 50%.

Tax Incentives

         The scope of investments entitled to tax incentives has been broadened and now includes
          preferential tax of 10% for software production, renewable energy, clean energy, waste
          energy, development of biological technology, and environment protection etc.
         A new amendment now offers preferential CIT rate at 10% to large manufacturing projects in
          excess of VND 6,000 billion (US$300 million) and projects in selected industrial zones,
          social housing, incomes from planting, protecting of forests etc.
         The law now provides preferential rate of 20% for a larger list of industries including
          investments in energy-saving projects, manufacturing of irrigation equipment; production and
          processing of cattle, poultry and fishery feed etc. Starting January 2016 the rate will be 17%.
         The new law extends the duration of concessional rates to enterprises that expand the
          productive scope, increase their capacity or renovate their productive technology.

        These are significant changes in the law but some improvement still need to be undertaken
by the government. Many of these changes are far reaching in their implication in terms of tax base, tax
rate and particularly tax incentives. Below are discussed some avenues where there is still scope for
improvement. These may form the future agenda for tax reform in Corporate Income Taxation.

       Presently the top rate has been reduced from 25% to 22%, with a lower rate of 20% for
smaller firms. This amendment in law was to follow the Tax Reform Plan 2011-2015 of Ministry of
Finance. The Government expects that this will improve the country’s attractiveness to investment.
However, this should also be accompanied by the following steps:

         There should be one single tax rate for all non-exempt and non-natural resource companies.
         Rate reduction should be followed by rationalization of the tax incentive schemes where
          some investments presently enjoy tax exemptions or 50 percent reduction in tax rates.



                                                   6
         Preferably a single rate for companies involved in mining and exhaustible minerals extraction
          and processing at 50%, including oil and gas should be adopted.
         The present list of exempt incomes can continue for the time being with minor modifications.
         Measures to secure tax revenue and fiscal sustainability, including implementation of tax
          administration reform, broadening of the tax base, and rationalization of tax exemptions

        Presently the criteria for receiving tax incentives are complex and these should be
simplified. The overlapping incentives to industries established within the economic zones are not
necessary as they already receive several advantages by virtue of their location in the zones. Also,
research findings indicate that out right tax exemption or tax holidays are not cost-effective. Government
is not able to evaluate the amount of revenues lost and many companies disappear at the end of the
incentive period and reappear as new enterprise to claim tax holiday/ exemption afresh. Thus it becomes
a drain on the government revenues. Also, it is not even clear from the existing research whether tax
incentives promote enough additional investment to justify the revenues lost.

         Vietnam is already adopting a generous tax regime, so additional incentives may not be
called for. A single rate of taxation for CIT for non-mineral companies (22%) has been legislated and
this will be further reduced to 20% from January 1, 2016. In addition, preferential rate of 10% has been
adopted for many sectors and some special types of businesses. It is more advisable to choose a single
non-mineral rate that can be low enough to be investment friendly as well as generate adequate revenues
and simplify tax compliance and tax administration. The best may be to do away with tax holidays,
reduced rates and special deductions and multiple rates and to have one single non-mineral rate at 22%,
and a single mineral rate of 50%. If this is done, the tax system would be still very attractive and business
friendly and the government is not likely to lose revenue in the long run. Revenue forecasting models
show that with this type of changes, there may not be any significant change in the levels of revenue.

         The government may contemplate introducing a comprehensive category of “not for profit
organizations” that are given tax exempt status. This category should include organizations after
being examined on a case by case basis by the tax authorities, and periodic review as is the practice in
USA. This will help simplify tax administration and compliance in the long run. Not only will these “not
for profit organizations” themselves be tax exempt, donations to these organizations can be made PIT or
CIT deductible at the discretion of the government in line with social objectives, subject to reasonable
limits. Government owned agencies or organizations may also be given this status if they are indeed
completely owned by the government, or if they genuinely do not seek to earn profits. Incomes from
certain socially desirable operations of the State Development Bank Vietnam and beneficiaries of the
Social Policy Bank have now been exempted in the revised CIT law of 2013. If the principle of allowing
organizations to register as tax – exempt organizations under the CIT law is followed such organizations
in the future, both government and private, may be easily accommodated. For instance, undistributed
profits of private higher education may be placed in this category.

        There is a cap on expenditures for advertising and other forms of sales promotion even
after the 2013 tax law revision, but this is not necessary. The cap on such expenditures has been raised
from 10% to 15% but this category of expenditures is usually essential for conducting business and
placing a limit seems unjustified. However, these expenditures should be allowed only if backed by
proper invoices/vouchers. Also, there has to be clear rules about when entertainment expenses are

                                                     7
business promotion and when they become employee benefit. Deductible expenses must be certified in
case of non-cash payment:

         Additional regulations to govern funding under the State program for geographical areas
with particularly difficult social and economic conditions as deductible expenses are not called for.
Since abolition of all tax incentives and tax holidays is being recommended here as a preferred policy
option, this category (local geographical areas with particularly difficult social and economic conditions)
may no longer relevant. If the government introduces provisions for non-profits and simultaneously
abolishes tax incentives this provision may be redundant.

         Additional provisions on thin capital may be considered. It is desirable to have regulations on
deductible expenses of borrowing costs in the case that the ratio of business loans to total equity is too
high. This regulation will ensure financial security for businesses and for the economy. The absence of
provisions to control expenses in the case of “thin capital” is of particular concern in the context of
transfer pricing by foreign owned or invested enterprises. In doing this, many definitions and issues will
still need to be clarified. It is important to have clear and comprehensive definitions of "debt", "equity"
and "interest" in the CIT Law. A clear definition of "credit institutions and banks" would also be
necessary to ensure appropriate scope and application of the proposed rule

        Regulations on nondeductible expenses for expenses in excess of the approved consumption
of raw materials, fuel, energy, goods should be removed. Allow enterprises to deduct expenses for
raw materials, fuel, energy, according to the actual invoices if valid. Normally, tax laws incorporate
provisions on how to deal with goods lost or damaged due to fire; obsolescence etc. and these can cover
inputs used in production as well as wasted inputs. Issues of excessive input deductions can be dealt with
through audit.

        An important issue is how many sets of accounts a business enterprise is required to
maintain under the revised CIT law. It is not desirable that losses from a lower rate be applied to
income from a higher rate and so three sets of accounts should be maintained under three heads (0%, 22%
and 50%) to simplify the tax structure. The tax laws do not prescribe any method of maintaining accounts
but this may be necessary. Large businesses with a turnover over a particular amount and companies
should be obliged to maintain accounts and get them audited by an Accountant. A company should not
be allowed to move from one system to another from year to year. The maintenance of accounts in the
manner prescribed by statute can also counter tax evasion attempts by showing incorrect debts and
expenditures

         The issue of Tax integration should be on the future agenda of tax reform. One of the issues
that the Government of Vietnam still has to address is tax integration. If however, the government feels
that dividends and capital gains accrue mostly to the rich and they are not likely to correctly pay PIT on
dividends (or capital gains), then the government should apply as much of the tax as it can at the
corporate stage. Also, to encourage long-term investments, the government can consider introducing
provisions for the indexation of the purchase price to compute capital gains tax in line with international
practices.

The Value Added Tax (VAT)

        The last amendments to the VAT Law 2008 were made in June 2013. The law applied to
value added taxes had been primarily the VAT Law of 2008 and it was recently revised in June 2013.
The main revisions to the VAT Law include providing clearer criteria for tax exemptions and providing a
VAT threshold. These revisions simplify tax assessment, create more favorable conditions for small
taxpayers, and will enhance efficiency in tax administration. A summary of these amendments is given
below.

Exemption

        The Act now clearly specifies that salt products would be exempted only if the main
         ingredient has the chemical formula NaCl.
        Some new financial services are now tax exempt, e.g. health insurance, fisherman insurance,
         lending services of the taxpayers, debt selling, foreign exchange trading, collateral assets of
         debts sold by state owned enterprise handling the non-performing loans of credit institutions.
        Tax exempt status of public services of sanitation and water drainage in streets and residential
         areas ha sbeen removed.
        A new category of “money” (notes and coins) is made tax exempt to remove the obstacles in
         the importing and exporting processes.
        The criterion for tax-exempt business has been changed from income basis to turnover basis.

Taxable Price

        The taxable price for goods and services now includes the environmental protection tax
         (similar to import duties in the taxable value for imported goods).
        The taxable price for asset leasing now includes the lease prices for imported machinery (this
         removes the incentive to lease rather than purchase such machinery).

VAT Rates and Zero-Rating Exports

        Exports of goods and services would be zero rated only if they were consumed “outside
         Vietnam, in the non-tariff zones, and in some cases provided to foreign customers in
         accordance with the Government’s regulations”.
        Preferential rate of 5% for mineral ores used for ferilizer production has been removed and
         would be now 10%.
        A preferential VAT rate of 5% applies to selling/renting/leasing of social residential houses.

Vat Threshold and Computing methods

        A threshold of VND 1 billion based on the annual turnover has been now introduced.
        Enterprises above this threshold are now required to apply the invoice credit method to
         calculate VAT liability.
        For businesses below threshold, a presumptive turnover tax at rate varying from 1 to 5%
         depending on the nature of business activity has been mandated.


                                                   9
         Subtraction method has to be used for enterprises and cooperatives below the VAT threshold.
          Subtraction method will also apply to household businesses, gold, silver and precious stones.
         Foreign contractors in the areas of oil and gas must pay VAT by the invoice credit method.

Credit of Input Value Added Tax

         The revised Law allows deduction of the input value added tax for goods lost or destroyed
          due to natural disasters, fires, accidents, and spoilage.
         The new Law allows for non-cash payment through credit cards too.

VAT Refunds

         The minimum refund limit of of 200 million dongs has been raised to 300 million dongs.
         New tax refund clauses have been added to encourage tourism and mechandise exports.
          Foreigners are now entitled to VAT refund when leaving the country.
         VAT refund is also allowed for programs/projects using official development assistance
          (ODA), or non-refundable grant and humaitarian aid and for those having diplomatic
          immunity.

        These are substantial changes in the law but some areas of improvements have still to be
taken up by the government and the National Assembly. Vietnam has come a long way in Tax
Reform in VAT. Below are however some areas where there is still scope for improvement. This should
form the future agenda for going forward.

         Presently, Vietnam has two tax rates in addition to a zero rate; it may consider moving to a
rate structure with zero and one positive VAT rate of 10%. Multiple rates generally increase the
administrative and compliance costs without any corresponding benefits in terms of revenues or improved
equity. The rate of 5% may therefore be eliminated and the goods subject to this rate may either be
moved to the 10% category or made VAT exempt or zero-rated if these are considered essential goods
predominantly consumed by the low income group people. This will also be in line with the prevailing
rates in the neighboring ASEAN countries.

         The tax rate of zero percent is applied to export of goods and services, including those goods
and services which are otherwise exempt from VAT, and international transportation. There are
however a few select services that are not zero-rated. The definition of exports subject to zero-rating
needs to be made more specific. Some services and unprocessed mineral resources are excluded from the
application of zero rating on export (article 8 on exemptions), but their exempt status on export is also not
explicit. The status of such services should be made more explicit. Also, the draft law presented to the
NA left it to the government to decide what items may be provided to “foreign customers” at zero rate.
The list of such items should be clearly specified as should the list of beneficiaries.

        Zero-rating may be further rationalized by applying a zero rate on all exports and listing
only the exceptions. To apply the destination principle fully, there is no need to list the specific goods
and services granted zero rating, it is better to zero rate all goods and services exported and explicitly
deny zero-rating to the chosen few. For instance, if the government wants to discourage export of low


                                                     10
value added natural resources, it can continue to deny zero rating to these items. Rather than excluding
specific services from zero rating, and taxing them as exempt services on export, it may be a better idea to
zero rate all services that are exported in accordance with a set of rules and regulations defining the place
of supply of service or point of sale. Countries in the region have already issued such rules (Singapore
and India) and the OECD is in the process of preparing a set of guidelines that the government may like to
consider.

         The current list of exempt items needs to be scrutinized and only a few of the 25 items
should remain exempt. The list of exempt goods and services is too large and most of them may be
moved to the taxed category. Generally VAT exemptions are justified only on distributional/equity
grounds or when they are hard to tax. Therefore, only financial services, primary education, basic
healthcare (not higher education provided on commercial basis and specialized health services), some
cultural and merit goods and services, aid financed activities, resale and rentals of real estate and clean
drinking water provided on non-commercial basis are good candidates for tax exemption.

         Other goods and services included in the exempt category should be moved to taxed
category. The rest of the items may be moved to the taxed category, for instance, agricultural and
livestock products, dredging, irrigation and harvesting performed by the private sector on commercial
basis, all sales of new real estate inclusive of land value, for profit medical services, and most other
services if provided on a commercial basis for profit should be under VAT. With the introduction of the
new VAT threshold at 1 billion VND, many of the exemptions presently being given for equity reasons
may be removed, most of them would be covered under the threshold in any case. Only services provided
by public agencies on a non-commercial basis deserve to remain VAT exempt. Gold imports should be
taxed just like other imports. Imports of certain machinery and equipment may be taxed on a deferred
basis until operations start and input credit is available to prevent large refund claims.

        When moving an item from the exempt list to the taxed list, care should be taken to ensure
that the sales price of good/ service is not below market or that the price is not subsidized . In the
absence of such caution, the VAT refund on inputs may exceed the VAT on the output and the
government may end up losing revenues. In such cases, it is better to leave the good/service in the
exempt category. Also, any provision that makes it more attractive to lease rather than sell assets solely
due to VAT charged should be removed.

         The current practice of having a zero threshold of exempting small traders leads to high
administrative and compliance costs without any commensurate revenue yields. This practice was
recently changed in 2013 and a ceiling of 1000 million dongs for registration under VAT has been
approved by the NA. The final choice of threshold in the long run should be based however, on the
tradeoff between the cost of administration and revenue implications. For the 11 million households who
would have to declare and pay VAT on their agricultural products, the newly imposed threshold will
exclude most small farmers and have them liable to a simplified presumptive tax on turnover. Direct
sellers of domestic produce (farmers etc.) will continue to be exempt. Another lower threshold below
which there should be no taxation or registration is also necessary because in such cases the revenues may
not be even adequate to cover the costs of administration and/or compliance. Currently the government is
considering 100 million dongs of turnover as the lower threshold.


                                                     11
         For the small traders below the exemption threshold of 1,000 million dongs, some sort of
taxation should be envisaged. Applying a turnover tax of 2-3 per cent which is then tax deductible by
the next registered buyer would be in accordance with the international best practice. This should be a
flat rate for all sectors and not different rates by sector as has been incorporated in the law. This will
again give rise to classification disputes and raise administrative costs. This “presumptive” tax should not
be linked to PIT or CIT since all enterprises are required to pay CIT regardless of size while household
enterprises are not required to pay CIT. This has been incorporated in the latest revision.

        The provision of voluntary registration for small traders should be kept in the law. Some
small traders may find it beneficial to register under VAT voluntarily and there should be a provision in
the law to accommodate such traders. With the implementation of the threshold, taxpayers whose
turnover for a year or 12 consecutive months is higher than the upper threshold will file and pay tax by
the credit method, and taxpayers whose turnover is below the upper threshold (1000 million dongs) but
above the lower threshold (100 million dongs) will pay VAT according to the percentage of sales.

        In case a business has both taxable and excluded or exempt goods and services then only the
turnover from the sales of taxable goods and services would be used to determine the business
turnover for the threshold purpose. For the newly established businesses, taxpayers could choose one
of the two options on taxation or can voluntarily register for the tax credit method except for household
enterprises which would be subject to the presumptive tax. If, at any time during the year, any business
exceeds any of the two thresholds, they must register immediately in the appropriate category, maintain
prescribed records and start collecting and paying the appropriate VAT. To ensure stability in case that
business turnover is volatile, businesses will be required to apply a stable tax calculation method (the tax
credit method or the presumptive method for VAT) in the next fiscal year or 12 months.

         With the adoption of the threshold for small traders, credit method would be applied across
board. This would imply that the subtraction method of VAT calculation for small traders stands
abolished. Thus only the credit invoice method for large firms and presumptive tax for small ones are
sufficient. However, the government is planning to retain this method for gems and gold, which is not
necessary.

         The existing provisions for refunding are complicated and vary with the nature and activity
of a particular business. The present VAT rules in Vietnam are complicated and vary with the nature
and activity of a particular business: a different set of rules is applicable for businesses operating under
the subtraction system, exporting businesses, and businesses undertaking investment activities. Also,
there is no justification for distinguishing between the VAT refunds on capital goods versus VAT refund
on other inputs. To prevent fraud based on input claims by disappearing companies, such new companies
that claim large refunds from new investment should be audited to make sure they are genuine. The
solution lies in increasing audit and enforcement capacity, not in delaying refunds by a year by default
which imposes a real cost of capital on businesses and is not likely to encourage exporters or investors.
Also, all new businesses must be audited for a couple of years before getting refund to make sure it is a
genuine unit and not a scam.

       The raising of threshold for refund to 300 million VND from 200 million VND except for
exporters and large investors takes care of inflation to some extent . This threshold is still on the

                                                    12
lower side and should be increased to 500 million dongs. Also, a carry forward period of three months
may be applied to every business and a threshold for obtaining the current period refunds may also be
fixed but it should not be excessive and should remain uniform across different businesses. Allow all
exporters who export more than a certain percentage of their output to claim refunds monthly based on
their return filing frequency even if below the threshold of 500 million, and extend a similar benefit to
large investors based on a transparent ratio criterion. Excess input tax should be preferably refunded fully
after each tax period which happens to be quarterly in case of Vietnam. Also, shorter time periods to
claim refunds should be allowed to exporters and investment projects. A waiting period of 1 year is too
long. The standard default period for refund claims should be at most 3 months if the refund amount is
below 500 million VND.

         Deduction of input VAT on goods lost or destroyed would now be allowed as recently
legislated. If the input VAT of lost goods and services is not deductible, businesses will be unable to
recover the VAT paid on lost or destroyed goods. These provisions existed in decrees and they were
simply regularized. On the other hand, the provision allowing investment input credit for all capital
goods even in cases where some goods produced are taxable and some are not is proposed to be deleted.
Similarly, the proposal to apportion input credit based on separate accounting where some goods
produced are taxable and some are not, failing which the input credit is to be apportioned by percentage
of turnover of taxable and non-taxable output should be approved. Thus, it would a good idea to
introduce a clear and simple rule to apportion credit in cases of taxable and non-taxable goods.

         Real estate should be taxed at the point of first sale of the new residential or business
construction at market price. Subsequent resale of real estate should ideally not be taxed. Following
the international best practice, in order to avoid distorting choice between house ownership and renting,
commercial leasing of residential property is also generally exempt.

PART 1 - Corporate Income Tax




              14
                             Chapter I: Introduction

        A profits tax was first introduced in Vietnam in 1990 and was levied on the income of all
business enterprises whether private sector, state sector or established through foreign investment. The
tax had a broad coverage with few exemptions. The corporate income tax in its present form was
introduced in 1999. It was later amended in 2003 with a view to abolishing discrimination among
different sectors of the economy, attracting more investment and enhancing tax revenues. It was amended
again in 2008 effective January 1, 2009 to remove certain anomalies and provide a more business-friendly
tax environment. Presently, this tax is one of the major sources of revenue in Vietnam and has been
generating between 3.5 and 5 per cent of GDP in tax revenues in recent years.

       The legal documents examined for assessing Corporate Income Tax in Vietnam include:

       (a) CIT Law No.14/2008/QH12 of June 3, 2008 promulgating the Law on Enterprise Income
           Tax;
       (b) Decree No. 124/2008/ND-CP of December 12, 2008 detailing the implementation of the Law
           on Enterprise Income Tax;
       (c) Decree No. 122/2011/ND-CP of December 27, 2011 detailing the implementation of the Law
           on Enterprise Income Tax;
       (d) Circular No. 123/2012/TT-BTC of July 27, 2012 providing guidance on the implementation
           of CIT Law No.14/2008/QH12 and guidelines on implementation of Decree No.124
           /2008/ND-CP dated December 11, 2008;
       (e) Decision No. 53/2004/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister dated April 4th, 2004 on policies to
           encourage investment in the Hi-tech Park;
       (f) Decision No. 206-2003-QD-BTC, 12 December 2003 on management procedure for use and
           depreciation of fixed assets;
       (g) Circular No. 05/2005/TT-BTC, November 1st, 2005, Guiding the regime of tax applicable to
           foreign institutions without Vietnamese legal status and foreign individuals engaged in
           business or with income incurred in Viet Nam; and
       (h) Circular No: 72/2006/TT-BTC that amends Circular No: 100/2004/TT-BTC, October 20,
           2004, Guidelines for value added tax and corporate income tax applicable to securities
           business.

Features of the Corporate Income Tax

Taxpayers

        Organizations engaged in goods production and trading or service provision are subject to
enterprise or corporate income tax. These include state enterprises, limited liability companies, joint-
stock companies, partnerships, private enterprises, cooperatives and foreign-invested enterprises.

        Similarly, foreign companies doing business and earning incomes generated in Vietnam are
subject to this tax. Taxable entities include resident establishments of foreign companies comprising

                                                  15
manufacturing and business facilities through which the foreign companies conduct a part or all of their
production and business activities in Vietnam such as:

         (a) Branches, executive offices, factories, workshops, means of transportation, mining, oil and
             gas fields or other sites of extraction of natural resources in Vietnam;
         (b) Construction sites, works of construction, installation or assembly;
         (c) Establishments providing services, including consultancy services through employees or an
             organization or individual;
         (d) Agents for foreign enterprises;
         (e) Representatives in Vietnam of authorized representatives empowered to sign contracts in the
             name of foreign enterprises or representatives not authorized to sign contracts in the name of
             foreign enterprises but regularly delivering goods or providing services in Vietnam.

Tax Exempt Income

         (a) Income earned from agricultural production activities of Co-Operatives;
         (b) Income earned from performance of technical services directly serving agricultural
             production;
         (c) Income earned from performance of contracts for scientific research and technological
             development; from products during their period of test production, and from products made
             from new technology applied for the first time in Vietnam1;
         (d) Incomes from the production and business of enterprises that employ disabled persons,
             detoxified people (former drug addicts now rehabilitated) and HIV sufferers. This excludes
             other incomes or income from activities outside the main business activities of the enterprise
             concerned. The number of these special category employees must be at least 30% of the
             average number of workers in a year employed by the enterprise. Enterprises engaged in
             financial activities or real estate are not entitled to this exemption and neither are enterprises
             that employ less than an average of 20 persons during a year;
         (e) Income earned from occupational training activities specially reserved for ethnic minority
             people, disabled people, children living in particularly difficult conditions and reformed
             offenders;
         (f) Income distributed to an investing company that are in the nature of return for capital
             contribution, joint venture and/or association with a domestic enterprise after payment of
             corporate income tax in accordance with CIT Law by the investee;
         (g) Aid funds received for use in educational, scientific research, cultural, artistic, charitable, and
             humanitarian and other social activities in Vietnam.

  This last category of income from products made from new technology applied for the first time should be
removed. In the case of multi-nationals especially, it is difficult to distinguish a “new” product from an upgrade .
Such labeling of “new” is fairly common for most consumer goods, as is continuous improvement in technology.
Unless there is a stringent justification or selection criteria for this category that makes claiming this exemption truly
justified, this is likely to be misuse.

                                                           16
Taxable Income

        Taxable income from goods production and trading or service provision activities is the total
turnover minus deductible expenses related to earning the income plus “other” income.

         “Other” taxable incomes include income from capital transfers and from real property transfers;
income from the ownership of or right to use assets; income from transfer, leasing out or liquidation of
assets; interest on deposits, loans or sales of foreign currency; recoveries from contingency reserves;
income earned from bad debts which were written-off and are now recoverable; debts payable to
unidentifiable creditors; income from business omitted in previous years, and other income including
income receivable from activities of production and/or business outside Vietnam.

        The proposed new CIT law sought to introduce some forms of “other income” for inclusion in
taxable income. This includes income from transfer of contributed capital; transfer of investment
projects, transfer of the right to participate in investment projects, transfer of the right to do exploration,
mining and mineral processing. At the same time, it is proposed to allow offset of losses from the transfer
of property, transfer of investment projects, transfer of the right to participate in investment projects,
transfer of the right to do exploration, mining, mineral processing which must be (1) determined
separately, (2) to be declared. and (3) to be set off against the profits/losses of these activities first; the
remaining loss can be set off against an assessable income of business activity during the tax period.

        These incomes are incomes of enterprises and should be considered a part of assessable income.
To ensure transparency, simplicity, and ease of administration, these incomes are explicitly included in
the category “other income” in Clause 2 of Article 3 of Enterprise Income Tax Law as follows:

        "2. Other income includes income from the transfer of capital, transfer of capital contribution;
        income from transfer of property, transfer of investment projects, transfer of the right to
        participate in investment projects, transfer of exploration, mining and mineral processing rights;
        income from the ownership or use of property; income from the transfer, lease or disposal;
        interest income from deposits, loans, sale exchange; reversal of reserves; collecting bad debts
        that were written off but now recovered; revenue liabilities that cannot be determined; business
        income from the previous year and missed earnings; Other, including income received from
        production activities, trading outside of Vietnam."

        It is advisable to transition to one positive non-mineral rate for all corporate income and one
positive rate for all mineral income in Vietnam. The Haig – Simon definition of comprehensive income is
the international standard which all tax regimes aspire to achieve. This definition of comprehensive
income includes all forms of income that add to net worth. All legitimate income of businesses should be
included in taxable income to avoid shifting to tax preferred activities.

        Two sets of issues arise: (1) is the income in the form of capital gains (including derivatives), (2)
or royalty/lease income? The answer is generally yes. But in the case of capital gains, there will be
demand for offset of losses since that is allowed in other cases. This does not arise in the case of (2)
which is straightforward addition to taxable income, but issues of expenses would arise.



                                                      17
         Since it is advisable to have one uniform rate of CIT and a 5 year loss carry forward provision
already exists, a preferred approach may be that all non-mineral net taxable income (that is not otherwise
exempted) be clubbed in one pool and taxed at the single positive non-mineral rate of 22%, and all
mineral incomes be similarly clubbed and taxed at 50%. This means that there will be a maximum of
three separate sets of accounts that an enterprise can possibly maintain - exempt income; taxable turnover
and other income, deductions and losses for the single non-mineral rate; and taxable turnover and other
income, deductions and losses for the single mineral rate of 50%. Losses from one rate should not be
applied to another rate. Therefore, there is no need for separation of accounts by type of income
(transfers, real estate, financial etc.). Only 3 sets of accounts arise in this new system (0%, 22% & 50%).
Once this is done, and all forms of non-mineral incomes that are not exempt are taxed at one uniform rate,
the only case where we need to separate expenses and losses is when the same enterprise may have more
than one type of income. In either case, the above approach should solve the problem. There is still no
need for more than 3 sets of accounts and no further distinction needs to be made.

        In the case of capital gains income from the above, especially in the form of options, there may
also be a case made for inflation indexation of the purchase price to avoid overstating the capital gain or
loss.

        Gross income earned from activities of production and business of goods and services abroad are
taxed under the provisions of the current Law on Enterprise Income Tax of Vietnam. The tax rate is
presently 25%. The tax payable is reduced by the amount of CIT which has been paid abroad, but the tax
deducted cannot exceed the income tax calculated under the provisions of the Law on Enterprise Income
tax of Vietnam. Taxed income from securities transfer is the securities selling price minus (-) the
purchase price of the transferred securities, minus (-) expenses related to the transfer, without indexation
of the purchase price.

        There is also a move to remove the “income being recoveries from contingency reserves” from
taxable income. This is not recommended due to the following reason: If payment into contingency
reserves are deductible from income while computing CIT payable in the year they were paid into the
reserve fund (or to a limited extent like in the case of the science and technology fund) then they should
be taxable when they are withdrawn from the fund, otherwise this income escapes taxation entirely. In
any case, if they are used to offset a loss or to affect deductible expenditure, the loss or expenditure is
deductible from taxable income.

Permissible Expenses

        As mentioned above, taxable income is calculated from the gross income after deducting
permissible expenses. The 2009 CIT law deems all expenses that meet two conditions as deductible
(except for certain specified non-deductible expenses). Expenses must meet the following 2 conditions
for being considered deductible.

         They are actually paid for and used in production and business activities;
         They are backed by adequate legally acceptable invoices and documents as prescribed by
          law.


                                                    18
Deductible and Non-Deductible Expenditures

        Depreciation of fixed assets used for goods production and trading or service provision activities,
costs of raw materials, supplies, fuel, energy and goods actually used in conduct of business, other
expenses for promoting goods sale or service provision including expenses for packaging, transportation,
advertisement, marketing, sales promotion and payment of brokerage commission, wages, remuneration
and allowances actually paid to laborers and costs incurred thereof, employer’s contributions to social
and health and unemployment insurance, expenses for services such as electricity, water, telephone,
repair of fixed assets, rentals of fixed assets, legal services, property insurance, and technical services,
expenses on research and development, innovations and modifications, payment of interests on loan for
doing business, deductions for reserves, taxes, charges, fees and land rents, business management
expenses allocated by foreign companies to their resident establishments in Vietnam, and certain
donations are some examples of deductible expenses. The law defines certain limitations on deductible
expenses:

         Establishments with “high economic efficiency” may apply quicker depreciation rate that is
          limited to two times of the prescribed depreciation rate;
         Depreciation corresponding to the original cost in excess of VND 1.6 billion/car, for
          passenger cars of 9 seats or less brought in use on or after January 1, 2009 (except cars
          exclusively used for the commercial passenger transportation or for tourism and hotel
          business) and depreciation of civil aircraft and yachts not used for commercial cargo,
          passenger or tourist transportation are not allowed;
         Enterprises are required to set reasonable consumption limits for raw materials, materials,
          fuel, energy or goods used for production and business activities from the beginning of a year
          or a period of product manufacture and notify these limits to their managing tax agencies
          within 3 months after commencement of production using these consumption limits;
         Expenses for advertisement, marketing, sales promotion and some other categories of
          marketing expenses that exceed 10% of the total amount of deductible expenses are not
          allowed except to newly established enterprises, who may deduct 15% in the first 3 years
          from the date they are established;
         The restricted level of 15% of total deductible expenses for the first 3 years is applicable to
          new enterprises that are granted business registration certificates on or after January 1, 2009,
          but not to new enterprises established as a result of consolidation, separation, split, merger,
          and type or ownership transformation;
         Payment of salaries, wages and other amounts payable to employees that the enterprises have
          accounted in business expenses in the taxable period but have not made payment for or
          incurred without maintaining payment vouchers as prescribed by law are not deductible;
         Enterprises are entitled to deduct a maximum of ten (10) per cent of their annual taxable
          income in order to establish the Science and Technology Development Fund of the enterprise.
          In case enterprises incur such expenses without setting up this fund, they may deduct valid
          expenses on scientific and technological development and research from taxable income, as
          they may deduct the expenses in excess of the amount contributed to the fund that were not

                                                    19
            paid for from the fund. In the proposed new CIT law, an amendment was mooted that would
            prescribe a minimum contribution to this fund for state-owned enterprises. This provision
            would make it mandatory for state owned enterprises to set aside a minimum share of their
            income into the fund to develop science and technology. This is a matter of policy. While it
            is laudable to develop science and technology, the government owns these enterprises and
            could very well set up the fund directly by setting aside a portion of the dividends paid by
            these companies to the government;
            Payment of interest on loan for doing business from credit institutions, financial
            organizations and other economic organizations; and payment of interest on loans borrowed
            from other entities computed at the actual interest rate which must not exceed 1.5 times the
            basic interest rate as published by the State Bank of Vietnam at the time the loans are allowed
            to be deducted, amounts in excess are disallowed;
         Taxes, charges, fees and land rents to be deducted have to be related to business;
         Business management expenses allocated by foreign companies to their resident
          establishments in Vietnam are allowed according to the proportion of such resident
          establishments’ turnover to the total turnover of the foreign companies;
         Financial aid or donation for education, health care, to overcome the consequences of a
          natural disaster or to build a charitable home for poor people as stipulated by law is
          considered deductible.

        Taxes can be assessed either financial year wise or calendar year wise. Tax period is determined
by calendar year. Where enterprises choose to apply the fiscal year different from the calendar year, the
tax period is determined by the applicable fiscal year.

       There is no requirement for fixing the tax period. Enterprises choose the tax period themselves
based on their situation and inform the tax authority.

Depreciation Rules

         All fixed assets of an enterprise which are involved in business activities are subject to
depreciation. The duration of use of an asset which is a key factor in determining the amount of annual
depreciation is indicated through a decision of the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Fixed assets are placed in 8
categories: (i) dynamic machinery and equipment, (ii) working machinery and equipment, (iii)
measurement equipment and laboratory instruments, (iv) transport equipment, (v) instruments for
management, (vi) building and architectural works, (vii) livestock and perennial plantation, (viii) fixed
assets of other kinds.

         These are further subdivided into 48 sub-categories. For new assets in each of these 48 sub-
categories, the minimum and maximum duration of use are prescribed in the MoF decision. If the asset is
already in use, the duration is calculated based on the ratio of the reasonable value of the asset and the
selling price of the new asset of that type multiplied by the notified duration of use for the new asset. Land
use right being a special type of fixed asset is not subject to depreciation.

        An enterprise can itself determine the duration of use under these guidelines.

                                                    20
         An enterprise may select the method of depreciation calculation appropriate to each of its fixed
assets from one of the following three methods depending upon its ability to meet the conditions applicable
to each method:

        (a) The straight line method: The annual rate of depreciation is the value of asset divided by the
            duration of use. Enterprises with “high business effectiveness” may conduct fast depreciation
            in order to renovate technology but limited to twice the rate of the straight line depreciation.
        (b) The reducing balance method: The reducing balance method of calculating depreciation can
            only be used for machinery and equipment, or instruments for measurement and testing
            which are newly invested fixed assets (not second hand). This method applies to enterprises
            in sectors where technology needs to be changed and the sector needs to be quickly
            developed.
        (c) The method of quantity or volume of products: This method may be used for fixed assets
            involved in business activities as machinery/equipment directly relates to manufacturing of
            products and the total quantity or volume of products manufactured can be calculated
            according to designed output of the asset.

         Every enterprise has to register its selected methods of depreciation calculation with the tax
authorities. If an enterprise has selected an inappropriate method of calculating depreciation, then it is
notified by the tax authorities.

        The selected and registered method of depreciation calculation for a fixed asset will be used
consistently and continuously throughout its use.

Turnover, Taxable Income and Tax Payable

        Turnover means total sales revenue, processing fees and fees for provision of services including
price subsidies and additional charges and fees to which the enterprise is entitled, calculated in
Vietnamese dongs.

                      Assessable Income = Turnover - deductible expenses + other incomes
       Taxable Income = Assessable Income - Exempt Income - Loss Carry Forward as permitted
    CIT Payable = {Taxable Income - Deduction for payments into Science and Technology fund} *
                                       applicable tax rate

Tax Rates

        The enterprise income tax rate applicable to business establishments is 25 per cent.

        The tax rate applicable to business establishments conducting activities of prospecting,
exploration and exploitation of oil and gas and other precious and rare natural resources are between 32
per cent and 50 per cent, depending on each project and business establishment.

         Public service units that are involved in the activities of goods and services business subject to
enterprise income tax that can account for their revenue but cannot account and determine the cost and
profits of the business operation declare and pay enterprise income tax on the revenue from sales of goods
and services as follows:

         For services: 5%.

        Chapter II: Rate Rationalization and Revenue
                        Implications

         The present CIT rate in Vietnam is 25%, to be applied to all taxable corporate income. This rate
applies to income not otherwise exempted or taxed at lower rates of 10%, 20% or at 50% or 0% of the tax
otherwise payable (the case of tax holidays). . The Tax Reform Plan 2011-2015 of Ministry of Finance
provides a guidance to reduce gradually CIT rate in accordance with a rational roadmap in order to
facilitate corporate sector in strengthening its financial capacity and improve the country’s attractiveness
to investment. The CIT rate cut scheme should be coupled with rationalizing tax incentives, broadening
the tax base, and strengthening tax administration to secure much needed fiscal resources. The existence
of multiple effective rates and incentives and preferences (chapter one) reduces the transparency of the
system as well as creates opportunities for companies to reduce their tax liability through aggressive tax
planning.

         One of the recommendations made in the current set of proposals to reform the CIT law has been
to further lower the tax rate of 25 per cent to 22% for large firms and 20% for firms that have less than
200 employees and a total turnover of no more than 20 billion VND. This has been accepted by the
National Assembly and will be implemented shortly.

        The specific proposed changes suggested in the draft law and approved by the national Assembly
are:

        (a) The tax rate will be 22% on non-mineral income of enterprises.
        (b) The enterprises which have less than 200 employees and a total turnover of no more than 20
            billion VND will be taxed at 20%.
        (c) Microfinance institutions are subject to the tax rate of 20%.
        (d) The income from project investment and construction of social housing for sale, for lease,
            lease purchase for objects defined in the Housing Law is taxed at the tax rate of 10%, without
            exemption or reduction.
        (e) Additional regulations: income from newspaper activities (including newspaper ads) of the
            press under the provisions of the Press Law and income from publishing activities under the
            provisions of the Publishing Law to be taxed at 10%.
        (f) The tax rate in the field of education and training, vocational training, health care, culture,
            sports and the environment (the field of socialization) is 10% for income from these
            activities.
        (g) Additional regulations have been proposed for tax incentives including incentives for
            investment expansion. Incentives proposed are:
            -   Tax rate of 10% for 15 years, maximum tax holiday 4 years and reduction of 50% tax
                payable for 9 years for new investment projects; for the application of, venture

                                                    25
                investment in and incubation of advanced technologies, production of composite
                materials, energy from waste, biotechnology, hi-tech etc. This is also available to new
                production of goods industries that invest 6 trillion VND and have turnover at least VND
                10 trillion a year within 3 years or new production of goods industries that invest 6
                trillion VND and have more than 3000 employees, except goods subject to Special
                Consumption Tax (SCT) and in mining;
            -   Additions to the category of 20% rate for 10 years, with tax holiday for 2 years and
                reduction of 50% of CIT in next 4 years: new investment projects producing high quality
                steel, energy efficient products, machinery and equipment for agriculture, forestry
                fishery, salt, water irrigation etc (20% will be reduced to 17% from 1/1/2016);
            -   Additions to the category of tax exemption for 2 years and reduction of 50%of CIT
                payable for next 4 years enterprises making investment(new investment is not specified)
                in industrial zones with difficult socio-economic conditions;
            -   Enterprises engaging in technology transfers to anyone located in areas with socio-
                economic difficulties get 50% reduction of CIT on incomes from the transfers.

Revenue Effects

        It is expected by the proponents of the changes that these rate reductions will increase the net of
tax return to equity capital and make some investments profitable at the margin that otherwise may not
have been. It is also expected that such a move will attract new investment into Vietnam as well as divert
some investment currently heading to lower tax jurisdictions towards Vietnam and provide more
incentives to existing domestic investors. Generally the thinking behind a move such as this is that (a)
Some of the tax revenue lost will be recouped in the long run when the increased investment leads to
increased output and income, (b) even if there is a small loss in revenue, it may be acceptable when
weighed against the benefits of increased investment such as jobs, technology transfer and reduction in
negative externalities or the provision of positive externalities.

         However, if we discount such dynamic effects and still want to preserve revenue in the short run,
reducing the corporate rate to 22% from 25% should be accompanied by elimination of concessionary tax
rates of 10 or 20 percent for preferred economic investments. If this is not done, it will obviously lead to
some revenue losses in the short run and perhaps even in the medium to long run. The rate reduction
should be accompanied by a rationalization of the incentive scheme where some investments presently
enjoy tax exemption or 50 percent reduction in tax rates. Such incentives or tax expenditures should be
carefully examined for their impact and effectiveness and compared to outcomes achievable by using
other policy measures outside the tax regime such as provision of improved infrastructure.

         The important issue that arises from the point of view of the tax authorities when such
rationalizations are considered is the revenue implication of the reduction of the top marginal CIT rate.
While the change may be revenue neutral due to elimination of tax expenditures and concessions, revenue
authorities may believe that withdrawing incentives and preferential rates may have other long-term
effects on economic activities that may result in lower revenues in the future. Therefore, the two issues
are connected in several complicated ways and the answer to what the long-term revenue impact will be is
not straightforward. We need to look into the short-term (static) effect of a reduction in the top marginal

                                                    26
CIT rate and the short-term impact of a reduction in tax preferences vis-à-vis the long-term (dynamic)
effects of the two groups of changes.

         The effects of a reduction of the CIT rate on revenues can be summarized with the following
quote from Mankiw (2006) “To what extent does a tax cut pay for itself? This question arises regularly
for economists working at government agencies in charge of estimating tax revenues. Traditional revenue
estimation, called static scoring, assumes no feedback from taxes to national income. The other extreme,
illustrated by the renowned Laffer curve, suggests that tax cuts can generate so much economic growth
that they completely (or even more than completely) pay for themselves. Most economists are skeptical
of both polar cases. They believe that taxes influence national income but doubt that the growth effects
are large enough to make tax cuts self-financing. In other words, tax cuts pay for themselves in part, and
the open question is the magnitude of the effect”.

Revenue-Neutral, Static and Dynamic Changes

        This, however, does not consider the case of a combination of tax rate changes and other
measures to widen the tax base, to remove tax expenditures and preferences including preferential rates of
taxation and tax holidays. Even with a completely static base, we can always think of a combination of
such measures that can be revenue-neutral.

         To analyze the effect of a change in tax rates on revenues we can use either a static or dynamic
model. A static analysis model uses firm data on the existing tax base to estimate the tax impact of
different tax structures while a dynamic model uses aggregate data to estimate through regression
possible effects on the revenue over time. The two models can also be used in combination to simulate
possible alternative paths for revenue in the future with different economic scenarios. Which models of
the static and dynamic type can actually be used depends solely on available data. Several models are
available. An example of a detailed static model is the Corporate Income Tax micro-simulation model
described below. This is the most reliable model since it uses individual tax returns for the static part of
the analysis.

A. STATIC ANALYSIS

I. Introduction

1. Description of Corporate Income Tax Micro-Simulation Model

       A micro-simulation model has four major components: (i) Table of Parameters; (ii) Corporate
Tax Calculator Model; (iii) Tax Returns Database; and (iv) Macro Modules.

        (i) Table of Parameters

        The Table of Parameters contains information about the current statutory corporate tax rates and
the proposed changes to those rates. According to the database available, different types of corporations
can be considered (only if we wish to consider the effect of different tax rates on different corporations –
otherwise we simply consider the corporations facing existing tax rate of 25%, against alternative rates of
23%, 22% and 20%). Right next to the current CIT rates, the proposed changes are shown. In any event,

                                                    27
this table provides flexibility to the model as changes to the current and proposed tax rates can be easily
done without modifying the macro codes.

        (ii) Corporate Tax Calculator Model

        Using the data (i.e. tax rates) stored in the Table of Parameters, the Tax Calculator Model
calculates the tax liability of an individual corporation. The formulae contained in the Tax Calculator
Model simulate the tax calculation procedures as presented in the provided tax returns samples. The
Model will assign appropriate tax rates applicable to the corporation (assumed to be 25% only in the
general case, but many preferential regimes and tax holidays also exist and they can be simulated as well).

         The Calculator Model presents the calculation of individual corporation tax liability under the
current and proposed law, as well as the changes or impacts on the corporation’s tax liability due to the
discretionary changes.

        (iii) Tax Returns Database

         Tax Return Database stores the tax returns data from national samples of selected corporations.
Again, for the sake of model presentation, only returns of taxpayers that are provided are considered.
This part of the model could be completed with a large and representative stratified sample of CIT tax
returns.

        (iv) Macro Module

         The Macro Module automates the process of simulating the calculation of tax liability for the
corporations in the database. The Module reads each individual corporation record in the database; stores
it in the Tax Calculator Model and saves the calculated tax liability in the designated location in the Tax
Returns Database. This process continues until the last record in the database is covered.

2. Steps to Construct The Model
        (i) Sampling of Tax Returns. Stratified sampling is suggested. First, different strata are
            established on the basis of some critical categories such as size of assets, income, industry, or
            region. Firms in each stratum resemble by the category used to select the strata. Second,
            sample of firms will be selected from these strata. Different weights are assigned to each
            stratum, and will be used to determine the proportion of firms in each stratum to be randomly
            drawn for the ultimate sample. For example, if strata are selected on the basis of gross
            income, higher income strata will be given higher weights; the proportion of firms drawn
            from those strata will be higher. Also, note that samples from different filing periods may
            also be selected to account for non-calendar filing and filing extensions. The “tax return”
            sheet usually has embedded a weight column that could be adjusted with the proportion of
            firms represented by each stratum.
        (ii) Data Cleaning. This step is to ensure consistency and reliability of data selected for the
             simulations.



                                                    28
        (iii) Data Completion Process. Filling in missing data relies on either data from corporate
             financial statements, and/or imputation data.
        (iv) Construct a Tax Calculator to Simulate Corporate Income Tax. Corporate income tax base
             is derived from gross income from different sources minus itemized deductions including
             costs of goods sold, depreciation allowance, interest payments, overheads expenses, and any
             net operating loss from prior years. Tax payable is estimated as the product of tax base and
             corporate income tax rate. Tax liability should also be adjusted for any tax credits that are
             allowed. From this base tax calculator, impact of any proposed changes in the corporate
             income tax code on a representative firm and on government tax revenue will then be
             simulated.

        The crucial element is availability of a stratified sample of CIT returns. Since such a sample is
currently not available in Vietnam a simpler solution is to obtain the total taxable profits and other
aggregate values of all corporations subject to the 25% rate and other preferential rates in consolidated
form for the last available year. With a completely static base, the new proposed rates can simply be
applied to these taxable profits to get an estimate of the tax estimated at the different rates. The simplified
model used in this case is described below using data available from the 2010 Enterprise survey.

II. Model, Data & Results (as applied to Vietnam)

        Now that the proposal to reduce the top rate for large non-mineral firms to 22% and for smaller
firms to 20%, to retain and expand tax holidays and the special rates of 10% have been approved; the
ideal analysis would have been to separate incomes from the Enterprise survey 2010 into the following
categories: (1) Income taxed at 25% - further subdivided into large and small firms’ income;(2) Mineral
income paying rates between 32-50%; (3) Income taxed at either concessional rate of 20% or 10%; (4)
incomes enjoying tax holidays by rate actually charged. However, such a division is not available to this
study from either tax returns or the enterprise survey 2010. The Average Effective Tax Rate (AETR) has
actually been calculated by dividing tax paid by net taxable profit reported in the survey. What we
expected to find is the following set of rates for firms paying non-negative amounts of taxes:

         Firms paying zero taxes who have positive profits: this could be due to exemption, tax
          holiday that allows 0%, or losses carried over that are deducted;
         Firms paying at 5%, 10%, 12.5%, or even 16% - 25% that avail the 50% reduction in taxes
          payable from the base rates of 10%, 20%, 25% or 32%-50% if all rates are covered in the
          50% of taxes payable scheme;
         Firms paying at statutory rates of 10%, 20%, 25%, 32%-50%.

1. Multiplicity of Rates

         The enterprise survey 2010 was examined to ascertain what the range of AETRs reported by
firms actually was in relation to the multiplicity of possible rates firms could potentially face. The
variable “rate” was created expressing CIT paid as a percentage of pretax profit . To create this, we had to
drop all cases of missing and zero pretax profit (since we cannot divide by zero). Cases of negative profit



                                                      29
were also dropped as were cases of negative CIT. The results are revealing and show that out of 170537
observations that remain, the percentage CIT rate varies from a minimum of 0% to 8263%.

        A look at the possible list of rates above should reveal that the tax system is made very complex
and opaque by the multiplicity of potential rates that a firm could pay in theory and the effects on
horizontal and vertical equity are indeterminate. Thus a rationalization of this rate structure itself is an
objective that the government may consider pursuing in the future.

        The next stage was to drop all those cases where the rate is greater than 50% since they cannot be
explained easily and then try to see if the remaining rates fall in the categories we expect. The results
obtained are presented in the next table:

        About 17000 observations are dropped when we eliminate those firms reporting rates above 50%.
For the remaining 155000+ firms the range reported varies continuously from 0 to 50. The variation
would have been even more if we had not rounded the rates to the nearest integer since it is derived from

data that may suffer from rounding issues. There is some bunching of rates at 0%, 14-16%, 20%, 24-
25%, 29-31%, 33%, 40% and 50% but the range is fairly continuous with almost every value between 0
and 42% showing at least 1000 firms.

2. Urgent Need for Cleaning Data and Conducting a Fresh Enterprise Survey

         Whether this is an error of data in the survey or a reality is not known. The message is two-fold
(1) if the table above represents reality then the prevailing system is unbelievably complex and should be
streamlined; (2) better data should be gathered through the survey if meaningful policy analysis is to be
attempted. This is elaborated next.

         The survey data does not allow us to segregate firms and their income by tax rate applied to
different streams of income, or to ascertain the rates or holidays or exemptions. Since this information is
not available, we are unable to conduct simulations on what would happen if rates are lowered from 25%
to 22% and 20% while retaining special rates and tax holidays since we cannot separate firm’s income by
tax rate applied. Therefore, the simulations have to be conducted with a number of assumptions to clean
data and the effect of retaining holidays and special rates cannot be estimated. The simulations actually
conducted keeping this data deficiency in mind are presented instead.

         For the future, it is advisable to start collecting data for enterprises that separate incomes
according to the applicable tax rates. Under the new regime, tax rates for mineral incomes are still in the
range of 32%-50%. The CIT rate for large companies will be 22% and for small companies will be 20%.
The tax rate of 10% will continue. Some companies will pay at 0% or at 50% of each of the above rates
during their tax holiday period, and some others will earn income that is exempt. In addition to reporting
total pretax profit and tax paid, firms should be asked to report income in each category, separated by tax
rate. As a simple check, the individual pretax profits reported by each firm should add up to the total, and
the tax paid reported should be equal to the applicable rate multiplied by the income reported in each
category. Even if firms earn incomes taxed at different rates, it would then be possible to add up incomes
earned at a particular rate. This will facilitate analysis of revenue impacts when rates change, adjusted for
possible dynamic effects. With the present availability of data, this exercise was simply not feasible.
From the Enterprise survey 2010, the following summary of the data was provided by the local sources
and it is presented in the next table:

3. Firms with Negative Profits but Positive Taxes

         A cursory look at the data above raises some issues about its reliability and gives anomalous
results. Of the 300,000 or so active firms surveyed, data on CIT was available for around 290,290 firms.
However a look at the row that lists firms with negative taxable profit (71365 in number) shows that they
paid taxes worth 670,592 million VND. It is not clear how this is possible. This could be possible due to
mis-reporting of book profit as taxable profit, or the inclusion of VAT or other taxes paid as CIT or even


                                                       33
cases of reporting taxable profits not accepted by the GDT or even perhaps that these firms were taxed on
turnover. In any case there cannot be any reasonable explanation as to why firms with negative taxable
profit (net taxable losses) should pay so much in CIT. This is all the more confusing since the next row
lists 192 firms with negative profits that paid negative taxes (which should be the equivalent of refunds).

4. Firms with Effective Tax Rate of greater than 27%

        There are several firms (70,521 in number) that paid an effective tax rate of above 27% during the
year. With a top marginal tax rate of 25% for non-mineral firms there can only be 2 explanations for this:
that the firms paid CIT on mineral income at rates between 32-50% or the firms paid CIT based on
turnover. Since no reduction of CIT is proposed for firms with mineral income or any changes proposed
for firms paying CIT on turnover, these firms were also dropped from the analysis along with the firms
above who reported negative profits but positive taxes.

         Excluding these firms leaves a potential total of 99,237 firms to conduct simulations which can
further be broken down as follows:

        The sample of 99,224 is not bad in terms of coverage since it is free from dubious data. In terms
of taxable profit, the sample is now rid of a lot of profitable firms that paid more than 27% in taxes, but is
also rid of losses so the effect on total taxable profit is not so pronounced. The remaining sample
accounts for 82% of declared (positive) profits. However, proportionally more of the tax paid (some of it
by loss making firms as discussed above, and most of it by firms paying more than 27%) is lost. The tax
paid by the sample is now lower at 51% of the total. We are also unable to explain why 70,521 firms paid

                                                     34
at an effective rate over 27%. It is unlikely that so many enterprises had mineral income, unless firms
paying on turnover basis are a large proportion of this category. The government may also consider for
the future the burden on these firms – lowering the top rate of 25% is unlikely to benefit them.

5. Effective Tax Rates in the sample

         The striking feature of the data is the effective tax rate implied for the firms in the sample which
is around 16.4% for all firms and large firms and only slightly lower at 16.2% for small firms. This
implies that if the base is completely static, the policy recommended that eliminates the special rate of
10% (and special rate of 20% if the normal rate is above 20%) and all tax holidays would increase
revenue even if the general rate is brought down for all non-mineral firms. Even a normal top rate of 20%
for all non-mineral firms if combined with elimination of tax holidays and the elimination of the 10% rate
would increase revenue in this scenario. We can see the magnitude of the potential increases in a static
model below:

6. Significant Loss of Revenues through Tax Holidays

        The clearest message that we can state from the completely static model is that Vietnam is losing
so much revenue currently from its tax holidays and special rates that it could contemplate further
lowering its rate to 20% for all firms and still gain CIT revenue if it simultaneously eliminates tax
holidays and special rates. However, an increase in the effective tax rate may lead to a reduction in the

                                                      35
tax base in the long run, which may cause revenues to fall if the effects are strong enough. To confirm
that a reduction in the tax rate combined with elimination of tax incentives will not cause a significant
drop in revenues we have to examine the potential dynamic impact of this change.

7. Moving Forward with Rate Reform

        Vietnam is already moving forward with a rational single rate of taxation for CIT for non-
mineral companies. It is also going to implement a second slightly lower rate for small companies. This
may encourage income shifting to tax preferred activities. The choice of company size should be based
on business considerations and economies of scale and not influenced by the tax rate. Going forward, it is
worth considering a single non-mineral rate that can be low enough to be investment friendly as well as
generate adequate revenues and simplify tax compliance and tax administration. Therefore, it is proposed
that the agenda for reform in the future would do away with tax holidays, reduced rates and special
deductions and multiple rates and have one single non-mineral rate at 22% and a single mineral rate of
50%. As discussed elsewhere, some industries/enterprises may be given tax exempt status based on
proper procedure and a formal procedure for determination of tax-exempt status. In all other cases of
socio-economic objectives, the government can use refundable or non-refundable tax credits since these
are certain, equitable and explicitly accountable tax expenditures. There is already a fairly long list of
exempt income for socially desirable activities and no major modification is proposed to that list.

B. DYNAMIC ANALYSIS

I. Introduction

         To estimate the effect of changing the tax rate on revenues we can relax the assumption of a fixed
base and allow it to change in response to the rate. This obviously means that revenues could increase if
the tax base increases in response to a decrease in rates. The overall impact on revenues depends on the
size of the response in the base and the actual effect on the Average Effective Tax rate (AETR). These
models are more dynamic in nature since they try to estimate the size of this response as well. The two
major types of models are (1) effect of rate on revenue or taxable income directly, and (2) effect of rate on
investment/FDI. The latter is more widely studied in the literature, but is less useful as highlighted in the
following quote: “Note that the link between the effect of the tax rate on investment and its effect on
revenue is not straightforward. For example, if lower tax rates reduce the effective tax rate on new
investment, this may stimulate investment. But, in the short run an increase in investment may reduce,
rather than increase, taxable income because at first (accelerated) tax depreciation allowances often
exceed any increased profits due to the capital investment and because increased profits may not arise for
several years. This is important in part because it suggests that the response lag to tax system changes
will vary depending on the kind of behavioral response. For example, the change in taxable income due
to income shifting is likely to be relatively fast, but the change in taxable income due to a response in real
investment is likely to be slower, and in the short run may be perverse (i.e., more investment may reduce
taxable income).” (Kawano and Slemrod, 2012, pg 6).

       If the base is completely static, then a reduction in the AETR can only reduce revenue. As we
have seen in the static analysis above, an increase in the AETR would increase revenue substantially.
However, a combination of reduction in statutory rates with removal of preferential lrates even in static


                                                     36
model can have a revenue-neutral or revenue-enhancing effect as well depending on the overall AETR.
To estimate what might happen when we allow for dynamic changes in taxable income over a longer
period, we need a combination of both models. The first (preferred) model that tries to relate tax rates to
revenues directly is the econometric model for CIT revenues as applied to South Africa (SA) as an
illustration (Glenday 2008). The model uses regression of tax revenues on the CIT rate as well as several
other “control” variables and the coefficient on this variable (the AETR/CIT rate) is the elasticity of the
tax revenues with respect to the tax rate. It gives an indication of how much revenue will change due to a
change in rates alone, and is related to the change in the base of the CIT as well. The formal model is
presented below. While this model adequately demonstrates the approach used, it is not the only possible
specification of the variables. In the ideal scenario, we would like to have the following series for at least
12-15 years annually to be able to estimate any of the model specifications:

               GDP at basic prices
               Corporate profits/Net or Gross Operating Surplus
               Business Investment
               Loss carry overs
               Corporate income before tax and CIT paid
               Corporate tax rate structure
               Corporate tax incentives structure
               Consumer Price Deflator, Producer and Wholesale Price indices
               Information on shocks to economy
               Discretionary changes to CIT structure and quantified annual fiscal impact for all years
               Share of corporate profits subject to each tax rate each year
               Share of CIT collections from each tax rate each year

         The SA model results are presented below to illustrate the model attempted for Vietnam. All the
elements present in the table of results for SA were available for a shorter series of 11 years from 2001 to
2011 except for an AETR for all years calculated directly from statutory rates and estimated bases and net
losses for 2011. The SA model also used available data for 30+ years due to which econometrically
robust time series error correction techniques were feasible which are not feasible in our case due to the
small number of observations.

II. Model, Data & Results for SA Type Model Developed for Vietnam

         Data for the model used for Vietnam was provided for the period 2000-2012 for the variables
listed below. Data for the AETR was not available from direct calculation so CIT/GDP was used as a
proxy for the AETR. This is not a satisfactory measure since CIT revenue is the dependent variable and
GDP is an explanatory variable. Since net loss was not available for 2011-12, lagged losses were used
instead (based on the enterprise survey) to preserve degrees of freedom. This means that we can
effectively use data for 2001-11 for regression, a total of 11 years annual data. The data series used are:

               Nominal GDP
               Business Investment of firms in the enterprise survey
               Net Operating Losses lagged 1 year of firms in the enterprise survey
               Consumer, Deflator, Industrial, Export and Import Price indices

                                                     37
                CIT revenue in nominal terms

        In all the models, log of real CIT revenue is the dependent variable. The AETR is taken as a
percentage leading to a ready interpretation of the coefficient that a 1 unit (in this case 1 percentage point)
increase in the AETR leads to a β % increase in CIT revenues . Several model specifications were tried.
In models 3 and 4 as opposed to models 1 and 2, a lagged dependent variable (the lagged log of real CIT
revenues) was used in addition to the time variable. Models 2 and 4 use log of real business investment in
the current year as an explanatory variable as opposed to models 1 and 3 that use log real losses lagged by
one year. The dependent variable is common to all models, and all other explanatory variables are
unchanged. A table of results is presented below after the table on SA models and results.

         2. Results and Observations

                 The number of observations at 11 (annual) was too small to allow for error correction techniques
         beyond the use of a simple time trend variable and a lagged dependent variable. Further, the absence of
         an independently calculated AETR meant that the CIT/GDP ratio had to be used, while log real CIT is the
         dependent variable and log real GDP is an explanatory variable. However, one feature emerges – the
         coefficient of the tax rate is positive at 0.1 in all model specifications. This can be interpreted in the
         following way: a 1 unit (1 percentage point) increase in the AETR increases CIT revenue by 0.1%. An
         increase of the AETR from 16.4% to 20% is an increase of 3.6 percentage points, so this should raise

                                                                 39
revenue by 0.36%. In this scenario, even with a 90% loss of potential revenue due to contraction of the
base when the effective tax rate is raised, we still get some additional revenue when we impose a uniform
tax rate of 20% on all firms and eliminate tax holidays and the special rate of 10%. However, if tax
holidays and special rates are retained and the top tax rate is lowered as is being contemplated, the AETR
can only go down, and this means that we will lose revenue at the rate of 10% for every percentage point
the AETR is lowered. Since we do not have information from the Enterprise survey on firms separated
by whether they are availing incentives or not, we cannot make a calculation of what the effective tax rate
will be under the new regime.

        To conclude, even in the most pessimistic scenario, Vietnam could reduce its CIT rate to the
proposed level of 22% and maintain its revenues if it eliminates the special rate at 10% and tax holidays
while retaining its current list of exempt incomes and incomes taxed on turnover. It can combine these
measures by raising its CIT rate on exhaustible natural resources to a uniform level of 50%. This will
ensure an attractive regime to attract investment as well as providing robust revenue for development in
the future. Lowering the CIT rates on large and small companies while retaining tax holidays and
incentive rates will most likely result in a fall in inflation adjusted CIT revenue in the short run.

3. Summary of Recommendations
    (i)    Reducing the corporate rate to 22% from 25% should be followed by elimination of
           concessionary tax rates of 10 or 20 percent for preferred economic investments. If this is not
           done, it will obviously lead to some revenue losses in the short run and perhaps even in the
           medium to long run.
    (ii)   The rate reduction should be accompanied by a rationalization of the incentive scheme where
           some investments presently enjoy tax exemption or 50 percent reduction in tax rates. Such
           incentives or tax expenditures should be carefully examined for their impact and effectiveness
           and compared to outcomes achievable by using other policy measures outside the tax regime
           such as provision of improved infrastructure.
    (iii) It is proposed that the agenda for reform in the future would do away with tax holidays, reduced
          rates and special deductions and multiple rates and have one single non-mineral rate at 22% and
          a single mineral rate of 50%. As discussed, some industries/enterprises may be given tax
          exempt status based on a formal procedure for determination of tax-exempt status. In all other
          cases of socio-economic objectives, the government can use refundable or non-refundable tax
          credits since these are certain, equitable and explicitly accountable tax expenditures. There is
          already a fairly long list of exempt income for socially desirable activities and no major
          modification is proposed to that list.
    (iv)   Vietnam could reduce its CIT rate to the proposed level of 22% - 20% and maintain its
           revenues if it eliminates the special rate at 10% and tax holidays while retaining its current list
           of exempt incomes and incomes taxed on turnover. It can combine these measures by raising
           its CIT rate on exhaustible natural resources to a uniform level of 50%. This will ensure an
           attractive regime to attract investment as well as providing robust revenue for development in
           the future. Lowering the CIT rates on large and small companies while retaining tax holidays
           and incentive rates will most likely result in a fall in inflation adjusted CIT revenue in the short
           run.

(v)    A close look at the list of possible effective CIT rates would reveal that the tax system is made
       very complex and opaque by the multiplicity of potential rates that a firm could pay in theory
       and the effects on horizontal and vertical equity are indeterminate. Thus a rationalization of
       this rate structure itself is an objective that the government may consider pursuing in the near
       future.
(vi)   There is an urgent need for cleaning data and conducting a fresh Enterprise survey. For the
       future, it is advisable to start collecting data for enterprises that separate incomes according to
       the applicable tax rates. In addition to reporting total pretax profit and tax paid, firms should be
       asked to report income in each category, separated by tax rate. As a simple check, the
       individual pretax profits reported by each firm should add up to the total, and the tax paid
       reported should be equal to the applicable rate multiplied by the income reported in each
       category. Even if firms earn incomes taxed at different rates, it would then be possible to add
       up incomes earned at a particular rate. This will facilitate analysis of revenue impacts when
       rates change, adjusted for possible dynamic effects.
(vii) According to the Enterprise survey 2010, a total of 70521 firms paid CIT at an effective rate
      over 27% - it is unlikely that so many enterprises had mineral income, unless firms paying on
      turnover basis are a large proportion of this category. The policymakers may also consider for
      the future the excessive burden on these firms – lowering the top rate of 25% is unlikely to
      benefit them.

         Other versions of similar models, with different data requirements are discussed for the purposes
of illustration. In our opinion their data requirements are even less likely to be met than the SA model.
They are presented in brief in increasing order of data difficulty to illustrate other possible approaches in
the academic literature.

        Abbas, Klemm, Bedi &Park (2012) adapting a model from Clausing (2007) have estimated the
equation:




         Since the true economic base cannot be estimated directly, the authors use the ratio of true
economic depreciation and the present discounted value of depreciation allowances as a proxy measure
for the ratio of base to corporate profits. A proxy measure of gross operating surplus to GDP is used by
the authors instead of corporate profits to GDP since the measure of corporate profits was not available to
the authors. As the authors point out: (pgs 15-16) “Like Clausing (2007), we proxy the share of profits in
the GDP by the gross operating surplus, which is a national accounts concept and for which some data are
available. Unfortunately we do not have data on corporate profits, which are likely to be different,
because the gross operating surplus includes profits from unincorporated businesses, and because there
are various other accounting differences, especially in the financial sector”. Further, they are unable to
split the profits to GDP ratio for reasons explained thus (Abbas et al, pg. 15) “Clausing (2007)
additionally splits the ratio of profits over GDP into the product of the ratio of profits to value added and
value added to GDP, but we do not have data on corporate value added.”

         What does this mean for Vietnam? If we have a series for corporate value added from the national
accounts for 12-15 years, and we have series of corporate profits from the tax department/enterprise
survey for all years as well, we can construct the series as in Clausing (2007). We would also have to
obtain the series on true economic depreciation (of enterprises assets) to depreciation allowances series
for the first proxy ratio as explained above. It is obvious that this data series is more stringent than the
data requirements for the SA model above that essentially provides the same elasticity – of tax revenues
to tax rates.

        One of the earliest models that illustrate the difference between the dynamic and static effects on
revenue of a change in the CIT rate is the Ramsey model that is now almost 80 years old. A simple
version is presented in Mankiw (2006). The static version is presented as:




                                                     42
Where:

         R       revenue per efficiency unit of labor
                 tax rate on capital income (similar to CIT rate)
         r       before-tax rate of return to capital
         k       capital per efficiency unit of labor

The dynamic version of this model is presented as:




Where:

                 tax rate on all labor income (similar to combined PIT and other wage taxes rate)

                 share of total income (GNI) going to capital

         First, the static formula implies that the effect of a change in the tax rate with a completely static
base is simply the change in the tax rate times the tax base or that revenue rises or falls by the full amount
of the tax change. However, the second (dynamic) equation is expressed as a percentage of the static
change and could take different values based only on 3 parameters – the CIT rate, the PIT rate and the
share of national income accruing to capital.

        For many countries, the effective values of     and    lie in the 25% range in terms of effective
tax rates if not statutory. For developed countries, the value of is below 50% normally while for
developing countries it can be above 50%. Either way, these parameters can and often are computed by
national accounts economists on a regular basis. Using the following ratios, Mankiw (2006) reports
“Consider the empirically plausible parameter values of    and      =1/4 and α =1/3. Then, (5) yields.




       A capital income tax cut has a long-run impact on revenue that is only half of its static impact. In
other words, growth pays for 50% of a capital income tax cut in the steady state.” (pg 1419)

        In the context of advanced countries many important econometric studies exist that have different
specifications that attempt to estimate the effect of the CIT rate on either CIT revenues or the tax base.

                                                        43
The important studies are summarized in Kawano and Slemrod (2012) and the important ones referred to
therein are Clausing (2007), Brill and Hassett (2007), Gravelle and Hungerford (2007), Devereux (2006)
among others. Kawano and Slemrod (2012) replicate the results from these models and then carry out
several different types of estimations and the first set of results is presented in the table marked table 7 at
the end of this annex for comparison. The variable Big refers to country size in terms of GDP etc.,
international refers to whether countries use worldwide or domestic bases to tax the base, and
depreciation is a measure of the PV of depreciation allowances. It can be seen that the coefficient on the
tax rate variable is actually very similar to the one found for Vietnam in our regressions above, even if the
variables chosen are not the same in our models.

         Further surveys of the all the theoretical issues involved in these types of estimations is presented
in great detail in Saez, Slemrod and Giertz (2012). One last issue is the type of models that involve the
second class of dynamic modeling, the effect of tax rates on investment. Abbas et al (2012) and Klemm
and Van Parys (2012) provide two good examples of such studies that include samples of developing
countries. As noted above, an increase in investment may not lead to an increase in the tax base and
revenues, but given that governments may be interested in promoting investment (domestic and FDI), the
result is separately of interest. Abbas et al (2012) summarizes their findings as follows: “The f irst two
regressions consider the marginal effective tax and control variables. The results show that the marginal
effective tax rate has no impact on investment. This suggests that when the tax rate rises on marginal
projects (i.e., projects that just break even after tax), the impact on aggregate investment is negligible.
The third and fourth regressions consider instead the average effective tax rate. These results show a
significant negative impact on investment. This suggests that rent-earning investments react to tax
changes and that this has an impact on aggregate investment.” (Abbas et al, pg 17).

        The results do not contradict those of Klemm and Van Parys (2012), which considers the effect of
tax incentives on investment in selected developing countries. They find that while FDI is somewhat
responsive to the tax rate and incentives, investment as a whole is not. However, as the authors have
noted, different studies (such as James and van Parys 2009) have found differing effects and results and a
comprehensive summary of many such studies for countries for whom data is easily available is also
available in De Mooij and Ederveen (2008).

       Chapter III: Expenses and Deductions, Thin
      Capitalization and Other Issues Connected with
                      Transfer Pricing

Expenses and Deductions

        The 2003 CIT law listed permissible expenses while stipulating certain expenses as not
permissible, or not deductible. The CIT law of 2008 does not explicitly mention permissible expenses, it
allows all expenses that are not specifically dis-allowed if two conditions are met - the expenses are real
and were incurred for the business and they are backed by documentary evidence as stipulated and
discussed in the introduction chapter.

        One of the major restrictions on permissible expenses is that companies can deduct no more than
10% of all deductible expenses (excluding certain controlled activities and the cost of goods sold in the
case of commercial activities) under the heading “expense of advertising, marketing, promotion,
brokerage commissions; receptions, ceremonies, conferences; marketing support, expense support,
payment discount; donation and offer of newspaper of the press agency directly related to production and
business activities”. This limit is slightly higher for newly established enterprises at 15% for the first
three years after establishment on or after January 1, 2009.

        Some expenditures are excluded from this ceiling limit such as commissions paid to insurance
brokers and to selling agents, certain distributors, expenses on market research and analysis, hiring
consultants for such research, fairs and commercial exhibitions and certain specified donations. However,
these expenditures are often regulated in other ways.

         A recent survey (2012) of over 300 firms conducted by the Institute of Economics and Finance
(IEF) in 3 major cities has raised some interesting issues regarding this limitation. Businesses in the
fields of trade, services and foreign invested enterprises have expressed difficulties with the limit, while
other firms spend amounts on advertising well below the set limits. Firms with FDI tend to find the limit
low on average, while the majority of domestic firms do not express difficulty. Similar effects are noticed
by size of firm, with the majority of large firms against the limit and a large majority of small firms for
the limit. Most of the adverse reactions came from FDI firms, large firms and firms engaged in the
banking, consumer electronics, food, beverages, and media and cosmetics sectors.

         Other issues: (1) Commissions paid to agents – these costs are fully deductible without limit if
they follow certain rules. This requires written contracts or the equivalent, the principal retaining
ownership of either the goods or the money and the principal either fixing the sale margin of the agent or
the percentage of commission on the purchase price to the agent. However, since ownership of goods is
rarely retained by the principal in practice these conditions are seldom fulfilled; (2) Display costs – can be
to both introduce products (which is fully deductible) or to promote sales of the goods (not fully
deductible). There are no clear guidelines to separate the two cases; (3) Costs of product introduction –
related to the previous point, there are no set rules for which costs are classifiable here and whether some

                                                     46
types of costs are fully deductible or fall within the ceiling. Compounding this confusion is the fact that
for expenses on staff related to introduction of products, it is not specified if the deductibility is for new
products only or all products.

         These kinds of expenditures are generally legitimate and are incurred to introduce new brands in
the market and serve the purpose of informing and educating the consumers. Therefore placing a
restriction on the total amount that can be spent on such items is not justified. The only thing that has to
be ensured is that the expenditures are genuine. One way to ensure this is that in all cases where the
expenditures on these categories are above a certain limit, the accounts will be audited. This type of
provision will discourage businesses to come up with spurious claims. This also obviates the need for
more regulations to minimize endless disputes that arise based on narrow definitions and bickering over
which costs are to be included under which provision.

        The expenses on entertainment are somewhat tricky because one has to be careful when this is a
legitimate business expense and when it becomes an employee benefit. There has to be clear rules about
allowing entertainment as an expense.2 At present, Circular 01/2010/TT-BTC dated 6/1/2010 of the
Ministry of Finance regulates spending to welcome foreigners to work in Vietnam; spending on
organizing international conferences and workshops in Vietnam and spending on domestic guests. This
Circular applies only to units using money from the state budget.

         Another restriction is the provision governing deductibility of inputs. The law requires
documentary proof in the form of invoices or import VAT payment vouchers and that transactions above
20 million Dongs be made through a bank. However, there is no such requirement for some firms. VAT
exempt firms are allowed to purchase goods and services without making payments through a bank even
if the amount exceeds 20 million Dongs. In some other cases such as payments to labor in excess of 200
hours per year for overtime; even when the businesses have legal records they cannot deduct the amounts
in excess as these expenditures violate provisions of the relevant labor laws.

         (1) The proposed draft CIT already incorporates a provision to disallow deduction from taxable
profit of value added tax already claimed as input credit while calculating VAT liability. Therefore the
issue under consideration is confined to the deduction from taxable income of expenses over 20 million
VND that were incurred without payment through a Bank (say by a VAT exempt firm that cannot claim
input credit). The issue applies to VAT exempted and CIT taxable firms since they do not claim input
credit under VAT. CIT deduction of input costs by firms that purchase deductible items without having
to make payments through a bank are presently disallowed if over 20 million VND.

        (2) The main point is that there is no need to have 2 sets of standards and create opportunity for
evasion.
2
  Two possibilities are presented for the sake of illustration. In Malaysia, expenditures that are a benefit to
customers are deductible from corporate income, while expenditures that benefit employees are not deductible. In
some other countries, the expenditures that benefit employees are deductible from CIT but are taxed as fringe
benefits either under the PIT or through a Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT). Since the PIT rate in Vietnam is lower than
the CIT rate, taxing under PIT would lose revenue, so it is better to either disallow those expenses or tax them at an
FBT rate closer to the CIT rate.

                                                         47
        (3) It is never recommended to allow any deduction without proper records or vouchers so for all
such transactions, the relevant records should be specified or ceilings prescribed.

         (4) An issue may arise about genuine expenditures incurred by firms that violate some other law
such as deduction for labor overtime in excess of 200 hours per year that violates the labor laws. Even
though firms have incurred such expenditures, they cannot deduct such costs. Obviously expenses that
are in violation of some other law cannot be allowed (such as overtime payment in excess of 200 hours),
thus either one of the laws needs to be amended to prevent this.

         Another issue is the requirement that Enterprises are required to set reasonable consumption
limits for raw materials, materials, fuel, energy or goods used for production and business activities from
the beginning of a year or a period of product manufacture and notify these limits to their managing tax
agencies within 3 months after commencement of production using these consumption limits. Use of
resources in excess of these limits and wasted resources pose a problem as they are governed by very
strict regulations and there is delay in adjustment of norms after the tax authorities are informed.

Recommendation:

        Remove the regulations on requiring enterprises to inform the tax authorities about the
consumption of raw materials. Allow enterprises to deduct expenses for raw materials, materials, fuel,
energy, according to the actual invoices if valid. Normally, tax laws incorporate provisions on how to
deal with goods lost or damaged due to fire; obsolescence etc., and these can cover inputs used in
production as well as wasted inputs. Issues of excessive input deductions can be dealt with through audit.

         The law allows deductions for certain activities such as specified donations and grants and to
finance activities for education, health, disaster recovery and “gratitude” for the poor . However many
enterprises have also contributed to other socially desirable activities such as for the local implementation
of road improvement, infrastructure development or implementation of the assistance program for remote
areas, including the Sea Islands. Since deductions are allowed for only the 4 specified grants, there is a
disincentive to fund other activities that are equally laudable but not tax-deductible. There are other
issues relating to qualifying “gratitude” donations to the poor – the deductibility of certain in-kind
donations or donations eventually reaching those without the appropriate “poor” certification . Even
within the classes of deductible donations, some restrictions exclude certain activities while allowing
others.

Recommendation:

        Normally, donations to qualified charitable organizations etc are deductible from income subject
to certain restrictions. The receiving entity in most cases will be able to register as a qualifying
organization under the tax law. Any donations to taxable entities are normally not deductible - in any
case the recipient would have to pay tax on income received including donations. It is also not necessary
that donations made to all tax – exempt organizations should be deductible for the donor. In the US,
donations made to “qualified organizations” are deductible from income tax as well as corporate income
tax subject to restrictions on the receiving organization and overall limits for deduction of donations. If
any such organizations qualify as tax exempt, they must be explicitly recognized by the tax authorities; in


                                                     48
the US the donor can verify the status of the receiving organization online in a part of the IRS website at
http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&-Non-Profits/Exempt-Organizations-Select-Check to ensure that it is an
authentic qualified organization. In countries such as the US, once proper proof of financing activities of
a qualifying tax exempt organization is maintained, the expenditure would be deductible subject to overall
limits that may be prescribed and various restrictions by type of tax and type of receiving entity. A
summary of the restrictions for US PIT and CIT can be found at http://www.bbb.org/us/Charity-Tax-
Deductions/. Otherwise if the receiving entity was not recognized by the tax authority as an exempt
organization, the receiving entity would have to count it as income and pay tax on it. There is still no
guarantee that the receiving organization’s tax exempt status automatically allows deduction of the
donation. That is also further regulated by the tax authority. Once the donor has obtained proper receipt
and tax identification number of the qualifying recipient, it is the recipient who has to prove that the
donation/financing was used for a qualifying activity; the donor only has to prove that the valid donation
was made to a qualifying organization and total deductions are within overall limits.

         This also applies to the case of undistributed profits of private higher education establishments
that re-invest their profits in education. There are clear rules for operation of non-profits. If an institution
is set up as a for-profit, or denied the non-profit status, it is taxed like any other commercial activity.
Then there are no separate rules required for these organizations, they are treated like any other company.
Registered non-profits do not have to pay tax anyway. Where a non-profit engages in commercial
activities, they are separated into independent companies with distinct legal status and accounts. Non-
profits are also required to maintain prescribed accounts. Also, whether something is exempt from VAT
or not is a related but entirely separate issue. As a non-profit, an entity can also be sales tax or VAT
exempt.

         The last issue relates to the non-deductibility of enterprise contributions to voluntary pension
funds. Compulsory contributions to social insurance and other forms of insurance such as health and
unemployment are allowed. Deduction of matching enterprise contributions to voluntary retirement funds
is not included in the CIT. The language used in the draft law is:

        “Contributions made to voluntary retirement funds or to funds with the nature of social security;
        the amount of money used to take out voluntary retirement insurance policies for employees,
        which is in excess of the regulated level”.

Recommendation:

         Make such contributions deductible subject to a maximum upper limit at the time of contribution
and partly or fully taxable under the PIT at the time of withdrawal of benefits. The government still loses
revenue due to the disparity in CIT and PIT rates. Since the government wants to encourage the use of
voluntary pension funds rather than only compulsory pension schemes such as social insurance (as is
increasingly done in the US as well), it has to ensure that the two forms of pension are treated equally. If
employers are required to contribute to voluntary pension funds of employees and cannot deduct such
contributions, then they have a disincentive to contribute to such funds and would prefer the contribution
to social insurance which can be deducted. If however, there is no obligation for employers to contribute
to voluntary pension funds or to voluntary retirement insurance policies, then there is no need to allow



                                                      49
deduction – the employer can reduce his contribution by the amount of the extra tax payable on account
of non-deduction.

         The current tax law does not contain provisions for the determination of deductible expenses of
some specific sectors (banking, insurance, securities, lottery, etc.). Guidelines of the Law (Circular No.
130/2009/TT-BTC, Circular 123/2012/TT-BTC) exclude certain deductible expenses such as "Expenses
of business insurance, lottery business, securities business and a number of other specific business fails to
comply with the written instructions of the Ministry of Finance. " In accordance with that, the Ministry of
Finance has issued separate circulars and guidelines for specific sectors such as insurance, securities,
lottery, and banking.

      To clarify policy, bring transparency and improve the legal standing of the circular, the
Government has proposed to insert in the CIT law under non-deductible expenses:

        “Payments for business activities in banking, insurance, lottery or securities sectors; and for
        other specific business activities as regulated by the Ministry of Finance.”

        This seems a sound proposal. As long as such expenses are governed by separate circulars there
is no harm in linking them to the CIT law to give better legal standing to those circulars.

Under Capitalization or Thin Capitalization

         In recent years, tax administrations in many countries have been concerned with the problem that
the ratio of equity to debt falls short of the norm for that industry. Companies take on a large amount of
debt with very little share money from shareholders. This practice may give rise to two sets of problems.
First, a large amount of debt implies that interest deductibility will be high and that will erode the tax
base. Second, with the shareholders stake in the business being low, this may increase the chances of
bankruptcy thereby imposing costs on the economy.

         The problem becomes more pronounced in the case of foreign subsidiary companies and the State
Owned Enterprises (SOEs) that enjoy both explicit and implicit forms of government guarantee and
therefore can raise large amounts of debt from the market. This problem has been tackled differently by
different countries. In case of foreign companies, one solution could be charging a high withholding tax
on interest payment to foreigners. Some countries (Belgium and Italy) judge the matter of thin
capitalization on case by case basis. Other countries such as the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and France
have legislated a limit on the debt/equity ratio that certain categories of industries should not exceed if
their interest is to be fully deducted. According to the US law, a debt equity ratio above 1.5 to 1 may
jeopardize interest deductibility.

        Another incentive for doing this and sometimes even disguising return on equity as interest
payment is due to preferred tax treatment of interest payment compared to dividend payment which is
often subject to double taxation, first at the company level and then at the personal level. Interest on the
other hand is taxed only once at the personal level. Some of the other restrictions imposed by a few
countries include:

         The loan cannot be obtained from shareholders or other related parties;

                                                     50
         The loan interest conforms to the market interest and is not excessively high;
         The amount of interest payable is not related to the profits or some other performance
          measure of the company.

        To mandate for a debt-equity ratio may be better because banning the loan from certain quarters
and putting conditions about interest rate may not be efficient and may affect the company’s financing
decisions adversely. It is also difficult to administer. The important point to note is that it does not
matter what debt-equity ratio exists in practice but what matters is the ratio allowed for tax deduction.
Debt-equity ratio in this sense limits the interest deductibility.

        The 2006 law on foreign investment does not provide any regulations on thin capital. The CIT
law of 2008 has the following provisions:

         Loan interest payments for production and business of enterprises that are not credit
          institutions or “economic organizations”, in excess of 150% of basic interest rate announced
          by the State Bank of Vietnam at the time of borrowing are not deductible;
         The payment of loan interest for capital contribution or payments of loan interest on loans
          taken to make up the deficit in the declared equity base are not allowable.

        Current CIT Law does not contain provisions to control expenses in the case of “thin capital”.

        The debt-to-equity ratio for Vietnam Enterprises as a whole was calculated to be 1.32 times in
1999, 1.93 times in 2000 and 1.96 times in 2002. On 1/1/2010, the average Vietnamese private enterprise
had liabilities at 2.1 times equity on average, while this number for State enterprises was 3.09.

        The results of the program named "The implementation of policies, laws, and use of state assets
in the group, the state corporation" of the National Assembly in 2009 also showed that 30-40% of the
total number of enterprises have the ratio of liabilities to equity of 3 times or more. In particular there are
a number of companies in the state whose debt is more than 10 times higher than the norm. This is
particularly of concern in the context of transfer pricing by foreign owned or invested enterprises. For
example, the subsidiary in Vietnam borrows a large amount of money from the parent company. Interest
expense paid to the parent company is subject to foreign contractors tax (FCT) at 5%. However,
borrowing costs are deducted from taxable income and this will reduce corporate income tax. Standard
CIT rate is 25%. Thus, parent company could have the benefit of a 20% reduction in the corporate
income tax. In contrast, the Vietnam State budget will lose this amount.

Recommendation:

         There should be regulations on deductible expenses of borrowing costs in the case business loans
ratio to total equity is too high. This regulation will ensure financial security for businesses and for the
economy, and moreover, this will act against transfer pricing. To this end, the draft law provides clear
roadmap from to enterprises. Enterprises have time to be active in business restructuring and rebalancing
the sources of working capital. On the other hand the draft law provides for the exclusion of interest
expense only for loans arising from or on 01/01/2016.



                                                      51
        International experience shows that in many countries with thin capital regulations, where interest
paid for the loan exceeds a certain percentage (ratio of loans to equity) the countries do not allow total
cost to be deducted when calculating the corporate income tax. OECD recommendations suggest a
maximum debt/equity ratio of 3:1. In fact, in many countries such as Taiwan, Japan, Poland, Spain,
Chile, Peru, South Africa, Portugal and Brazil loan provisions of business on equity in excess of 3:1 shall
be considered as thin capital; some countries specified lower rate as Canada (2:1), France, the United
States (1.5:1), Venezuela (1:1). Some countries apply this rate depending on the type of company. For
example in China the prescribed ratio is 2:1 for normal business and 5:1 for financial institutions; Russia
has a prescribed ratio of 3:1 for regular business and 12.5:1 ratio for banks and other financial institutions;
Korea has 3:1 ratio if the loans are raised from of foreign shareholders and 6:1 ratio for businesses such as
financial institutions. Accordingly, the interest charged in excess of capital is considered to be thin and
shall not be included in deductible expenses when calculating income tax liability.

Provisions of Some Other Countries:

        - New Zealand - The applicable ratio was decreased from 75% (3:1) to 60% (3:2) as of 2011/12
income year. Additionally, debt must be in excess of the specified D: E ratio, and also greater than 110%
of the worldwide debt percentage.

         - Germany - German rules were previously based on a 1.5:1 ratio and a de minimus safe harbor
(virtually safe or too small to be of concern) of euro250k. This was replaced effective 2008 with a
general limitation on interest deductions exceeding 30% of EBITDA (with exceptions, such as threshold
of euro 3m etc).

        - Australia - whilst the 3:1 ratio is used, it is a safe harbor. Entities with debt in excess of 3:1
(20:1 for financial entities) may demonstrate that the debt is at arm's length (i.e. independent parties
could raise that level of debt). There are also other safe harbors for de minimus interest deductions (less
than AUD 250k) and for worldwide gearing ratio (ratio of equity to debt or equity to asset base).

        - Netherlands - until 1 Jan 2013 Netherlands denied deductions for excessive debt (debt
exceeding 3:1) provided the excess exceeded euro 500k. As of 1 Jan 2013 new rules focusing on
excessive debt in participating subsidiaries were introduced.

         - In Vietnam real estate business must have a minimum of 20% equity investment in the project
(ratio 4:1), to ensure conditions on the financial ability to undertake a real estate project. Businesses
BOT, BTO, BT now also have to meet the equity ratio from 20% to 30% (4:1 or 3.3:1), depending on the
individual project, to be able to participate in the project.

        - Circular No.TT 13/2010/TT-NHNN of State Bank has regulations mandating the ratio of capital
to ensure safety in the operation of credit institutions is 9% which is effectively a 10:1 D/E ratio.

         The introduction of thin capitalization rules is in line with international trends (in particular the
current focus on base erosion and profit shifting), as is the basis for the proposed rule, being a ratio
approach of a 4:1 debt to equity ratio (and 10:1 D:E ratio for financial institutions). For completeness, it
is however noted that more recently several countries have moved to an "earning stripping approach" to
dealing with excessive interest (% of EBITDA - see Italy and Germany for example). Ratios of 2-3.5 are

                                                      52
common, so in this regard it is noted that a ratio of 4:1 is reasonably generous. One risk is that companies
currently capitalized at a lower ratio might take the opportunity to introduce further debt to the maximum
allowed under the legislation. The Law should include a provision that would disallow interest on new
debt for which there is no commercial or business purpose. The drafting team may consider taking a two-
prong approach: a d/e approach and an interest stripping approach3, perhaps restricting interest to 30%
EBIT.

         Delayed implementation mechanism - The proposed roadmap for implementation (delayed until
2016) is important as it gives time for enterprises to review their arrangements and make necessary
adjustments. What is unclear however is how the rules will apply whereby an enterprise has a
combination of loan (debt) instruments with different commencement dates. It is proposed that a blanket
start date of 1 Jan 2016 may be considered (i.e. for all debt in existence at the relevant measurement time,
including those concluded pre-2016). The impact of this on enterprises with significant debt from
independent parties could be limited through the possibility for an arm's length alternative, and the impact
on parties with related party debt is addressed by providing sufficient notice (over 2 years) for them to
reconsider their financing arrangements. This would also prevent erosion of the tax base through
"gearing up" by enterprises in order to exploit the delayed implementation.

        On the reference to loans “as opposed to “debt, it is suggested that the definition of debt could use
a “catch all” phrase, such as “Debt means any form of financial instrument on which interest or similar
payments are made that are allowable as a deduction in a computation of taxable income”.

         It is important to have clear definitions of the various terms. Introduction of rules based on a
D:E ratio requires clear and comprehensive definitions of "debt", "equity" and "interest" in the CIT Law.
A clear definition of "credit institutions and banks" would also be necessary to ensure appropriate scope
and application of the proposed rule (and again, to limit any major economic distortions). For example
some, countries also allow higher ratios not only to banks, but also securities dealers and similar firms
(Australia). If the term “credit institutions and banks” is interpreted very liberally, the much highe r D:E
ratio will apply to a much wider range of institutions and may cause a distortion in the financial markets
as firms seek to alter their economic activities to qualify as credit institutions to avail the higher interest
deductions. How certain items are to be valued (debt, assets, capital) also requires careful consideration,
in many countries reference is made to accounting standards. The applicable accounting standards in
Vietnam and their interaction with the tax law (including relevant definitions) will therefore need to be
reviewed.

        When are debt levels to be measured? Under the proposed rule it is not clear as to the "timing" of
measurement of the D:E levels. i.e. should the D:E ratio be measured (1) at year end, (2) as average ((a)
opening and closing balance method, (b) multiple measurement points, (c) monthly etc.)? Clear
guidelines on this are necessary to reduce uncertainty.


3
  Interest stripping refers to the rules that disallow interest deductions in excess of a certain percentage of taxable
income, and generally apply to corporations that have a debt to equity ratio in excess of the prescribed limit. This
prevents erosion of the CIT base by restricting total deductions for interest payment to a certain percentage of
income, payments in excess of that amount are “stripped” or removed or deferred and deduction is not allowed in
the current tax year.

                                                          53
        Approach of proposed rule and the possible impact on economic behavior: the proposed rules are
based on a ratio approach, which is to be applied rigidly. This has the potential to distort economic
behavior. Whilst many countries have adopted D:E ratio approaches, numerous have specified these as
safe harbors4, providing that interest on debt exceeding such ratios will still be deductible provided the
taxpayer can demonstrate that the level of debt is arm's length (see for example Australia).

        On the point of the “arm’s length let over-ride”, this means that taxpayers need to show that, had
they been independent and free-standing, they would have been able to borrow more from a third party
lender. The GDT would need to counter this if this point is raised.

        More fundamentally, it is not clear about the scope of these rules. They appear to apply to purely
domestic loans as well as cross-border loans (which may be intentional, as the TP rules also apply
domestically), but also to loans from any lender (whether related or not) – with the implication that the
rules apply to stand-alone companies that are not members of a group. The assumption is that Vietnam
intends these rules to apply to interest deductions arising in members of a MNE or Vietnamese group –
perhaps this should also be clarified.

         Application to SMEs etc.: The proposed rule appears to apply to all corporate enterprises with no
threshold. A significant number of countries that have thin capitalization rules in place provide "de
minimus" safe harbors, whereby the interest will be deductible regardless of the D:E ratio or other
applicable thin capitalization rules (i.e. Arm’s length principle (ALP) or % of taxable earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio) provided the total interest deduction is
below a specified amount.

        Administration, monitoring and information: Monitoring the application of thin capitalization
rules by the Tax Administration will require certain specific information. It will therefore be necessary to
ensure that the tax filings require disclosure of debt and equity levels and information concerning
application of thin capitalization rules.

Taxation of Foreign versus Domestic Companies

        There is no differential treatment between taxation of domestic and foreign corporations. As part
of Vietnam’s efforts to meet the criteria for accession to the World Trade Organization, the Vietnam’s
National Assembly has unified principles relating to investment in Vietnam by foreign and domestic
investors. Foreign invested enterprises are treated on the same footing as Vietnamese companies. This is
the consequence of the national treatment principle that Vietnam has attempted to adhere to since the
conclusion of bilateral trade agreement with the US.

Capital Gains

        Income from capital transfers and from real property transfers; income from the ownership of or
right to use assets; income from transfer, leasing out or liquidation of assets are included in “other

4
 A legal provision to reduce or eliminate liability as long as good faith is demonstrated; in this case the interest
deduction ceiling based on D:E ratio would apply except in those cases where firms can demonstrate that the
deduction is valid, and at “arm’s length” interest rates.

                                                        54
income” when calculating taxable income and are thus taxable in Vietnam. The various methods of
calculation of capital gains are:

         Taxable income of real property transfer equals (=) assessable income minus (-) the loss
          during the real estate transfer in the previous years (if any). Assessable income of real estate
          transfer is calculated as revenue earned from the real estate transfer minus the cost the real
          estate and the deductible expenses incurred on the real estate transfer;
         Taxable income from transfer or liquidation of assets other than real estate is the sum of
          money collected from asset transfer or liquidation minus (-) the book value of assets at the
          time of transfer or liquidation and deductible expenses directly related to the transfer or
          liquidation;
         Taxable income from capital transfer (excluding income from securities transfer) is the total
          sum of money collected under a transfer contract minus (-) the purchase price of the
          transferred capital amount, minus (-) expenses directly related to the transfer;
         Taxable income from securities transfer is the sale price minus (-) the purchase price of the
          transferred securities, minus (-) expenses directly related to the transfer;
         Taxable income from intellectual property copyright or technology transfer, is the total
          collected sum of money minus (-) the cost or expense for creating the transferred intellectual
          property right or technology, minus (-) the expense for maintaining, upgrading or developing
          the transferred intellectual property right or technology, and other deductible expenses.

         As discussed above and in chapter 1, capital gains are now taxable in Vietnam. However, there is
no provision for indexation of the purchase price. In situations of high inflation this leads to over taxation
of the capital gains since the selling price increases both due to increase in real value of the asset as well
as inflation. To estimate the true capital gain, the purchase price should also be appropriately adjusted for
inflation. Using the historic purchase price rather than an inflation indexed purchase price overstates the
extent of the capital gain and may discourage genuine long-term investment in assets. To discourage
short-term speculation in liquid assets, some countries place restrictions on indexation for assets held for
periods less than 1-3 years, but indexation is usually desirable for long-term investments.

Regulation of Transfer Pricing

         Originally, transfer pricing provisions did not exist in the Vietnamese CIT law. They do,
however, form a part of their Double Tax Avoidance Agreements. Transfer pricing adjustments however
cannot be made only on the basis of treaty law. The force for carrying out an adjustment under the
transfer pricing regulations must come from the domestic law. In international law on taxation it is
commonly understood that the taxpayer can rely on whatever is more beneficial to him, treaty law or
domestic law. This situation has now been remedied. Where the agreement on avoidance of double
taxation which the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has signed has different provisions on the permanent
establishment, the provisions of that Agreement shall apply.

         The corporate/business enterprise tax rate of 25% was low and comparable to the tax rates in the
region and countries with whom Vietnam does business. With a number of deductions and exemptions
provided in the tax laws, the effective tax rate was even lower than 25%. Vietnam has gone for a lower
rate for all non-mineral companies. One way to avoid conflict and foster a favorable business climate

                                                     55
without losing revenues is for the tax authorities to adopt regulatory criteria that have the support of
international bodies. Fortunately a consensus exists among the OECD, the UN and the EU that a single
guideline should be employed both by the enterprises in setting transfer prices and by the taxing
jurisdictions. The basic guideline is the “arms-length-criterion”.

        Arms-length price is the price that would have been negotiated between two unrelated parties for
similar transactions under similar circumstances. To prevent the misuse of transfer pricing, most
countries establish their legal right to adjust the reported transfer prices to conform to an arms-length
standard. It may, however, be noted that implementing arms-length pricing has been a difficult task in
practice both for the multinationals and the taxing jurisdictions.

        The main provisions for transfer pricing in the CIT law in Vietnam are laid down as follows.

Provisions to Regulate the Expenses of Business Management Allocated by Parent Companies
Abroad to Permanent Establishments in Vietnam

CIT Law 2008 has the following provision:

        “Article 9. Deductible expenses and non-deductible expenses when determining taxable income

        2. The following items shall be non-deductible expenses when determining taxable income:

         (d) That part of business management expenses allocated by a foreign enterprise to its resident
establishment in Vietnam which exceeds the level calculated by the allocation method stipulated by the
law of Vietnam.”

        The allocation method referred to above is defined in the following law:

Circular No. 123/2012/TT-BTC:

        “Article 6. Deductible and nondeductible expenditures upon determination of taxable income

         2.25. The expenses of business management allocated by company abroad to permanent
establishments in Vietnam in excess of the expenses calculated by the following formula:


                                     Taxable revenue of permanent
    Expenses of business               establishment in Vietnam                     Total expenses of
   management allocated                                                                  business
   by foreign company to              = revenue of foreign company
                                    Total                                           Xmanagement of
  permanent establishment           including revenues of permanent                foreign company in
  in Vietnam in tax period         establishments in other countries in                 tax period
                                               tax period




                                                   56
         This method ensures that the total administrative or business management cost of the parent
company of the Vietnam PE allocated as an expense to be deducted from the PE’s income while
calculating Vietnam CIT liability does not exceed the same proportion as its revenue. It means that total
business management (overhead or administrative) costs deductible in Vietnam under this head has to be
in the same proportion as Vietnam PE’s earning to total earnings of the parent company, subject to certain
restrictions on start dates, availability of audited financial records and compliance with Vietnam’s
regulations on accounting, etc.

       There are further provisions to regulate business transactions between associated parties:
Circular No. 66/2010/TT-BTC dated April 22, 2010 – guiding the determination of market prices in
business transactions between associated parties allows the following 5 methods to determine the
“arm’s length price” or its substitute that can serve as a basis for determining the true value of
deductions or taxable income for related parties. The methods allowed are:

                The comparable uncontrolled transaction price method;
                The resale price method;
                The cost plus method;
                The comparable profit method:
                The profit split method.

Current Issues

(1) The Allocation of Business Management Expenses:

         The general management costs from all areas of business and activities-including business
activities not related to the subsidiary in Vietnam are distributed to the subsidiary in Vietnam by the
parent company abroad. This can cause a loss to the subsidiary in Vietnam.

(2) The Most Common Forms of Transfer Pricing:

        The subsidiaries in Vietnam usually reduce income tax in Vietnam by doing the following:

             Raise the value of tangible fixed assets imported from their offshore parents and
              associated companies thereby increasing cost, as well as depreciation and reducing the
              CIT payable in Vietnam;
             Raise the price of raw materials imported from the parent company or a companies who
              are members in the group in order to increase deductible expenses;
             Raise the value of intangible assets acquired such as royalty payments, fixed payments
              for use of brand names etc.;
             Lower selling price of output products by export contract through its parent company or
              associated companies abroad in order to reduce the revenue and reduce the amount of
              income tax payable in Vietnam;
             Subsidiary in Vietnam provide services to foreign associated companies at prices lower
              than the market price or free of charge. Conversely, they pay the service fee to the parent
              company or its foreign associated companies at very high prices;


                                                   57
             Subsidiary in Vietnam takes loans from the parent company or associated companies
              abroad in the same group at very high interest rate.

        Management costs allocated to the subsidiaries in Vietnam must be cost incurred for general
management of the parent company for the region and related business activities in Vietnam, which does
not include administrative costs for each private business activity of the head office and other expenses
incurred for other areas, or for production and business activities that do not take place in Vietnam. The
maximum allocated expenses must be limited to 8% -12% of the total costs incurred in Vietnam. Since
the method of calculation of apportionment of the costs stated above does not rely on costs in Vietnam,
but takes the total administrative cost of the parent company and allots it to Vietnam PE in the proportion
of income of the Vietnam PE to total income, it could happen in case of the total business management
cost being very high that the allocated cost could be higher than 12% of the Vietnam PE’s total costs
(excluding the allocated business management cost).

        These regulations to limit the allocation of administrative overheads are applied in many
countries such as France and Belgium. It is also suggested that the “thin-capital” regulations which have
been proposed in the CIT Law draft should be applied and the content of transfer pricing should be
included in the Enterprise Income Tax Law to raise the legality of these regulations. When combined
with the low uniform tax rate and abolition of tax incentives, these measures should help control transfer
pricing more effectively. Training to appropriate officers in this area should also be considered.

         Paragraph 3 of Article 2 of the Law on income tax 2008 regulates the term “Resident
establishment” in order to determine the tax payers covered under the CIT and the CIT calculation
method.

        CIT Law 2008: "3. Resident establishment of a foreign enterprise means a production and/or
business establishment via which a foreign enterprise conducts part or all of its production and/or
business activities in Vietnam which earn income, comprising …”

         The additional conditions "earn income" for the concept of resident establishment places a
restriction on the scope of this provision making it narrower than international regulations and agreements
thereby affecting the tax base in Vietnam. Business establishments may not be considered as resident
establishment in Vietnam when they have no earned income.

         Thus, the CIT Law draft removes the phrase "earning income" in the definition of resident
establishment.

      This is a good proposal; otherwise a PE that successfully transfers all its income out of Vietnam
may completely evade the provisions of the CIT law.

         The definition is still not in line with international standards found in tax treaties. In this regard,
it is noted that the definition provides taxing rights beyond those generally afforded in tax treaties (i.e.
providing for services PE and not providing exclusion for independent agents), however this is not an
issue provided that tax treaties, where applicable, override Vietnam domestic CIT law. Moreover, the
core definition of PE does not implement the "fixed place of business PE" in the same way as tax treaties
as it refers to examples and not a clear requirement such as "fixed place of business". As a result there

                                                      58
may be instances whereby activities of a non-resident would comprise a PE under the tax treaty but not
under the CIT law.

Tax Integration and Flat Tax Rates

        The CIT laws exempt many enterprises receiving dividends from paying CIT on dividends
received under certain circumstances. However, the PIT law requires any person who has dividend
income to pay tax on that income at 5%.

        The matter of tax integration arises because of the notion that corporate income tax and personal
income tax result in double taxation of income. The presumption is that ultimately even the income from
the companies accrues to individual shareholders and when dividends are subject to personal income
taxation, it amounts to double taxation of income.

         Classical method and full integration are at the two ends of the spectrum in this regard. In
classical method (US, Switzerland) the corporate income and dividends are taxed separately and
shareholders bear a double tax burden. In Full integration, tax on business profits is withheld by the full
amount and claimed as a credit when personal income tax is computed. The final effective tax rate in this
case is at the personal income tax rate and company income tax is just a withholding device. No country
has tried full integration. The US and a few other countries, however, effectively adopt this method in
case of small companies with a limited number of owners (less than 35 in US).

        Most countries have adopted some form of partial integration methods in which some relief is
granted either at the corporation level or the shareholders level. These are discussed in detail in the final
chapter on international experience of taxation of corporate income.

Flat Tax

         Slovakia has adopted a flat rate system under which all tax rates are at 19 per cent – rates for
personal income tax, corporate income tax and value added tax. For tax integration, they have taken a
rather bold approach. They have abolished the dividend taxation completely. Since both personal income
and corporate income are taxed at 19 per cent, this approach has made the taxation of income fully neutral
in terms of the source of income and there is no incentive either way - to incorporate or not to incorporate
– for tax planning purposes.

         Russia has also adopted a flat rate personal income tax with a single tax rate of 13 per cent in
addition to zero per cent. But in their case, the federal corporate income tax rate is 30 per cent and the
combined rate becomes 35 per cent because local municipalities have been allowed to impose a corporate
income tax of 5 per cent. The rate of dividend taxation was first raised from 15 per cent to 30 per cent in
year 2000. This was, however, accompanied by a credit for the underlying corporate income tax paid.
Later on the imputation credit was withdrawn and a low dividend tax at the rate of 6 per cent and now at
5% has been applied. Thus both corporate income and dividend income are taxed but the dividends are
not taxed at the normal PIT rate but at a much reduced rate. This is not a full tax integration system but
closer to a partial integration system (to the extent that dividends are taxed at a much lower rate than the
PIT), as long as the same income is not taxed again under the PIT.


                                                     59
         Since the scope of this report does not include PIT, we will not make further suggestions on that
account. However, it may be said that notwithstanding the deduction of 5% tax on dividends at the
corporate level, there are still two issues that arise: (1) whether to tax realized capital gains from retained
earnings as well to maintain parity between tax payable at the personal level between dividends and
capital gains; (2) whether the government sees it as an issue of providing strong incentives to all classes
of income earners to become shareholders, or whether the government views income from corporations as
primarily a source of income for the rich that should be taxed.

        If the government wants to maintain strong incentives to invest (especially in the long-term) in
companies, then it can continue to exempt the capital gains portion and do the following for distributed
dividends (details above):

            (1) Dividend tax credit or imputation system with refund at personal level
            (2) Single Stage System
            (3) Dividend deduction at personal level (partial taxation at PIT level)

         If, however, the government feels that dividends and capital gains accrue mostly to the rich and
they are not likely to correctly pay PIT on dividends (or capital gains), then the government should apply
as much of the tax as it can at the corporate stage. Instead of 5%, the dividend tax can be raised to 10%.
This has two risks: (1) smaller shareholders returns will fall, and may exceed their liability under PIT; (2)
if capital gains are not taxed a second time, shareholders will prefer to receive profits through this
mechanism rather than dividends.

        Therefore, the government should consider a proper method of partial integration. It can
withhold dividend tax at a higher rate of 10-15% at the corporate stage, but provide a credit of the tax
paid to PIT paying shareholders if they file a PIT return and if dividends are taxed like other income at
progressive rates. Then the government should also include short – term capital gains from shares at the
same rate in the PIT to maintain parity.

Suggestions to Improve Conditions for the Selection of Accounting Practices for Taxation Purposes

        Generally as a rule all businesses - big or small - maintain some accounts so as to know their
margin of profit. The corporate sector has to maintain accounts in the manner prescribed by the company
law. It is understood that accounts by companies are maintained and audited by chartered accountants.
These are few and their level of competency is not known. The tax laws do not prescribe any method of
maintaining accounts. Some provisions exist in the law on value added tax but not in the CIT laws.

        Small businesses with low turnovers cannot be expected to get their accounts audited as the costs
may be too high for them. The tax statute should provide that the profits disclosed should be reflected in
the accounts maintained and shown to the tax officer. If the accounts are not maintained in a credible
manner from which the profits can be properly deduced, then the accounts would be liable to be rejected
and the profits estimated by the tax officer. The tax officer would be also entitled to resort to an
estimation of income even in cases where no accounts are maintained or not produced by the taxpayer
before the tax department. Vietnam has the following provisions for non- business enterprises that cannot
account for taxable profit in the normal fashion.


                                                      60
        Non-business units that indulge in goods and services business subject to enterprise income tax
who can account for their revenue but not account for cost and income of the business operation shall
declare and pay enterprise income tax as a percentage on the revenue of sales of goods and services, as
follows:

         For services: 5%
         For goods business: 1%
         For other activities (including activities of education, health, art performance): 2%

        There is no information of the number of companies that apply this method. Moreover, there is
no revenue limit when applying this method. All non-business units that meet requirements can apply.

         Large businesses with a turnover over a particular amount and companies should be obliged to
maintain accounts and get them audited by an Accountant. It should be mandatory to file the audited
balance sheet and accounts along with the return of income so as to prevent any manipulation after the
return is filed.

         Accounts for the small businesses, may be allowed to be kept, either on receipt or mercantile
basis. A taxpayer should not be allowed to move from one system to another from year to year. If he is
allowed to do so then certain items of income would never be taxed. In one year a sale may be made but
sale proceeds may not be received in that year. If accounts are maintained on a receipt basis then that sale
would not be accounted for in the income for that year. If the person is allowed to switch to the
mercantile system of accounting in the following year then that specific sale would not be disclosed again
as in this year there is no accrual, the sale having taken place in the earlier year.

        For large businesses and companies, accounts should be kept only on the mercantile basis and in
accordance with international accountancy norms (double entry book keeping) - you book an expense
when you incur it and not when you pay for it. Similarly you book a receipt when you raise an invoice or
make a sale and not when you actually receive the moneys. In this manner the fact as to whether an
expense has been incurred and whether it is allowable only has to be examined. Likewise the sale of an
item does not have to be linked with the receipt, which may be in a later year. Tax evasion will
consequently be checked by the statute prescribing methods of how accounts should be maintained as also
what forms and registers are necessarily to be kept by different kinds of businesses.

        Before prescribing methods of accountancy and their audit, a check should be made of the
number of qualified accountants that would be available in the next few years. It is important to know the
appropriate time for the introduction of the scheme of maintenance and audit of accounts. It is also
equally important to train officers of the tax department in accountancy. Audit division of the tax
department would then be able to examine and audit the accounts of small and large businesses.

        The scheme of maintenance of accounts should be laid down in the tax law and the rules and not
through circulars. Apart from the fact that the law on the subject would be available at one place, the
penalty for any infringement thereof would also get legal backing.

Suggestions to Impede Tax Planning

        Dubious debts and attribution of unrecoverable debts to expenditure if detected are tax evasion
and not just tax planning. The latter is considered to be within the four corners of the law and is known as
tax avoidance. There is a very thin line to distinguish the two and most countries follow the principle of
substance over form.

        One of the methods of countering tax evasion attempts by showing incorrect debts/ or
expenditures, is by introducing the methods of accountancy onto the statutes. The audit by accountants
would further impede fudged accounts in this regard. Lastly the accountants should be made responsible
for the accounts audited and certified by them by providing laws to make them accessories to the
detection of a wrong claim. Penalty and prosecution should be prescribed for the taxpayer and the
accountant signing the certified accounts found to be incorrect on the score of wrong debt claims etc. In
the audit form accountants would have to certify a debt and how it has become bad according to the
norms laid down by the Government. This would act as a deterrent and taxpayers may desist from this
tax evasion technique.

         Laws curbing the debt claims or putting a ceiling in place are not recommended as these create
distortions of their own. This is true particularly for economies of developing countries like Vietnam.
Also thin capitalization rules may be imposed as mentioned earlier although this may result in somewhat
decreased flow of investment into the country.

        In addition to the accountancy set up, tax officers would still have to deal with delinquents. Tax
enforcement machinery should be strengthened and the knowledge of accountancy of the officers
upgraded. Examination of Accounts is an art which comes through knowledge and experience and due
regard should be given by the administration in the placement of officers in taxing jurisdictions. The
suggestions made would hold good for detection from the accounts of any kind of fraud and not only
dubious debts.

        Chapter IV: Tax Treatment of Special Entities

        This chapter deals with the taxation of certain special entities under the CIT. Certain classes of
organizations are regulated by laws other than the CIT law and conflicts arise when the regulating laws
contain provisions inconsistent with the CIT laws. Some of the cases currently under discussion in this
context are highlighted in this chapter and some of the solutions proposed are discussed.

          It should be mentioned at this stage that two general provisions are normally recommended in the
case of all taxation world-wide from the point of view of both optimizing tax policy and revenue and
facilitating tax administration: (1) No provision on taxation, and tax revenue should be issued as a part of
laws outside the tax law unless they are intended to reference whole or part of an existing tax law; (2)
Even if such measures exist in other statutes governed by ministries other than the Finance ministry,
unless they are re-issued by the competent authority to issue legislation on tax matters they should be
removed from the law.

         This will ensure that no agency other than the agency responsible for collecting taxes makes any
decisions that affect the collection of taxes that are independent of the tax authorities and that conflicts
between laws are minimized and that tax collection remains the primary responsibility of the tax
administration. Otherwise, if the ministry of mines, for example, issues a law that grants concessional
rates to certain projects, it can lead to a rush of such proposals from other ministries. It is the primary
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and the tax authority to collect taxes. Unless they are informed
of any measure that may affect tax collection and have a chance to examine its implications and give their
consent or present their objections, they will find it very difficult to implement a consistent and rational
tax policy and meet their revenue targets. Secondly, this will also minimize conflicts between different
laws and classes of taxpayers if all tax related provisions are issued by the authority that regulates tax
laws only.

Undistributed Incomes of Private Higher Education Establishments

         The CIT law of 2008 does not have any provision to exempt the undistributed incomes (profits)
from CIT. The net effect of this is that many not for profit organizations such as British Council, the
French Community, Education Center of the Council of Ministers of ASEAN countries, etc. become
liable to pay CIT on their incomes despite being involved in socially desirable activities. Three
alternatives have been suggested in this regard:

        (1) Undistributed profits of all organizations should be exempt from tax. This is clearly not a
viable option. It is another matter to say that undistributed profits should be exempt from double taxation
(not charged capital gains tax or taxed under PIT) but if this is removed from the ambit of CIT all
companies will have an incentive to evade CIT by not distributing any profits.

        (2) Tax exemption for undistributed profit of private higher education institutions implemented
through the CIT law. This is a more realistic option, but it can be taken further. It has been discussed in
the previous chapter in the context of donations to charitable activities that organizations that are
primarily engaged in socially desirable activities can be granted a “not – for – profit” status under the CIT

                                                     63
law. This will not only enable their income used for charitable purposes to be tax – exempt, but also
allow donations to these organizations to be deducted from taxable income of other entities. Required
restrictions on their activities can be prescribed in the CIT law itself or a supporting act and it is the job of
the tax authorities to ensure only that they fulfill the restrictions required for their tax exempt status. In
the US, such organizations are identified in the tax code and the IRS issues them a “determinations” letter
confirming their tax – exempt status on successful application.

        (3) Not adding the proviso on tax exemption in the CIT law, but continue to allow it under the
law on tertiary education. This is not a good idea for reasons discussed above. The standard and best
practice around the world is that tax related provisions are regulated by the tax authorities through the tax
law. If non tax authorities start granting tax exemptions without the knowledge and concurrence of the
tax authorities, it will become impossible to have any control over tax collections and ultimately, the
budget.

Income from Transfer of Certified Emission Reductions

         The CIT law of 2008 does not have a provision for the exemption of income from the transfer of
certified emission reductions. In 2008, a one-year exemption to such income was granted by decree.
Vietnam has many Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects, of which 164 projects are
internationally recognized, thus being ranked fourth in the world in this area. With 7 million tons of CO2
Carbon Emissions Reduction (CERs) certificates, Vietnam is ranked ninth in the world in the number of
CERs certificates. The transfer of CERs is a source of income for businesses and it is a part of assessable
income when calculating the corporate income tax. The corporate income tax on income received on the
transfer of CERs not only reduces the benefits of the business transfer, but also does not encourage
businesses to invest in CDM projects.

          Some countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, South Africa, and China have tax exemption on
income from the transfer of CERs. For example, the Thai law applies tax exemption on income from the
transfer of CERs for 3 years consecutively after the project receives written approval of the Greenhouse
Gas Management Organization Thailand. South African law applies the income tax exemption from the
first transfer; the income from the subsequent transfer of CERs is taxed.

         It is a matter of government policy on environment and development as to how far the
government of Vietnam wants to encourage such businesses from the point of view of attracting
internationally mobile investment that is also beneficial to the environment as well as the local economy.
On the other hand, income from CERs is also a form of corporate income and there is no particular reason
to exempt it as it supplements normal business income.

         Since we are recommending that Vietnam remove its tax holidays, have one positive corporate
tax rate for non-mineral income and one for mineral income, while not expanding the list of exempted
incomes, it is really a matter of the potential loss of revenue from this exemption. It does not make any
sense to exempt the first transaction only and not subsequent ones. The total revenue from this source
should first be computed. Many of these companies may already be enjoying a tax holiday or a reduced
rate of tax and paying less than the prescribed rate on such income. If tax holidays are removed and there
is only relatively low CIT rate the government can include this income in the list of exempted incomes if

                                                       64
the revenue loss is small. If this is expected to be a major source of income in the future, the government
should tax it. There are international practices both ways and it is really a matter of taking a policy
decision one way or the other.

Income from the performance of duties by the State Development Bank Vietnam (VDB), Bank for
Social Policy (BSP)

         The VDB and BSP perform activities that are often developmental in nature. The current CIT
Law does not provide for the tax exemption for the income from many activities of VDB and VBSP. In
practice, the banks comply with the Regulation on Financial Management for Banks, while the tax
authorities charge taxes under the CIT Law. This causes some conflicts.

         The main activities of these banks are non-profit business. In some cases, they operate using
funds bearing subsidized interest rates received from the Government. Therefore, the income of these
banks should be exempted from tax and these contents need to be reflected in the CIT Law to ensure
consistency when it is implemented. Income from the state development investment credit activities, and
the state export credit activities of BDV should be exempted from taxes; income from credit activities for
the poor and other policy beneficiaries of BSP is tax exempt income. However, the activities of the two
banks have expanded recently, and are similar to activities of professional commercial banks. So CIT
Law needs to clarify unambiguously which incomes should be exempt from CIT.

         There is another approach that may be preferable. If the principle of allowing organizations to
register as tax-exempt organizations under the CIT law is followed and the two banks are granted this
status, their incomes become exempt. However, profit-making activities would then be disallowed, or
shareholders would not be able to receive those profits. The question is really one of ownership and
intent. If the government owns these organizations completely (all the share capital) and subsidizes them
(through funds at low interest rates), it does not make much difference whether they are taxed or not. It is
re-routing money from one government account to another.

        However, if there is a component of private capital then part of their income goes to private
shareholders and it also does not make sense for the government to subsidize and then exempt incomes of
private persons. If the organizations are wholly-owned by the government and all their income belongs to
the government, they can very well be taxed. If they are some form of Private-Public Partnerships, then
the taxation of these entities should be handled differently, taking into consideration the subsidy
component, equity contributions and other factors to maintain efficiency and market discipline. To save
on administration and compliance costs, it is recommended to get organizations wholly-owned by the
government registered as not-for profit and exempt them. However, such organizations normally do not
undertake activities for the purpose of earning profits. It would also not be in keeping with their status as
not-for-profit organizations if they do. Recovering cost plus a margin for contribution to fixed costs and
cross-subsidizing loss-making activities is another matter and may be permissible.

        To emphasize again, if these are wholly owned by the government, and the government grants
them exempt status, the government does not lose anything as it gets the surplus they generate, while
saving on administrative and compliance costs. In general, to implement this type of provision, a whole
new set of provisions have to be added to regulate “not-for-profit” entities in the tax law on the lines of

                                                     65
the US tax code and practice in other countries. However, normally “not-for-profit” organizations do not
work for profit, and if they do, they have to be taxed – they cannot use the status as a tax shelter.
Normally, if commercial activities have to be undertaken, those activities are separated from the tax-
exempt entity; it is set up as a separate corporate entity that is not tax-exempt and taxed accordingly.

Income from transfer of investment projects; income from transfer of exploration rights, mining
and mineral processing; income from transfer of contributed capital - the right to participate in
investment projects

        “Other income” is taxable under the CIT law in addition to income earned from manufacturing
and services businesses. Other taxable income comprises income from capital transfers and from real
property transfers; income from the ownership of or right to use assets; income from transfer, leasing out
or liquidation of assets; income being interest on deposits, loans or sales of foreign currency; income
being recoveries from contingency reserves; income earned from bad debts which were written-off and
are now recoverable; income being debts payable to unidentifiable creditors; income from business
omitted in previous years, and other income including income receivable from activities of production
and/or business outside Vietnam.

        Income from transfer of investment projects; income from the transfer of exploration, mining and
mineral processing claims; income from transfer of contributed capital, the right to participate in
investment projects etc. are all new forms of income generated in the economy and are quite common in a
modern business oriented economy. These earnings are not mentioned in the new CIT Law and are only
prescribed in the bylaws of the Decree. Some businesses do not accept this as an assessable income
because it is not prescribed in the Law on CIT, causing difficulties for the implementation of the CIT
Law.

         These incomes are incomes of enterprises and should be considered a part of assessable income
as has been discussed in chapter 1. As discussed therein, there is also no need for a proposal to club and
set off losses from these incomes separately. If it is necessary, this may be made explicitly clear in the
CIT law.

Income earned from activities of production and/or business in goods and services by enterprises
employing specified numbers of disabled people, reformed addicts and people infected with HIV

         Through several decrees and circulars, the government has provided tax exemptions to two
classes of enterprises: (1) Those that employ disabled, rehabilitated and HIV positive to the extent of 30%
or more of their labor force (subject to a minimum of an average number of 20 laborers in their workforce
during the year) – excluding enterprises in the real estate or finance sector; (2) Those enterprises
receiving income from job-training activities exclusively for ethnic minority people, people with
disabilities, children in extremely disadvantaged circumstances, persons involved in social evils, persons
undergoing detoxification, and detoxified and HIV-infected persons. If an establishment also provides
job training to others, tax-exempt income shall be determined based on the ratio between the number of
ethnic minority people, people with disabilities, children in extremely disadvantaged circumstances,
persons involved in social evils, persons undergoing detoxification, and detoxified and HIV-infected
persons and the total number of job trainees of the establishment.

                                                    66
        These regulations are not a part of the CIT law itself and are governed by other provisions. More
importantly, there are two possible viewpoints on whether these provisions should exist at all. The first
viewpoint is that this is socially desirable from many points of view and reduces the government’s
subsidy burden or the expenditure the government would have to undertake in the absence of training and
employment to such persons. The second view is that these incentives should not be included in the CIT
Law. The integration of social policies in the CIT law makes tax policy more complex, difficult to
manage, creates loopholes for companies to take advantage of lower tax payable and causes horizontal
inequity between companies. There are three clear reasons for this.

        - First: In practice, it is very difficult to calculate the income earned from activities of production
and/or business in goods and services by enterprises especially reserved for employees who are disabled
people, reformed addicts and people infected with HIV. There are some criterions required in the Decree
No. 122/ 2012/ND-CP and Circular No. 123/2012/TT-BTC, but it is still difficult for the tax authorities to
understand and manage these provisions.

        - Second: The fact that only enterprises that have tax payable could benefit from this tax
incentive. This means that employees that are disabled people, reformed addicts and people infected with
HIV will have differential benefits from tax incentive policy depending on the profitability of the business
they work for.

         - Third: in some instances, this regulation leads to abuse. Enterprises can manage to have the
names of wounded soldiers or people with disabilities on their payroll to meet the CIT Law requirements
in order to enjoy tax incentives. However, in many cases, these individuals do not participate or do not
directly work in the business.

         The integration of social policy in the tax incentives could make the tax policy more complicated.
In addition, it does not play its full role in addressing social policy and it is easy for enterprises to abuse
the tax incentives to evade and avoid tax. Therefore, in the future there is a need to restrict the integration
of social policy in the tax incentives, and try to achieve socially desirable outcomes through other
measures, such as direct support from the state budget for social policy beneficiaries.

         If this is not possible, then the use of a refundable tax credit should be pursued rather than
allowing exemption/deduction. This has the advantage that the amount of tax benefit does not vary with
the tax rate applicable to the company or the taxable profit, the amount per employee is fixed and
received by the company whether it makes a profit or loss, the government can exactly account for the
amount of tax revenue it loses because of this provision and it will take care of some of the issues of
having to calculate income properly as per the law attributable to these persons and make it revenue
neutral to the enterprise to employ such persons if the benefit is calculated accurately by the concerned
government authorities.

                            Chapter V: Tax Incentives

I. Tax Incentives

        The Corporate Income Tax in Vietnam provides for a series of tax incentives for different types
of industries and their geographical location. These tax incentives are listed in detail in the annex I to this
chapter. These are in addition to exemptions from tax provided to certain sectors and incomes discussed
in previous chapters.

        An analysis of these tax incentives reveals their complexity. Some incentives are available if the
investment is made in specific sectors, and specific geographical locations. Others are applied if the
enterprise meets some social criteria like employing certain number of labor force, female labor or
handicapped people. Another category of enterprises eligible for tax incentives is the investments made
in special economic zones.

         The tax incentives may be broadly placed in two categories: first, where preferential or reduced
rates of 20 and 10 percent tax rates are applicable and second, where outright tax exemption or tax
holiday for prescribed period of time followed by 50 per cent tax liability for a few more years. It is also
stipulated in these provisions that if an enterprise is starting a new business or expanding an existing
business, it must separately identify the profits of each of those units in order to claim the benefits of tax
incentives. However, Article 18 – Circular 123/2012/ TT-BTC allows firms that cannot separate their
taxable profit to allocate deductible expenses to incentive availing income in the same proportion as
incentive eligible income to total income.

        Different types of tax incentives both in terms of rate reduction and duration of application are
available depending on different criteria such as:

    (a) Whether the investment is in geographical areas included in the appendix to the Decree No.
        124/2008/ND-CP of December 11, 2008, detailing and guiding the implementation of a number
        of articles of the Law in Enterprise income tax, or economic zones or hi-tech parks established
        under the Prime Minister’s decisions;

    (b) Whether it is located in sectors such High technology as prescribed by law; scientific research
        and technological development; Development of water plants, power plants, water supply and
        drainage systems; bridges, roads, railways; airports, seaports, river ports; airfields, stations and
        other infrastructure works of special importance as decided by the Prime Minister; Manufacture
        of software products. In some of these cases the benefit may be extendable to a maximum period
        of 30 years;

    (c) Whether the investment belongs to point (b) above and is located in geographical areas included
        in point (a) above;

    (d) Whether the investment is made in industries located in Economic Zones.



                                                      68
Eligibility Criteria

         The criteria for receiving tax incentives are outlined in detail in the law but their multiplicity is
bound to create practical problems. For instance, it would not be easy to separate profits of existing
establishment from its expanded part or relocated unit or from application of renewed technology.

        There is a separate provision of tax incentives to industries established within the economic zones
and hi-tech zones. There is no apparent reason for doing this. Economic zones already offer several
advantages to investors and any additional benefits under the corporate income tax are not necessary and
simply lead to avoidable revenue leakage.

Tax Holiday or Tax Exemption

        It is now a well-established fact that out right tax exemption or tax holidays are not cost-effective.
It is more or less a blunt and opaque system of taxation in which there is no direct linkage between
incentive and investment and the government is not able to evaluate the amount of revenues lost. It is
also not unusual for companies to establish businesses so that they just fulfill the conditions of enjoying a
tax holiday, then disappearing at the end of the period and reappearing again as a new enterprise to claim
tax holiday/exemption afresh.

         In conclusion, it may be noted that the present regime of tax incentives is very complex and needs
to be greatly rationalized. It not only lacks transparency resulting in higher compliance costs to
businesses, it offers avenues that may be abused by corporations for tax avoidance which increases the
cost of administration and is also likely to result in loss of revenues.

         Therefore, our recommendation is to do away with tax holidays, and multiple rates and to have
one single non-mineral rate at 22%, a single mineral rate of 50%, abolish all tax holidays, reduced rates
and special deductions. As discussed elsewhere, some industries/enterprises may be given tax exempt
status based on proper procedure and a formal procedure for determination of tax-exempt status. In all
other cases of socio-economic objectives, the government can use refundable or non-refundable tax
credits, since these are certain, equitable and explicitly accountable tax expenditures. In the present CIT
draft law, the government has sought to exclude certain incomes from the purview of tax incentives, such
as:

    (a) Income from transfer of capital, transfer of capital contribution; income from transfer of property
        (other than social housing provisions), income from transfer of investment projects, transfer of
        Joint franchise investment, transfer of exploration, mining and mineral processing; foreign
        income received in Vietnam;

    (b) Income from operations search, exploration and exploitation of oil and gas, and other precious
        resources and income from mining activities;

    (c) Income from business services which are subject to special sales tax;

    (d) Other cases as prescribed by the Government.


                                                     69
        If our recommendations are accepted, this becomes unnecessary. However, the draft law of June
19, 2013 proposed the following:

        The scope of investments entitled to preferential tax incentives has been broadened. Article 13
has been substantially revised. Clause 1(b) now includes preferential tax at 10% for enterprises engaged
in software production, production of composite materials, light construction materials, and precious
materials, the production of renewable energy, clean energy, waste energy, development of biological
technology, and environment protection.

         A new Clause 1(d) now offers preferential CIT rate at 10% to large manufacturing projects in
excess of VND 6,000 billion (approximately US$300 million) and investment projects in selected
industrial zones. New provisions in Clause 2(b), 2(c) and 2(d) now extend the 10% rate to projects
investing in social housing, incomes of mass media and publishing houses, and corporate incomes from
planting, caring, and protecting of forests; agricultural, forestry, and aquatic production in locations that
have extremely difficult socio-economic conditions; and investment in the preservation of agricultural,
aquatic, and food products.

        The new Clause 3(b) now provides for a preferential tax rate of 20% for a larger list of industries.
These include investments in energy-saving projects, manufacturing of irrigation equipment; production
and processing of cattle, poultry and fishery feed; and the development of traditional trades. Starting
from January 1, 2016 the corporate incomes under this clause will be taxed at 17%.

        The incentives in the form of duration of tax exemption and reduction in tax rates has also been
revised in Article 14. A new provision in Clause 4 now extends the duration of concessional CIT rates to
enterprises that wish to expand the productive scope, increase their capacity or renovate their productive
technology.

II. Experience of Other Countries on Tax Incentives

        Tax incentives, tax holidays in particular, used to be quite popular especially in the developing
countries about ten to fifteen years back. This trend has been undergoing change in the past few years as
a series of studies have clearly shown that tax incentives do not have a significant impact on flow of
investment in a country. As a result, tax holidays have completely disappeared from developed countries.

        It has been borne out that the following factors play a significant role in attracting investment:

            -   Economic and political stability
            -   A well administered and stable tax system with moderate tax rates
            -   Adequate infrastructure – both physical and social
            -   Untapped but trainable labor force
            -   Existence of natural resources

        Now OECD countries only use investment tax credit or accelerated depreciation both of which
are quite well targeted to investment. Developing countries including the ASEAN do maintain a variety
of incentives.


                                                     70
1. Types of Tax Incentives and Their Implications

       For corporate income tax, most common incentives include tax holiday, investment tax credit or
allowance, and accelerated depreciation.

1.1. Tax Holidays

     Zero tax rates are applied during holiday period and positive tax rates after the period comes to an
end. Sometimes a reduced rate is applied for some time before applying the normal tax rate.
         It is one of the most common forms of tax incentives and is widely in use.
      It is a “blunt” tax instrument. Tax holidays and general corporate income tax rate reductions have
been empirically found to be cost-ineffective.


1.2. Investment Tax Credit

         As the name suggests, it is a credit given to the investor against his tax liability. In order to take the
benefit of a tax credit in the initial year when tax liability may be small or zero, the individual or the company
should have tax liabilities somewhere else. Otherwise the credit may be carried forward.

        With an Investments tax credit of K per cent, if the purchase price of an asset is = I, then the
investment tax credit is KI. The net cost of investment then becomes I-KI = I*(1-K). This would
naturally increase the rate of return on the investment I.

1.3. Investment Expense Allowance

           If the rate of allowance is K, then instead of a tax credit, the amount KI is deducted from taxable
income.

         European countries in transition like Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Romania apply this type
of investment incentive.

1.4. Accelerated Depreciation

a. Main issues related to depreciation

     -      Two components of depreciation: “wear and tear”; and technical obsolescence.
     -      Ideal case when “true” reduction in value of investment item (economic depreciation) is used.
     -      However it is hard to estimate economic depreciation, hence in tax codes depreciation rates or
            depreciation schedules are arbitrarily specified (fiscal depreciation).


b. Some types of fiscal depreciation

   b.1. Straight line depreciation:



                                                        71
        When the same rate of depreciation is applied over the project’s life.

    Illustration

       Assume an asset with 5 years of life and purchase price $1,000 and corporate income tax rate of 40%
and 8% as cost of funds or discount rate. The depreciation allowance each year is US$200.

                     Year                          1             2              3           4            5
    Straight Line depreciation                      200              200            200         200      200
    Tax savings @ 40%                                80               80             80          80       80
    Present value of savings @ 8%                    80              74.1           68.6        63.5     58.8
    Total savings in present value                 345.0

   b.2. Accelerated depreciation:

         Assume a straight line depreciation in 3 instead of 5 years of normal life. It will reduce tax liability
during early years and thus the present value of total taxes paid decreases which would improve the project's
viability.


                     Year                          1             2              3           4            5
    Straight Line depreciation                         333           333            333           0              0
    Tax savings @ 40%                                  133           133            133           0              0
    Present value of savings @ 8%                      133           123            114           0              0
    Total savings in present value                     370

    -   The present value of tax savings is more with an accelerated depreciation. This would encourage
        investment.
    -   Accelerated depreciation encourages projects with long term investments since the present value of
        tax savings in higher in this case.

    b.3. Immediate expensing

        In immediate expense, full amount of depreciation is deducted in the first year of production.
Immediate expensing provides the largest tax savings and, therefore, encourages investment most. In this
case, however, the government does not collect any tax revenues.

    b.4. Declining-balance method

    -   Currently applied by countries like Japan, Switzerland, and Spain.
    -   Assuming that investment cost of $1 depreciates at the rate of r. Depreciation schedule is as shown
        in the table below.

          Year                    0           1              2              3           …            t       …

  Allowance
  Book value of assets                  1-r            (1-r)2        (1-r)3         …       (1-r)t           …



                                                        72
1.5. Neutral Tax Incentives

         The design of incentives requires a good deal of care so that it does not affect the "neutrality" of the
tax. Neutrality is achieved when an incentive does not induce new covered investments with low rates of
social yield, while failing to induce covered investments with higher rates of social yield.

Some neutral tax incentives - Incentives that do not distort investment decisions:

        -    Musgrave neutrality;
        -    Samuelson Neutrality;
        -    Harberger-Bradford neutrality.

a. Musgrave Neutrality

        It entails:
                         Immediate deduction (expensing) of investment from taxable income, and;
                         Full taxation of future income streams and no depreciation allowed.

         Immediate expensing does not change project rankings. If the taxable income is Y and depreciation
is D, the present value of investment is PV (Y+D). With immediate expensing, the project gains
t*(PVY+PVD) at the very outset. Since there is nothing to depreciate in future, it pays tax on (Y+D) and
loses t*(PVY+PVD) during its life time.

                 The net gain/loss of the project is: = PV(tY) + PV(tD) - PV(tY) - PV(tD) = 0

         Note that under immediate expensing, government does not collect any tax, it rather becomes a
partner in investment. Hence this incentive should be used rarely and is a preferred instrument only for
promoting environmentally friendly machinery and equipment.

         If there is a 50 per cent tax rate and all investment is immediately expensed, the government in effect
becomes a 50 per cent partner in the venture. It contributes half the amount invested in the corporation by
off-setting 50 per cent of taxes which the company would have paid otherwise. From the stream of benefits
generated by the project every year, the government takes exactly half of it (as its share) each period.

b. Samuelson Neutrality

        It entails:

                         There is no immediate deduction of the investment, and;
                         Tax is applied to income net of economic depreciation.
                                     Tax impact on the project = PV (-tY).
                        The PV of project income after tax = PV (Y-tY) = PV [Y (1-t)]

         The PV of income decreases by the same fraction as the tax rate among all projects. As Rate of
return is determined based on net-of-tax income, the returns of all the projects decrease by the same fraction

                                                       73
and hence the ranking of the projects does not change. If a project has an internal rate of return "r", then the
net of tax return becomes r(1-t).

c.     Harberger-Bradford Neutrality

         It combines immediate expensing (Musgrave neutrality) with economic depreciation (Samuelson
neutrality). A fraction of the investment cost (say ‫ )ג‬is immediately expensed and the remaining (1-‫ )ג‬part is
deducted as economic depreciation over the asset's life.

           The ranking of projects will not change again.

2. Tax Incentives in ASEAN

2.1        Indonesia

General Income Tax Exemptions.- The CIT law exempts: Aid payments or donations; dividends from
retained earnings, retained capital, and profits or dividends received by venture capital companies not
listed in the stock market. The PIT law exempts: the after-tax profits from a partnership or similar
association; gifts, donations and inheritances; proceeds of life and health insurance; compensation in-
kind; and Social Security benefits (death and accident), except Old Age Pensions.

Contribution to Development.- Industries that significantly contribute to national industrial development
are benefited by:

           -   Additional deduction of 5% of the realized capital investment, for six years.
           -   Option to used accelerated tax depreciation (double normal rates).
           -   Loss carry forward for 10 years.
           -   10% withholding tax (or lower DTA rate) on dividends to non-resident shareholders.

Economic Development Zones (KAPET).- These industries are granted, in addition to the last 4 incentives

       the export market, full exemption from import duty on direct raw materials is normally granted,

        manufacturing license. Until the year 2000, companies are given the waiver from compliance to
        the equity condition.

   (iii) Full exemption from import duty is normally given if:

       -   The finished product made from dutiable raw materials/components is not subjected to any
           import duty.

manufacturers are normally required to pay import duty of 2% or 3% ad valorem. For raw materials
which are subjected to import duty of 3% or less, applications for exemption will not be considered.

         To encourage the manufacture of local components for the assembly industry, imports of

  Chapter VI: International Experience in Taxation of
                  Corporate Income

1. CIT Base and Rates

        In most developed countries income arising from all sources including business, trading as well
as non-business income is included in the tax base. Although it may be hard to find formal definitions of
taxable income, as a rule it is computed under the principles of ‘sound commercial accounting practice’
and following the generally accepted accounting principles maintained by the accounting profession in a
country. Increasingly countries are aligning their accounting standards with international financial
reporting standards (IFRS). In most countries, it is based on profits shown in the company’s profit and
loss accounts or the changes in the assets and liability statements over a year.

        Tax rates in developed countries also vary considerably. One trend, however, is clear that the top
CIT tax rates have been declining over the years. This has been often attributed to tax competition.
According to the OECD report on the fundamental reform of CIT (OECD (2007), and Fundamental
Reform of Corporate Income Tax, OECD Tax Policy Studies, No. 16, OECD Publishing, although
corporate tax rates have been declining during the last decades, larger-sized OECD countries continue to
levy corporate taxes at higher rates than the smaller-sized OECD member countries. However, despite
the reduction in statutory corporate tax rates, corporate tax revenues have kept pace with – or even
exceeded – the growth in GDP and the growth in revenues from other taxes in many OECD countries.
This might partly have been caused by the broadening of corporate tax bases, for instance through the
provision of less generous tax depreciation allowances.

         For OECD countries, table 1 below shows clearly the downward trend in CIT rates over time.
The US is the only country that increased the CIT rate over the 2000-10 periods over the average of the
previous decade, but that may also be a consequence of the fact that it is the only major country in the
world that does not have a VAT/GST at the federal level. For many countries in Asia, the CIT plays a
major role when it comes to revenue. This may be due in part to the fact that developing countries do not
have PIT systems to match those of OECD countries and therefore find the tax handle offered by the CIT
more convenient. As table 2 below shows, Indonesia and Malaysia are the two countries in the region
that collect substantially more revenue than Vietnam through CIT.

        One reason for imposing a corporate tax is that the tax plays an important withholding function,
acting as a “backstop” to the personal income tax. The corporate tax might be needed to avoid excessive
income shifting between labor income and capital income. The corporate tax also acts as a withholding
tax on equity income earned by non-resident shareholders, which might otherwise escape taxation in the
source country. Moreover, governments might levy a corporate tax because firms earn location-specific
rents and/or because capital is not perfectly mobile.

         According to the OECD report (2007), the main drivers of corporate income tax reform are the
tax-induced distortions under current corporate income tax systems from a domestic and international tax
point of view. The corporate income tax is likely to distort the total amount of investment and the type of
investment projects that are undertaken, the corporate sources of finance and uses of profits, the location
of the corporate tax base, the choice of a business’s legal form and the fact that tax might have an impact
on corporate mergers and acquisitions.

         Tax revenue and tax complexity considerations are important drivers of corporate income tax
reform. Some important sources of tax complexity are the different tax treatment between debt and
equity, the existence of different types of legal forms that are taxed differently, the tax rules with respect
to business restructurings and the tax rules with respect to the transfers of business assets.

        Most developed countries tax capital gains at the full corporate income tax rate while a few
countries exempt capital gains if reinvested in business. Subject to restrictions in some countries to
prevent tax avoidance, all expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in earning the income or maintaining
the assets are tax deductible. However, there are always some grey areas where interpretations may
differ. By early 1990s, all OECD countries allowed a company to carry forward losses for a period which
ranges from five years to unlimited period. Countries such as the US also allow loss carry backward from
one to three years. All the countries provide for depreciation allowance but the way of doing it differs.
Many OECD countries have tried to keep depreciation rules such that tax deprecation is as close to
economic depreciation as possible including both wear and tear and obsolescence. Since accurate
computation of economic depreciation is technically and administratively difficult, some standardized
method like straight line or declining balance method is followed. In some countries these depreciation
rules are more generous than others. When it comes to tax incentives, it generally takes the form of
accelerated depreciation at a higher rate than the normal. Tax holidays are not offered by OECD
countries.

        In what follows, we have compared the CIT systems of 15 countries in three groups of five
countries each: OECD, BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and Vietnam’s neighbors .
The chosen OECD countries are UK, USA, South Korea, Singapore and Australia. The neighbors chosen
are Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. The CIT in those countries have been
compared across the following dimensions: Main tax rate and other tax rates and taxes on corporations,
residence versus source of income principle of taxation, depreciation, deductions and expenses, capital
gains, inventory valuation, treatment of losses, treatment of charitable contributions and prevention of
base erosion. Relevant tables are presented in this chapter and the source is mainly Price Waterhouse
Coopers’ Worldwide Tax Summary 2012-13 supplemented by Deloitte’s country tax highlights for 2013.

         Thin capitalization and the international experience in that area have been discussed in detail in
the chapter on expenses and are therefore not discussed in this chapter. Transfer pricing is also discussed
in the chapter on expenses and is not discussed here in detail, except to indicate some country experiences
in preventing base erosion.

        Tax incentives are also not discussed as the complete system of incentives in ASEAN countries
has already been presented as an annex in the relevant chapter. After the discussion on tax integration, we
compare the CIT systems of the 15 countries. Annex A to this chapter describes international trends and
experience of Tax Policy Reform globally but with examples from some specific countries.

2. Tax Integration and Taxation of Dividends
          After the corporate tax is paid at the company’s level, the net of tax profits are distributed, in part or in
full, to the shareholders and then they are subject to personal income tax other than in cases where the shares
are held in a tax free pension or mutual fund. This raises the issues that with taxation of dividends, corporate
income tax and personal income tax result in double taxation of income. The presumption is that ultimately

                                                          92
even the income from the companies accrues to individual shareholders and when dividends are subject to
personal income taxation, it amounts to double taxation of income. When it comes to taxation of foreign
companies under the CIT, most countries tax dividends through a flat rate withholding before profits are
repatriated to the home country. The home country may give tax credits for the taxes paid in the host country
when charging tax on the dividends received.

        Broadly there are three options for dividends received by taxable individuals. First, apply CIT on
company’s profits and then tax dividends fully under the personal income tax. This is the “classical” system
where both incomes are taxed and there is no integration between the two (US until recently when it
introduced a reduced tax rate on tax-paid dividends, and Switzerland).

          Second, integrate the two taxes completely by giving full credit for CIT paid when calculating the PIT
liability. This is the case of full integration. In this case, tax on business profits is withheld by the full
amount and then it is claimed back as a credit when personal income tax is computed. The final effective
tax rate in this case is at the personal income tax rate and company income tax is just a withholding
device. The US and a few other countries effectively adopt this method in case of small corporations or
so-called S-corporations with a limited number of owners (less than 100 in US) and for all limited
liability companies (LLC) and partnerships (LLP) . In these latter cases of the S-corporation, LCC and
LLP, no corporate tax is charged. All income is reported as personal income of the individual
shareholders or partners. However if a country has a weak PIT system that raises little revenues by way
of taxes and this may not be a good model. In the UK, 10% tax is withheld from dividends distributed by
resident companies, and for individual taxpayers in the lowest taxable bracket the personal tax rate is also
10% so the credit of tax effectively equals the personal income tax (PIT) payable. For taxpayers in higher
brackets, the 10% tax on dividends withheld by the company is available as a credit against PIT payable.

        Third, integrate the two taxes partially by giving partial credit for taxes paid at the corporate level.
There can be several variations of partial integration approach and most countries have adopted some form
of this type of integration in which partial relief is granted either at the corporation level or the
shareholders’ level. Below are listed some alternative ways to do this.

     Dividend deduction system where all or part of the corporate income that is distributed as dividends
      can be deducted against the company’s corporate income tax liability.
     Split-rate system where the profits distributed as dividends are taxed at a lower rate than the part that
      is retained, but dividends are also taxed at individual level.
     Dividend tax credit or gross-up and imputation system where the entire corporate income is taxed,
      but that part of tax attributable to dividends is credited back as tax credit to shareholder. Thus
      dividends are ultimately taxed at personal income tax rate and retention at corporate income tax rate.
     Dividend deduction at personal level where corporate tax rate is charged on all income, but
      distributed dividends are only partially taxed or are partially tax exempt or are taxed at a reduced
      rate.
     Tax credit method where it provides credit to shareholders against their personal income tax usually
      specified as some proportion of the dividends received.




                                                      93
     Single Stage System is more common in developing countries where only the return to equity at the
      corporate level is taxed and dividends are not included in income at the personal level. A big
      advantage is its simplicity. This may lead to a net gain in revenue if all shareholders are taxed at
      lower tax rate under the PIT than the CIT applied to the company profits. In such a situation, if the
      dividends were exempted from CIT, the PIT collected after distribution would be less than the CIT
      collected at the company level.

          Where adjustments are made to dividend taxation at the personal level that assume that taxes have
been paid at the corporate level (such as the single stage system that exempts dividend income or the dividend
tax credit that pays a credit at the statutory CIT rate) then the individual may be benefitting when for some
reason no or low taxes have in fact been paid at the corporate level. As a result mechanisms have been devised
to ensure that a minimum amount of tax has in fact been paid. One such system that is used internationally is
the Dividend Tax Account that checks whether sufficient taxes have been paid currently or in the past by the
corporation whenever it pays out dividends. If not, the tax deficiency has to be paid. This is an excellent
system not only to ensure tax integration system is correctly applied, but that in the long-run corporations pay
their fair share of taxes on distributions out of the company.

         The taxation of dividends is treated differently in different OECD countries. Australia, France and
Italy apply the full integration where CIT is only a withholding tax and the final tax is at the rate of personal
income tax. Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the US take the classical approach where both incomes
are taxed separately.

3. Main Tax Rate, Other Tax Rates and Taxes on Corporations

        The tax rate within the selected OECD countries varies from a low of 17% in Singapore to an
average federal rate of 35% for companies in other countries. Australia and Singapore have flat rates
while US, Korea and UK have a progressive rate structure either through multiple CIT rates for different
slabs of income or a large threshold exemption or both. In the US, most state governments also impose
CIT while in Korea there is a 10% surcharge on CIT for resident companies. Korea, Singapore and the
UK either exempt income or have lower rates for small companies or both, while the US allows
companies to register as “S” corporations that are exempt from CIT . While the US is the only country in
this group that imposes a CIT at the state/local level, almost all countries have other taxes applicable to
corporations, especially on the mining sector.

         Within BRICS, rates on average are higher though not as high as in the US. They vary from a
low of 20% in Russia to effective highs of over 30% in India and Brazil (due to clubbing with other taxes
as in Brazil or surcharges as in India). All countries except China augment the CIT with a variety of other
social contributions charges, and South Africa has an elaborate regime for graduated taxation based on
company turnover. India has a minimum alternative tax system that aims to tax 20% of adjusted net book
profits for resident companies, while the Russian CIT is split between the central government and states
with the major share going to the provinces.

       Vietnam’s neighbors also impose CIT rates in the 20%-30% range, with Philippines, Laos and
Cambodia maintaining minimum alternative tax regimes based on taxable turnover. Philippines and
Indonesia also impose some other local and regional taxes on businesses. Malaysia has a higher rate for

exemptions.

4. Residence versus Source Principle

        In the OECD countries studied, resident companies are taxed on worldwide income in all
countries with the exception of Singapore where all companies are taxed on Singapore source income
only, unless foreign income is received in Singapore or deemed to be received. All countries have well
defined permanent establishment (PEs) laws, normally based on OECD model based on a fixed place of
business and in some cases where dependent agents exist or effective control is exercised. PEs are taxed
on domestic source income. Residency is determined by differing criteria in different countries:
sometimes based on incorporation in domestic country (Australia, UK, and USA) and in other cases on
place where directors meet or place where effective control is exercised (Korea, Singapore).

        These patterns are repeated in almost all BRICS and Vietnam’s neighbors in our sample of
countries. India taxes residents on India source income only, as does Malaysia, while Laos and Russia do
not have well defined residence/PE laws. Practices of taxing branch profits vary widely across countries
as do policies on imposition of withholding on repatriation of profits by branches.

AUSTRALIA   Resident companies are taxed on worldwide income
            In case of countries with DTAA, Australia’s right to tax is limited to
            profits attributable to PEs
            Resident companies are ones incorporated in Australia, or if not, then
            carries on business in Australia and its management or control or its
            majority shareholders are Australian
            Well defined PE laws exist and are consistent with most DTAAs
KOREA       Residents are taxed on worldwide income. Nonresidents with PE
            taxed on Korean source income. Other nonresidents taxed through
            WHT on items of income separately. Companies with head offices or
            place of effective management in Korea are considered resident. With
            some exceptions, companies with fixed place of business, dependent
            agents or employees of 2 years standing are considered PEs.
SINGAPORE   Taxes on Singapore source income for all companies and on foreign
            source income when remitted to Singapore
            Residence defined by central management and control location in most
            cases where directors meet
            Since Singapore taxes on source, PE is not an important issue except
            for treaty purposes and WHT, but a PE is taken as a clear indication of
            source. Based on OECD definition a PE is generally defined as a fixed
            place of business including branches, or providing services through
            Singapore employees for specified periods or agents who can negotiate
            and contract

            taxable in Singapore when received in Singapore (or deemed to be so).
            Foreign tax credit is available for treaty countries, and unilateral credit
            for non-treaty countries. Foreign dividends, foreign branch profits,

            companies incorporated abroad may also be treated as UK resident is
            effective management and control resides in UK
            A nonresident has a UK PE if it has a fixed place of business in UK or
            an agent unless of a preparatory or auxiliary nature
            PEs taxed in same way as domestic companies, except that small
            profits rate is not available for a PE unless allowed by DTAA; specific
            rules exist for PE profit determination – evaluated as if a separate
            (standalone) company for financing arrangements but allowed to
            allocate part of head office costs

          UK residents and PEs have to separately calculate net income from
         each source of business and total taxable capital gains. Starting point
         for determining trading income is book profits worldwide, and these
         are adjusted for dividends and income from property (non-trading
         income) and capital expenditure and then capital allowances, pensions
         contributions etc.
         While residents are taxed on worldwide income, a group may make a
         one-time election to exempt all non-UK branches from taxation in UK;
         if they do not elect this, foreign tax credits are still applicable either
         through treaties or unilaterally

         Foreign companies pay tax on profits earned by a PE in Russia on the
         same basis as Russian companies and deduct mostly the same
         expenses. Treaties may include provisions for deductibility of HQ
         expenses incurred abroad for its PE in Russia
         New provisions introduced guide the determination of taxable income
         of a PE based on functions, assets and risks. A Permanent
         Establishment is considered to be formed if a foreign legal entity
         provides free of charge services to third parties in Russia; in such
         cases, the tax base is 20% of its expenses on these activities. and may

INDONESIA    Resident companies pay on worldwide income, as are PEs generally
             Foreign companies and PEs have to pay the same CIT obligations,
             either by direct payments, third party withholdings, or a combination
             of both, while non-residents, without a PE in Indonesia, have to
             withhold the tax on their Indonesia-sourced via the Indonesian party
             paying the income
             Branch profits are taxed at 25% (ordinary CIT), and after tax branch

5. Capital Gains

         In all the OECD countries covered, capital gains are taxable at the ordinary CIT rates. In the
sample, only the UK currently allows for inflation adjustment of acquisition cost in the calculation of
capital gains, subject to the condition that this does not give rise to losses. In all cases, capital losses can
only be set off against capital gains in the ordinary course, while the UK has several provisions in this
regard to set off losses against other group company gains and to carry forward some losses. The US and
the UK both allow losses to be carried forward while the US allows 3 year carry back as well.

         Within the BRICS there is more variation in the treatment of capital gains and losses. China
simply adds realized gains to ordinary income on realization. India has the most elaborate laws on
separation of short term from long term gains, indexation and differential treatment of gains form shares
and securities. South Africa taxes gains as ordinary income but only to the extent of 2/3 of the gains. All
the countries place restrictions on set off of capital losses against gains rather than general income except
Brazil that allows set off against any income in the year the loss is incurred.

        The picture is generally diverse in Vietnam’s neighbors as Cambodia and Laos (except for buyer
withholding on gains from shares in Lao) have no separate provisions for gains and include them in
taxable profit; Indonesia does the same but has special provisions for land, buildings and shares and
Philippines and Malaysia do not tax capital gains except form property, land and buildings.

            system that guides judicial determinations on these issues and takes
            into account several features of these transactions. After 2012, gains
            form equity sales will not be taxed unless at least 20% of the shares of
            the company whose shares are being transacted have been held for at
            least 2 years
UK          Capital gains from assets taxed at CIT rates. Calculated as sales
            proceeds minus cost of purchase and improvements, transactions costs
            and allowance for inflation. Inflation indexation cannot be used to
            create or increase capital loss. Losses can be offset only against gains
            and can be carried forward indefinitely but not carried back. Capital
            gains can be deferred for certain assets if sale proceeds reinvested in
            similar assets within 3 years. Elaborate rules for anti-avoidance in the
            area of capital losses for intragroup transactions and mergers and
            acquisitions (M&A) exist

         capital losses are not off set against any type of income
USA      Gains recognized by corporations on capital assets in accounts are
         taxed at same rate as ordinary income. Capital losses can be deducted

6. Treatment of Losses
         All OECD countries allow loss carry forward and also allow some form of loss carry backwards
for one or two years. While Singapore allows 10 year loss carry forward and US allows 20 years, the
other countries allow unlimited loss carry forward for normal trading income. There is generally also a
built in anti-avoidance rule in that the ability to carry forward losses may be constrained by significant
changes in ownership.

        None of the BRICS allow loss carry back, while all allow varying types of carry forward. Brazil
allows carry forward without any time limit, subject to tax loss utilization in any year not reducing taxable
income by more than 30%, China allows 5 years carry forward, Russia allows carry forward unrestricted
for 10 years. Losses from sale of fixed assets can be deducted over remaining useful life on pro-rata
basis, and losses from separate “baskets” can only be set off against gains form same basket in most
cases. For India no carry back but carry forward allowed for different periods for different losses: unused
depreciation (no limit); other non-speculative business losses (8 years), speculative business losses (4
years) and capital losses (8 years). Finally, for South Africa, indefinite carry forward allowed to firms if
active and uninterrupted and similar operations conditions are met.

        For Vietnam’s neighbors there is no loss carry back in the sample, and all allow loss carry
forward, but only Malaysia allows indefinite carry forward (subject to some restrictions); while others
allow for 3-5 years. In practice all countries impose some restrictions on carry forward.

7. Depreciation

         All OECD countries in the sample allow either straight line or reducing balance depreciation over
useful life or a combination of both. All countries have some form of immediate expensing or accelerated
depreciation of extra investment/depreciation allowances for specified classes of assets or taxpayers.
Australia, Singapore, USA and UK have “clawback” provisions to capture excess depreciation on sale of
assets. US, UK and Australia allow depreciation of goodwill and other intangibles subject to some
conditions.

        Similarly BRICS countries mostly use straight line depreciation over useful lives and some
countries allow reducing balance. Russia and South Africa are more conservative than OECD countries
in allowing depreciation of intangibles and goodwill.

        The picture is similar for Vietnam’s neighbors with straigh t line over useful life and reducing
balance being the dominant methods, with some variations. Normally buildings have the longest useful

lives, accelerated depreciation may be available for some assets of types of companies and the treatment
of goodwill and intangibles varies over the sample.

                                  effective life. The life can be chosen by the taxpayer or follow a
                                  published official determination.
                                  Small taxpayers (turnover less than AUD 2 million) have a simpler

                                  assessment studies etc.

8. Expenses and Deductions

         In the sample, OECD countries considered have varying practices in allowing deduction of
startup expenses, most allow deduction for bad debts as incurred, fines and penalties are generally not
deductible while the practice of allowing income tax deductions vary, most allow payment to foreign
affiliates at arm’s length while withholding taxes (WHT) are applied in most cases. The practices with
respect to entertainment expenses vary from country to country with Australia disallowing most such
expenditures and Korea allowing employee meals and other remunerations without limit.

        The pattern is repeated in the BRICS and Vietnam’s neighbors with most countries allowing
startup expenses in some form and bad debts when incurred, mostly disallowing fines and penalties and
income taxes deductions and allowing payments to foreign affiliates at reasonable levels subject to WHT,
with widely varying practices with respect to entertainment and meals.

9. Inventory Valuation
       Most countries allow valuation at cost, and most do not allow or severely restrict last in first out
(LIFO) while allowing first in first out (FIFO). Unlike in the case of depreciation, most countries expect
conformity between tax and book treatment of inventory.

                                  allowable. For tax purposes, inventory may be valued at cost, market
                                  selling price or replacement cost regardless of how accounting valuation
                                  is done. Small business entities may ignore the change in inventory

10. Donations and Charitable Contributions

        Most countries allow deduction of charitable donations to approved entities and some impose
limits on the total deductions in a year, while many allow carry forward of unutilized deductions.
Singapore appears to be the most generous, allowing deduction of 250% of the value of approved
donations, while at the other end of the spectrum, Russia generally does not allow deduction of donations
and South Africa imposes a 20% WHT on the value of some property donated by residents.

                           132
         determination of the arm’s-length price:
         • Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method.
         • Resale price method (RPM).
         • Cost plus method (CPM).
         • Profit split method (PSM).
         • Transactional net margin method (TNMM).
         • “Other methods” as may be prescribed
         The regulations require a taxpayer to determine an arm’s-length price
         for international transactions or specified domestic transactions. It
         further provides that where more than one arm’s-length price is
         determined by applying the most appropriate transfer pricing method,
         the arithmetic mean (average) of such prices shall be the arm’s-length
         price of the international transaction or specified domestic transactions.
         Accordingly, the Indian regulations do not recognize the concept of
         arm’s-length rule but require the determination of a single arm’s-length
         price. Taxpayers are required to maintain a set of extensive information
         and documents relating to international transactions undertaken with
         approved enterprises AEs or specified domestic transactions, and to
         submit them with returns.
         Indian law prescribes a simplified dispute resolution mechanism as well
         as “safe harbor” provisions (not yet notified). Taxpayers enjoying tax
         holidays are also required to comply with TP regulations. Domestic
         transactions are also covered by TP regulations since 2012. Advance
         pricing agreements have also been introduced since 2012 under which
         the authorities may enter into a binding agreement valid for 5 years at

    Annex: International Trends and Experience in Tax
                      Policy Reform
        Revenue collected from corporate taxation is an important source of government finance
and the case for this tax is particularly strong in developing countries. This is because, unlike in
developed countries, not much revenue is raised through personal income taxation and corporate income
taxation acts as a partial substitute.5 Moreover, in developing countries, corporate income tax revenue is
especially important because, in many instances, it constitutes the main national benefit to be derived
from foreign investment (Bird 96).

         At the same time, in a supply-side model, reductions in corporate taxation can raise
investment, output and employment (Cotarelli). The classical supply-side growth model, however, is
only one of many possibilities to be considered (Bird, 44) and empirical evidence on the ability of lower
tax rates to permanently raise investment levels is scarce. On the contrary, some of the countries with the
highest tax rates are also the countries with the highest rates of investment, growth as well as those with
the lowest rates of poverty (Scandinavia) and poverty-reduction (China) while recent CIT rate reductions
in Germany and ECA do not seem to have yielded fruit.6

         The coming sections will review results from direct flat tax reforms, results of country modeling
of indirect tax reforms, incidence analysis of indirect tax systems and reforms, and lessons learned from
actual tax systems and tax reforms that can be of use to the Government of Vietnam. It will finish with a
concluding section.

1. Impact of Direct Flat Tax Reforms7

        Beginning in the mid-1990s, a large number of countries in ECA enacted flat tax reforms.
Some have implemented a flat rate on the personal income tax (PIT), others have complemented that with
changes in rate and exemptions under the corporate income tax (CIT) though at a different rate, while yet
others have implemented a flat rate at the same level for both PIT and CIT. The tax rates varied widely
across countries, from the 35 percent of Russia or 33 percent of Lithuania for the CIT to the 13 percent of
Ukraine and 12 percent of Georgia for the PIT. Such reforms affect revenue collections, tax compliance,
administrative costs, economic efficiency and income distribution.8

         In the short run, the reforms do not seem to have had a significant impact on revenues . The
fact that revenues did not decline despite a widespread absence of “supply-side” responses is largely due

5
  “This tax should be seen as a means for taxing personal incomes and an analysis of it should be closely linked to the persona l
income tax.” (Burgess and Stern).
6
  For instance, according to OECDTAX, a detailed general equilibrium model, the German 2000 tax reform reducing tax rates on
corporate profits and capital income was to result in an increase in domestic and foreign investment and an associated 0.8 percent
of GDP increase in growth. Instead, GDP growth fell by 50 percent whether one compares the 1990-2000 pre-reform decade to
the 2001-2010 post-reform decade or the pre-reform decade to the post-reform but pre-global recession 2001-2005 years.
Similarly, the investment-to-GDP ratio averaged 22 percent in the 6 years prior to the reform and it declined to 18 percent in the
6 years after the reform. In ECA, similarly, there seems to be no correlation at all between CIT reductions and investment rates.

  This section is a summary of the findings of Saavedra.

  The movement was led by Estonia (1994) followed by Lithuania (1994), Latvia (1995), the Russian Federation (2001), the
Slovak Republic and the Ukraine (2004), Georgia and Roumania (2005), Bulgaria (1997-2007).


                                                              135
to the fact that most countries designed them to be, in the short term, revenue-neutral. In particular, the
countries which set the rate at a relatively low level also decreased allowances and exemptions. In some
countries (especially the Ukraine and the Slovak Republic), the reduced reliance on direct taxes was
joined to an increase reliance in indirect taxation.

        In countries in which there was actually an increase in tax collections, this was not driven
by a “supply-side” effect of reduced rates. Rather, it seems to have been driven either by exogenous
events which had begun before the tax reforms (increases in investment) or by improved compliance. For
instance, in the Slovak Republic in 2005 (the second year of the reform), the PIT and CIT collection
increase was driven by factors beyond growth in wages and GDP respectively, most likely an
improvement in tax compliance. Subsequently, moreover, the tax-to-GDP ratio in the Slovak Republic
declined markedly from 17 percent in the pre-reform year (2003) to just 12 percent by 2010 (World Bank
data).

          Even the increase in compliance –one of the objectives of the tax reform and in theory one
of the benefits of low and flat taxes—did not pan out everywhere. In Ukraine, for instance, there is
little evidence of improved compliance in the PIT. In the first year of the reform, PIT collections fell and
the increase witnessed during the second year was due to wage growth. This result is common to other
countries and could be due to the fact that it is harder to evade PIT to start with for the large majority of
taxpayers—those under payroll—while for the self-employed and others, the lower flat rates did not work
as an incentive to alter their compliance behavior. The CIT in the Ukraine, on the other hand, did show
good performance. Though CIT elasticity to GDP fell during the first year of the reform due to the
reduced rate, it increased in the second year to a level above that of the pre-reform year. This, however,
may be attributable either to improved compliance or to the continued growth in foreign direct investment
which had started before the tax reform. Unlike in the Slovak Republic and Russia, the performance of
the Ukrainian tax effort held up, going from 14 percent in the pre-reform year to 18 percent in 2011
(World Bank data).

2. What Tax Structure Do Rich, Democratic Countries with Low Inequality Have?

         This section briefly describes the tax systems of Scandinavian countries, as they most closely
approximate the vision aimed for by the Government of Vietnam9 : “a strong, democratic, just and
civilized country with rich people.” Results from economic modeling need to be interpreted with caution
as their predictive value is limited. Economic policy changes typically have unintended consequences
that models are simply unable to capture. Therefore, the ultimate test is reality—what do countries with
the desired-for socio-economic characteristics look like institutionally and policy-wise? This is the
question this section aims to address.

2.1   Scandinavia

        Globally, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are among the richest, most egalitarian,
least corrupt countries with the highest quality of democratic governance . They have some of the
highest income per capita in the world (all above 30,000 USD per capita as of 2011). They are also
among the most egalitarian, with Gini coefficients in the mid-20s10 and poverty having been eradicated.
They also have unemployment rates well below the Euro-area average of 11.7 percent--4.8 percent in
Denmark, 3.5 percent in Norway, and somewhat higher at 6.9 percent in Finland and 7.8 percent in
Sweden. They similarly top the world rankings on good governance. Denmark and Finland are tied at
number one (with New Zealand) while Sweden was number 4 and Norway number 7 (tied with Australia)
in Transparency International’s 2012 Global Corruption Perception Index. Finally, they also boast some
of the best-performing, least captured democracies. On the global quality of democracy index for 2012,
Norway, Sweden and Finland ranked first, second and third respectively while Denmark ranked fifth.

        As regards socio-economic performance, the Scandinavian countries achieve these results
by raising a significant amount of resources through their tax systems. The tax and overall revenue
to GDP ratios are 46 and 56 percent in Denmark, 37 and 50 percent in Sweden, 30 and 53 percent in
Finland, 40 (non-oil) and 57 (overall) percent in Norway respectively (IMF 2012 data). In addition, these
countries have managed to keep their fiscal deficit and debt ratios at very manageable levels compared to
other OECD countries. In 2011-2012, the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio was just 0.3 percent in Sweden, 0.8
percent in Finland and 4.2 percent in Denmark while Norway posted a 13 percent of GDP surplus due to
oil revenue. The public debt-to-GDP ratios are also low at 37 percent in Sweden, 50 percent in Denmark
and Finland, and 60 percent of non-oil GDP in Norway (2012 IMF Article IV Consultation Reports).
Longer run fiscal sustainability, however, will need to be addressed due to the rapidly aging populations.

         These high levels of public revenues allow the Scandinavian countries to finance large
amounts of public expenditure. These high levels of public expenditure finance high quality public
education and health systems as well as similarly large fiscal transfer systems –universal pension systems
as well as unemployment, disability, child, family and other benefits. The overall amount of re-
distribution achieved through the fiscal system is very significant. Compared to the primary income
(market) Gini, the disposable income (post-fiscal) Gini coefficient is reduced by 46 percent in both
Denmark and Sweden.11

        Overall, the largest amount of income re-distribution is carried out through the expenditure
side of the budget though the tax system contributes as well. However, unlike in some other
countries, tax systems also contribute to re-distribution in the right direction. In 2004 in Denmark, for
instance, 79 percent of total fiscal re-distribution (calculated as reduction in primary income Gini) took
place through the transfer system and 21 percent through the tax system. In the same year, the equivalent
percentages were 84 and 16 percent respectively in Sweden.12 (Wang and Caminada, 2011). These


10
   In 2012, the Gini coefficient in Sweden was 0.23 (IMF Article IV 2012).
11
   The equivalent percent reduction is 44 percent in Germany and 27 percent in Canada (Wang and Caminada,
2011).
12
   The relative contributions of the transfer and tax systems to income re-distribution are similar in other OECD
countries. Also in 2004, they were 68 and 32 percent in Canada and 77 and 23 percent in Germany.


                                                      137
percentages –of roughly three fourths of the re-distribution being carried out through the expenditure side
and one fourth through the tax system—are common to most OECD countries (see Table 3).

        Scandinavian countries carry out most of the re-distribution achieved by the tax system
through income taxes, particularly highly progressive personal income taxes. As shown in Table 2
below, the top personal income tax rates range from a high of 62 percent in Sweden to a low of 40 percent
in Norway (due to oil revenues). As regards capital gains taxation, all four countries introduced flat rates
ranging from 28 percent in Norway and Finland to 59 percent in Denmark. As time goes on, if the dual
personal income tax system is not reversed, it will be important to follow the evolution of the income of
the top decile, top 5 percent and top 1 percent of the population in countries with low capital gains
taxation as it is likely to increase substantially.

        Corporate income tax rates are around the mid-20s and have been reduced in the recent
past while their bases have been broadened. Following global trends, Scandinavian countries have
lowered their corporate income tax rates. However, as in other OECD countries that implemented
reforms which simultaneously lowered the rate but broadened the base of the CIT, the percent of GDP
collected through the tax has so far remained roughly stable.

2.2    The Tax Systems of Two Successful Middle-Income Countries - Brazil and China

        This section presents the tax structure of two middle-income countries that hold useful
lessons for Vietnam in both their strengths and their weaknesses. The chosen countries are Brazil and
China. These countries have been selected because they have achieved some of the best performance in
economic growth (China), reducing income inequality (Brazil) and slashing poverty (both). The tax
system has supported these achievements by raising sufficient revenues. At the same time, much room
for improvement exists in both countries in terms of simplification as well as in enhancing the
progressivity and efficiency of the tax system.

        The tax system a middle income country builds greatly contributes to the societal model it
creates. It can be argued that tax systems need to be different in developing and developed countries.
Their economies are less diversified; economic informality is widespread, trade protection is more
prevalent and administrative capacity more limited. Therefore, the tax base is narrower. Moreover,
vested interests are often strong, making the collection of personal income tax difficult. This has typically
led to greater reliance on trade and corporate income taxation and less reliance on personal income
taxation than in developed countries. As a country moves from low to middle-income, however, the
range of possibilities open to it in tax policy are larger and the type of tax system it enacts has great
influence on the economy and society it builds.

        Therefore, it is useful for middle income countries to learn from the tax systems of
developed countries they regard as models. This is the case because, in many respects, middle income
countries quickly approximate the characteristics of developed countries and are well on their way to

building the “model” of developed country they aim at. This is why it is of great use for middle income
countries to observe the various models of market democracies in the world and build fiscal systems that
will help them get there. Similarly, lower-middle income countries have much to learn from the most
successful middle and upper-middle income countries, both in their strengths as well as their weaknesses.

         This section presents the tax systems of two middle income countries - Brazil and China -
which have had remarkable success in reducing poverty. None of the two countries has done well on
all three fronts of growth, poverty and income distribution. China has had stellar GDP growth and
poverty reduction, but dramatic increases in inequality. Brazil, on the other hand, has had impressive
success in reducing poverty and income inequality, but less success on economic growth. Between 1990
and 2011, the average annual GDP growth rate was 10 percent in China –the highest in Asia (and the
world)14-- and 3 percent in Brazil. Between 2005 and 2009, growth in Brazil accelerated to average 4
percent. Moreover, between 2000 and 2009, Brazil’s poverty and extreme poverty declined by 50
percent, going from 22 to 11 and from 12 to 6 percent respectively. Similarly, the income share of the top
decile has been growing seven times faster than that of the top decile, with a fifty percent contribution
coming from market income and the other fifty from the tax-and-transfer system. As a result of this
dynamic, the Gini coefficient has declined from 60 to 55 over the past ten years.

        Both countries have also made significant progress in other indicators of human welfare. In
many human development indicators, such as literacy, infant and maternal mortality and life expectancy
Brazil and China now stand well above the levels achieved by the average middle income country (Figure
1). Therefore, on balance, both countries can be considered very strong performers.

                                                                                                       Brazil

         Neither of the two countries has a tax system that could be considered a model, but they
raise significant amounts of resources as public revenues and spend them reasonably well. In 2011,
the revenue-to-GDP ratio was 36 percent in Brazil (IMF Article IV) and 23 percent in China. In addition,
in China, a large amount of service delivery, particularly in the basic infrastructure area, is carried out by
state owned enterprises whose resources are not reflected in general government revenue. Both countries

 are doing well as regards fiscal sustainability. In 2011, the budget deficit was only 2.6 percent in Brazil
 and 1.2 percent in China, despite the global recession. Similarly, their public debt-to-GDP ratios were 26
 percent in China and 65 percent in Brazil, where it was on a downward trend.

        The two sections below will trace the main lines of the tax systems of Brazil and China,
 which hold useful lessons for middle income countries undertaking tax reform.

i.    Brazil15

          Brazil collects 34 percent of GDP in taxes, but its tax system is overly complex, has an
 excessive number of taxes and a distortionary cascading effect. The overall number of taxes –at 85--
 is excessively and unnecessarily large. Moreover, it has a strong cascading effect caused by taxes levied
 at the federal, state and municipal level which compound each other and are applied to the final sales
 price of the good including taxes rather than the pre-tax sales price. Because it is a federation, the federal
 and the regional governments share revenue-raising and spending responsibilities.

         Direct taxes account for 55 and indirect taxes for 45 percent of government revenues.
 Around two thirds of the income tax collection comes from the corporate income tax, which raises around
 4.5 percent of GDP while the personal income tax raises 2.6 percent of GDP (IMF Article IV 2012).
 Social security contributions are also important and yield 6 percent of GDP. Indirect taxation, on the
 other hand, provides 14.6 percent of GDP.

          Corporate income is taxed at a progressive rate of 24 to 34 percent, with a supplementary 6
 percent on financial institutions. The corporate income tax rate is 15 percent, with an additional 10
 percent on income exceeding BRL 240,000 per year. The presence of the dual rate makes the statutory
 CIT rates progressive. In addition, there is a social contribution on net profits at a rate of 9 percent.
 Thus, corporate income taxation is charged at a combined rate of either 24 or 34 percent. As of 2008, the
 tax rate of the social contribution for financial institutions, private insurance companies and capitalization
 companies is 15 percent. This higher rate should help compensate for the distortion caused by the fact
 that the transactions of these institutions are not subject to VAT like other sectors are.

          The tax system on its own, on the other hand, is regressive. Direct taxes are strictly
 progressive, with the first five deciles paying 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 percent of their income in income taxes
 while the top decile pays 10 percent. Indirect taxes, on the other hand, are highly regressive with the
 bottom decile bearing almost three times the burden of the top decile. This incidence, which is much
 more regressive than in other Latin American and middle income countries, is not mainly due to the tax
 structure (which includes lower rates for goods consumed by the poor). Rather, it is the result of the
 extremely high level of inequality of market income and the lower percentage of rural population in
 Brazil.16 Because the tax system is dominated by indirect taxes, it is regressive as a whole. On the other
 hand, because income is so strongly concentrated at the top, the government collects most of its taxes
 from the upper income groups (See Table 5).

 15
   The description of the tax system draws heavily from Higgins and Pereira 2013.
 16
   The percentage of rural population in Brazil is only 15 percent while it is 21 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean region
 as a whole and 51 percent in middle-income countries. The rural poor are typically much less hard hit by indirect taxes than the
 urban poor as they have some home-grown production and purchase much of the rest in local agricultural markets which do not
 pay taxes.

ii.   China

           China collects 23 percent of GDP in taxes and, through its state-owned enterprises, sustains
  a level of public investment of 26 percent of GDP. Tax and expenditure responsibilities are split across
  the various levels of government. Direct and indirect taxes account for 25 and 60 percent of overall
  government revenues respectively. Personal income tax collections are still very low, amounting to 6
  percent of tax revenues in 2006.

           China has relatively high tax rates for personal income on labor, moderate rates for
  corporate and capital income gains and makes extensive use of tax incentives. Personal income tax
  rates are progressive, with a top rate of 45 percent. Capital gains, on the other hand, are taxed at a flat
  rate of 20 percent. Corporate income is taxed at 25 percent, since 2007 irrespective of ownership. China
  has a system of tax incentives designed to subsidize all high-tech companies and companies investing in
  equipment for environmental protection, water conservation and production safety. The first subsidy is
  characteristic of industrial policy while the latter two can be justified in terms of correcting for positive
  externalities generated by these activities. China, however, arguably makes excessive use of tax
  incentives, eroding the neutrality of the tax system and reducing the tax base sometimes with questionable
  results

          In 2002, the Chinese central government initiated a reform to phase out all formal state
  taxes and informal fees by 2006 while increasing central government transfers . In the first stage (up
  to 2004), the reform can be seen as a “fee-tax swap” in which informal fees were to be replaced with
  agricultural taxes. In 2004, however, Premier Wen Jiabao promised that all agricultural taxes would be


                                                      142
phased out within 5 years. In fact, by the end of 2005, 28 out of 31 provincial areas had implemented the
reform and in 2005, the central government announced the phasing out of all agricultural taxes at the
beginning of 2006. Simultaneously, the central government doubled its level of transfers.

         The increase in central government transfers, however, did not sufficiently compensate for
foregone resources and local governments are having difficulties in funding public services . (Tao
and Qin). In 2005, for instance, central government transfers increased by RMB66.4 million while the
rural tax reform had a revenue cost of RMB150-160 million (Zhang, 2005). As a result, the financial
situation of local governments worsened with budget deficits and public debt increasing in most
provinces. Local governments implemented cost cutting measures like reducing the number of public
employees and merging school districts. Despite these measures, there has been a significant
deterioration in the effectiveness of public service delivery to local populations. Moreover, the absence
of a well-functioning social security system providing unemployment and medical insurance and pensions
has reduced the margin of maneuver of local governments. This is especially the case in provinces with
few private sector opportunities while, in those with a more thriving economy, well-qualified civil
servants are leaving the public sector.

3. Conclusions

        Fees on public services have increased across the world, reducing access for the poor . A
wide and steep increase on fees on education, health, transport, privatized utilities, business licenses and
many other public goods and services has weighed heavily on the poor. Public pressure has mounted
against these increases in many countries in both the developed and the developing world. Reducing
them and supplementing them with tax financing would in many cases be both economically efficient (as
it would subsidize areas of positive externalities) as well as equity and positively impact the accumulation
of human capital in education and health.

         Many ECA transition countries have introduced flat tax rates in both PIT and CIT without
clear effects on tax collections, investment or growth. Most countries designed the reforms to be
revenue-neutral by enlarging the base of these taxes and reducing deductions and allowances. As a result,
in the short run, revenues did not fall markedly. In some countries, there were some positive impact from
enhanced compliance, particularly in the CIT, but these results are neither general nor robust. There also
do not seem to have been any consistent impact on investment rates across countries. Those benefitting
most from these reforms have been the highest income groups whose statutory rates tumbled. In some
countries where high thresholds were not instituted, tax rates on lower income groups increased, making
the PIT more regressive.

         Developed countries with well-functioning democracies and low inequality raise significant
resources through the tax system, including a highly progressive personal income tax. Scandinavian
countries, some of the closest examples of the market-based social democracy model Vietnam aims at,
raise large amounts of revenues through their tax systems. These tax systems carry out roughly one-
fourth of the overall re-distributive task of fiscal policy. CIT rates are moderate and the tax is broad-
based.




                                                   143
         Middle income countries making substantial progress in growth, poverty and inequality
reduction also have a strong tax effort. This is the case of China and Brazil. Both countries, however,
have features in their tax systems which reduce their efficiency and equity. China implemented a tax
reform to reduce the particularly heavy weight of the tax system on rural areas by eliminating agricultural
taxation and illegal fees. Brazil has a highly complicated tax system, with an excessive number of taxes
and a strong cascading effect.

         Globally, there is a need to re-balance tax composition increasing the weight of direct taxes
relative to indirect taxation. The case for this rebalancing is particularly strong in developing countries
as there is no robust evidence of the impact of tax composition on growth. Moreover, broad-based VATs
weigh heavily on lower and lower-middle income groups especially in highly urbanized middle income
countries with low informality. Easing the weight on indirect taxes would help improve the distributive
impact of tax policy and enhance the legitimacy of the tax system. It would also foster aggregate demand
and enhance the working of automatic stabilizers.

        On corporate income taxation, the frontier lies in reducing tax incentives and allowances,
particularly in developing countries. CIT rates have been reduced across the world, with little evidence
of impact on investment rates. On the other hand, investment incentives are pervasive, diminishing the
yield of the tax system, reducing its neutrality and often weakening governance. The main task ahead is
therefore to simplify CIT regulations, reduce exemptions and maintain rates.

         Moving toward homogeneous rates for taxation of income from labor and capital is critical
to the credibility of the tax system and may require international cooperation. Globalization has led
to the reduction of tax rates on capital gains, which are now significantly below the rates at which income
from labor is taxed. This is inequitable, horizontally and vertically, benefitting the wealthiest in every
society and undermining the credibility of tax systems across the world. Returning to at least
homogeneous rates for both sources of income is highly desirable. International cooperation would
facilitate this transition and avoid a further race-to-the bottom in capital gains taxation.

PART 2 - Value Added Tax




           145
                              Chapter I: Introduction

        Value Added Tax (VAT) has been an important source of revenue in Vietnam. It presently
contributes about one - third of the total tax revenues, which is the largest share of all taxes to total tax
revenue matched only by the tax on Enterprise Profits (CIT). Together, the VAT and CIT account for
almost two-thirds of the tax revenues of the Government of Vietnam. Except for a few years in the past,
it has been generally a buoyant tax, the revenues growing at a rate greater than the growth rate of the
GDP.

         Prior to the introduction of a VAT, Vietnam had adopted a turnover tax in October 1990 in its
first round of tax reform. In an effort to mitigate the shortcomings of this tax, several rounds of
amendments have been carried out since then. Finally, the turnover tax was replaced by a VAT in 1999.
Subsequently, several amendments have been made with some major changes adopted in 2003, 2006, and
the VAT Law revision conducted in 2008. Several major changes have also been approved by the
National Assembly in 2013 and are due for implementation soon.

1. Overall Structure of VAT

        The VAT law introduced in 1999 was consumption-based, following the destination principle,
and applied to both goods and services. Exports were zero-rated while 26 categories of goods and
services were exempt. A special feature of this tax was the exemption of goods and services subject to
Special Consumption Tax (SCT) or excises.

        A rate of 5 percent applied to 13 categories of items, a rate of 20 percent applied to 5 groups of
goods and services including gold, silver, gems, hotel tourism and catering services, lotteries of all kinds,
shipping agents and brokerage services, while the rate of 10 percent applied to all remaining goods and
services. The rate of 20% was subsequently removed and the maximum rate applicable presently is 10%.

          A number of articles of the original VAT have been subsequently amended. The main
characteristics of the current VAT system (applied since January 2009) are discussed next. The present
VAT law mandates three tax rates. A tax rate of zero (0) percent is for the export of goods and services,
and international transportation. A tax rate of five (5) percent is applied to a select group of about 15
categories of goods and services. This group includes clean water; fertilizers and pesticides; medical
equipment and medicines; teaching and learning aids; children’s toys and books; unprocessed products of
cultivation, husbandry, forestry and fresh foodstuffs; sugar and by-products; products made from jute and
bamboo; semi processed cotton; feed for cattle and poultry; technical and scientific services; special
purpose machinery and equipment for agricultural production and newsprint; cultural exhibits and sports
activities. The only change proposed in this category is to remove ores used in fertilizer production from
the list of goods and services taxed at 5%, and to charge 5% VAT on selling, renting and leasing of social
residential houses.

        Finally, a tax rate of ten (10) percent is applied to the remaining items under VAT.


                                                    146
        A major change compared to the earlier VAT law has been that VAT now applies to all goods
and services subject to the Special Consumption Tax (SCT) which, in fact, is the Excise Tax. It is an
important change and ensures that Vietnam law conforms to the international practice.

        Twenty five categories of goods and services are VAT exempt under the new law.

2. Exclusions

         A number of items are excluded (not exempted) from the VAT laws of Vietnam. They are
regulated by Decree No 121/ND - CP and Circular 06/TT - BTC, which came into effect from March 01,
2012. These include- goods and services provided outside Vietnam by Vietnam-based taxpayers except
international transportation with overseas places of departure and arrival; revenues from compensation,
bonus, support, transfer of emission rights and other financial revenues; Vietnam-based production and
business organizations and individuals that purchase from foreign organizations without permanent
establishments in Vietnam or overseas individuals not residing in Vietnam services such as repair of
vehicles, machinery or equipment (including supplies and spare parts); advertising and marketing;
investment and trade promotion; goods sale and service provision brokerage; training; or share of charges
for international post or telecommunications services provided outside Vietnam between Vietnamese and
foreign partners.

        Non-business organizations and individuals that are not value-added tax payers are not required
to declare and calculate value-added tax when selling their assets, including assets they are using to
secure loans at banks or credit institutions. Further details of this category are discussed in the chapter on
exemptions.

3. Exemptions

         The list of exempt categories of goods and services is long and broadly includes: (a) products of
cultivation, husbandry, animal breeds and plant varieties; (b) financial/credit services and insurance
(including engagement in stock exchange); (c) state owned dwelling houses sold to tenants ; (d)
healthcare and animal health services; (e) renovation, and construction of cultural, physical and sports
infrastructure ; (f) radio and TV broadcasting funded through state budget, newspapers and magazines
publications; (g) public services of sanitation, water drainage, and irrigation in agricultural production; (h)
public transportation by bus and tramcar; (i) weapons and military equipment for defense; (j)
humanitarian aid and nonrefundable aid; (k) transfer of technology; (l) post, telecommunication and
internet services; (m) machinery, equipment and supplies which cannot be produced domestically and
need to be imported for direct use in scientific research and technological development activities;
machinery, equipment, spare parts, special purpose means of transport and supplies which cannot be
produced domestically and need to be imported for prospecting, exploring and developing oil and gas ;
(n) goods and services of business individuals with monthly incomes below the common minimum salary
level applicable to domestic organizations and enterprises; (o) salt products; (p) transfer of land use
rights; (q) teaching and vocational training, (r) goods transited through Vietnam territory; (s) Export of
unprocessed mined resources; (t) Gold imported in the form of bars or ingots etc.




                                                     147
       The current draft law approved by the NA makes minor changes to this list including extending
the VAT exempt categories of insurance and financial services.

4. Tax Exempt Threshold for Small Traders

        Presently, every small producer and trader is subject to VAT unless their income falls below the
level comparable to the official minimum wage. In Vietnam, there is no threshold based on turnover
exempting small producers and traders from the VAT net. A provision, though, has been made to apply
the subtraction method of VAT calculation for those small businesses that cannot maintain records. This
method calculates value added as the selling price of goods or services minus the purchase price of such
goods and services. Records need not be maintained for purchase of inputs and these are generally
estimated on the basis of the type of business and the turnover. The combination of zero thresholds and
application of the subtraction method increases administrative costs without a commensurate increase in
revenues.

         The law recently approved by the national assembly introduces a threshold based VAT system for
the first time in Vietnam. Under the present system, business with annual turnover below VND 100
million a year would not be subject to the VAT, while businesses with turnover below 1000 million VND
a year would pay a presumptive tax based on turnover. Businesses that fall below the second threshold of
1000 million VND could opt for payment of VAT through the credit invoice system if they maintain
prescribed records, and some household businesses as well as firms in the gold, gems and jewelry
businesses are allowed to operate under the subtraction method of calculating VAT.

5. VAT Computation Methods

        Both the credit method, called the value added tax credit method (deduction method), and the
subtraction method, referred to as the calculation of tax based on added value method (direct method),
have been adopted for calculating the VAT liability in Vietnam. At present Vietnam has virtually no
turnover based threshold for VAT. All registered Enterprises and co-operatives are supposed to pay VAT
through the credit invoice method and those individual and household businesses that can meet
accounting requirements could also register under the credit invoice or deduction method. It has been
found through audit and inspections that most individual and household businesses do not in fact maintain
proper accounts.

        The proposed new law approved by the NA introduces VAT thresholds and requires all
Enterprises and co-operatives above the 1 billion VND thresholds to register and pay VAT according to
the deduction method. It requires individual and business households to apply the direct or subtraction
method, and thus provides them an incentive to incorporate if they cross the threshold, since only
Enterprises (registered) can pay VAT by the invoice-credit method. The subtraction method is presently
applied to those enterprises and small traders doing business who fail to fully implement regulations on
accounting, invoices, and vouchers to serve as the bases for tax calculation under the credit invoice
method and to businesses involved in gold, silver and gems trading activities and to household and
individual businesses.




                                                  148
        Under the new regime, all individual and household businesses, certain foreign contractors and
the gold, gems and jewelry sector will operate under the direct or subtraction method. All Enterprises and
co-operatives over the 1 billion thresholds will register and pay under the credit-invoice system and those
Enterprises and co-operatives under the 1 billion thresholds who maintain prescribed accounts may also
voluntarily register and pay under the deduction or invoice credit system.

        The proposed new law approved by the NA has also changed the method of computation of the
subtraction or direct method, from using ratios of value added to turnover to determine the taxable base,
to a direct tax on turnover with the exception of gold and precious stones sector. It has specified that
enterprises and cooperatives with turnover under 1 billion except those that can voluntarily register under
the deduction method, and all household and individual business regardless of size, business entities, and
foreign business individuals and organizations that are not permanent residents of Vietnam, but have
incomes incurred in Vietnam and have not fully complied to the required regime of accounting, with a
few exception shall pay VAT based on turnover at the following rates:

         Commercial (distribution and supply of goods): 1%;
         Product related production, transportation and services, construction combined with input
          material supply: 3%;
         Service and construction (with exception of construction services combined with input
          material supply): 5%;
         Other business operations: 2%.

         An exception has been made for gold, silver, precious stones, where the value added tax payable
according to the subtraction method for computing value added tax is calculated by the direct added value
of the sold goods and services times the value added tax rate, applied for gold, silver and precious stone
trading and product making. The added value of gold, silver, and precious stones is determined by the
selling prices of the gold, silver, precious stones minus the input prices of the gold, silver, precious stones
correspondingly.

6. Real Estate

         In Vietnam, the price of the transfer of the right to use land is not taxable under VAT. This has
been discussed at length in a later chapter. Almost all the issues in this category arise because the sale of
real estate is taxable, but land is exempted as is the sale of state owned dwelling houses to current tenants.
The problem of allocation of land value to real estate is further complicated in the case of sale of high rise
apartment buildings, leading to loss of revenue on account of non-inclusion of land value and giving rise
to numerous disputes about the proper transaction price for levying VAT.

7. VAT Policies for Gems and Jewelry

        At the importation stage, Article 5 of the Law on VAT of 2008 defines "Gold imported in bar and
foil which has not yet been processed into fine art articles, jewelry and other products" is not subject to
VAT, while Gold jewelry, other products made by imported gold are charged 10% VAT.




                                                     149
        In the domestic market, according to the current regulation the purchase, sale, and manipulation
of gold are taxed by the subtraction method or direct method for VAT, and the VAT liability is the
difference between the selling prices minus (-) the cost of goods sold times (x) the rate of 10%.

        The exemption given to imported gold while taxing domestically purchased gold under VAT
provides negative protection to the domestic gold industry. In the proposed draft VAT law approved by
the national assembly, the government has retained both the exemption to imported gold as well as the
method of subtraction for calculating VAT for gold, silver and precious stones industry.

8. VAT Taxable Value (Taxable Price)

         Article 7 of the VAT law regulates the price on which the output VAT is levied. In general, the
transaction value is used and the attempt is to use the actual selling price exclusive of VAT and interest,
but including other levies (such as special consumption tax), in domestic currency as the basis for
calculating VAT. The current set of amendments approved by the national assembly also includes the
value of another excise type tax – the environmental tax in the taxable value. The article 7 separately
specifies the price in cases of imported goods, goods and services sold by production and trading entities,
goods and services used for internal exchanges or consumption, donation and gifts, asset leasing,
installment payment methods, out-sourcing of goods, construction and installment, real estate businesses,
trading agents and brokers and invoices with the value added tax inclusive prices.

9. VAT Refunds

         The present rules on VAT refund in Vietnam are complicated and vary with the nature and
activity of a particular business.

       i.   For businesses operating under the deduction method excess tax on inputs is not refunded
            unless it is carried forward for three months.
      ii.   For exporting businesses, cumulative total excess input tax refund in excess of 200 million
            dongs is permitted at present.
     iii.   In case of businesses that have undertaken investment for more than a year but have not been
            able to deduct input credits completely, cumulative excess input tax is refunded annually
            unless it exceeds 200 million dongs in which case it is refunded quarterly. If, however, the
            business investment is new, refunds are made on a quarterly basis in case the cumulative
            excess input tax is less than 200 million dongs, and immediately if over 200 million. Thus a
            different set of rules is applicable in case of VAT refund on different companies.

        Under the new draft law approved by the NA, the default period for availing refund of unutilized
input credit has been increased to 12 months and the threshold amounts for refund of accumulated credits
have been raised to 500 million VND.

10. VAT Deductions

         The present VAT law allows deduction of taxes paid on inputs from VAT payable subject to
certain restrictions for units operating under the credit invoice system. The present system discriminates
somewhat between investment inputs and other inputs in that it allows for investment input credit for all


                                                   150
capital goods even in cases where some goods produced are taxable and some are not while other input
credit for raw materials is allowable only in the same proportion as taxable turnover. For payments above
VND 20 million, supporting bank documents are required, while for payments under the limit payment
through a bank is not mandatory.

        The recently approved draft law has incorporated a number of changes in these provisions that are
discussed in detail in chapter 8, the most important one being the treatment of investment input and other
input credit on an equal footing.

11. VAT on Exports

         In general, the VAT treatment of exports in Vietnam is in line with international practice, which
is to zero rate exports. However, certain categories of exports are kept outside the purview of zero rating
such as cases of transfer of technologies or intellectual property rights abroad; offshore reinsurance
services; credit provision, capital transfer and derivative financial services; post and telecommunications
services; and exported products that are unprocessed mined resources and minerals.

         At present, Vietnam does not have comprehensive laws to govern the “point of taxation” in the
case of services. Normally it is recommended that all exports of goods and services be zero rated to keep
them competitive in international markets as well as to properly apply the destination principle. This is
not an issue in the case of goods where the decision to exempt or zero rate is largely a matter of policy. It
is more of an issue with services as it can be very difficult to define whether services were actually
exported or not. This matter is discussed in detail in the chapter on exports under VAT.




                                                    151
                               Chapter II: VAT Rates

        At present, Vietnam has the following VAT rates:

        (1). Tax Rate of Zero (0) Percent for Export Goods and Services, including export goods and
services exempted from value added tax when they are exported and international transportation; except:

            a)   Transfer of technologies or intellectual property rights abroad;
            b)   Offshore reinsurance services;
            c)   Credit provision;
            d)   Capital transfer;
            e)   Derivative financial services;
            f)   Post and telecommunications services; and
            g)   exported unprocessed minerals stipulated in detail by the Government

        The government proposes to add the category “Exported goods and services that are consumed
outside Vietnam, in the non-tariff zones, and in some cases provided to foreign customers in accordance
with the Government’s regulations.”

         This is not an unusual provision, as Vietnamese goods consumed outside Vietnam and in non-
tariff areas should not be subject to VAT as VAT is for goods in “home use” . Care needs to be taken,
however, to prevent diversion and re-entry of these goods into Vietnam (domestic tariff area) without
payment of tax. However, there may be a need for further elaborating the proposed definition to both
clearly define “point of sale” for exported services, to limit leakage of bene fits to non-entitled persons, to
extend legitimate services to foreigners and at the same time to prevent unnecessary extension of benefits
to foreigners as well. The general principle is to zero-rate all exports of goods and services and the law
should be elaborate enough to ensure this, if necessary with supplementary rules. These issues are
discussed further in the chapter on export treatment of VAT.

        (2). Tax Rate of Five (5) Percent for the Following Goods and Services:

            a) Clean water for production and daily life;
            b) Fertilizers; ores for fertilizer production; insecticides, pesticides and plant and animal
               growth stimulators;
            c) Feeds for cattle, poultry and other domestic animals;
            d) Services of digging, embanking and dredging canals, ditches, ponds and lakes for
               agricultural production; growing, tending, and preventing pests and insects for, plants;
               preliminary processing and preservation of agricultural products;
            e) Unprocessed cultivation, husbandry and fishery products, except products specified in the
               Law;
            f) Preliminarily processed rubber latex; preliminarily processed turpentine; nets, main ropes
               and fibers for making fishing-nets;
            g) Fresh and live food; unprocessed forest products, except timber, bamboo shoots and
               products specified in the Law;


                                                     152
            h) Sugar; by-products in sugar production, including molasses, bagasse and sludge;
            i) Products made of jute, rush, bamboo, leaf, straw, coconut husks and shells and
               Eichhornia crassipes, and other handicrafts made of agricultural raw materials;
               preliminarily processed cotton; paper for newspaper printing;
            j) Special-purpose machinery and equipment for agricultural production, including
               ploughing machines, harrowing machines, rice-planting machines, seeding machines,
               rice-plucking machines, reaping machines, combine harvesters, agricultural product
               harvesters, insecticide or pesticide pumps or sprayers;
            k) Medical equipment and instruments; medical cotton and bandage; preventive and curative
               medicines; pharmaco-chemistry products and pharmaceuticals used as raw materials for
               the production of curative and preventive medicines;
            l) Teaching and learning aids, including models, figures, boards, chalk, rulers, compasses,
               and equipment and tools exclusively used for teaching, research and scientific
               experiments;
            m) Cultural, exhibition, physical training and sports activities; art performances; film
               production; film import, distribution and screening;
            n) Children toys; books of all kinds, except books specified in Clause 15, Article 5 of this
               Law;
            o) Scientific and technological services under the Law on Science and Technology.

       The government plans to delete the category “ores for fertilizer production” from this list, raising
the VAT to 10% for these products.

        The government also plans to add the category selling, renting or leasing of social residential
homes to the 5% category. We have commented on the use of VAT on new property and residential
construction in a later chapter so no further comments are made here.

         To benefit agriculture, metal ores used for fertilizer production are charged 5% VAT as applied to
fertilizer whereas ores in other cases are charged 10%. It is very difficult to tax any good at different
rates based on end-use. VAT is normally charged at the time of clearance from the factory gate (or mine)
and end-use is not certain at that stage. This invariably leads to disputes and extra administrative and
compliance cost to monitor end-use. The government proposes to delete the category “ores for fertilizer
production” from the 5% category which is a good idea.

        (3). The Tax Rate of 10% applies to Goods and Services not listed under 0% and 5%.

        The international experience is varied. The standard VAT rates in some countries like Denmark,
Poland, and UK are as high as 25, 22, and 20% percent respectively. Some countries like Australia and
New Zealand have moderate rates of 10 and 12.5 percent respectively. On the other hand, countries like
Switzerland and Japan have comparatively low tax rates at 7.6 and 5 percent respectively. In Canada,
provincial governments charge an additional VAT or sales tax rate on top of the federal rate of 5 percent.
The standard tax rates in most Asian countries are more moderate and range from 10 to 17 percent.

         Currently about 145 countries have adopted VAT out of which 54 per cent countries have a single
rate in addition to a zero rate. In the chapter on international experience of the VAT it may be seen that



                                                   153
while the VAT system in Vietnam may look very different from most of the OECD countries, it compares
well with the neighboring countries. The rationale for multiple rates is rooted primarily in a two-way
equity concern. First, that the poor should not be taxed heavily and therefore some goods and services
that are mainly consumed by them should be lightly taxed. The list of goods and services with a 5 percent
VAT rate in Vietnam therefore mostly include items related to agriculture and animal husbandry,
education, medicine, science and technology. The second consideration probably has been that the rich
should not get off lightly and therefore those goods and services that are mainly consumed by the rich
should be taxed at a higher rate.

        The issue of multiple VAT rates may be analyzed on the dual principles of efficiency and equity.
Efficiency gains could be realized by following the inverse elasticity rule according to which
goods/services with low elasticity of demand should be taxed at a higher rate and goods/services with
high demand elasticity should be taxed at a lower rate. This would justify higher VAT rate for the so
called “sin” goods like alcohol and tobacco products. It could also be argued that some other goods such
as gasoline and some luxury items have low elasticity of demand so far as the rich were concerned. A
higher level of taxation for all such goods, however, can be easily ensured by imposing excises on those
items in addition to the normal VAT. Another aspect of the efficiency point could be made on the ground
that higher rates would result in higher tax revenues. There is, however, no strong evidence to support
this hypothesis. On the other hand, it is a well-known fact among tax administrators that higher tax rates
are more likely to encourage tax evasion.

         As regards the equity or distributional considerations for tax differentiation, income taxes and
expenditure policies which may be thought of as subsidy for the poor or a negative income tax are
preferred policy instruments compared to the use of different rates of indirect taxation on different
commodities. For instance, food items are often taxed lightly on the ground that the poor spend a greater
share of their earnings on food in comparison to the rich. Studies of tax systems where rate
differentiation has been implemented, however, tend to show that in majority of such cases, the tax
benefits largely go to the rich who are likely to spend larger sums on those items compared to the poor.
Even if it is accepted that distributional gains may be realized by rate differentiation in VAT, such gains
are likely to be quite modest. Also, there are very few items that can be differentiated clearly on the basis
of consumption by different income groups.

         While there may be some marginal benefits of rate differentiation in VAT, several costs imposed
by this kind of policy are well known and would outweigh such benefits, if any.

        Some of these costs are outlined below.

       i.   A single positive rate lowers cost of compliance by simplifying the requirements of keeping
            records and invoices. It also simplifies tax forms which goes a long way in promoting self-
            assessment.
      ii.   Rate differentiation creates opportunities for misclassification of items, thereby raising the
            cost of administration. On the other hand, a single positive rate removes the confusion that
            might arise in the treatment of border line cases and thus lowers the cost of administration.
            For example:



                                                    154
            -   Printing activities are charged 10% VAT but books (except non-taxable books) are
                charged 5%.
            -   Science and technology services, which are regulated in the Law on Science and
                Technology, are charged 5% VAT. Science and technology services have a lot of
                similarity with other services such as inspection, legality inspection, storage etc.; charged
                at 10%.
            -   As regulated in the Law on VAT, products of cultivation, husbandry, aquaculture,
                seafood and fisheries which have only been subject to conventional preliminary
                treatment (semi-processed) in the stages of sale are charged 5% VAT; products that have
                been subject to finished processing are charged 10% VAT.
            -   Whether massage machines should be taxed 5% or 10% V AT? In the businesses’
                opinion, massage machines are used for health treatment purposes thus should be charged
                5% (patient’s’ treatment); in the tax authority’s opinion, the massage machines are not
                distinctly used for health treatment purpose and should be charged 10%.
            -   Teaching aids are charged 5% VAT and there are a lot of products that can be both
                teaching aids and normal goods such as white board, equipment tables, etc.
            -   Sugar and by-products are charged 5% like agriculture products in the sale stage. But
                then, should sweetener and chemical sugar be taxed at 5% or 10%?
     iii.   The use of a single rate helps limit the numbers of refunds. If there is a low tax rate along
            with a zero rate some taxpayers, particularly exporters and importers of capital goods, could
            be in a sustained credit position vis-à-vis the tax department. This would result in additional
            refund claims.

         In the case of Vietnam, a lower VAT rate on several input items is sometimes justified on the
ground that it will reduce the cash flow burden of the VAT taxpayers. The VAT payers, however,
typically enjoy a cash flow benefit from collecting higher VAT on their outputs so this cannot be a serious
problem.

       Thus, there is hardly any justification for maintaining multiple rates on a long term basis.
Vietnam should therefore consider moving to a rate structure with zero and one positive VAT rate and a
few, well defined exemptions.

        Also, when a single VAT rate is adopted, all the categories of goods/services to which that rate
will apply need not be listed. The new law should spell out the zero-rated goods, exempt goods and then
the single rate should apply to all the remaining goods and services being produced and consumed in the
economy.

        The introduction of a single rate should be part of an overall VAT reform rather than
implemented in isolation. It may have to be synchronized with the reform in excises where some luxury
items are brought in the tax net so that the elimination of the lower VAT rate is not seen as a step
unfavorable to the poor.




                                                   155
         The question is if the government decides to adopt a single VAT rate, what should that rate be? If
the 5 per cent rate is abolished, should the country maintain the 10 per cent rate or it should explore the
possibility of enhancing the rate. There are several reasons for thinking of a higher tax rate for the future.

       i.   If the 5 per cent rate is abolished, what remains is the rate of 10 per cent. But this is
            comparatively a low rate of taxation under VAT in the international context. Out of the 112
            countries in the world with a VAT for which we have data, 88 countries impose a VAT with
            their rate in a range of 12%-25% out of which 20 countries impose the rates from 20%-25%,
            36 countries impose the rates from 17%-20%, 32 countries impose the rates from 12%-17%,
            the other 24 countries impose 12% rate or below. Countries in the region having common
            economic characteristics to Vietnam such as Laos, Indonesia, and Cambodia impose 10%
            rate. China imposes a general rate of 17% and preferential VAT rate of 13%. Singapore
            imposes 5% GST rate.
      ii.   With the gradual reduction of trade taxes under the provisions of WTO, the question of
            recouping the loss of revenue will certainly arise for Vietnam in not too distant a future. The
            revenue from the corporate income tax is currently at the level of over 5 per cent of GDP and
            it will be unrealistic to expect a phenomenal increase in this. The scope of additional revenue
            from property and land related taxes are limited not only in Vietnam but generally in most
            countries. While some of the requisite increase in revenues can come from the restructuring
            of income taxes, the VAT has to play a dominant role in increase of revenues in the future.
     iii.   The choice of the higher than 10% rate can be made more palatable by exempting some of the
            goods currently taxed at 5% such as equipment and machinery for agricultural production,
            clean water and medical equipment. Under a VAT even exempted goods pay some VAT on
            inputs, so this may meet the considerations of equity while largely preserving revenues.
            Goods that need not be taxed at a concessional rate and can be moved to the higher rate,
            currently enjoying 5% tax rate are:
            -   Books of all kinds (except non-taxable books) because it is difficult to make a distinction
                between them and other goods charged 10% for printing.
            -   Science and Technology services (ST) because there are no grounds to distinguish
                between them and other common services such as: evaluation, legality inspection,
                storage, etc.
            -   Metal ore for fertilizer production because there is no way to distinguish such metal ores
                from other ores. This is proposed in new law.
            -   Teaching aids because many of them are normal goods (such as board, equipment table).
            -   Sugar and by-products because it will be more fair to sweetener and chemical sugar
                industries.
            -   Cultural activities; exhibitions; physical training and sports activities; artistic
                performances; film production; and importation, distribution and screening of films
                should be charged 10% VAT or higher because these are supplied for profit.
            -   Growth Stimulators for animals and plants should be charged the 10% VAT or higher
                because there are many types and are difficult to distinguish. Also, there is some
                uncertainty about whether they are goods for animals and plants or not.




                                                    156
     iv.    The government budget deficit has been widening over the years, forcing the government to
            borrow more. Since 2009 Vietnam has continuously reduced its tax rate; therefore another
            reduction in tax rate even 1% or 2% will create difficulties in balancing the government’s
            budget in the next several years, especially when import tax is lowered due to international
            commitments and Vietnam’s economic prospects as well as the world economic prospects are
            yet to improve. Unbalanced budget over a long period leads to serious repercussions.
            Vietnam’s credit rating is still low thus borrowing cost in the international market is going to
            be high.
      v.    According to international experience, other countries do not reduce VAT rate on “merit”
            goods but give aid directly to consumers (normally low-income people) in cash or give
            “merit” goods and products to consumers or vouchers. For instances, in the situation of long
            and serious imbalance of government budget and recession, decreased spending and
            deflation, the Japanese government is trying to convince Japanese Congress to increase the
            VAT rate from 5 percent to 10 percent.

        It is therefore suggested that in the course of its tax reform, Vietnam should consider enhancing
the VAT rate. Of course, before deciding upon a higher rate, a sensitivity analysis will be necessary in
terms of rate versus tax revenue trade off using a revenue forecasting model. Even with a modest
increase in rate, the VAT rate should remain at an acceptable level. Elimination of the 5% rate will also
have to coincide with streamlining the current list of exemptions, which is discussed in the next chapter.

1. Exclusions

        A number of items are excluded (not exempted) from the VAT laws of Vietnam. They are
regulated by Decree No 121/ND - CP and Circular 06/TT - BTC, which came into effect from March 01,
2012 as “3. Cases not requiring declaration and payment of value-added tax:

   a) Goods and services provided outside Vietnam by Vietnam-based taxpayers, except international
      transportation with overseas places of departure and arrival.
       In case service provision activities are carried out both in Vietnam and overseas, while service
       provision contracts are signed between two enterprises paying tax in Vietnam or having
       permanent establishments in Vietnam, such services are subject to value-added tax for the
       contract value performed in Vietnam, except the provision of insurance services for imported
       goods;

       transferred upon division, splitting, consolidation, merging and transformation, business
       establishments with transferred assets must have asset transfer orders enclosed with a set of asset
       origin dossiers and are not required to issue invoices.

       For asset transfer among independent cost-accounting units or among member units with full
       legal entities in the same business establishment, business establishments with transferred assets
       must issue VAT invoice, declare and pay VAT as prescribed except for the cases guided in clause
       5 of this Article.

       c) Payment claiming from third parties in insurance activities.

        This is obviously a long list of exemptions and needs to be examined carefully. But first, a brief
note on the rationale of exemptions is presented below.

Why Exemption?

         First of all, why exempt any goods and services? One possible reason could be if output were
hard to identify and measure or if it were administratively hard to tax. For instance, financial services and
small traders are exempted on these grounds. In the first case, it is not easy to measure the output of
financial services in addition to the fact that these services are internationally mobile. In the second case,
the administrative cost of taxing traders below a certain threshold is comparatively higher than the
revenue gains from taxing them. Therefore, there is some justification for exempting these sectors.

        Another reason for exemption could be that it is a less costly and administratively convenient way
of applying a reduced VAT rate. It may be argued that a lower rate may be preferable to exempting a set
of goods and services. The issue of rate differentiation has already been discussed in the preceding
section with the conclusion that it is not a desirable feature of a VAT system. Thus exemption of goods
and services cannot be justified on this ground.

Revenue Implications of Exemption



                                                    161
          Second, what would be the implication of exemptions for tax revenue? Effectively, exemptions
break the VAT chain and may result in an increase of VAT revenues if there is a cascading of taxes. If,
however, exemptions are applied at the last stage, revenues will fall. So the overall impact of VAT
exemption is indeterminate and there is no clear cut evidence that it is a revenue enhancing measure. In
any case, cascading is not a desirable feature and one reason for moving away from turnover taxes was
that it causes cascading.

Anomalies Created by Exemption

There are several anomalies created by exemption.

        (i)     Exemption distorts the input choices because of an element of tax that remains in the
        chain of production. This aberration does not remain confined to a single sector but would
        pervade all those sectors where the products made from the exempt input are further used as
        production inputs.

        (ii)     By introducing an element of cascading, exemption will create an incentive for vertical
        integration of units giving rise to artificial groupings of activities and organizational forms that
        are not necessary from commercial view point.

        (iii)    It would create a major problem if the final product is exported because zero rating will
        not be able to eliminate the cascading created by exemption at an intermediate stage. Similarly, it
        creates incentive to import inputs that domestically have an exemption in their production chain
        because the import price does not have an element of tax in it since exports from other country
        would be zero-rated.

        (iv)     Exemptions also create administrative and compliance problems for traders who sell
        both taxed and exempt items. Their input tax payments must be allocated between the two kinds
        of sale.

Some Goods and Services Commonly Exempted

        Looking at the international practice of exemptions, the following broad categories of goods and
services seem to be generally included in the category of exempt goods and services.

        (i)     Agricultural products and key agricultural inputs
        (ii)    Passenger transport
        (iii)   Cultural and other merit goods
        (iv)    Aid financed activities
        (v)     Services provided by the public sector, health and education in particular
        (vi)    Financial services
        (vii)   Real estate and construction




                                                    162
         The rationale behind exempting the first two categories of goods and services is some sort of
distributional or equity consideration in the sense that by exempting these sectors, the low income
consumers and agricultural farmers will benefit. This concern is, however, partially addressed since small
farmers and transporters will normally fall in the category of small exempt traders below the prescribed
threshold limit. The third category reflects the sensitivity of taxing certain goods and services in a
particular country while the fourth group might arise because of conditions imposed by the donors. The
extent to which exemption may have to be granted to these two categories of goods and services would be
country specific and somewhat item specific.

         Goods and services supplied by the public sector in competition with the private sector should be
fully taxed except where these are purely non-commercial services given free of charge. Defense, other
not-for-profit public services, some categories of health and education services fall in this category. It is
hard to tax a service that is given away free except by taxation of inputs. In fact, public sector may be
regarded as the final consumer of non-commercial services that it produces and gives away free of charge.
This is the practice currently adopted in EU countries.

       As regards health and education, the standard advice and practice is to exempt basic services –
primary education, basic healthcare - and tax the specialized services at normal tax rate.

        One relevant question is: does it make a difference whether such public sector services that are
provided free of cost are taxed or exempt? Since the final price is zero, taxation or exemption apparently
does not make any difference. As regards tax revenue on inputs, that also is a washout because that will
increase the budgetary costs to the government for providing those services. The only difference is that
exemption would break the chain with its accompanying implications.

        Some countries (Canada, some EU countries) have therefore adopted the practice of taxing these
services and then rebating the VAT to public bodies engaged in this kind of activities. This virtually
converts the exemption to zero-rating. The problem of assessing the sales value for such services is often
solved by looking at the user fee collection if there is a user fee or by the amount of budgetary subsidy
provided to the agency in question. In any case, the overall revenue implication for the government
would be zero.

         Financial services such as banking and insurance are typically VAT exempt for reasons discussed
earlier. The main reason is that they are extremely hard to tax and are fairly mobile.

         The ideal treatment of real estate and construction would be to tax the services that flow from
them. Credit may, of course, be given if services are used as business input. The leasing of real estate for
commercial purposes can be easily subject to VAT but this would be hard in case of owner occupied
houses. To avoid distorting choice between renting and house ownership, the commercial leasing of
residential property is also generally exempt. One way to tax residential property under the VAT would
be to tax at the time of purchase of house. Taxing the subsequent resale does not make a lot of sense as
the tax revenues paid by buyer and the refund claimed by seller would cancel out. The construction
activities should be taxed in the normal way and credit given for construction as a business activity. This
practice would ensure that those who construct houses for own occupation and are therefore VAT exempt
on the final value of the house, at least pay VAT on their inputs.



                                                    163
         In Vietnam, the Law on VAT defines that transferring the use of land is non-taxable for VAT.
Therefore, when determining the tax rates for the transfer of land (including the rights to use land,
buildings and works on land), tax calculators have to exclude the value of transferring the use of land
which is not subject to VAT. Actually, there is not sufficient evidence to determine what the value of
transferring the use of land will be while deducting this item in determining the taxable value in the land
transfer transactions. If the contract price is used in calculation, the buyers and sellers will agree to put
high price for the value of transferring land and low price for the value of buildings and works on land in
their contracts to avoid tax, especially in the case of sale to final consumers.

        The taxing authorities (Government’s authorities on tax, audit and inspection) have no basis to
distinguish the agreed price from the market price leading to different decisions. Business and buyers in
many cases suffer from prolonged, inconsistent processes along with incomplete and complicated
procedures. If the provincial-level People's Committee’s land price is used, the tax deduction from land is
low leading to complaints about high tax burden from the real estate businesses and customers. In this
case, the best way is to include the total transaction value including land to avoid these disputes, a
“Homestead exemption” as a percentage of the total transaction value may be given for non -commercial
properties to reduce the total tax payable while maintaining the single rate and making the process simple
and transparent.

Some Guiding Principles for Vietnam on Exemptions

       The above discussion provides some useful guidelines for reexamining the existing list of
exemptions in Vietnam. Similarly, imports of some machinery and equipment that cannot be produced
domestically are VAT exempt. On the category of machinery and equipment, there is no need for tax
exemption unless the VAT refund system is very slow or dysfunctional.

        Goods and services provided by the public sector free of cost on a noncommercial basis are good
candidates for exemption. This includes primary education and basic health. Cultural and other merit
goods, aid financed activities; financial services may be considered for exemption because of their
unusual situation. Residential rentals are a good candidate for tax exemption while new residential
properties can be taxed. Other items in the list in section 4 of the act need a close scrutiny and should be
excluded unless there are some strong reasons to keep them tax exempt.

A Cautionary Note on Taxing Health and Education Services

        When bringing anything under the tax net from an exempt list, one has to make sure the sale price
of the output is commercial price and not below market or subsidized price. Otherwise, the tax
department may end up paying more tax on the input than collecting tax on the output. This kind of
problem may arise in cases such as secondary education where the output price may not be market
determined and has some hidden element of subsidy. Many countries (Botswana, South Africa) ended up
losing revenues by not exercising caution. If there is an element of subsidy in sales price, it should be
grossed up before applying VAT to avoid this problem.

        Some of the issues raised are examined below and some general comments provided on specific
exemptions. It may be noted that the comments have to be read with observations made in chapter 2 on
rates and chapter 4 on threshold.

Comments on Specific Exemptions in Vietnam

a. Products of cultivation and husbandry; cultured and fished aquatic and marine products, which have
not yet been processed into other products.

b. Products being animal breeds or plant varieties, including eggs, breeds, saplings, seeds, sperms, germs
and genetic materials at the stages of culture.

         Comment: Normally it is advisable to exempt small farmers from VAT but not all farmers. In
fact, producers over a certain turnover find it in their interest to remain part of the VAT system so that
they can claim refund of taxes paid on their input and the price of their output is not higher than other
producers.

        When a threshold is introduced for VAT exemption, small farmers may become automatically
exempted while bigger producers remain part of the VAT and thus there may not be any need for this
category of exemption. An issue has also been raised about “Products of cultivation, husbandry,
aquaculture, seafood and fisheries which have not yet been processed into other products or which
have only been subject to conventional preliminary treatment by organizations and individuals in the
stages of production, catching, sale and import.”

         Several authorities, businesses, especially the Vietnamese Customs and domestic agricultural
producers complain about the difficulties in determining “preliminary treatment”. For example: cooked
fish vs raw fish, spiced fish vs un-spiced fish; frozen cut chicken; etc. The provision leads to complexity
and difficulties due to inconsistency in implementation between companies and tax authorities as well as
between different authorities (tax offices, customs offices).

         The solution to this problem is to remove the exemption and rely on the threshold. However,
given that the middle rate of 5% should also be eliminated as we recommend, this category then becomes
taxable at the rate of 10%. The second best solution to restrict the exemption to a few specific items can
work in two circumstances: (1) Once we have a single positive rate and a good threshold and (2) A clearly
defined VAT tariff nomenclature aligned to the HSN on the Customs side (relying on the accompanying
explanatory notes). Disputes of this kind can be minimized, even if not completely eliminated even if the
exemption continues or is limited to a few items. The general principle is that all exemptions are to be
interpreted strictly; normally the onus of proving that they are entitled to a reduction in duty is on the
assesse, not revenue authorities. This issue has been discussed in detail in the chapter on treatment of
agriculture.

c. Irrigation and drainage; soil ploughing and harrowing; dredging of intra-field canals and ditches for
agricultural production; services of harvesting farm produce.

        Comment: The question is who distributes irrigation water and provides drainage facilities. If it
is public sector agency, exemption is okay otherwise it should be subject to normal VAT. VAT Law


                                                   165
defines that dredging inland canal activities are not subject to VAT. However, according to several tax
departments, agricultural technical services for "dredging inland canals" are difficult to determine because
the Irrigation Law only classifies inland canals by their levels (level 1 to level 4 or 5, depending on each
period) or the main canal, sub-canals etc.; the Irrigation Law does not define the term "inland".
Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether to collect or not to collect VAT on canal dredging activities.
Again, if the government provides the service it can be exempted, there is no real benefit to exempt a
private provider.

d. Salt products made from seawater, natural rock salt, refined salt, iodized salt. Here the government
intends to insert a qualifier in the new VAT law that restricts the exemption to salt products whose main
component is the chemical formula NaCl.

        Comment: It is important to know the nature of the industry: is it organized and formal or small
and totally informal? If it is organized, there is no particular need for exemption. If it is small and
informal, the introduction of exemption threshold should solve the problem. The restriction (Na Cl)is
useful if there are many classification disputes over the use of the word “salt” and will limit loss of
revenue in this category, this restriction already exists at the decree level.

e. State-owned dwelling houses sold by the State to current tenants.

        Comment: State owned dwellings sold to private individuals should be treated the same way as
sale of other buildings. If, however, the sale to current tenants is part of a privatization move and VAT
exemption is a sort of incentive to promote that policy, the current practice may continue as long as the
government wishes to provide a temporary boost to a slumped real estate market. The selling, renting and
leasing of social residential houses has now been placed at the 5% rate. It is recommended again that all
new construction be treated evenly as discussed below.

f. Transfer of land use right.

         Comment: Land use is subject to “Land Use Right Transfer Tax” but the rates are quite low and
vary between 2 to 4 percent. Either that rate should be revised or normal VAT may apply to this transfer.
This issue has been discussed in more detail above in this chapter as well as in the chapter on treatment of
special entities.

g. Credit services and investment funds, including capital lending activities; loan guarantee; discount of
negotiable instruments and valuable papers. Here the government proposes to add a provision to charge
VAT on sales of defaulters assets used as security and forfeited by lenders and several other financial
transactions involving foreign exchange and debt.

h. Life insurance; insurance for school pupils; insurance for domestic animals and cultivation plants, and
non-commercial insurance. Here the government proposes to add to the scope of insurance by including
“insurance of ships and boats and other equipment and tools directly used in fishery and re-insurance.”

        Comment: These two belong to the normal category of financial services and should remain VAT
exempt. The forfeiture of pledged assets is meant to help creditors recover their loans and help the credit
market function smoothly. There should be independent regulations to prevent profit-making by lenders


                                                    166
when they sell assets to recover money lent. The VAT can be charged on the amounts of sale in excess of
the recoverable amount (and regulations should determine what should be done with the remaining
surplus) but to charge VAT on amounts below the amount owed to the lender will only raise the lending
margin and quantum of lending in the long run by imposing a further cost on the lender.

        Regarding the addition made for fisherman insurance, it is acceptable in order to encourage
working in the sea. As long as it is confined to exempting the insurance only that is fine, and the
exemption should not be extended to recreational boats and luxury/leisure craft. Rather, the government
can follow the approach to exempt all insurance and reinsurance activities rather than list them
individually as this will reduce disputes and minimize costs.

i. Medical examination and treatment, healthcare services, and veterinary services.

        Comment: This exemption is quite open ended and technically even cosmetic surgery would be
VAT exempt. A line has to be drawn somewhere clearly specifying which categories of health and
veterinary services will remain exempt (limited exemption of health and education services has been
discussed above). It may be a better approach to exempt specific categories of medicines rather than for
profit medical services by doctors and nursing homes.

j. Post, telecommunication and Internet services universalized by Government programs.

        Comment: If it is publicly funded it is okay but not if the private sector is involved.

k. Public services of sanitation and water drainage; maintenance of zoos, flower gardens, parks, street
greenery and public lighting; funeral services. The government proposes to remove the category of
Public services of sanitation and water drainage in streets and residential areas from this category in the
new VAT law.

        Comment: This category may remain VAT exempt if all the activities are strictly non-commercial
in nature. An issue has arisen recently since many businesses have been involved in providing public
services on sanitation, lighting or services having similar characteristics such as house cleaning, office
cleaning, there is no basis to distinguish them and it is difficult to identify the concept of “public”, leading
to problems due to different interpretations of the concept of "public". It may be better to stick to the
principle of “commercial” rather than public – is the service provider undertaking an activity for
commercial profit based on the fee charged? If yes, they should be taxed regardless of whether the service
is meant for the public or privately provided.

l. Maintenance, repair and construction of cultural, art and public welfare works infrastructure and houses
of gratitude.

         Comment: Purely artistic, cultural and charitable services may remain VAT exempt but why
exempt maintenance of these services? Who will be exempt? – The contractor? If so then one has to split
inputs that go into these services versus other maintenance activities. It is better to make all these taxable,
and include a provision that really non-commercial forms of artistic activities may be tax exempt, not
maintenance.



                                                     167
m. Teaching and job-training activities.

      Comment: Commercial and job training should be subject to VAT, only Public Education should
be VAT exempt.

n. Radio and television broadcasting under programs financed by the State budget.

       Comment: This is again quite open ended. Advertising services should be taxed both in public
and commercial radio and TV.

o. Publication, import and distribution of newspapers, magazines, textbooks, course books, political,
scientific and technical books, legal documents, propaganda materials in any media, money printing.
Here the government proposes to add the category “money” in the new VAT law.

        Comment: Any distinction between domestic production and imports ends up providing negative
protection to domestic industries. So this may be dropped. However, if some categories of books are
deemed important, they may be considered for zero-rating. The addition of “money” is made to clarify
that money (notes and coins) is not subject to value added tax levy to remove obstacles in the importing
and exporting processes, and this is a good idea.

p. Public transportation by bus or tramcar.

        Comment: At present, there is no public transportation by tram. Also public transportation by bus
is no longer a field of no profit, or low profit, or in need of Government’s subsidies to encourage people
to use. People choose their public transportations by convenience and ticket prices. Currently, many
companies participate in public transportation by bus by forming business cooperatives for profit purpose.
In some provinces, there has been the phenomenon that inter-provincial, inter-district transportation
businesses take advantage of bus transportation which is not subject to VAT to gain profit. Also taxi
associations have suggested listing taxi activities under public transport operations because they are
transporting millions of people each year and have petitioned the Government for taxi association’s
equality under tax law like other forms of transportation. Again, the same principles apply. Subject to
the threshold, any for-profit activity that charges a commercial price should be taxed, especially luxury
services such as air-conditioned limousines etc.

q. Equipment, machinery, supplies and transport means which cannot be produced at home and needs to
be imported for direct use in scientific research and technological development activities; aircraft, drilling
platforms and ships hired from foreign countries used in production and trading, which cannot be
produced at home; equipment, machinery, spare parts, special-use transport means and supplies, which
cannot be produced at home and need to be imported for activities of prospecting and developing oil and
gas fields.

        Comment: Instead of exempting such imports, a policy of deferment may be a preferred option
where VAT payment on capital imports is deferred until VAT input deductions are claimed. Thus these
capital inputs become subject to the normal VAT and subsequent refund or reimbursement without
affecting the VAT chain in any way.



                                                    168
r. Special-purpose weapons and military equipment for security and defense purposes.

        Comment: The question is what is VAT exempt – production of all such weapons or
production/purchase by military or for military use only? The purchase by military should be VAT
exempt but if production and sale is being done by the private sector they should pay VAT on their input
purchases.

s. Goods imported in the following cases: humanitarian aid and non-refundable aid goods; gifts for State
agencies, political organizations, socio-political organizations. Goods sold to international organizations
and foreigners for humanitarian and non-refundable aid to Vietnam.

         Comment: These two categories are okay. The administrative issue is that these items should not
find their way to the private markets.

t. Goods which are transshipped; transited or transported through Vietnam.

        Comment: This category is redundant because VAT only applies if imported for home use.

u. Technology transfer under the Law on Technology Transfer; transfer of intellectual property rights
under the Law on Intellectual Property; computer software.

        Comment: Some more information is needed on this category. It is not clear what is exempt –
royalty paid for these transfers, some form of fees, or something else?

v. Gold imported in the form of bars or ingots which have not yet been processed into fine-art articles,
jewelries or other products.

         Comment: question is why special treatment to gold? The exemption of this category is not
justified, particularly exempting only imported gold creates negative protection for the domestic industry.
This is also discussed further in the chapter on treatment of special sectors.

w. Artificial products used for substitution of diseased people’s organs; crutches, wheelchairs and other
tools used exclusively for the disabled;

        Comment: This being for medical, functional purposes is okay. There are several opinions on
determining the replacement parts such as time, function, and purpose. Recently, cosmetic surgery is
becoming more popular along with the use of materials such as breast implant. If tax authorities only
consider the criteria on replacement function and not on medical materials, the breast implant will be
considered non-taxable artificial products; but if they do consider the medical materials criteria, breast
implant will be taxable. Or kidney purifier, although only used once in a very short time the majority
opinion among the public as well as tax authorities is that this product is an artificial product. However,
there are also some opinions that in terms of time a kidney purifier only operates for a few hours and
cannot meet the replacement requirement, thus is subject to VAT.




                                                   169
x. Exported products which are unprocessed mined resources or minerals as prescribed by the
Government. Here the government proposes to substitute “into other products” in place of “as prescribed
by the government” in the new law.

        Comment: There is no need for this category of exemption because this should be covered by
normal zero-rating of all exports. Is this provision somehow supposed to override normal zero-rating
provision?

        Clause 23, Article 5 of the Law on VAT defines: “Export products being exploited natural
resources and mined minerals which have not yet been processed as stipulated in regulations of the
Government” non-taxable for VAT to limit their exportation because their export value is low, and their
exportation businesses do not create many domestic jobs, and create social and or environmental
tensions. Actually, it is very hard to determine what unprocessed natural resources are, leading to
complexity, inconvenience, and inconsistency between businesses and tax authorities as well as between
different authorities. A typical example is some types of stone (cut or split, crushed or otherwise) or some
types of enriched ore such as copper; iron; gold etc.

         Products that are unprocessed natural resources are unique products, being regulated under the
Minerals Law. The Law on VAT does not define specifically that issue but does give the Government
authority to guide, leading to inconvenience on implementation, causing a delay in the application of law,
and affecting the rights of the tax payers under VAT. On the other hand, this is also an export and should
be subject to 0% VAT like other goods; and other regulatory issues should not be included in the VAT
Law but be included in others legal documents, policies, or in the Law on Export. This issue is also
somewhat spurious. If the government’s policy is to encourage all exports, the government can remove
this item from the exempted list and place it under the zero-rated list, as it should all exports of goods and
services. if the government does not want to promote exports of raw and unprocessed materials, it can
keep it under the exempted category, transferring the onus on the exporter to prove that the item is
adequately processed to claim export refund. This is an effective way to discourage exports of low value
added raw materials.

y. Goods and services of business individuals who have a monthly income lower than the common
minimum salary level applicable to domestic organizations and enterprises. The government proposes to
replace the income criterion by “the monthly turnovers at or under 100 million dongs”.

         Comment: The determining criteria for an individual business that does not have to pay VAT is
based on the minimum wage applicable to businesses and not based on business revenue; thus the criteria
is inconsistent with the nature of VAT that is an indirect taxes imposed on goods and services and also
making the implementation difficult and complicated for both the taxpayers and the tax authority. When
added to the fact that there are two different methods for charging VAT as well, it makes the system
unnecessarily complicated. The idea of using a turnover threshold is a good one. This issue is discussed
in detail in the next chapter and recommendations provided.




                                                    170
                         Chapter IV: VAT Threshold

1. Tax Exempt Threshold for Small Traders

         Currently, there is no threshold based on turnover for exempting small producers and traders from
the VAT net. That means everyone is subject to VAT with the exception of exemptions granted. To deal
with the problem of small businesses that cannot maintain records, provision has been made to apply the
subtraction method of VAT calculation. This has also been extended to Gold, Silver and Gems trading
activities and specified foreign organizations and individuals conducting business without a resident
establishment. Those businesses that can keep sales invoices but not input invoices and for those who
cannot keep either of those two sets of invoices, the subtraction method of computation is used based on
sales invoices or declared sales turnover and deemed markup as a proxy for input costs. The only
exemption provided is based on the income for those small businesses whose monthly income is below
the minimum public sector wage.

         This practice of keeping zero thresholds and applying subtraction method on small traders clearly
increases the cost of administration without commensurate yield in revenues. A common characteristic of
VAT in most countries is that the bulk of revenues – 80 per cent to 90 per cent - come from relatively
small proportion – 10 per cent to 20 per cent - of VAT payers. Thus the situation is more skewed towards
very small number of VAT payers paying almost the entire tax revenues while the tax administration has
to spend substantial resources to collect very small amount of revenues from large number of small VAT
traders.

         There are about 550,000 business entities declaring and paying VAT by the tax credit method in
Vietnam. One third of them are small and very small businesses making less than 1 billion VND in
sales/turnover a year contributing about 0.3% of total VAT revenue. For most small and very small
businesses, their accounting is not organized well enough to ensure compliance with the Law on
Accounting, and a lot of these businesses lack the ability and willingness to comply with the regulations
of law for the declaration and payment of VAT. A few businesses even take advantage of the favorable
conditions for the company establishment process to establish businesses to trade VAT invoices or issue
fake VAT invoices for other businesses to deduct input VAT, leading to deterioration of the business
environment as well as losses to the Government’s revenues. The tax management has been costly and
inefficient due to the absence of a threshold. About 70% -80% of the management costs is for 20 % of
VAT revenue whereas only 20% -30% of the administrative costs is for 80% of VAT revenue.

        Household businesses currently are allowed to select the tax credit method if they comply
accurately with regulations for accounting books, invoices, and receipts. The result of tax inspection
reveals that nearly all of household businesses cannot meet the above requirements. Therefore, the
regulation on allowing businesses to select the tax computation method has not been effective in ensuring
compliance with accounting procedures.

        This, therefore, calls for introduction of a tax exempt threshold in order to lower the burden on
the tax department and also on the small VAT payers. This will clearly break the VAT chain and create


                                                  171
some degree of cascading. Thus it may place those small VAT payers at a disadvantage who transact
with bigger taxable enterprises. To mitigate this adverse impact, the option for voluntary registration
should be available to the exempt VAT payers as well.

         What would be the desirable threshold for Vietnam? Universally there is a great variation in the
threshold level across countries. The exemption levels vary considerably in the neighborhood of Vietnam
as well. For instance, the threshold in Philippines is US$14,100 while the threshold in Singapore is
US$709,200. Cambodia has a threshold of US$62,652 for services and US$125,304 for goods, Indonesia
has a threshold of US$15,300 and Thailand US$56,250.

        The level of threshold for Vietnam should be chosen so that it eliminates bulk of those small
VAT payers who do not make substantial contribution to revenues while imposing a large administrative
cost. This requires a revenue estimation exercise to determine the most suitable threshold level.

        Most countries start with a high threshold and gradually lower it. In case of Vietnam, the
threshold has been virtually zero and this approach cannot be applied in the future. It is, however possible
to examine, with the help of econometric modeling, several alternative thresholds in terms of their
revenue implications and the resulting number of taxpayers. The one which is found to be most
appropriate and cost effective should be selected.

2. Taxing The “Below Threshold Traders”

        Vietnam is currently considering two thresholds. The first or “lower” threshold of 100 million
VND of annual turnover will serve as a minimum turnover level below which businesses will not have to
pay any VAT. The “upper” threshold of 1000 million VND will serve as the cut-off for implementing the
credit invoice method. Firms between the two thresholds will be required to pay VAT using the
subtraction method or simply on turnover, including all individual and household enterprises.

         The taxpayers below the “upper” threshold would be VAT exempt in terms of applying the credit
invoice system but some sort of taxation can be provided for them. Many countries have opted for a
turnover tax of 2-3 per cent which is then tax deductible by the next registered buyer. It may be
mentioned that there will still be a category of very small businesses that cannot be subjected to even this
turnover tax because the revenues from them may not be adequate to cover even the costs of
administering them. It may also be mentioned that no distinction should be made between types of VAT
entities in applying the threshold if a single threshold is chosen. It should not matter if the taxpayer is an
Enterprise or a household business, only turnover is considered.

        If a business below the threshold wants to register under the credit-invoice VAT, it has to comply
with the VAT documentation and accounting regulations. Any firms and household units regardless of
size should be allowed to register and operate under the credit-invoice system if they want to, subject to
maintenance of proper records and following applicable laws and procedures. The proposed VAT law
has deleted the clause “and register to pay tax according to the tax credit method” under the paragraph
that regulates who should avail of the credit-invoice method. Under the proposed law, corporate
businesses that fully satisfy accounting and book-keeping regulations and have turnover above 1 billion
VND and others who voluntarily register and meet the accounting criterion can use the credit invoice



                                                    172
system, except households who use the turnover method, while gold, gems etc. use the subtraction
method. Other businesses who are above the 100 million VND limit but do not qualify/opt for the credit
method would pay tax on the percentage (%) of turnover.

         At present, the VAT law provides two options for payment of VAT for firms that do not avail the
credit-invoice method.

Option 1: Collect on The Income Ratio (%) Added Value on Turnover

         This option has the advantage of being consistent with the current Law on VAT and consistent
with the current method applied by household businesses and small and very small business. However,
the drawback of this method is the determination of the added value can be very complex because the
value added depends on the characteristics of each sector and business area. The current rate schedule by
% of added value applied on turnover by the Ministry of Finance (The General Department of Taxation)
is divided into 5 regions and 19 industry groups (making up 95 division of the percentage rates in the
schedule), and the rate is specified by Tax Department for each division of schedule. Therefore, to
simplify the procedures and meet the requirements for modernization of tax administration, there is a need
to eliminate this method of calculating VAT, which is used very rarely around the world mostly to tax
sectors like banking and finance which we have recommended to keep out of the VAT net anyway. There
is no real need to retain this method for just one sector.

Option 2: Collect on The Percentage (%) of Turnover.

         The second option has the advantage of being simple, clear, and easy to implement for the tax
authorities and taxpayers. Compared to the first option, the second option does not require taxpayers to
calculate the added value; which is in line with international practice that has been adopted by many
countries in the world. At the same time, following the second option may cause some uncertainty about
the tax obligations for a number of taxpayers, especially for the taxpayers who are currently paying taxes
on the added value. Therefore the answer is to introduce this method for all firms between 100 million
and 1000 million annual turnover (with the option for firms to choose the credit invoice method and
comply with accounting regulations), and eliminate the subtraction (or direct) method, while ensuring that
turnover is the only criteria for selection, not the type of business. The draft law has proposed to do this,
while unfortunately retaining the heading for the section consistent with the old subtraction method for
gold and precious stones.

        At present Vietnam is considering a threshold of 100 Million Dong for absolute exemption from
VAT, and a range of 100 million Dongs (approximately US$ 5000) to 1000 million Dongs
(approximately US $ 50,000) to keep traders and businesses out of the credit-invoice system. In our
opinion, the absolute threshold should be chosen first, below which there is no taxation. The absolute and
intermediate thresholds should be chosen subject to the revenue forecasting exercise and for firms within
the two thresholds, a simple turnover tax of 2-3% on sales should be applied. Whether the turnover tax is
to be made creditable or not depends on the rate chosen and the overall revenue implications that will
emerge from the revenue estimation. When below threshold sellers sell to final consumers or other
exempt sellers the credit of presumptive tax paid cannot be used, but it may well make a difference when
small sellers sell inputs to large purchasers registered under the credit invoice system. Unlike what is



                                                    173
being proposed, a flat rate should be used rather than multiple rates for different activities which will give
rise to classification disputes and raise administrative costs. Since we are simultaneously proposing a
single positive VAT rate for the credit invoice system, the choice of a single rate for the presumptive tax
will minimize distortions.

         This “presumptive” tax should not be linked to PIT or CIT since all enterprises are required to
pay CIT regardless of size while household enterprises are not required to pay CIT. All income earners
regardless of whether income is from dividends, corporate capital gains or household businesses are
normally required to pay income tax in most countries. Thus, a turnover based “presumptive tax” has no
connection with CIT which is a tax based on choice of business structure. We can think of it as an extra
tax for limited liability due to incorporation. The issue of CIT plus PIT on the same income can be sorted
out through tax integration measures. The presumptive tax can be thought of as a substitute for PIT and
VAT for any small business unit, regardless of whether household or enterprise, but it then becomes
possible for the shareholder of a small enterprise to be taxed thrice: for PIT through turnover, for CIT, and
then again through PIT on dividends and capital gains!

3. VAT Calculation Methods

         Both the credit - invoice method (called the method of tax deduction), and the subtraction method
(referred to as the direct calculation method) have been adopted for calculating the VAT liability under
the present law. As explained above, the subtraction or direct calculation method is applied to those
individuals and small traders doing business who fail to fully implement regulations on accounting,
invoices, and vouchers to serve as bases for tax calculation under this method and is proposed to include
gold, silver and precious stones and some foreign agents.

        Once a suitable threshold for exempting small traders is chosen and implemented, the dual
computing system may be abolished and only the credit or tax deduction method should remain
applicable. All businesses above 1000 million VND in turnover should be forced to comply with the
accounting and bookkeeping regulations regardless of whether they are enterprises or household
businesses and use the credit-invoice system. Businesses below 100 million VND need not pay VAT.
The rest can either pay the presumptive tax, or voluntarily register for the credit-invoice system subject to
approval after they comply with accounting regulations.

        With the implementation of the threshold, taxpayers whose turnover for a year or 12 consecutive
months is higher than the upper threshold will file and pay tax by the tax credit method, and taxpayers
whose turnover is below the upper threshold but above the lower threshold will pay VAT according to the
percentage of sales. The regulation and the classification will help taxpayers, especially small taxpayers
(including small businesses, very small businesses, household businesses, and individuals), saving time
on tax procedures and reducing expenses for small taxpayers and the tax administration.

       In Vietnam the number of businesses with a turnover of 0.5 billion / year or less accounted for
27.7% of the number of firms and contributed 0.1% of total value added tax; businesses with turnover
below 1 billion / year accounting for about 30% of firms contributed 0.3% of total VAT revenue.




                                                    174
        Around 30% of businesses and 80% of household businesses have turnover under 1 billion
VND/year, around 35% of businesses and 85% household businesses have turnover under 2 billion
VND/year. If all these businesses are simply exempted, the GDT would potentially not lose more than
0.3% revenue at current rates and the savings on administrative and compliance costs would be huge,
even if no presumptive tax is imposed. In fact, if the rates are rationalized to one single rate around 10-
12% on the remaining firms, a lot of these below threshold firms would pay final VAT on their inputs and
would not be able to issue VAT invoices, so total revenue could go up with all changes in place and total
costs would go down substantially! The control of the GDT over the remaining firms would go up
considerably since they will be able to free up more resources for effective audit.

         In case that business turnover is volatile, to ensure stability, businesses will be required to apply a
stable tax calculation method (the tax credit method or the presumptive method for VAT) in the next
fiscal year or 12 months.

        In case that a business has both taxable and excluded or exempt goods and services then only the
turnover from the sales of taxable goods and services is used to determine the business turnover for the
threshold purpose.

        For the newly established businesses, the taxpayers choose one of the two options on taxation or
can voluntarily register for the tax credit method. If, at any time during the year, any business exceeds
any of the two thresholds, they must register immediately in the appropriate category, maintain prescribed
records and start collecting and paying the appropriate VAT.

            Chapter V: VAT Treatment of Agriculture

        The treatment of agriculture under the VAT is quite varied around the world ranging from full
taxation to outright zero-rating or exemption. In Vietnam, different agricultural products are subject to
different types of tax treatment.

1. VAT Law 2008

Article 5.- Non-Taxable Objects

        1. Cultivation and husbandry products, and reared and fished aquatic products which have not
        yet been processed into other products or have been just preliminarily processed and sold by
        producing and fishing organizations and individuals, and products at the stage of importation.

Article 8.- Tax Rates

        2. The tax rate of 5% applies to the following goods and services:

        e/ Unprocessed cultivation, husbandry and fishery products, except products specified in Clause
        1, Article 5 of this Law;

        g/ Fresh and live food; unprocessed forest products, except timber, bamboo shoots and products
        specified in Clause 1, Article 5 of this Law;

2. Issues

         In many cases, it is very hard to determine whether agricultural products have been processed into
other products or have just been preliminarily processed (such as in the cases of rubber, rubber latex,
marinated and spiced seafood, husbandry products, raw lumber for making paper, etc.), leading to
difficulties for businesses, tax authorities, auditing authorities, and inspection authorities. Sometimes tax
authorities and businesses judge the appropriate classification based more on opinion than on rational
criteria. In some cases, policy makers have hard time determining whether the products have been
completely processed. There have been many cases where businesses have been denied their tax refunds
and charged fees although they have completely complied with the accounting principles and correctly
declared their tax liability as well as consulting relevant authorities in advance and not intending to
violate any tax rule.

        This can be dealt with by linking the exemptions to a VAT tariff aligned to the HSN. The HSN
and explanatory notes considerably reduce uncertainty of classification. Similarly, if the suggestion to
impose customs duty on these products at importation is followed, the HSN is used directly. Alignment
of the VAT tariff with HSN reduces disputes between different authorities. In general, exemptions and
other duty reliefs are always interpreted strictly to protect revenue. This means that for charging duty, the




                                                    176
onus is on the tax authority to demonstrate that duty is due, but for any reduction in duty or refund, the
onus is on the person claiming the relief to demonstrate that they are eligible for the relief.

         The Law on VAT defines that unprocessed agricultural products sold directly by domestic
producers and at the import stage are non-taxable under VAT. This ensures equality between imported
goods and domestic goods, and conforms to WTO regulations. The fact that tax authorities do not charge
and collect VAT on unprocessed agricultural products or preliminarily processed products at the import
stage creates favorable conditions for the importation of agricultural products. Recently, low labor
productivity along with high input prices has led to higher domestic production cost. The price of
agricultural products imported into the Vietnamese territory does not include VAT (foreign companies
selling agricultural products in Vietnam not only pay 0% VAT on exports but also receive a full refund of
creditable VAT input in most countries).

         On the other hand, domestic producers of agricultural products cannot deduct VAT input; thus
their price will include VAT on inputs for the reason that agricultural products are not subject to VAT.
Therefore the price of agricultural products sold by domestic producers may be higher than the price of
imported agricultural products (assuming that both products bear the same costs and profits).

         The Law on VAT defines that unprocessed or preliminarily processed agricultural products are
not subject to VAT at the import stage and are subject to a VAT rate of 5% at the trade stage. In fact,
there are frauds created by a number of importation businesses dealing with agricultural products by (1)
creating businesses to import agricultural products and then dissolving these businesses and (2)
continuing that methodology in other provinces, (3) making purchases among these businesses, and not
legally declaring and paying VAT at the stage of importation for unprocessed agricultural products. Tax
authorities have not had any effective solution to investigate these cases, resulting in big losses to the
Government’s revenues. This is similar in some respects to “carousel” fraud cases that have been found
in the EU as well.

3. Recommendations

Recommendation 1: Remove the regulation that agricultural products are not subject to VAT at the stage
of direct sales of domestic production and importation. This brings imports and domestic producers
under the VAT net and they can claim input credit as well.

        Therefore, there is a need to amend the Law on VAT by removing the Clause 1 Article 5.

        Implementing this solution helps to fix the loophole in management policies and limits tax
evasion that affects the domestic agricultural sector. However, there is a need for a careful consideration
of impacts before implementing this solution for the following reasons:

        a. The household producers (currently there are more than 11 million households) would have to
        declare and pay VAT on their agricultural products sold as well. In the current socio-economic
        conditions and even for later years, the policy may not be feasible because: (i) it directly impacts
        the lives of farmers and (ii) the tax authorities do not have enough infrastructure and manpower to
        manage these household producers.



                                                   177
        b. Most domestic agricultural products that have not been processed into other products are basic
        consumer goods for majority of the population, are sold through street markets and vendors. The
        collection of VAT whether in the form of deduction method or direct method will affect food
        prices and income for the majority of these low-income earners if they are brought into the tax
        net.

        To limit the effects mentioned above, there is a need to consider another provision to ensure that
not only farmers and small businesses do not have to declare and pay VAT but also the non-
discrimination principle of the World Trade Organization is not violated. A threshold is required for
domestic VAT.

        Clause 25 Article 5 the Law on VAT defines objects not subject to VAT “Goods and services of
business individuals being people with an average monthly income lower than the minimum wage
applicable to domestic organizations and enterprises.”

        Under the above regulation, the majority of farmers and small businesses still fall under VAT and
the major producers including the farms will have to declare and pay tax if direct sales are not exempted.

        However, the government is proposing to implement a threshold system in place of the above
provision that should exclude most such small farmers and street vendors or have them liable to a
simplified presumptive tax on turnover. So that issue does not arise in the proposed law.

         There will still be large farmers and traders who will fall under the tax regime in this system and
thus there will be a need to train the large producers so they can comply with accounting principles, keep
invoices and receipts for VAT payment. Taxing the big producers actually does not affect the market
much because theoretically the prices of goods of these major producers and farms are generally lower
than that of small household businesses due to their higher productivity; and if they are large enough they
will get credit of input taxes.

         However, that will still mean that large farmers will be brought under the VAT net and so will
food in general when sold through large establishments and when imported, and this might be unpopular
politically. Since it is also being recommended that the 5% rate be eliminated this makes exemption all
the more valuable; otherwise the tax rate jumps from tax only on inputs or 5% on value added to 10% on
value added. If the exemption is removed and the 5% rate eliminated, all food domestic or imported,
produced or sold is taxable at the single rate.

Recommendation 2: Put a limitation on the number of agricultural products that have not been processed
into other products or preliminarily processed and is not subject to VAT at the stage of production or
importation and tax the rest.

          The principle limits the basic exempted agricultural products for consumption to those that need
not be imported or imported in very small volume, including goods that Vietnam has trade surplus such
as: rice, coffee, soybeans, seafood, etc.

        There will be some difficulties in the implementation of the policy as listed below:



                                                   178
        a. The policy cannot cover all farmers and household businesses (small ones will be exempt
        anyway under the threshold, but imports will not be, but some large farmers and traders will now
        be taxable) thus some of them will have to pay VAT on their goods sold, creating an issue with
        respect to equity.

        b. There is also a risk that this may violate WTO principles of non-discrimination.

       This policy is not recommended on grounds of horizontal equity. Further, with elimination of the
5% category, items that are taxed will be taxable at 10% and not 5%, while many are exempt due to the
exempted category and the threshold. This obviously has the potential to increase inequity.

Recommendation 3: Impose a Customs duty (not VAT) at WTO approved rates on imported food that is
not creditable in the VAT chain. This would cancel the benefit to importers of not having to bear input
VAT duty on the imported goods, while domestic farmers still continue to be out of the tax net. The
customs duty is collected at the border, so it also solves the problem of disappearing firms and gives some
protection to small farmers with higher costs of production. Since there is no threshold for customs duty,
all imports regardless of size have to pay the duty.

        However, for domestic traders of imported or domestically produced food, there is a plan to
introduce a threshold, and this will give VAT relief to small businesses. Direct sellers of domestic
produce (farmers etc.) continue to be exempt. There is also no violation of equal treatment under the
VAT if a customs duty is imposed. However, with the elimination of the 5% category, traders above the
threshold will now pay 10%.

        Currently, the value of importation of imported agricultural products by household businesses and
individuals is not high and most of these imported agricultural products are imported from countries
having common borders with Vietnam. These can be dealt with through border trade rules and land
customs stations.

        For exported agricultural products, the current law extends zero rating to all exported products,
including exempted ones. So any exporter regardless of size can claim refund of input credit on export.
In case small exporters find it difficult to comply with accounting rules to claim input credit, duty
drawback rates based on value and volume can be considered to reimburse input duties. Further issues
regarding exports are dealt with in the chapter on export treatment under VAT

         In general, the regulation on not collecting VAT on the “products that have not yet been
processed into other products or which have only been subject to conventional preliminary
treatment/semi-processed by organizations and individuals in the stages of production, catching, sale and
import” has some shortcomings. There is a need to correct these anomalies and make the provision
consistent with Vietnam’s commitment to its WTO obligations and its desire to keep small farmers and
sellers of basic agricultural produce out of the VAT net.

        We have recommended that the list of exemptions be limited as far as possible. The elimination
of the middle VAT rate, the introduction of generous thresholds and strictly restricting the exemptions to
food and agriculture are all connected with this issue. Our first recommendation is to eliminate the
exemption as well as the 5% rate. We then rely on the threshold for equity and there is no discrimination


                                                   179
between domestic agriculture and imports, and between domestic producers and traders. The second best
solution, recognizing the political nature of food is to severely limit the exemption to basic food items
only relying on HSN style tariff headings, or imposing a customs duty on all imports of food etc, while
maintaining the current exemption, and allowing the 5% rate to be eliminated and the threshold to be
introduced.

                           Chapter VI: VAT Refunds


         The present rules on VAT refund in Vietnam are complicated and vary with the nature and
activity of a particular business.

        (i)      For businesses operating under the deduction method excess tax on inputs is not refunded
        unless it is carried forward for three months.

        (ii)    For exporting businesses, cumulative total excess input tax refund in excess of 200
        million dongs is refundable in the current period.

        (iii)    In case of businesses that have undertaken investment for more than a year but have not
        been able to deduct input credits completely, cumulative excess input tax is refunded annually
        unless it exceeds 200 million dongs in which case it is refunded quarterly. If, however, the
        business investment is new, refunds are made on a quarterly basis in case the cumulative excess
        input tax is less than 200 million dongs, and immediately if over 200 million. Thus a different set
        of rules is applicable in case of VAT refund on different companies.

I. The Draft Law Proposes The Following Changes to Article 13 Governing Refunds:
    1. Substitutes the phrase “If having the input value added tax not fully deducted for the month or
quarter in case of quarterly declaration, the amount will be deducted in the following period; in case of
tax credit accumulation after at least twelve months from the first month or after at least four quarter from
the first quarter of having un-deducted input value added tax, the remaining amount of un-deducted input
value added tax can be refunded” in place of “shall be able to claim value added tax refunds if in three
continuous months, the input value added tax exceeds the output value added tax.”
       The only sensible interpretation of this change is that it increases the time for claiming refund
from 3 months to 1 year on inputs!
  2. Raising the threshold for claiming refund in case of new investment and exports to 500 million
VND from 200 million VND.
    3. Inserts the terms quarter after month to bring it in line with existing legislation that allows SMEs
to choose to file quarterly.
   4. Non-residents have been allowed refunds of VAT when carrying duty paid goods out of the
country; diplomats have been allowed this facility within the country.
    5. Projects carried out using ODA, grants and humanitarian aid have been extended the benefits of
refund in varying degrees which is already provided for in regulations and decrees.

        As mentioned above, excess input tax should be preferably refunded fully after each tax period
which happens to be quarterly in case of Vietnam. This is, however, not feasible in many developing
countries with limited administrative capacity. The carry forward system is mainly advocated as a



                                                    181
safeguard against fraud but that can be really caught only with a quick and effective audit system. Thus
one main area of weakness in refunds could be the lack of effective and prompt auditing capacity. So the
long term solution is strengthening administration and acquisition of audit capacity.

        In case of Vietnam, however, some other complications related to VAT refund need to be
remedied. There is no justification for distinguishing between the VAT refunds on capital goods versus
VAT refund on other inputs. A carry forward period of three months may be applied to every business
and a threshold for obtaining the current period refunds may also be fixed but it should not be excessive
and should remain uniform across different businesses. This would render the system simpler and more
transparent.

        All new businesses must be audited for a couple of years before getting refund to make sure it is a
genuine unit and not a scam. Otherwise, a new unit may come up and claim a lot of refund based on false
invoices and then disappear. Old and well established units are less likely to commit fraud.

         To deal with the concerns of investors about late refund, some countries have adopted the practice
of allowing deferment of VAT payments on specific capital imports until VAT input deductions are
claimed. This approach requires effective customs control and coordination between customs and
domestic VAT administration. Vietnam exempts import of capital goods which cannot be produced
domestically. This clause may be replaced by a deferment provision. In case such capital goods are also
produced at home, however, this may place the domestic capital equipment producers at a disadvantage.
Sometimes, zero-rating of capital equipment items has been tried in some countries but this may result in
a net revenue loss to the extent that capital equipment is used by unregistered businesses as well.

II. Justification Given for The Proposed Changes

        1. The limit of 200 Mil VND for creditable input VAT for investment projects and exports has
been constant since 2000 in the VAT regulations. After 12 years of inflation the CPI Index in 2011 is
253.5 compared to the base in 2000 at 100. The purchasing power of 200 Mil VND value in 2000 equals
that of 500 Mil VND in 2011. Because of inflation, the purchasing power of 200 Mil VND value has
gone down drastically and the number of tax return filers has gone up leading to higher administration
costs.

        2. Business establishments paying tax under the tax deduction method are eligible for VAT
refund if their input VAT is not completely deducted in 3 consecutive months or more. This regulation
has led to an increase in VAT refunds, putting a strain on the VAT Refund Fund. Due to the short
waiting time of three months, the time available to the authorities for inspection and audit is not enough
and some tax payers are taking advantage of the situation to establish businesses where it is easy to
accumulate claims for tax refund. The capacity of the tax authorities for inspection and audit is limited,
leading to losses in tax revenue.

        3. Tax refund for tourists:

       Clause 1, Article 8, the Law on VAT No 13/2008/QH12: The tax rate of zero (0) percent shall
apply to exported goods and services, international transportation, and to goods and services
which are not subject to VAT regulated in Article 5 of this Law which are exported…”.


                                                   182
        In order to stimulate tourism and exports, the Prime Minister issued the Decision No
05/2012/QD-TTg dated 19/01/2012 on the pilot implementation of a scheme of refunding VAT on goods
bought in Vietnam by foreign tourists when the tourists leave the country. The policy has been adopted
and implemented by a number of countries such as Singapore, Thailand, etc. in order to attract tourists to
buy more goods in-country. The policy has been effective since 01/7/2012 to 30/6/2014. To date, there
are 43 businesses in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City registered to sell goods and products to foreign tourists.

        Article 13 of the Law on VAT has not yet regulated specifically refunds for foreign tourists.

        4. Tax refund for ODA-funded projects and Beneficiaries of diplomatic privileges or immunities:
Article 13 of the Law on VAT does not contain provisions for refunds for ODA-funded projects and
beneficiaries of diplomatic privileges or immunities, but these regulations already exist in decrees.

III. Comments

    1. Raise the threshold for refund to 500 million VND from 200 million VND except for exporters
and large investors to take care of inflation.
    2. Add the regulations proposed for VAT refunds to foreign tourists and non-residents and
diplomats.
    3. Add the regulations for VAT refund to ODA-funded projects etc.
     4. Allow exporters and investment projects shorter time periods to claim refunds. A waiting period
of 1 year is too long. The standard default period for refund claims should be at most 3 months if the
refund amount is below 500 million VND. Allow all exporters who export more than a certain percentage
of their output to claim refunds monthly based on their return filing frequency even if it is below the
threshold of 500 million, and extend a similar benefit to large investors based on a transparent ratio
criterion. There should be no distinction between input and investment credit as recommended above. To
prevent fraud based on input claims by disappearing companies, such new companies that claim large
refunds from new investment should be audited to make sure they are genuine. The solution lies in
increasing audit and enforcement capacity, not to delay refunds by a year by default which imposes a real
cost of capital on businesses and is not likely to encourage exporters or investors.

             Chapter VII: VAT Treatment of Exports

        VAT using the destination principle requires taxation at the place of consumption or use, rather
than at point of origin or production. This is implemented by applying the same VAT at the border to
imports as is applied to goods manufactured domestically, and zero rating exports. Vietnam strives to do
so in most cases and is conscious of its obligation under WTO to treat imports and domestically produced
goods fairly under the VAT. This issue has also been discussed in the context of agricultural products in
the relevant chapter. An exception to this rule is the exemption to the import of gold that is exclusively
imported by the government agencies.

        The regulations governing imports and exports in the VAT Law 2008 are as follows.

Article 8. Tax Rates

         The tax rate of 0% applies to exported goods and services, international transportation and goods
and services not liable to value-added tax specified in Article 5 of this Law upon exportation, except cases
of transfer of technologies or intellectual property rights abroad; offshore reinsurance services; credit
provision, capital transfer and derivative financial services; post and telecommunications services; and
exported products which are unprocessed mined resources and minerals specified in Clause 23, Article 5
of this Law.

Comment: Some confusion exists with respect to the exemptions in this clause of some services and
unprocessed mineral resources from the application of zero rating on export. These items are otherwise
non-taxable under article 5 or exempt as discussed in the chapter on exemptions. The same article 8 says
in clause 3 that goods not zero rated or subject to the 5% rate are to be taxed at 10%, leading to the
conclusion that they may be considered taxable at 10% when exported(since they are denied zero rating)
unless they are treated as exempt. However, in practice, notwithstanding this minor legal point that may
potentially be misinterpreted; these goods are treated as exempt goods on export as well as domestic
consumption. This also means that they are in effect being taxed to the extent that input and/or
investment input VAT is not being refunded on export.

         The issue regarding exports of exhaustible natural resources has been discussed in the relevant
chapter on exemptions, while the issue of exemption to services involves a few more points that we shall
discuss below. Notwithstanding those points discussed individually, in general it is recommended that all
exports be zero-rated. There is no need to list the specific goods and services granted zero rating, it is
better to zero rate all goods and services and explicitly deny zero-rating to or tax the chosen few. If the
government wants to discourage export of low value added natural resources, it can continue to deny zero
rating to these items and for services. Some additional regulations are recommended below.

       Further, Circular No. 06 /2012/TT-BTC of January 11, 2012, guiding the implementation of a
number of articles of the Value-Added Tax Law and guiding the implementation of the Decree No.
123/2008/ND-CP of December 8, 2008 and the Decree No. 121/2011/ND-CP of December 27, 2011, lists
a few more provisions that regulate zero rating and exports. They include need for written service


                                                   184
contracts and bank payment in specified cases as well as adherence to import and export procedures in
others. This circular also increases the list of items denied zero rating on export by including the face
value of mobile phone cards including calling cards, services of certain kinds provided in non-tariff zones
etc.

         Next, an amendment is proposed to amend article 8(1) to clarify that exported goods to which the
0% rate applies consist of “Exported goods and services that are consumed outside Vietnam, in the non -
tariff zones, and in some cases provided to foreign customers in accordance with the Government’s
regulations.” It also ensures that non-residents and tourists can claim refund of VAT when they leave the
country with duty-paid VAT purchased in Vietnam (as is the practice in many developed countries such
as the UK). Further, the proposed amendment leaves it to the government to decide what items may be
provided to “foreign customers” at zero rate. When coupled with the idea discussed above of the implicit
taxation of exported services, it seems that the definition of exports subject to zero rating needs to be
refined further.

        There is no real problem with the definition of export of goods, and denial of zero rating to any
goods is a matter of government policy. As stated earlier, the normal policy is to extend zero rating to
goods exported out of the domestic tariff area. The issue of zero rating exports of services is however an
area that is still a “work in progress” and can be debated further.

         To apply the destination principle, we should be zero rating services when exported. However,
this gives rise to a host of issues, especially when the service can be delivered over the internet. For
example, the determining criterion of whether the services claiming the zero rates are consumed in
foreign countries or not is satisfied; but the criterion of whether these services’ buyers are foreigners
without permanent establishment in Vietnam cannot be satisfied. With economic development and
international integration, more and more Vietnamese businesses are getting involved in the provision of
goods and services beyond Vietnam. For example:

    (a) Vietnamese businesses buy and sell goods that do not transit through Vietnamese territory.
        Piaggio Vietnam trades in the Asia region (buying bikes from Italy for distribution to other Asian
        countries); the services of trading are rendered entirely abroad, to foreign consumers by a
        Vietnamese entity.
    (b) Vietnamese taxpayers provide services in foreign countries or in both international and domestic
        market for Vietnamese customers, including survey, design, construction supervision and the
        performing arts. Services provided to a Vietnamese taxpayer abroad would not qualify for zero
        rating.
    (c) Vietnamese businesses engage in construction internationally and perform installation for
        Vietnamese businesses or for foreign organizations and individuals, such as construction projects
        in Laos, Cambodia, Congo, Burma etc. They could be hit by either the Vietnamese entity
        restriction or the permanent establishment in Vietnam restriction.

        VAT (in theory, especially if intended to be a destination based, consumption type VAT) is a tax
on the consumption of goods and services in Vietnam. The determination of the place where these
services are consumed can be based on general criteria such as location (the headquarters of the supplier),




                                                   185
the location of the property (for real estate), place of residence of the consumer, and place where service
is consumed (eg. for fine arts performances).

         Different types of services have different specific criteria to determine the point of sale of the
service. For example, for services such as performing arts, sports, entertainment, education, food, the
determination based on the service suppliers’ headquarters location will be inconsistent with the principle
of VAT destination rule, therefore these services need to be taxed by their actual consumption location
(inside or outside the Vietnamese territory) for tax liability calculation. For services related to real estate
(such as repair, construction, supervision, valuing of real estate, leasing hotels, halls), their place of
supply should be based on the real estate’s location. For intangible services such as consultants, brokers,
etc. the criteria for determining consumer location services should be based on residence of the buyers.

         In some countries, the concept of export of services is determined only by the customers’ location
at the time of issuing the VAT invoice. For instance: according to regulation No 9 of the European
Commission: “exported service are determined if the buyers are in a foreign country.” This regulation
does not mention whether and where these services are consumed and the reason for their consumption.

         According to international practice, exported services are defined by whether the consumption is
located in a foreign country, including the domestically produced services consumed in a foreign country,
such as cross-border services (TV, network service). China applies a VAT rate of 0% for research and
development and design activities provided to overseas entities; Indonesia imposes tax rate of 0% on
repair and maintenance services related to the goods other than real estate not consumed in the "customs
territory" of Indonesia and for construction activities (including planning, design, construction,
supervision and counseling services) if the services are tied to real estate inside the “customs territory” of
Indonesia. Services on repair and maintenance of aircraft, ships, machinery, and equipment for overseas
customers are also subjected to 0% VAT rate by a number of countries (Indonesia, Thailand, Russia, etc.).

        To summarize, it is increasingly conventional to have a set of rules and regulations to define the
“point of sale” of services or the place of supply. The present EU regulations adopt the destination
principle for services within the EU, but apply the origin principle to sales of service to entities outside
the EU. While the general principle of zero rating exports of goods and services is re-iterated, it is also
recommended to have a clear set of rules to define the conditions for zero rating of services based on the
place of supply or the ‘point of sale”. Rather than excluding specific services from zero rating, and taxing
them as exempt services on export, it may be a better idea to zero rate all services that are exported in
accordance with a set of rules and regulations defining the place of service. Countries in the region have
already issued such rules (Singapore and India) and the OECD is in the process of preparing a set of
guidelines that the government may like to consider.

     Chapter VIII: VAT Treatment of Special Sectors,
             Taxable Value and Deductions

1. VAT Policies for Real Estate (Transfers of Land or Transfers of Land Use Rights and Structure
   on or Associated with the Land)

VAT Law 2008 has the following provisions in this regard.

Article 5.- Non-taxable objects

        5. State-owned residential houses sold by the State to current tenants;

        6. Transfer of land use rights;

Article 7.-

        Taxable price for real estate trading, the taxable price is the real estate-selling price exclusive of
value-added tax, excluding the charge for transferring land use rights or the land rent remittable into the
state budget.

         In Circular No. 06 /2012/TT-BTC of January 11, 2012, guiding the implementation of a number
of articles of the Value-Added Tax Law and guiding the implementation of the Decree No. 123/2008/ND-
CP of December 8, 2008 and the Decree No. 121/2011/ND-CP of December 27, 2011 of the government:

        Taxable prices for real estate business, taxable prices are real estate transfer prices minus (-) land
prices deducted for VAT calculation.

        a) Land prices deducted for VAT calculation are prescribed as follows:

                a.1) For land allocated by the State to invest in infrastructure of houses for sales, land
                prices deducted for VAT calculation includes land levies payable to the State budget (not
                including exempted or reduced land levies) and compensations for land clearance as
                prescribed by law.

                a.2) For State-owned land use right auctions, land prices deducted for VAT calculation
                are auction winning prices;

                a.3) For land lease to construct infrastructure, houses for sale, land prices deducted for
                VAT calculation are the land rents payable to the State budget (not including the
                exempted/reduced land rents) and the compensations for land clearance as prescribed by
                law.




                                                    187
                 a.4) For business establishments receiving land use right transfer from organizations,
                 individuals, land prices deducted for VAT calculation are land prices at the time of land
                 use right transfer including the value of infrastructure (if any); business establishments
                 are not eligible for deductions of input VAT of the infrastructure calculated in the
                 deducted VAT-exclusive value of rights to use land. If it is not able to determine land
                 prices at the time of transfer, land prices deducted for VAT calculation are land prices
                 prescribed by People’s Committees of central-affiliated cities and provinces at the time of
                 signing the transfer contract.

                 a.5) For real estate establishments conducting business in the form of build-transfer (BT)
                 and exchanging works for lands, land prices deducted for VAT calculation are prices at
                 the time of signing the BT contract as prescribed by law.

         b) For construction and trade of infrastructure, building houses for sale, for transfer or for lease,
         prices for VAT calculation are the collected amounts by the progress of the project or the
         progress of money collection specified in the contracts.

Article 21.- Effect

        2. For real estate transfer contracts signed from January 1, 2009 until March 01, 2012, the first
payment date is January 1, 2009 and made before March 01, 2012, if the collected amount is not lower
than 20% of the total contract value, the deductible land prices are still applied in accordance with the
Circular No. 129/2008/TT-BTC of December 26, 2008 and guiding documents of the Ministry of
Finance.

        For real estate transfer contracts signed before March 01, 2009, but the first payment is after
March 1, 2012 or the collected amount before March 01, 2012 is lower than 20% of the total contract
value, the deductible land prices are applied in accordance with the Government’s Decree No .
121/2011/ND-CP and the guidance in this Circular.

Issues

        These have been discussed at length in the chapter on exemptions. Almost all the issues arise
because the sale etc. of real estate is taxable, but land is exempted as is the sale of state owned dwelling
houses to current tenants. The problem of allocation of land value to real estate is further complicated in
the case of sale of high rise apartment buildings. The main points discussed in chapter 3 on exemptions
are summarized below:

    1. Tax real estate at the point of first sale – new residential or business construction at market price.
    2. Allow credit of input VAT both to the seller (if he is registered to pay VAT under credit invoice)
       and to buyers of new construction for business use if they are also registered large taxpayers
       under credit invoice. Exempt buyers like households would either bear the tax on purchase of a
       new home, or bear at least the tax on inputs.
    3. Allow a “homestead exemption” (to borrow a term from property taxation) – a fixed percentage
       of total sale value of the property as a consideration for the current exemption of land.


                                                     188
    4. Since we plan to have only one positive VAT rate, this allows us to avoid having a special rate for
       real estate, and will end all disputes about what proportion of the real estate sale price is due to
       land.
    5. Avoid taxing subsequent resale of real estate.
    6. Avoid taxing rentals and leasing.
    7. Bring sales of government housing to existing private tenants under the VAT unless this is a
       privatization or welfare related move that is temporarily needed to boost a flagging real estate
       market. If there is a real estate bubble, the real estate VAT acts as an “automatic stabilizer” and
       yields substantial revenue to the government.

2. VAT Policies for Gems and Jewelry

        - At the importation stage: Article 5 the Law on VAT of 2008 defines "Gold imported in bar and
        foil which has not yet been processed into fine art articles, jewelry and other products" is not
        subject to VAT.

        - Gold jewelry, other products made of imported gold are charged 10% VAT.

        In domestic market: According to the current regulation the purchase, sale, and manipulation of
gold are taxed by the direct method for VAT, and the VAT liability is the difference between the selling
price minus (-) the cost of goods sold times (x) the rate of 10%.

         The exemption given to imported gold while gold purchased domestically remains subject to
taxation provides negative protection to the domestic gold industry. In the proposed draft VAT law, the
government plans to retain both the exemption to imported gold as well as the method of subtraction for
calculating VAT for gold, silver and precious stones industry.

Comment: The exemption for gold imports is justified by pointing out that it is a monopoly of the central
bank. If that is really the case, it makes no difference if it is taxed on import or not. Presumably, VAT is
applied whenever imported gold is re-sold to any private person since the central bank obviously is not
part of the industry that uses gold in bar or foils form to produce any other goods (except perhaps as
content in coins) for sale. If VAT is applicable whenever imported or any other gold is sold within the
country by any taxable entity above the threshold (under the proposed VAT law); gold becomes similar to
any other commodity that can be taxed using the credit-invoice system. However, the fact that gold is
exempted on import and untaxed small private sellers of gold do not generate VAT input credit for buyers
is given as the rationale for retaining the subtraction method for the gold and gems industry.

          This does not appear to be a tenable reason to keep the third method of calculating the VAT (the
subtraction method) in the law just for one industry. The real reason appears to be that under a credit
invoice system, many businesses will have input credit invoices while some will not, hence the tax
liability will be different for different businesses with the same net of tax input and output prices. Hence
the subtraction method avoids the problem of missing input tax invoices. This is again no different from
any other commodity that has exempt sellers. That is insufficient ground to retain the third method of
calculating VAT for just this sector.



                                                   189
3. VAT Taxable Value (Taxable Price)

         Article 7 of the VAT law regulates the price on which the output VAT is levied. In general, the
transaction value is used and the attempt is to use the actual selling price exclusive of VAT and interest,
but including other levies (such as special consumption tax which is an excise tax), in domestic currency
as the basis for calculating VAT. The article separately specifies the price in cases of imported goods,
goods and services sold by production and trading entities, goods and services used for internal exchanges
or consumption, donation and gifts, asset leasing, installment payment methods, out-sourcing of goods,
construction and installment, real estate businesses, trading agents and brokers and invoices with the
value added tax inclusive prices.

        There are two types of amendments proposed to this article (1) to include the “environmental
protection tax” in the base for VAT and (2) to delete a section deducting the lease prices paid to the
foreign partners in the case where imported machinery that could not be produced at home was leased.

Comment: Since import duties are included in taxable value for imported goods as is the special
consumption tax (an excise) where applicable, another excise – type tax like the environmental tax should
also be included.

        Regarding the removal of the a section deducting the lease prices paid to the foreign partners in
the case where imported machinery that could not be produced at home was leased – this provision
obviously has no place in the law since there is no similar deduction of the price paid in full in the case of
import on full payment. If this provision stays it would give a clear incentive to lease rather than
purchase such machinery.

4. VAT Deductions

Issues

         The current Law on VAT defines the general principles on deducting input VAT. However, these
principles are quite loose and abused in VAT deduction process. Many businesses purchase items and
incur expenses such as telephones for executives and entertainment that benefit employees rather than
serve as inputs in production. When these taxable expenditures are incurred in the company’s name, they
are able to then avail the input credit through the VAT invoice.

        One general principle of input value-added tax credit stated in VAT Law is: “Input value-added
tax on goods or services used for the production or trading of goods or services subject to value-added tax
may be wholly credited”.

        But there is also special regulation stated in the VAT Law: The input value-added tax on fixed
assets used for the production and trading of goods or services both subject and not subject to value-added
tax may be wholly credited. There is a difference in the treatment of input credit and investment input
VAT. The VAT Law has also not specified how to determine creditable input value-added tax amounts in
the case when taxpayers have input value-added tax used for the production and trading of goods or
services both subject to value added tax and not subject to value-added tax and cannot account for them
separately. However such a proviso exists in decrees.


                                                    190
        About the time for deduction of input VAT, point d, Clause 1, Article 12 of the Law on VAT
defines: Upon determination of the tax payable for a month, input VAT arising during such month shall
be declared and credited. Any business establishment which discovers that an amount of input VAT
declared and credited was erroneous shall be permitted to conduct a supplementary declaration and
amend the declaration within a time-limit of a maximum of six months after the date of discovery of the
error.

        The current law has a provision that allows taxpayers up to 6 months to file a revised declaration
supplementing or correcting the monthly input VAT claim otherwise required. While under claiming
input VAT deduction is obviously detrimental to the taxpayer (since the government has already received
the input VAT), erroneous over or incorrect claims benefit the taxpayer.

        Therefore, the 6 months provision hurts genuine claimants who cannot claim input VAT for any
reason within 6 months, while it benefits taxpayers who erroneously claim input credit refunds not due if
the mistake is detected by audit within 6 months. In the latter case, they may be able to claim that they
would have filed a revised declaration within 6 months and escape penalties.

        Recently, there have been many businesses that cannot declare and deduct their input VAT within
six months of discovering missing claims or erroneous under-claims that they have due to the following
reasons: newly established businesses whose accounting departments are still not well versed in
accounting for VAT, changes in personnel, lost records due to relocation, sellers have not issued VAT
invoices because they have not collected their payments, etc.

        For business goods and services that have been lost without compensation: In the production
process, there are risks of losses due to unavoidable reasons such as natural disasters, fires, accidents and
destruction of goods for quality reasons (especially food). For these losses, the Law on VAT of 2008 has
not specified what can be done about the deduction of input VAT on goods and services that are lost
without compensation. Thus, if the input VAT of these lost goods and services is not deductible, business
will be in a position where they are unable to recover the VAT paid on lost or destroyed goods.
Currently, the Decree 121/ND-CP permits businesses to avail of the input VAT credit on taxable goods
and services (inputs) lost or destroyed.

         Regarding the phrase "payment via a bank or banking payment": The Law on VAT 2008 requires
a bank payment receipt to deduct input VAT on individual payments over 20 million VND. However,
there are many methods of payment through a third party that does not involve a bank or payment in cash,
for example payment through credit cards.

        To resolve these issues, the following amendments are proposed to article 12 in the draft VAT
law:

     Including the input value added tax on uncompensated losses of value added taxable goods in
      deductible input credit.
        This is a good idea; to ensure that this provision is not misused by unscrupulous taxpayers by
        regularly claiming deduction on lost goods without proper evidence (perhaps by buying/forging




                                                    191
    VAT invoices), the tax authorities may insist on time bound audit in these cases and maintenance
    of proper evidence (e.g. insurance documents in case of accidents).
 Deleting the provision allowing investment input credit for all capital goods even in cases where
  some goods produced are taxable and some are not and adding a provision to apportion input
  credit based on separate accounting for such classes of goods, failing which the input credit is to
  be apportioned by percentage of turnover of taxable and non-taxable output. These provisions
  already existed in decrees outside the law.
    This is also recommended. It has been stressed in the chapter on refunds that there is no basis for
    treating VAT on inputs differently from VAT on investment goods. It is also a good idea to
    introduce a clear and simple rule to apportion credit in cases of taxable and non-taxable goods.
    The onus is now on the taxpayer to account for input use properly if he feels the ratio is
    detrimental to him.
 Inserts a provision to fully deduct the input value added tax of the goods and services used for oil
  and gas field exploration and development.
    This provision already exists in decrees outside the law. Presumably, this provision means to
    provide some sort of benefit (a parallel to immediate expensing in the CIT to such companies),
    and in any case should be allowed.
 Replacing the time limit of 6 months to file supplementary declarations in cases of missing or
  erroneous claims of input VAT credit with the phrase “before the tax authorities make decisions
  on tax inspection and audit at the headquarters of the taxpayers.” This brings the provision in line
  with Item 1, Article 38 of the Tax Administration Law. It also allows genuine payments of input
  credit to be recovered even after 6 months and should also allow erroneous claims discovered
  during an audit before 6 months to be penalized.
 Replaces the term “bank transaction” with “non-cash” where it occurs in this section, thus turning
  “bank transaction payment” into “non-cash payment”.
    This is also recommended since payments can be both non-cash and not made through a bank in
    modern commerce. The basic purpose of this measure however should be remembered for VAT
    purposes: to ensure that there is independent third party evidence that the VAT invoice (thus the
    initial taxable event and payment for input VAT, and subsequently the validity of the input tax
    credit claim) is genuine. This has actually been done by other, more effective means in some
    countries such as Korea, where all VAT invoices are issued by the government through software
    installed on all the registered taxpayers’ cash machines.

                          Chapter IX: VAT - Revenue

1. Introduction

         The value-added tax has increasingly been adopted by countries around the world. Governments
in developing countries have replaced turnover taxes, sales taxes, and some excise taxes as well as import
duties with the consumption-type VAT. The main argument for doing so is based on the fact that VAT is
a stable source of revenue. It allows an efficient tax collection at multiple stages of production and
distribution of goods and services, and minimizes the cascading effect from taxes on inputs of businesses
which also pay taxes on sales.

        There is a considerable uncertainty and concern regarding the impact of a VAT and changes to its
structure on revenue collection. Particularly, the input tax credit under the VAT system, while necessary
to avoid the tax cascading effect, makes the estimation of the tax base rather complicated. Thus, the
estimation of VAT base and potential revenue is of significant importance to policy makers.

         The most prevalent VAT system is a consumption-type multi-stage sales tax based on the
destination principle. The VAT is typically assessed using the credit-invoice method where each firm
charges tax on its sales and receives credits for tax paid on its inputs. The VAT based on the destination
principle aims at taxing sales of goods and services for the domestic market, regardless of whether they
are produced domestically or abroad. This type of VAT is essentially equivalent to the single-stage
domestic retail sales tax on final consumption, but administered differently.

        The potential VAT revenue depends on whether it is origin- or destination-based, the method of
assessment (credit-invoice or subtraction), the scope of exemptions and zero-rating, the level of tax rates,
and the degree of tax compliance. Exemption means no VAT on sales and no credit is provided for the
taxes paid on inputs. No VAT also applies on zero rating, but the business receives full credit for the
taxes on inputs.

        Vietnam has a destination type; consumption based VAT using the credit invoice method for
enterprises and has proposed the turnover based presumptive tax on household businesses.

2. Different Methods of Estimating VAT Revenue

         Generally, there are three methods that can be used to estimate the VAT base and its
corresponding revenues. These methods assume a consumption-type multi-stage VAT based on the
destination principle. They also assume a credit-invoice mechanism for assessing the VAT.

         Aggregate (National Accounts) Method. The aggregate method follows one of two
          alternative approaches: (i) production and (ii) consumption. The production method starts
          with the GDP. To arrive at the value-added included in the VAT base, the GDP needs to be
          adjusted for imports, zero rating, exemptions, and turnover threshold. Since the VAT is




                                                   193
          ultimately paid by consumers, the consumption method starts with final consumption and
          adjusts for zero-rated and exempt goods and services to estimate the VAT base.
         Disaggregate Method.          The disaggregate method also could follow production or
          consumption approach. This method requires detailed breakdown of the National Accounts
          and Input-Output (I-O) Tables, and also information from other sources, such as household
          expenditure and industrial surveys to estimate the impact of exemptions and zero rating. The
          production approach computes the tax base by adding up the value added of each industrial
          sector in the economy to provide the tax base by sector. The consumption approach uses the
          final selling price of all goods and services purchased by final consumers and exempt sectors
          in the economy. This approach would automatically capture the destination principle of the
          VAT since the value purchased by final consumers excludes exports and includes imports.
          Moreover, it allows for an analysis of the incidence and price impact of the VAT on
          consumers.
         Microsimulation (Tax Returns) Method - VAT returns databases ideally provide detailed
          information on accrued domestic and import VAT liabilities and credits, as well as actual
          collections, refund payments, and assessment adjustments. Detailed information on imports,
          and the duty and VAT charged on these imports, provide a strong starting point for estimating
          VAT revenues.

        For VAT revenue estimation in Vietnam, we have used the production approach and used the
aggregate model supplemented partly with available data from the I-O table. Due to incompleteness of
data made available to us, the use of the consumption approach was not feasible. Data required for micro-
simulation models (consolidated VAT returns in electronic format-either a stratified sample or all returns
for any recent year) are not available. The I-O table also aggregates categories of government
consumption spending and aggregates all capital formation (private, government and change in
inventories). This rules out the use of the full disaggregated model as we would require isolation of
government expenditure on different goods and services, separation of capital formation into private,
government and change in inventories for each sector separately to the extent possible. A brief
description of the methodology of the production approach we actually use is as follows.

3. Production Approach

        For the production approach, the value added of all exempt goods and services and exempt
imports must be subtracted from the GDP, while exempt investment expenditures and exempt exports as
well as intermediate sales of exempt goods to taxed sectors must be added back to the estimation of the
VAT base.

        We start with the definition of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) = Consumption (C) + Investment
(I) + Government expenditure (G) + Exports (X) – Imports (M), and recognize the both consumption (C)
and Investment (I) can be either private or by government. Using subscript (p) for private, we can re-
write GDP = Cp+ Ip + G + X – M recognizing that G covers all government expenditure including current
as well as capital expenditure. In the case of a consumption-type VAT, the base (B) can be estimated by
subtracting exports and adding imports to reflect the domestic consumption following the destination
principle. The base should also be reduced by the amount of gross fixed capital formation since
businesses receive input tax credit for their capital investment. If sales of new houses are subject to VAT,


                                                   194
            residential constructions (Ih), which is part of the gross fixed capital formation, must be added back to the
            tax base as consumers cannot claim input tax credits. Since residential construction in the national
            accounts does not include the land value and Vietnam also does not tax land value under VAT, Ih need not
            be adjusted.

                     The total government expenditures (G) is equal to expenditures on wages and salaries (Gw) plus
            consumption of final goods and services (Gc) purchased from the private sector. Gw is not a part of the
            base since VAT is not imposed on wages, but the Gc is potentially includable as long as it is not exempt
            or zero rated. Thus we arrive at the VAT base using the production approach:

                     BaseP = GDP – Gw – VAexempt – Ip + Ih + Ip,exempt –X + Xexempt + M – Mexempt + ISexempt,taxed

                     Where VAexempt, Ip,exempt, Xexempt, and Mexempt denote exempt domestic production (including
            exempt exports and retail traders), taxed capital formation in exempt sectors, exempt exports, and exempt
            imports purchased directly by households, government or exempt traders, respectively. Xexempt could be
            exports of exempt goods or exports done by unregistered traders. Investment expenditure of exempt
            sectors must be added to the VAT base since these sectors do not receive input tax credits. ISexempt,taxed is
            the total sales value - not the value added - of intermediate sales of exempt goods to the taxed sectors.
            The table below provides a detailed framework for making necessary adjustments to GDP to arrive at a
            tax base of a destination-based, consumption-type VAT implemented with a credit-invoice method using
            the production approach.

            4. VAT System Proposed for Vietnam and Parameters for Modeling

                     In the current study, we have outlined a proposed system for Vietnam in the previous chapters.
            The salient features of this system are summarized below and contrasted with the system accepted by the
            National Assembly (NA) after recent amendments. Since the models are based on the proposed system, it
            is useful to contrast the two approaches before we discuss the impact on revenue.

                 A credit invoice based consumption type VAT has been proposed for all enterprises except
                  household businesses (HHBs), with a turnover based threshold. The optimal threshold is
                  normally suggested based on a model for determining that threshold which balances the loss of
                  revenue with the savings in compliance and administrative costs. This exercise is presented at the
                  end of this chapter, while the NA has accepted two thresholds already – (1) 100 million VND
                  below which there will be no requirement to pay VAT (2) 1000 million VND above which there


                                                             196
    will be a requirement for all enterprises to maintain accounts, register for an invoice credit system
    and collect and pay VAT based on the difference between input VAT paid and output VAT
    liability. Household businesses, it is understood will pay taxes through the presumptive tax
    unless they register as Enterprises. Since they will then also be liable to pay CIT, it is assumed
    that they are unlikely to do so unless they lose a lot of VAT input credit. We have thus presented
    2 models – one in which our suggestion of a uniform threshold for all businesses is followed and
    presumptive tax is charged on all businesses between 100 and 1000 million VND and the second
    where it is assumed that all household businesses pay presumptive tax. We had also
    recommended a flat presumptive tax on sales at 2-3% while the proposed system retains separate
    rates for categories of taxpayers. Land value is still not included in the value of the VAT base for
    construction sales, but is taxed separately under a different tax at a lower rate.

    We have proposed a single positive VAT rate of 10% (up to 12% if necessary), on all taxable
    goods and services not otherwise exempted or zero rated. However, the 5% rate has been
    retained in the new law. We had also proposed this VAT rate (10%) should be extended to new
    sales of construction including land value which was not accepted.

 We had proposed that all exports should be zero rated and the only exemptions should be on
  clean water and financial services and all goods and services provided publicly on non-
  commercial basis. This has been partially done since most financial services are exempted
  (including on export) and most exports are zero-rated other than some exempt exports. We have
  taken the category “real estate” to be completely exempt. There are already two categories of
  “civil construction” and “other construction” and we have taken part of the value of civil
  construction to be new residential construction taxable under the VAT at 10% excluding land
  value since land value is not included in the proposed law. A separate category called “real estate
  services and business” also exists and it has been taken as taxable at 10% . Therefore, since we
  are not recommending taxation of rents of any kind (as imputed rent of owners is not taxable), in
  the absence of information on what constitutes “real estate” or “real estate services” which is
  either consumed by households or is exported, we have treated it as an exempt sector.

 Therefore for modeling purposes we have started with the base case of a uniform 10% VAT
  imposed on credit invoice basis for all activity with turnover above 1000 million VND, a 2.5%
  turnover tax on all turnover between 100 and 1000 million VND, complete exemption for water
  and financial services (domestic sales as well as exports) and 50% exemption for sectors such as:

            -    Health medicine
            -    Health instrument and apparatus
            -    Products of printing activities
            -    Products of publishing house
            -    Science and technology
            -    Education and training
            -    Health care, social relief



                                                   197
                -    Culture and sport
                -    Association
                -    Other services

        Association and other services are undefined. For the others it is expected that the government is
the producer of at least half of the value. These assumptions can of course be refined when more accurate
information is available than at present. The ratio of exemption and the choice of fully or partially
exempt sectors can be varied in the model.

        To take care of the taxation of HHBs under the presumptive system the next variation we have
introduced is to model the same system as in the baseline case with 90% of the base where the 10%
represents household businesses that are taxed on turnover. The 10% was arbitrarily chosen due to lack
of information on the output of these firms and could also be modified. A sensitivity analysis can be done
on this presumed share of household businesses once we have more information. We separately model
the output under thresholds as enterprises between the upper and lower thresholds in both the baseline
model as well as the model with HHBs removed.

5. Modeling Steps

         The basis for the model was the last available Input Output table of 2005 that was available. This
model listed GDP by production approach as VND million 839,310,059 and GDP by expenditure
approach as 839,310,061million VND at producers prices in 2005. An estimate for the 2010 figure for
GDP was found to be 1,980,914,000 million VND and was used to age the table to 2010. Further, for the
presumptive tax model we needed to subtract the output of the 5 largest firms in each sector to estimate
the output above and below the proposed thresholds. Since this data (extracted from 2010 enterprise
survey) was available to us with a modified set of sectors (based on industrial classification 2007 codes),
we had to further collapse the aged I-O table to match the output data for large enterprises from the 2010
enterprise survey. This inflated and collapsed I-O table for 2010 served as the basis for simulations. The
results for the baseline case where all output is taxed at 10% except zero rated exports and exemptions
listed above are reported in the table next page.

         Since change in inventories is not available, only positive GFCF of 3,624,203 is added as GFCF
in exempt sectors and the negative figure of 8,094,097 is not used. The VAT/GDP ratio in 2011 is around
7.8% for Vietnam. Given that there are 2 rates of 5% and 10% (and the total rate is a weighted average of
the two) the C-efficiency ratio for Vietnam in the same year has been calculated at 1.09 (IMF 2012). This
implies that Vietnam raises at least 10% more revenue than is implied by applying the weighted average
tax rate to all consumption. Normally, the difference between the tax rate applied to the calculated base
and actual revenues is taken as a measure of the compliance rate. In this case, adding 10% of the
calculated VAT to the estimate (as implied by a C-efficiency ratio of almost 110%) would also give us the
actual revenue in 2010. This can be explained in two ways: (1) the I-O table figures are not reliable and
are a serious underestimate of GDP; (2) due to the numerous exemptions, collection of VAT by the
subtraction method and turnover taxes etc., Vietnam collects more VAT than is warranted by the level of
consumption. The answer is that both are probably true, and has also been suggested in an earlier report
(Haughton, 2012).

         The next form of simulation is to try and incorporate the choice made by the NA to keep
household businesses regardless of size out of the purview of the invoice credit system and tax them on a
presumptive basis on turnover. This poses two sets of issues: (1) what is the total turnover of these units
for the purpose of the presumptive tax; and (2) how does removal of these firms from the invoice credit
system affect the I-O table itself – in terms of both inputs and outputs. It is obvious that this requires
sector by sector information on both the outputs of household businesses as well as their inputs. Such
information was not available and we had to proceed on the basis of an overall assumption. To continue
the modeling process we assumed that 10% of all value added was accounted for by household enterprises
that will remain out of the credit invoice system and be taxed on turnover. This ratio was also assumed to
be uniform across all sectors to begin with in the absence of any other information. The I-O table was
then reduced on both the input as well as the output side by a uniform 10%. These assumptions can of
course be modified with better information – not only can the 10% ratio be changed; we can also change
the uniform 10% assumption. A sensitivity analysis on this model can provide VAT revenues for
different assumptions.

         Next, the reduced I-O table with 90% was used to repeat the estimation procedure above. The
difference in the total output of the two I-O tables for each column was added to the turnover to be taxed
on a presumptive basis. This provides an estimate of what would happen if we continue with the ideal
system proposed and then introduce modifications proposed by the NA. To repeat, the rate of adjustment
for the output of HHBs, the exempt sectors, proportions for partially exempt sectors, and the rates of
presumptive taxation can all be varied in this model with better information. The results presented here
are valid for the assumptions we have made at present.

         A further note of caution is warranted about the threshold modeling that determines the value
added of output below the threshold (deducted from the base in adjustment of G). The data used for this
adjustment is from the Enterprise survey and does not include HHBs. This means that the number of
firms is undercounted and that average output of firms is overstated after the top 5 enterprises are
removed. This reduced the value added below the threshold and thus overstates the VAT base in the
baseline case. It however does not do so in the simulation case since HHBs are not included. To
maintain consistency the first two tables - the baseline case and first simulation with no HHBs have been
calculated using the threshold model and the Enterprise data for the baseline case only, and the simulation
takes value added under threshold at 90% of the baseline case and calculates the presumptive tax using a
similar procedure for turnover in addition to the difference in gross output from the two models. Another
table is presented (the second simulation) that uses the threshold model in the reduced I-O table since it is
correct to use number of enterprises when we have removed the output attributed to HHBs.

        Another note of caution is posed with respect to producers prices. The I-O table of 2005 is
available at producer’s prices and these do not include wholesale and retai l margins that are normally
taxable. Had we been estimating the base from the consumption side directly using the actual I-O table of
2010 we would have had to make an adjustment for wholesale and retail margins. We have not done so
for two reasons in the inflated table:

        (1) The GDP figure used to inflate the 2005 I-O table is not assumed to be at producer prices and
        thus would have taken care of this adjustment since the adjustment factor would be higher than in
        the case 2010 GDP was at producer’s prices as well.

        (2) It is not clear whether the category “trade” includes undistributed wholesale and retail
        margins. Since we are using gross value added to estimate the base, and the Gross Value Added
        (GVA) of the sector “trade” is also included, adding trade margins again would be double
        counting if this category already includes undistributed retail and wholesale margins. However
        this is unspecified and if the I-O table is at producer’s prices, pure wholesale and retail margins
        should not have been included in other columns since the trade column is not zero. When the
        trade column is at zero, the table is taken to be at purchaser’s prices. Moreover, under the
        household consumption column, the 2010 table shows household consumption of “trade” of
        66,890,846 VND and this should indeed be the relevant trade margins that are undistributed, but
        recorded as a separate activity.

         The last simulation model is presented on the next page that differs in only one way from the first
simulation model on the previous page. The threshold model is applied to the reduced I-O table to
determine the presumptive tax as well as value added of below threshold business. Since the reduced I-O
table already excludes the output of HHBs, it is correct to estimate turnover above threshold by using the
number of firms from the enterprise survey since only enterprises should be left. This second simulation
repeats the procedure in the baseline case for estimating both the presumptive tax as well as the value
added of firms below the threshold. Since the number of firms is underestimated in the baseline case (as
HHBs are not recorded) the average output in the baseline case is inflated using this procedure.. This is
corrected in the second simulation and the average turnover falls, and the value added below threshold as
well as the presumptive tax increases. However, the differences in total revenue between the three tables
are negligible and so are the differences between the two simulations.

6. Comparative Results and Some Issues


        Comparing the two sets of results (the baseline case with HHBs included with the same models
but excluding HHBs) shows that the effect on revenue is negligible, a small fall from 140.3 million VND
to approximately 137.7 to 137.6 trillion VND in both simulations. This is achieved using a uniform rate
of turnover taxation at 2.5% and can be easily varied, as can the proportion of value added of HHBs and
other details in the estimation based on more accurate information.

         One other issue that requires highlighting is that the turnover information from the 2010
Enterprise survey does not match the I-O table in many cases. This is to be expected in some cases since
the 2005 table was aged using a uniform rate in the absence of information on sector by sector changes
and some sectors may have actually grown faster than others. However a bigger issue is that for several
sectors the turnover of the top 5 enterprises was actually larger than total output from the aged table. This
implies negative output for remaining firms and those sectors have to be dropped from the analysis. This
further implies that the presumptive tax base is underestimated in the base case and the proportion of
value added deductible from the base attributable to small firms and potentially in the simulations as well.
This cannot be corrected unless we have an I-O table for 2010 that is consistent with the Enterprise survey
data of the same year.

        Another issue is the choice of threshold. At present, we have taken the thresholds approved by
the NA in the draft law. As we have highlighted in previous chapters, this is not the optimal procedure.
The threshold should be chosen to balance the losses and gains from introducing a turnover based
threshold and we shall examine this issue in more detail in the next section.

7. Choice of Threshold


Generally the optimal threshold Z is calculated as:




Where:

     Administrative cost per year = A
     Compliance cost per year =     C
     Marginal economic cost of revenues or public funds = δ
     "Value added" (taxed output value-taxed input value) as a share of turnover =       v; Tax rate = τ
     Threshold annual turnover =    z

We have the following information:

     V = (1-0.467105269)




                                                      204
     τ = 10%

     C = 1030 hours of staff time per year (Coolidge, 2012)

     A = taken at 2 million VND per SME based on GDT salaries on SME staff (2010) divided by
     estimated 800,000 SMEs including household enterprises

     δ = 1.25 (range 1.33) as recommended by White House for US projects

      The compliance cost is an assumption, as are some aspects of administrative costs. The compliance
cost could be accurate for large firms but is unlikely to be accurate for small and medium enterprises.
Assuming that the wage for accountants and those who can manage taxes is at least 2 times the official
minimum wage (2,350,000/month) on an hourly basis (divided by 160 hours for a month gives around
14,687 an hour), the total compliance cost (1030*14687*2) is over 30 million VND which small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) obviously cannot spend on just complying with taxes. Using administrative
costs equal to compliance costs and a wage rate higher than minimum wage that still gives a reasonable
total spending on compliance to account for non-labor costs would need to adjust downward the number
of hours required for SMEs to comply with taxes.

         Without more accurate information on compliance costs and administrative costs we cannot get
more accurate results. For simulation purposes, it is possible to forecast the revenue under various
different threshold scenarios by substituting the different thresholds in both models above. This exercise
is not attempted here until a more firm range of possibilities for thresholds is decided based on complete
information; otherwise it would amount to little more than an academic exercise.

        Taking a more reasonable assumption of average compliance cost at 10 million VND and
administrative cost at 2 million VND each for SMEs (which is still quite high for micro businesses) we
get an optimal threshold at Z = (1.25*2000000 + 10000000)/(0.533*0.1*0.25) = 938,086,304 VND
which is just a little lower than the 1000 million accepted by the NA. Therefore, no adjustment is
proposed to the thresholds proposed by the NA at present in the absence of more firm information on
compliance and administrative costs for SMEs.

                           Tax

1. Overall Assessment of VAT Design and Revenue Performance from International Perspective

         A comparative picture of VAT regimes in the OECD and selected Asian countries is presented in
Tables 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4 below. The picture in OECD countries emerging from tables 11.2- 11.4
is quite diverse. The standard VAT rates in some countries like Denmark, Poland, Hungary, and the U.K.
are as high as 25, 23, 27 and 20 percent respectively. Other countries like Australia and New Zealand
have moderate rates of 10 and 15 percent respectively. On the other hand, countries like Canada and
Japan have comparatively low tax rates at 5 percent. It may be noted, however, that the rate in Canada is
low because the country has a dual VAT and provinces apply their own General Sales Tax and VAT.
Similarly the threshold varies from a low of US$6,339 in Denmark to a high of US$93,566 in Japan. The
contribution of VAT revenue also varies considerably from as low as 2.6 percent of GDP in Japan to as
high as 10.1 percent in Denmark.

        It is clear from table 6 that the standard tax rates in Asian countries are more moderate at around
10 percent. While the Philippines has a low threshold of US$34,407, Indonesia has a comparatively high
threshold of US$64,018. In 2011, the contribution of VAT to revenues is around 3 to 4 percent of GDP in
most of these countries with the exception of Vietnam (7.7%) and China (9.4% in 2010). While the VAT
system and its performance in Vietnam may look very different from most of the OECD countries, it
compares well with the Asian countries.

         In order to assess the VAT efficiency, two efficiency ratios are generally used: production
efficiency ratio and consumption efficiency or C-efficiency ratio. The production efficiency ratio of VAT
is measured by the ratio of VAT revenues to GDP divided by the standard VAT rate expressed as a
percentage. A low ratio indicates erosion of the tax base due to poor tax policy such as zero-rating and
reduced rates or poor enforcement of the law. Consumption efficiency or C-efficiency ratio is a similar
measure where the share of VAT revenue as a percentage of consumption divided by the standard rate is
estimated. If a uniform consumption tax is imposed on all consumption, its efficiency will be 100
percent. Zero-rating of some items will reduce the ratio below 100 and taxation of investment goods will
raise it to more than 100 percent. Alternatively, a high C-efficiency could be an indicator of multiple
breaks in the VAT chain due to excessive exemptions resulting in taxation of both the final consumption
and some of the constituent intermediate goods. Both these ratios show the same thing but one is
normalized with reference to an income type VAT while the other is to a consumption type VAT.

        Clearly the three factors that would determine the revenue productivity of VAT in a country are:
(a) The rules that prescribe the rates, the base, the threshold and other issues related to tax structure; (b)
The scale of taxable consumption in the economy that is, the final expenditure made by the consumers on
taxable items; and (c) The effectiveness of the tax administration and the level of compliance. Since VAT
on tradable goods are collected by the customs department, the third factor related to tax administration
would also depend to some extent on the share of trade in the economy that is, the trade/GDP ratio,
because it is easy to collect VAT on the imports.

Notes to Tables 11.2
1. Nomenclature. The tables are based on a common nomenclature for all OECD countries. Heading 5110 (General taxes on goods and services) is used for Tables 3.1 and 3.2. It
includes VAT, sales taxes and other general taxes on goods and services. Heading 5120 (Taxes on specific goods and services) consists primarily of excise taxes, but also includes
certain specific taxes such as customs duties and taxes on insurance and certain financial operations in particular. Heading 5111 Value added taxes is used for tables 3.5 and 3.6. It
includes all consumption taxes charged on value-added, irrespective of the method of deduction of input tax and the stages at which the taxes are levied. In some countries the heading
may include some taxes on financial and insurance activities.

2. Capital transfer. The total tax revenues have been reduced by the amount of capital transfer. The capital transfer has been allocated between tax headings in proportion to the
report tax revenue.

3. Averages. All member counties are taken into account for the calculation of the un-weighted averages, including countries that had not implemented the relevant taxes for the year
considered. They are counted with a value of zero in the numerator and 1 in the denominator. However, countries that did not exist at the time considered (Czech and Slovak
Republics before 1993; Slovenia before 1991) are not included in the calculation of the averages. Are also excluded from the calculation of the averages the countries for which no
data is available for the time considered (Chile before 1990, Hungary before 1995; Israel before 1995, Korea before 1975; Mexico before 1980; Poland before 1995; and Slovak
Republic before 2000).

4. Israel. The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the
status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law.

Notes:

(1) Registration/collection thresholds identified in this table are general concessions that relieve suppliers from the requirement to register and/or to collect
for VAT/GST until such time as they exceed the threshold. Except where specifically identified, registration thresholds also relieve suppliers from the
requirement to charge and collect VAT/GST on supplies made within a particular jurisdiction. Relief from registration and collection may be available to
specific industries or types of traders (for example nonresident suppliers) under more detailed rules, or a specific industry or type of trader may be subject to
more stringent registration and collection requirements. In countries marked by *, a collection threshold applies: all taxpayers are required to register for
VAT/GST, but will not be required to charge and collect VAT/GST until they exceed the collection threshold. Thresholds shown in this table apply to
businesses established in the country. In most countries, the registration threshold do not apply to foreign businesses i.e. businesses having no seat, place of
business, fixed establishment, domicile or habitual residence within the country

(2) "Yes" means a supplier is allowed to voluntarily register and collect VAT/GST where their total annual turnover is less than the registration threshold.
(3) Minimum registration/collection periods apply to general concessions. This period is the minimum term during which the concession is applied to
taxpayers which have opted for it.
(4) Exchange rates for conversion into USD are Purchase Parity Rates (PPPs) for private consumption. Data is taken from OECD Dotstat

Country notes
Chile: Despite that all taxpayers are required to register and obtain a taxpayers' identification number that not only serves for VAT purposes but for all types
of taxes, small businesses, craftsman and small service providers can be subject to a special regime in accordance to which they charge VAT for a fixed
amount based on the average level of income for the last 12 months, provided they do not exceed the annual collection threshold of 20 Monthly Tax Unit (
CLP$ 782.760 or USD$ 1.565 approx.). The collection threshold does not apply to legal entities but only to individuals. This system must be adopted for at
least for 12 months after which the taxpayer can return back to the ordinary regime.
Czech Republic : The registration threshold does not apply to fixed establishments in the Czech Republic of non-resident businesses
Denmark: A higher threshold of DKK 170 000 (EUR 22 840) applies to the blind, and a threshold of DKK 300 000 (EUR 40 300) applies to t he first sale of
works of art by their creator or his successors in title. For the purposes of the latter exemption, the threshold of DKK 300 000 must not have been exceeded in
the current or preceding year.
France: Specific thresholds apply for certain activities. EUR 41 700 for lawyers, writers and artists; EUR 32 000 for providers of services other than hotel
accommodation and restaurants.

Greece: The registration/collection thresholds do not apply to certain categories of taxable persons, such as freelancers, taxpayers whose annual turnover from
B2B transactions is at least 60%, exporters, technicians who render services in relation to maintenance or repair of buildings and construction sites, such as
painters, electricians and plumbers.
Israel: The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities. The use of such data by the OECD is
without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law.
Italy: Self-employed that have an income lower than EUR 30 000 can choose the micro-sized taxpayers scheme (regime dei contribuenti minimi). It involves
exemption from IRAP (Regional tax on productive activities) and VAT and a 20% tax rate in place of the ordinary PIT. As from 1 January 2012, such scheme
is intended only for individuals under 35 years of age who have started up new business activities as self-employed or enterprises since 31 December 2007.
The exemptions from IRAP and VAT have been confirmed, while ordinary personal income taxes will be replaced by a 5% tax.

Japan: Businesses (companies and individuals) are not required to register and account for Consumption Tax (VAT) during the first two years of
establishment (except for companies whose capital is of JPY 10 000 000 or more. In this case they should be registered for Consumption Tax from the
beginning). After this two year period, whether businesses should be registered as a taxable person is determined every year based on their annual taxable
turnover for the accounting period/tax year two years before the current accounting period/tax year. If that turnover has exceeded JPY 10 000 000, the
business should be registered. Businesses can opt for a voluntary registration for Consumption Tax, even if their turnover is below the threshold. In that case,
the businesses have to remain registered for two years.
Netherlands: The amount of EUR 1 345 is based on the special scheme for small businesses. It is not a threshold based on turnover but on net annual VAT
due. If the net annual VAT due (VAT on outputs minus VAT on inputs) is EUR 1 345 or less, the taxpayer gets a full VAT rebate and no VAT is due to the
Tax Authorities. In this case, the taxpayer has no obligation to file VAT returns. However, businesses under the small business scheme must still register as
VAT taxpayers. In that sense, there is no threshold for registration for VAT purposes. If the net annual VAT due is more than EUR 1 345 but less than EUR
1 883, the taxpayer gets a partial VAT rebate. In this case, the taxpayer must file a VAT return.
Norway: A higher threshold of NOK 3 000 000 applies for admission to sporting events
Portugal: The collection threshold does not apply to commercial legal entities. For small retailers that fulfill some specific conditions the collection threshold
is EUR 12 500

United Kingdom: the registration threshold in effect from 1 April 2010 up to 31 March 2011 was GBP 70 000. It went up to GBP 73 000 with effect from 1
April 2011

        Table 10 shows an estimate of productivity and consumption efficiencies across the geographical
regions. The estimates (for the year 2001) indicate that both production efficiency and consumption
efficiency ratios for Asia are comparable to the ones in the EU, Central Europe, North Africa and the
Middle East, and Latin America and they are significantly higher than in Sub-Saharan Africa.

                         Table 10: VAT Efficiency Across The World (2001)




         A comparative picture of production and consumption efficiencies for Vietnam and some of its
neighboring countries is presented in table 11. Both the productivity efficiency and consumption
efficiency in Vietnam compare well with its neighboring countries. In fact, these are significantly higher
than the regional averages presented in table 10. In addition to many other factors, this could also be the
result of a series of cascading-induced exemptions in the VAT law.

        To ensure that Vietnam has a robust and clean VAT law and yields sufficiently high productivity
and consumption efficiencies, the logical sequence to proceed would be to first fix the tax structure and
then focus on the tax administration and tax compliance issues. Eliminating or at least minimizing the
exemptions would be necessary to give a realistic picture of the performance of the VAT. Once these
issues are tackled successfully, the expected revenues can be ascertained by forecasting VAT revenue,
using the models outlined in chapter 10, with the help of forecasting models in order to see the level of
compliance in the economy and then try to improve it.

       Some typical features of the VAT in Vietnam such as tax structure, exemptions, computation
method for tax liability, refund and equity are examined below, bearing in mind international practice of
VAT regimes.

2. Zero-Rating and VAT Refunds

        Zero-rating of exports is essential in order that all the taxes are taken out of the production chain
of an exportable item and it remains internationally competitive. A destination based credit method VAT
easily meets this requirement. However, for this to be effective, prompt refund of input VAT is
necessary.

         In principle, refunds should be paid without any delay otherwise it becomes a penalty against
investors. Precise data about the amount of refund paid are not readily available for developing countries
but it is possible to have a sense of the dimension of this problem by looking at some of the developed
countries. For instance, according to the refund data collected by the IMF for the year 1995–96, the U.K.
collected over US$68 billion dollars and returned US$26 billion in refunds. Thus refunds were about 60
percent of net collections which is unusually high. In the case of France, the refund is normally about 40
percent, in Sweden 80 percent while for Korea it is about 50 percent. In most developed countries, VAT
refunds exceed 40 percent of the gross VAT collections while in most developing countries of Africa,
Asia, and Latin America; it amounts to less than 20 percent of the VAT revenues.

Some Important Features of VAT Refunds Globally

         A key feature of the credit method VAT is that some businesses would pay more VAT on their
inputs than they collect on their sales and would therefore claim excess credit refunds. It is therefore
important to have a refund system in place if the VAT regime has to be implemented successfully. At the
same time, a large amount of VAT revenue is lost as a result of VAT refund abuse. While countries have
found it generally difficult to estimate the extent of revenue loss, it is believed to be substantial. Tax
authorities in the U.K. estimated the amount of VAT losses in 2002–03 to be around 16 percent of the net
VAT receipts. VAT abuse comes in different forms, ranging from traders omitting sales from records to
falsification of invoices.




                                                    218
         Sometimes, businesses are launched without any legitimate activity for the sole purpose of
stealing money from the government through the refund system. The following are some notable aspects
of VAT refunds around the globe.

     Most of the VAT refund claims are made by exporters both in terms of numbers and amounts.
      Typically, a small number of large exporters account for the bulk of VAT excess credit.
     The other businesses claiming refunds are comprised of those traders that have made large
      purchases of capital goods relative to current sales. Also, in countries with a dual rate structure,
      refund claims arise when outputs are taxed at a lower rate while inputs are taxed at a higher VAT
      rate.
     The VAT registration process should contain sufficient checks and controls to prevent registration
      of fictitious traders who want to register with the sole intent of stealing from the VAT system.
      The registration staff should carefully assess and verify initial information presented for
      registration.
     The level of threshold for compulsory registration is relevant not only for effective administration
      of VAT but also for reducing refund abuse. If the threshold is too low, the tax administration
      resources become over stretched in managing the VAT registered businesses and monitoring
      refund claims. Vietnam, with zero thresholds, faces this problem. So an appropriate level of
      threshold is important for effective monitoring and management of VAT refund.
     An effective risk-based audit system plays an important role in reducing VAT refund fraud.
      Exchange of VAT and income tax information and VAT and customs information are important
      in this regard. Where direct and indirect taxes are administrated together in a unified tax
      administration, exchange of VAT and income tax information is routine. Where these taxes are
      administered separately, however, exchange of information is generally limited. In some
      countries, this kind of exchange is legally prohibited. As a substantive share of VAT revenues
      are collected through the customs agency, the cooperation between VAT and customs also
      becomes important.


3. International Practice in VAT Refund and Policy Implications for Vietnam

        In most developed countries, refunds are usually paid within three to four weeks of the end of the
taxable period. Also, there are virtually no restrictions on the refund payment. In developing countries
and transition economies, however, the situation is different and this turns out to be one of the weak links
in the VAT administration. Many of these countries limit the entitlement to refund. The IMF conducted
a survey of 36 such countries and come up with the following findings:


     Ninety percent of the countries in the survey reported that their tax authorities are bound by law
      to make refunds within a prescribed timeframe, generally 30 days. It is also true that the statutory
      deadlines are often not met. Around 40 percent of the countries go further and provide for
      interest payments on late refunds. In eight countries, refunds are focused on exporters only. Six
      countries give refunds to exporters immediately and the rest give refunds with some time lag,
      both to exporters and other businesses.



                                                    219
    Most countries (60 percent of the surveyed countries) now ask their taxpayers, particularly non-
     exporters, to typically carry forward the refund for a specific period – generally six months.
     While this practice enables the tax administration to verify genuineness of refund claims, these
     measures create hardship to investors and are not welcomed by firms who are making large
     investments while their production and sales do not begin immediately thereafter. Many VAT
     systems allow for refunds to be offset against other tax liabilities, for instance, the income tax
     liability which further delays the actual refund.
    Four of the surveyed countries make refunds in excess of a floor credit only. One country adjusts
     only once every year at the end of the year. One country makes no refunds at all even though it is
     provided in the law and one other country pays refunds in an ad hoc manner. There is one
     country that pays refunds only after an audit. Two countries in Africa have enacted legislation to
     deny all outstanding claims as of a specific date. This, of course, has serious implications for the
     long-term integrity of the tax system and the credibility of tax administration. Thus clearly there
     is a great deal of variation among countries. Also, the actual refund practices are found to be
     quite different from what is laid down in the law.
    Two-thirds of the surveyed countries undertake some sort of risk assessment in processing VAT
     refunds. Sometimes it is quite sophisticated (UK) while in many countries it is often rudimentary
     and may amount to verifying each refund claim. A quarter of surveyed countries have a statutory
     requirement to verify every refund claim. This naturally takes a lot of time.
    It is also found that a lack of an appropriate audit program in many countries contributes to the
     existence of a poor refund system. A third of the surveyed countries report that they do not have
     a VAT audit program. These countries end up carrying out extended prepayment checking of
     claims rather than relying on a sound post-payment audit. This naturally delays the entire
     process. It is important for the tax administration to have a sense of the level of refunds payable
     so that financial resources are in place in a timely fashion and also as a warning signal against
     attempted fraud.
    Exchange of information about VAT registered traders and the value of supplies across countries
     has become important for international transactions. For instance, EU member states exchange
     information via a VAT information exchange system (VIES) about VAT traders and sales of
     goods and services.

        Generally, there are two methods of budgeting for VAT refunds: (a) making payments from gross
VAT revenues, (b) paying from budget expenditure appropriations. Irrespective of the method used, it is
necessary to have a forecasting and monitoring system to estimate VAT collections and level of refunds.
Actual collections and refunds should be tracked against forecasts and variances should be explained and
reconciled. Some countries have adopted innovative practices to reduce refund fraud. For instance,
Kenya provides for mandatory certification of VAT claims by certified public accountants (CPAs) for
claims exceeding specified amounts. Sanctions are also imposed on CPAs who knowingly certify false
claims.

        A number of countries give preferential treatment to taxpayers with sound compliance histories
(“gold” status in Pakistan). Some countries (Bulgaria) have introduced a VAT bank account system


                                                  220
where a VAT registered business must open a VAT account for depositing VAT payments and spending
money on VAT purchases. This is meant to reduce cash transactions and thus reduce VAT fraud.

        The following lessons with significant policy implications for Vietnam’s VAT system can be
learned from analysis of international experience in VAT refunds.

    1. The number of taxpayers should be kept at a level that can be realistically managed by choosing
       the right threshold and verifying the VAT registration applications to prevent fictitious traders
       entering the system.
    2. Suitable forecasting and monitoring systems should be established to anticipate refund levels and
       make provisions for refund payments.
    3. Refunds should be processed in a reasonable period of time and interest paid on late payments.
       Excess VAT credit should be offset against VAT and other tax arrears.
    4. Exporters should be paid refunds promptly. In a functioning risk management, the tax
       department should make a clear distinction between claimants with a history of compliance and
       those who are new. The Tax department should maintain historical profiles for each refund
       claimant.
    5. Verification of VAT refund claims should be a component of a wider audit program. A pre-
       refund audit should be implemented for high risk claims while a normal post audit should be
       conducted for other less risk cases.
    6. Given the substantial size of VAT refunds, one part of an audit department may simply focus on
       refund audits, that is, verifying the facts of refund claims.
    7. VAT refunds also create opportunities for corrupt practices by tax and customs officials and this
       has to be carefully monitored.

        Some countries, especially among transition economies, have tended to delay refunds and use the
resources to overcome temporary revenue problems. While this kind of interest free loan from the
business sector may appear attractive in the short run, it is bound to create a serious backlash and
adversely affect the investment climate in the country and therefore such practices should be avoided.

3.1. Importance of Customs in VAT Collection

         An important feature of VAT collection brought out by empirical studies of countries in Asia,
Africa, Latin America and Central Europe is that the revenue collected on imports normally accounts for
a large proportion of total VAT revenues in most countries. A study by the IMF of this ratio in more than
twenty developing and transition economies shows that the ratio varies between 40 percent (Peru) to 70
percent (Bulgaria and Haiti). This clearly brings out the importance of customs collection in VAT
revenue collection.

        There is another way in which customs plays an important role in VAT collection. As the tax
policy analysis for VAT would show, under the credit method if the final sales are VAT exempt, the chain
terminates at the stage of the previous input purchase. In that case, there is some loss of revenues at the
stage of final sales but total revenues are not lost because the VAT collected on the input is not refunded.
In many developing and transition economies, this is what happens on the sale by the informal sector of
the economy.

                                                    221
         The informal sector is responsible for a substantial share of final sales to consumers in these
countries and by its very nature this sector often does not pay VAT on its final sales. But if the customs
department is effective at the border, the imported inputs used by the informal sector would be collected.
Since the informal sector is not registered under VAT, the taxes on inputs paid at the border are not
refunded to them even though the tax on value added at their stage is lost. Thus customs effectiveness is
an important factor in the effectiveness of total VAT collections in the countries where an informal sector
is prominent. In addition, exchange of information between the customs department and the VAT
collection agency would help the latter in crosschecking whether the traders who are importing part of
their inputs are paying the right level of tax on their production. Thus clearly the extent of cooperation
between the customs and VAT administrations is crucial for the successful enforcement of VAT. In fact,
close cooperation among the different parts of tax administration is helpful for enforcement of all taxes –
income tax, VAT and custom tariffs.

        However, this kind of cooperation in developing and transition economies is more of an
exception than a rule. Clearly, a separate VAT department independent of the domestic tax department
that administers income taxes is bound to make this kind of cooperation harder to achieve. The same
problem would be faced where there is little cooperation between the Customs department and other
domestic tax administration including the VAT.

3.2. Some features of VAT regimes in other countries17

       We present below the broad practices in OECD and BRICS countries as well as among the
neighboring countries of Vietnam,

OECD: The federal Australian government levies the 10% GST but distributes the proceeds to states.
Exempt supplies include residential rents, re-sale of residential property and most financial services
(including life insurance). Exports, health (including health insurance), education, most food supplies and
medical services are zero-rated, while general insurance is taxed. Reverse charges may apply to
purchases made by registered buyers of overseas supplies in some cases.

        Korea similarly imposes a VAT at 10% and exempts unprocessed food and agricultural products,
medical and health services, financial services etc., and zero-rates exports of goods and services. The
unique feature is mandatory registration for and use of e-invoicing by taxpayers in Korea. Singapore has
the main VAT (GST) rate at 7%, but only exempts specified financial services and residential properties,
and zero rates exports of goods and services. Restrictions are applied to certain inputs for the purpose of
VAT credit (car rental, medical expense, club subscriptions etc) and on the claim of refunds by non-
residents. GST registration is required if taxable turnover (person or company) exceeds SGD 1 million
annually.

       UK has the highest VAT rate in the OECD group at 20% on most goods and services, but taxes
some goods at 5%. Most exports, most food items, most public transport, books and publications, and

                                                       222
specified essential goods and services are zero-rated. Some supplies are exempt, such as rights in land,
insurance, financial services, betting and gaming, education, certain sports services, cultural services, and
health and welfare. The USA is the only large country in the world that has no VAT at the federal level.

BRICS: Brazil imposes a federal VAT on import, sale and transfers of goods at rates between 10-15% on
most items and a state sales and service tax at rates ranging from 7-25%, the coverage of services under
the state sales and service tax being restricted to transport, communications and electricity only; most
income from services are subjected to a municipal service tax on turnover at 2-5%.

         China is gradually moving from a Business Tax to a more comprehensive VAT through its
Shanghai pilot project. Currently, the sale or import of goods, and certain services are charged VAT at
rates of 13% or 17% with a rate for small taxpayers at 3%. Export refunds are available on materials
purchased locally at rates between 0%-17percent. The Shanghai pilot program has been introduced for
certain service industries earlier covered by the business tax at rates of 6%, 11% and 17% (3% for certain
small taxpayers). The business tax is currently imposed on services, transfer of intangible assets, and
immovable property at rates of 3%, 5% and 20%.

         India imposes limited VATs at both the central and state levels. The federal VAT excludes
wholesalers and retailers as well as manufacturers below a certain turnover threshold, while the state VAT
excludes services and inter-state sales. The typical federal rate is 12% and an education cess at 2% and
higher education cess at 1% is applicable over this rate, so the aggregate federal rate is effectively
12.36%. The state VAT is charged at 1%, 4%, 5% and 20% in addition, and a 2% Central Sales Tax is
charged on inter-state transactions instead of the state VAT. Input VAT credit on goods and services paid
to the center is available for the central VAT liability and input VAT credit for the state VAT for the state
VAT (in the same state), credit of state VAT is not available for the central VAT and vice-versa.

        In Russia, VAT is a federal tax at a standard rate of 18% and a lower rate of 10% on certain basic
foodstuff, children’s clothing, medicines and medical products, certain printed publications, etc. exports
are zero-rated and certain financial, educational and transportation and socially desirable services are
exempt. Reverse charges are applicable for most payments made to unregistered foreign companies in
specified circumstances.

        In South Africa, VAT is levied at the rate of 14% on most domestic sales on registered taxpayers
(turnover above ZAR 1 million annually or those who elect to register with annual turnover above ZAR
50,000). Exports are zero-rated as are specified farming equipment, sales of enterprises, certain fuel, and
deemed supplies by welfare organizations. Certain supplies such as interest charges, basic foodstuff,
domestic land transport and education etc. are exempt.

Vietnam’s Neighbors: Cambodia has a VAT at 10% applicable to “real regime” taxpayers, with exports
being zero rated as well as direct supplies to export oriented specified industries. Exempt supplies
include postal services (public), medical services, and electricity, and public transport, insurance and
specified financial services.

        Indonesia has a VAT applied at the rate of 10%, with zero rating for exported goods and some
services. Many goods and services are VAT exempt including machinery and capital equipment in


                                                    223
certain situations, electricity (unless household capacity exceeds 6,600 watts), piped water, livestock,
poultry and fish feed and/or raw materials for preparing feeds, certain agricultural crops in their natural
state delivered by farmers, agricultural seeds, plantations, forestry, animal husbandry, breeding, and
fishery sources, polio vaccines, textbooks etc.

        The standard rate in Laos is also 10%; exempted items include unprocessed agricultural products,
seeds, fertilizers, textbooks, education services, medical services, banking services, and insurance, while
exported goods and services are zero rated. The turnover threshold (compulsory) is annual revenue of
400 million Lao kip (LAK). Companies below this threshold may voluntarily register. One unique
feature of Lao PDR VAT is that VAT is charged on withholding taxes (WHTs) at 10% and in the case of
a foreign recipient, the WHT is considered a final tax.

        The rate in the Philippines is 12%, with zero-rating of exports. Certain services are VAT exempt
and taxed on turnover instead. Taxpayers whose annual turnover is below PHP 1,919,500 pay a 3% tax
on receipts or sales and do not have to register for VAT.

        Malaysia has not yet implemented its proposed 4% goods and services tax (GST) to replace its
current sales and service tax systems. In practice, the current sales and service tax already incorporates
many features of VAT.

Annex A: International Trends and Experience in Tax
          Policy Reform on Indirect Taxes

         “The replacement of sales taxes with the VAT –especially the flat-rate VAT-- has tended to
make tax systems less progressive. Another key development of the past few decades has been the
spread of the VAT across the developing world. VAT revenue has replaced a number of indirect taxes,
including tariff and other trade taxes as well as domestic sales taxes. Typically, the introduction of
relatively broad-based VATs replacing sales taxes has tended to reduce the progressivity of the tax
system. This has taken place by enlarging the tax base to previously exempt goods and services that are
basic necessities and reducing tax rates on goods that are more important in the budgets of higher-income
households. As a result, revenue-neutral reforms, have generally led to gains by upper-income groups at
the expense of lower-income groups (Coady: 277). That being said, it is important to make an assessment
country by country as tax incidence very much depends on VAT design (Chu et al. 2000).

         VAT rates have also tended to increase as part of the global move toward taxing
consumption more heavily and income more lightly. This trend is particularly acute in Latin America,
where consumption taxes account for 60 percent of all tax revenues compared to 30 percent in Europe.
Countries particularly concerned with income distribution, particularly in Europe but also in the
developing world, have introduced VATs with lower rates and/or 0-rating or exemptions for goods
featuring especially prominently in the consumption basket of the poor. Countries less concerned with
the distributional impact of taxation have introduced VATs with a very broad base and a single rate (see
below for further details). Even in Europe, however, the share of household income paid through
consumption taxes by the bottom income decile is three times as high as that paid by the top decile.

        As a result, rising VAT rates and revenues have compensated for declining personal –and in
some cases corporate—income tax revenues and fiscal re-distribution has declined. This trend has
combined with the decline in income taxation to create more regressive tax systems. In Latin America,
tax reforms from the 1970s to the 1990s typically entailed additional reliance on indirect taxes just as
inequality was rising (Mahon, 2012: 2). The result of these changes in the tax system coupled with
reductions in social assistance is the progressive erosion of the contribution of fiscal policy to diminishing
rising pre-tax-and-transfer income inequality. According to IMF estimates, from the mid-1980s to the
mid-1990s, fiscal policy offset 73 percent of the 3 percentage point increase in pre-tax-and-transfer
income inequality in the OECD while in the next decade this percentage had declined to 53 percent
(Coady 2012: 12).

        Moreover, fiscal space for further increasing VAT rates is getting thinner while the stepped
up taxing of high income and high wealth individuals remains a green field. As a recent IMF report
frankly states:

        Continued trade liberalization will put pressure on revenue in many lower-income countries.
        Scope to meet these and other revenue needs by simply raising standard VAT rates is becoming
        limited, so the potential lies largely in better improving compliance and scaling back preferential


                                                     225
         treatments. Not least, and important too for the wider legitimacy of tax systems, greater efforts
         can be made—requiring political will as much as technical capacity—in taxing elites and high-
         income/wealth individuals (IMF 2011: 5)

         As regards the VAT, collection efficiency considerations advocate for the setting of a single
rate with 0 rating for exports while equity considerations advise having multiple rates. Ease of
administration advises having a single VAT rate. This is the case especially in low-income countries with
particularly low capacity and which simply cannot effectively handle multiple rates. Moreover, from an
economic efficiency perspective, it can be argued that lower VAT rates and exemptions/0-rating (aside
from exports) constitute a generalized subsidy that ends up mostly benefiting those who do not need the
rebate (the wealthier, as they consume more). On the other hand, the VAT can easily be made neutral and
even slightly progressive by establishing a reduced rate (or exempting or 0 rating18) goods which feature
particularly prominently in the consumption basket of the poor.19 IMF advice has typically tried to
balance efficiency and equity considerations by advising VATs with a broad base, a single rate, a fairly
high threshold and some exemptions, such as those for financial services, government agencies, and basic
health and education (IMF 2011: 24).

         The equity case for indirect taxation is particularly strong in developing countries. This is
the case because, unlike in developed countries, the “equity damage” of a flat rate VAT cannot be as
easily undone with the combination of a progressive income tax (to add to the taxation of the rich) and
transfers (to compensate the poor) (Keen and Simone: 317; Ebrill et al.; and Stiglitz 2003). On the
contrary, as will be shown, even in Latin American countries with conditional cash transfer systems to the
poor, the fiscal system can be regressive due to the impact of indirect taxes.

        Rate differentiation has also been urged on economic efficiency and stabilization grounds
(Bird, 125; Asher and Booth). In this vein, it has been argued that:

         In many developing countries, a VAT may be a part of a well-designed tax structure. In a sense,
         this chapter is a critique of the excess zeal of VAT advocates, who sometimes suggest that there
         should just be a uniform tax on all goods. This chapter argues that that is seldom the case.
         There should, in general, be differential taxation. It may be desirable to impose differential taxes
         on imports, including to promote development. It may be desirable to impose differential taxes
         on luxuries or oligopolies, including to promote equity (Stiglitz, 2009).

         Indirect taxes can increase the post-fiscal poverty rate even in the presence of transfers to
the poorest, particularly in middle income countries with high urbanization rates. On average, it is
estimated that in most countries taxes eat up around 10 percent of the income of the poor with indirect
taxes accounting for a high proportion of the taxes paid by the poorest 60 percent of the population (Bird,
51). Moreover, the introduction of broad-based VATs in place of sales taxes has tended to reduce the
progressivity of the tax system by enlarging the base to include previously exempt goods and services that
are relatively more important in the budget of the poor (Coady). In low-income countries with high rates
of rural population and high informality, the VAT can be progressive. In middle income countries with

18
  Zero-rating is more advisable than exemptions.
19
  The advice of a single-rate VAT was largely based on the administrative constraints of low-income countries. Many middle
income and most developed countries successfully administer multiple-rate VATs.

                                                          226
high rates of urbanization, low own-food consumption and relatively low informality, the VAT can be
highly regressive. Even if its impact on the poorest is mitigated (or even reversed) with transfers, the
near-poor and lower-middle income groups will bear the brunt of the tax through the taxation of their
necessities. As will be shown below, in many Latin American countries, the VAT is regressive, greatly
lowering disposable income for the poor and, in some cases, like Brazil, increasing the post-fiscal
moderate poverty rate.

        Moreover, “in the absence of well-functioning schemes for income redistribution, there is no
theoretical presumption in favor of uniformity of indirect taxation”20 Revenue-neutral indirect tax
reforms (such as flattening the VAT) typically lead to gains by upper income groups at the expense of
lower income groups (Coady). Therefore, if equity is a consideration and there is no PIT or transfer
system to compensate, rate differentiation is arguably the best way to prevent the institution of a
regressive tax. Namely: “uniform taxes become unattractive unless the income redistribution system
through taxation and transfers is very powerful” (Burgess and Stern).21

        In addition to standard sales tax or VAT and trade taxes, indirect tax systems typically
include excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco, petroleum products and some luxury goods. An excise tax
on luxury goods needs to be carefully designed to ensure it taxes the goods and populations intended.
When properly designed, this tax can help diminish the regressive nature of the overall indirect tax
system.

1.       Indirect Tax Reform - Results from Country Modeling

         This section presents the results of studies modeling the impact of tax reform on income
distribution. The results of various studies carried out across the world are presented in turn and a
conclusion summarizes their main findings.

        Both general as well as partial equilibrium models tend to find that the introduction of a
broad-based VAT tends to reduce the progressivity of the tax system. This takes place by enlarging
the base to include previously exempt goods and services that are relatively more important in the
consumption basket of the poor and/or by reducing taxes on goods that are relatively more important in
the consumption of the better off (Coady).

        On the contrary, the introduction of differential rates on goods consumed
disproportionately by the poor, such as food, would improve the progressivity of the VAT (Coady).
Overall, evidence from country modeling indicates that: “even though the greater part of basic foodstuffs
are usually not consumed by the poor, in the face of the strong direct impact on the poor of taxes on such
foodstuffs, concern for their wellbeing often suggests the need for their exemption.” (Bird, 127) .
Regarding personal income taxation, the replacement of multiple rates with a flat rate significantly
20
   Specifically, proportional commodity taxes are optimal if Engel curves are linear and differences across households in their
demographic position shift the position but not the slope of their Engel curves, and if there is a universal and optimal set of
demogrants (i.e. transfers linked to household structure). If any of these assumptions does not hold, indirect taxes should
generally depart from uniformity to take account of whether goods are relatively more important in the consumption of the worse
off (Burgess and Stern; Deaton and Stern).
21
   Still, “using the indirect tax system should generally be viewed as a short -term measure until more cost-effective re-
distributional policy instruments are developed, for instance, a well-designed and well-implemented social protection program.”
(Coady).

                                                             227
reduces the progressivity of the tax system and increases income inequality. Specific country studies are
summarized below.

        In Jamaica, replacing differentiated consumption taxes with a uniform rate of 20 percent
increased the tax burden on low-income households and the tax system’s regressivity. Exempting
food, however, reversed those results and lowered all taxes on low-income families dramatically in a
progressive manner. (Bird, 59)

        In India, reduced rates on fuel and increased taxes on milk products improved the equity of
indirect taxation. On the other hand, the shift to a uniform VAT would increase the price of many
essentials and reduce the expenditure of the poorest rural households by almost 7 percent and that of
urban households by about 5 percent. “The only value judgment for which it (such a shift) would be
considered optimum would be that involving no concern whatsoever for income redistribution in favor of
the poor” (Ahmad and Stern, 1983)

         In Pakistan, analysis concluded that any degree of concern for inequality at all made wheat
and sugar poor candidates for increased taxation compared to meat and eggs (Ahmad, Leung and
Stern, 1984). A two-tier VAT makes little difference in rural areas given the food consumption out of
home-grown stocks, but it sharply increases the number of poor urban gainers and reduces the number of
gainers among the top 5 percent (Ahmad and Ludlow, 1989). Similarly, the marginal social costs of
raising revenue by taxing rice, edible oils, housing, fuel, light and clothing were always below the median
cost while the attraction of taxing cereals, on the other hand, depended on how concerned one was about
income distribution (Ahmad and Stern, 1991).

       In Cote d’Ivoire, sales taxes were found to be neither progressive nor regressive, with urban
dwellers being heavy payers of the manufacturing level VAT (Choon Sia, Wahba and Whalley)

         In Bosnia and Herzegovina, replacing a multiple rate with a single rate VAT was found to
be slightly less progressive. The effect of introducing a VAT with a single rate of 17 percent to replace a
sales tax with a standard rate of 20 percent, a preferential rate of 10 percent and a zero rate for exports and
a number of basic food items as well as certain services, was modeled. The analysis found that the VAT
was slightly less progressive than the sales tax and would result in an increase in the average tax burden
in the range of 1.9 to 2.6 percent across deciles with the highest impact being for the lower-income
deciles. (Tareq et al. 2005)

        In Bangladesh, replacing the existing indirect tax system (which taxed food) with a zero-
rating system for food was found to be less regressive. The existing system was compared with a
system that zero-rated food grains and vegetables, applied a uniform rate on other goods and services, and
levied excise taxes on tobacco, energy goods, and sugar. This system was found to be less regressive and
would lead to gains for lower-income households in the range of 1.2 to 2.7 percent and losses for higher-
income groups in the range of 0.8 to 6.6 percent (Hossain 1995, 2003).

      In Mexico, the incidence of VAT increases was found to be progressive while reducing VAT,
combined with higher energy prices had a progressive incidence as well (Sobarzo, 2000).



                                                     228
        In the Philippines, indirect taxes were found to be near neutral . Energy taxes were found to
be progressive while import taxes and VAT were found to be neutral in incidence. The VAT was found
to be more regressive than sales taxes due to the relatively high VAT rate on food whereas sales taxes
were relatively higher on goods consumed by wealthier households. It was found that removing the VAT
on food and increasing the base rate on other goods to 16.4 percent to make the reform revenue-neutral
transforms VAT into a progressive tax (Devarajan and Hossain, 1995). Similarly, another study finds that
excise taxes are regressive, import taxes progressive and the VAT ranges from being almost proportional
(neutral) to slightly progressive (Clarete, 1991). More recently, a Bank study found similar results
(World Bank, 2010).

        In South Africa, the VAT has been found to be mildly regressive. Low income households
pay over 5 percent of their income in VAT compared with only 3.5 percent among high-income groups.
This was the case despite the fact that certain food items (such as brown bread, maize meal and milk
powder, rice and unprocessed vegetables and fruits) were zero-rated and small-scale firms were not
required to register for the VAT (Go et al., 2005).

         In Costa Rica, broadening the VAT base supplemented with transfers to the bottom deciles
would be progressive. The VAT currently exempts a large number of goods and services and the rate (at
13 percent) is relatively low by regional standards. In addition, around 8 percent of GDP is zero-rated. A
simulation maintains the 13 percent rate, but broadens the tax base leaving only education, health,
passenger transport, financial services and real estate sales and renting out of the tax base and includes a
targeted transfer to the bottom deciles. The reform reverts the contribution of the first four deciles from
12.1 percent of total VAT revenue to a negative amount (owing to the transfer system) and the revenue-
neutrality of the reform requires the contribution of upper income deciles to increase.22

2.          Indirect Tax Reform - Results from Tax Incidence Analysis

         This section presents some examples of tax incidence studies carried out across the world to
assess the impact of indirect tax reform. The studies use household income and expenditure surveys to
estimate the tax burden on households by income group. As in the above section, a tax incidence in
which a higher percent of income is paid in taxes by higher income groups than by lower income groups
is qualified as progressive, an equal share of taxes being borne by all income groups is qualified as neutral
while a lower percentage of income being contributed in taxes by higher income groups is qualified as
regressive.

        In Ethiopia, the introduction of the VAT increased the tax burden of poorer households
more than three times than it did for the highest decile, mainly due to the inclusion of food. A study
assessed the tax incidence of the replacement of the sales tax with a VAT in 2003 in Ethiopia. The VAT
was introduced at a higher rate (15 percent) and with a broader base than the sales tax it substituted. It
exempted sales of used dwellings, financial services, medical and educational services, electricity,
kerosene, water and transportation, but not food. The new VAT was found to be very mildly progressive
with the poorest deciles facing a burden of 4.3 percent and the richest decile a burden of 5.78 percent.
The estimated progressivity of the VAT depended entirely on the shares of consumption of exempt items


22
     Though this is unclear from the paper, the tax burden of the middle deciles (middle class) probably increases.

                                                                 229
and items obtained in kind (despite the fact that the exempt goods and services are consumed mostly by
the households in the highest deciles). This is mainly because the poor spend a much larger share of their
income on food and therefore pay a disproportionately larger fraction of their expenditure on the food
items they purchase. As is typically the case, for rural households, the VAT is more progressive than for
all households while for urban households, the VAT is regressive. Inclusion of food under exempt items
would significantly reverse this regressivity (Munoz and Cho).

        In Uganda, it was because of the zero-rating of commodities consumed by the poor that the
introduction of the VAT did not make the poor worse off. The tax system was by and large
progressive before the reforms and all taxes were progressive except excise taxes and the graduated
personal tax. The personal income tax was the most progressive and import duties the second most
progressive, followed by sales taxes. After the introduction of the VAT, it is not clear whether it was
more or less progressive than the sales tax. (Chen, Matovu and Reinikka)

         In Bolivia, indirect taxes are found to be highly regressive, taking 18.4 percent of the
income of the poorest and only 2.6 percent of the income of the richest deciles respectively . Despite
the existence of non-contributory pensions and conditional cash transfers, the post-fiscal Gini coefficient
is higher than the market/disposable income Gini due to the highly un-equalizing effect of indirect taxes.
As a result, the post-fiscal (tax-and transfer) headcount ratio for poverty and extreme poverty is
substantially higher than the market headcount ratio. This is the case because the Bolivian indirect tax
system does not include exemptions for the items most commonly consumed by the poor. The tax system
also affects the overall redistributive capacity of Bolivia’s fiscal system through its low yield . Therefore,
as a whole, the Bolivian fiscal system is just neutral because of a combination of a low and non-
progressive tax system and a low level of not particularly progressive transfers. (Arauco et al. 2013)

        In Mexico, indirect taxes are close to neutral due to exemptions on foods and medicine
(jointly with the assumption that rural households do not pay VAT) . Non-oil tax revenues have
stagnated at around 10 percent of GDP for the past thirty-five years. Direct taxes are highly progressive
since workers in the first four deciles are exempted and benefit from a negative income tax. Nevertheless,
the overall tax system nationally and in urban areas is only very slightly progressive due to the small
weight of income taxes relative to indirect taxes. Total taxes are more progressive in rural areas reflecting
the VAT assumption. (Scott 2013)

        In Peru, indirect taxes are also found to be progressive due to extensive informality and
exemptions are found to have greater incidence on the middle deciles. Direct taxes are progressive,
but have little effect on inequality due to their little weight in the overall tax effort and as a percent of
GDP. Overall, the fiscal system is found to have little effect on poverty and income inequality due, not to
low efficiency of spending, but rather to the low overall level of taxes and social spending (Jaramillo
2013).

         Uruguay has a strong tax effort and achieves a significant reduction in inequality and
poverty through its fiscal tax-and-transfer system though indirect taxes are regressive. This is due
to the fact that it raises a substantial amount of resources through its tax system allowing it to spend 28
percent of GDP in social spending (2009 data). Direct taxes are progressive (with the poorest decile
paying 0.9 percent of its income in direct taxes and the richest decile 9 percent). All social programs are

                                                     230
also progressive with in-kind transfers in the form of education and health benefits having the largest
impact in lowering income inequality. Indirect taxes, on the other hand, are highly regressive with the
two poorest deciles being hit the hardest (the poorest decile pays 17 percent of its income in indirect taxes
while the richest deciles pay only 7-8 percent). As a result, indirect taxes increase income inequality and
poverty. (Bucheli et al. 2013)

        Tax incidence analysis, therefore, confirms the results of country modeling that indirect
taxation which does not exempt basic necessities tends to be regressive.

All Scandinavian countries –like almost all OECD and many middle income countries—have a
multiple rate VAT. As we saw above, this is also the case in many developing countries. The objective
of the multiple rates is to make the VAT less regressive (even if less efficient). Moreover, in OECD
countries such as Scandinavia, the revenue foregone in VAT payments in the consumption of low-rated
items by high-income individuals may be seen as compensated by high PIT rates on these income groups.
The standard VAT rate is 25 percent for Denmark, Norway and Sweden and 23 percent in Finland. In
2008, VAT collections ranged between 7 percent (in Norway) and 10 percent in Denmark.

         All four Scandinavian countries have lower rates and exemptions on goods and services
considered to be of high public utility. Denmark, 0-rates exports and newspapers and exempts a
number of services with positive externalities such as education, health, welfare and public passenger
transport services. Similarly, Sweden, has three reduced rates of: (i) 12 percent on goods and services
such as food and hotel accommodations, (ii) 6 percent, on services such as domestic passenger
transportation, books, newspapers and certain sporting and cultural events; (iii) 0 percent on the exports
of goods, fuel to aircrafts, ships and aircrafts for commercial transport and services related to them and
prescription pharmaceuticals; and (iv) exemptions, for health and welfare, education, and the sale and
letting of real property. Norway has reduced rates of 14, 8 and 0 percent as well as exemptions while
Finland has reduced rates of 13, 9 and 0 percent on similar goods and services as in the other two
Scandinavian countries. All four countries –as is still common globally—exempt financial and insurance
services. Unlike in the preceding cases, however, this latter exemption is not determined by “public
good” considerations but rather by the fact that the international community has not yet found an effective
way of taxing financial services.

3.          The Tax Systems of Two Successful Middle-Income Countries - Brazil and China

       The two sections below will trace the main lines of the tax systems of Brazil and China,
which hold useful lessons for middle income countries undertaking tax reform.

Brazil23

         There are a large number of indirect taxes operating at the federal, state and municipal
level with multiple rates, including lower rates for food and a number of exemptions. Like in the
United States, each state has its own sales tax rates and regulations. There are two types of VAT in
Brazil: a state sales tax and a federal excise tax. The standard rate of the state’s sales tax ranges from 17
to 19 percent depending on the state. There are reduced rates of 7 percent and 12 percent which apply to

23
     The description of the tax system draws heavily from Higgins and Pereira 2013.

                                                               231
inter-state supplies within Brazil depending on the region into which goods are sold and to certain intra-
state supplies, such as diesel oil and hydrated ethyl alcohol fuel, motor vehicles and transport services (12
percent). Goods that are part of the basic food basket and products from the electronic data processing
industry are taxed at a reduced rate of 7 percent while supplies of books, newspapers, periodicals, and the
paper consumed in the printing of such products, sale of fixed assets, fruits, vegetables, and farm and
garden produce and preservatives are exempt. Imports are taxed at rates ranging from 4 to 25 percent
while communication services are taxed at a rate ranging between 13 and 25 percent.

         The tax system on its own, on the other hand, is regressive. Direct taxes are strictly
progressive, with the first five deciles paying 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 percent of their income in income taxes
while the top decile pays 10 percent. Indirect taxes, on the other hand, are highly regressive with the
bottom decile bearing almost three times the burden of the top decile. This incidence, which is much
more regressive than in other Latin American and middle income countries, is not mainly due to the tax
structure (which includes lower rates for goods consumed by the poor). Rather, it is the result of the
extremely high level of inequality of market income and the lower percentage of rural population in
Brazil.24 Because the tax system is dominated by indirect taxes, it is regressive as a whole. On the other
hand, because income is so strongly concentrated at the top, the government collects most of its taxes
from the upper income groups (See Table 13).

24
  The percentage of rural population in Brazil is only 15 percent while it is 21 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean region
as a whole and 51 percent in middle-income countries. The rural poor are typically much less hard hit by indirect taxes than the
urban poor as they have some home-grown production and purchase much of the rest in local agricultural markets which do not
pay taxes.

        As a result of indirect taxes, a non-trivial share of the non-poor/moderate poor/extreme
poor become poor/extreme poor/ultra-poor respectively, despite transfers.25 Indirect taxes move 11
percent of those vulnerable to poverty into poverty, 15 percent of in moderate poverty into extreme
poverty and 4 percent of those in extreme poverty into ultra-poverty despite any cash transfers they
receive (Lustig and Higgins). In fact, the effective tax rate on the basic food basket is 13 percent on
average despite lower state taxes on food. Because the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on
food, they are hit very hard by the amount of indirect taxes.

China

         China collects 23 percent of GDP in taxes and, through its state-owned enterprises, sustains
a level of public investment of 26 percent of GDP. Tax and expenditure responsibilities are split across
the various levels of government. Direct and indirect taxes account for 25 and 60 percent of overall
government revenues respectively. Personal income tax collections are still very low, amounting to 6
percent of tax revenues in 2006.


25
  To measure the impact of fiscal policy on poverty in a middle income country, Higgins and Pereira and Lustig and Higgins use
the international poverty lines proposed by the World Bank of US$1.25 PPP per day (ultra poverty), US$2.50 PPP per day
(extreme poverty), and US$4.00 PPP per day (moderate poverty), as well as the lines used to determine eligibility for the
Conditional Cash Transfer program Bolsa Família’s fixed benefit (70 reais per month [$1.34 PPP per day]) and variable benefit
(140 reais per month [$2.69 PPP per day].

                                                            233
         China has relatively high tax rates for personal income on labor, moderate rates for
corporate and capital income gains and makes extensive use of tax incentives . Personal income tax
rates are progressive, with a top rate of 45 percent. Capital gains, on the other hand, are taxed at a flat
rate of 20 percent. Corporate income is taxed at 25 percent, since 2007 irrespective of ownership. China
has a system of tax incentives designed to subsidize all high-tech companies and companies investing in
equipment for environmental protection, water conservation and production safety. The first subsidy is
characteristic of industrial policy while the latter two can be justified in terms of correcting for positive
externalities generated by these activities. China, however, arguably makes excessive use of tax
incentives, eroding the neutrality of the tax system and reducing the tax base sometimes with questionable
results (See Box X).

        China has three VAT rates, including reduced rates for basic necessities and small-scale
producers, 0-rating as well as special consumption taxes on luxury goods. The standard rate is 17
percent. A reduced rate of 13 percent applies to items such as grain and edible oil, books and newspapers,
tap water and heating, feeds, and agricultural products while exports are 0-rated. Exports of some goods,
however, are not wholly zero-rated and the associated input tax is not refundable in full to the exporters.
Most services, such as transportation, telecommunications, construction, and hotel services are taxed
between 3 and 20 percent. Unlike many countries, China does not exempt financial and insurance
services from VAT. The VAT rate for small-scale VAT payers is 3 percent. A special consumption tax
is imposed on luxury goods and services at higher rates on goods presumably consumed by high-income
earners –alcohol, tobacco, cosmetics, firecrackers, gasoline and diesel and automotive products.



                     Box 1. The Impact of China’s 2004 VAT Exemptions Pilot

 Beginning in 2004, the Chinese government implemented a VAT reform in three Northeast
 provinces which removes fixed asset investment from the tax base. These provinces were
 chosen because, whereas many coastal cities had undergone rapid changes and upgrades in capital
 assets and technology, the traditional industrial base of the northeast regions had been left behind.
 The objective of the reform was to encourage firms in these provinces to invest more on fixed
 productive assets and upgrade their technology and thus revitalize these old industrial bases.

 The reform significantly reduced firms’ tax burdens, but also reduced employment while its
 effect on investment was limited and only positively significant for state-owned enterprises.
 The profits of domestic firms improved after the tax burden was partially removed while the profits
 of foreign firms fell. The impact on firm productivity was only significant for domestic firms and
 the effect was negative. Moreover, for most firms, their exports fell in conjunction with the tax
 reform.

 The reform led firms to use fewer workers, increased profits for SOEs and led to some
 increase in productive investment among SOEs, but no significant change for other firms.
 Treated firms reduced employment between 6 and 8 percent.

        Conclusions
4.Despite the fact that the main impact of the reform seems to have been inducing labor-saving
  growth, it was extended to the rest of China in 2009.

 (Cai and Harrison, 2011)
                                                    234
        Over the past three decades, VAT collections have increased across the world and room for
increasing VAT rates is shrinking. VAT revenues have been used to substitute for declining revenues
from other sources, especially trade taxes and, in some countries, CIT revenues. As a result, economic
and political room for increasing VAT rates is very limited in both developed and developing countries.

        Broadening the base of the VAT tends to increase the tax burden on lower and lower-
middle income groups, particularly in highly urbanized middle income countries. Some policy
advice focuses on broadening the base of the VAT, but tax incidence analysis and country modeling
results show that including basic necessities in the VAT base turns a potentially neutral tax into a
regressive one. This is not necessarily the case in low income countries with high levels of rural
population and high levels of informality.

         A VAT without sufficient exemptions or lower rates for necessities makes it highly
regressive in many Latin American countries despite the presence of transfers to the poor . The
standard prescription of having a broad-based VAT supplemented with transfers to the poor is found to be
insufficient to make the overall tax-and-transfer system progressive. It hits particularly hard lower-
middle income groups, which do not benefit from the transfers the poorest income deciles receive.

         Efforts to increase VAT collections should thus particularly focus on increasing collection
efficiency and broadening the base to financial transactions. This can be achieved through
strengthened tax administration, including simpler regulations, greater ease of paying taxes, more
effective use of third-party information and overall improvement refund management. A potential area
for broadening the base of the VAT would consist in extending it to financial transactions which have, to
the present, been exempt in most countries. This would greatly enhance the horizontal neutrality and the
vertical equity and overall fairness of the tax system, enhancing its legitimacy.

         Globally, there is a need to re-balance tax composition increasing the weight of direct taxes
relative to indirect taxation. The case for this rebalancing is particularly strong in developing countries
as there is no robust evidence of the impact of tax composition on growth. Moreover, broad-based VATs
weigh heavily on lower and lower-middle income groups especially in highly urbanized middle income
countries with low informality. Easing the weight on indirect taxes would help improve the distributive
impact of tax policy and enhance the legitimacy of the tax system. It would also foster aggregate demand
and enhance the working of automatic stabilizers.

        Developing countries would be well advised in avoiding labor demand-dampening measures
such as high payroll taxes and measures to cheapen the cost of capital . There is evidence that in
OECD countries as well as in Latin America payroll taxes have fostered labor substituting technology.
Moreover, capital-favoring measures (such as accelerated depreciation and VAT exemption for capital
investments) have similarly led to less labor-intensive growth in many countries, including in China. A
labor-intensive growth model, therefore, should resist these policies.

COUNTRY                                                REGIME

OECD

AUSTRALIA       The federal government levies GST at a rate of 10%, and distributes the revenue to
                state governments. The GST is a value-added tax (VAT) applied at each level in the
                manufacturing and marketing chain and applies to most goods and services, with
                registered suppliers getting credits for GST on inputs acquired to make taxable
                supplies.
                Exemptions: Food with some significant exceptions; exports; most health, medical,
                and educational supplies; and some other supplies are ‘GST-free’ (the equivalent of
                ‘zero-rated’ in other VAT jurisdictions) and so not subject to GST . A registered
                supplier of a GST-free supply can recover relevant input tax credits, although the
                supply is not taxable.
                Residential rents, the second or later supply of residential premises, most financial
                supplies, and some other supplies are ‘input-taxed’ (‘exempt’ in other VAT
                jurisdictions) and are not subject to GST. However, the supplier cannot recover
                relevant input tax credits, except that financial suppliers may obtain a reduced input
                tax credit of 75% of the GST on the acquisition of certain services.
                Health insurance is GST-free. Life insurance is input-taxed. General insurance is
                taxed.
                Reverse charges may apply to services or rights supplied from offshore, where the
                recipient is registered or required to be registered, and uses the supply solely or partly
                for a non-creditable supply.
KOREA           VAT is levied at a rate of 10% on sales and transfers of goods and services, except
                zero-rated goods and services (e.g. goods for exportation, services rendered outside
                Korea, international transportation service by ships and aircraft, other goods and
                services supplied for foreign exchange earnings) and exempt goods and services (e.g.
                basic life necessities and services, such as unprocessed foodstuffs and agricultural
                products; medical and health service; finance and insurance services; duty-exempt
                goods). Electronic VAT invoicing is a compulsory requirement. If a taxpayer fails to
                issue the electronic VAT invoice or report electronically to tax authorities, the
                relevant penalties shall be imposed.
SINGAPORE       Goods and services tax (GST) is charged at 7% on the supply of goods and services
                made in Singapore by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of one’s business.

                The only exemptions from GST are prescribed financial services (including life
                insurance) and the sale or rental of residential properties. Zero-rating only applies to


                                                236
     the export of goods and international services.

     GST is also levied on imports of goods, at the time of importation. However there are
     reliefs available to ease the cash-flow burden of import-export traders by suspending
     GST at the time of importation. GST is not currently charged on imports of services.

     A taxable person is one who is, or is required to be, registered for GST. GST
     registration is required if one’s taxable turnover exceeds SGD 1 million per year.
     Voluntary registration is permitted if the taxable turnover is below the registration
     limit, subject to conditions.

     A supply of goods is made in Singapore if the goods are in Singapore at the time

     of supply, and a supply of services is made in Singapore if the supplier belongs in

     Singapore. Generally, a person belongs in Singapore if one’s business (including
     carrying on a business through a branch or agency) or fixed establishment is in
     Singapore.

     A taxable person is allowed to offset the input GST paid on taxable purchases against
     the output GST chargeable on supplies made. However, certain purchases are
     specifically denied an input GST deduction. These include supplies of goods and
     services such as non-business expenses, club subscription fees, family benefits, car
     rental expenses, motor vehicle expenses, medical expenses, and transactions involving
     betting, sweepstakes, lotteries, fruit machines, or games of chance.

     A non-resident is not entitled to GST refunds except by appointing a resident tax
     agent to act on one’s behalf. The resident tax agent can then recover import GST paid
     on behalf of the non-resident business but will be required to account for output GST
     on any subsequent supply of the non-resident’s goods in Singapore.

UK   The standard VAT rate of 20% applies to most goods and services, apart from
     domestic fuel and power and certain other reduced-rate supplies, which are subject to
     VAT at 5% (note that the standard rate was increased from 17.5% with effect from 4
     January 2011).

     Most exports, most food, most public transport, books and publications, and certain
     other essential goods and services are zero-rated. Some supplies are exempt, the main
     categories being the giant of certain interests in land, insurance, financial services,
     betting and gaming, education, certain sports services, cultural services, and health
     and welfare. Zero-rating is preferable to exemption because the VAT on costs
     incurred in making a zero-rated supply can be recovered while that incurred in making
     an exempt supply cannot.

     VAT is chargeable on the supply of most goods and services made in the United

     Kingdom by ‘taxable persons’ in the course of business, when their taxable turnover


                                     237
exceeds the registration thresholds. Taxable persons include individuals, companies,
partnerships, clubs, associations, or charities.

Taxable persons who are not normally resident in the United Kingdom, do not have a
business establishment in the United Kingdom, and, in the case of companies, are not
incorporated in the United Kingdom, but who make taxable supplies, sales to
unregistered persons in the United Kingdom, or acquisitions of goods in the United
Kingdom above the relevant limits, may be required to register and account for VAT
in the United Kingdom.

If the value of taxable supplies is over a specified limit, registration for VAT is
compulsory unless the taxable supplies made are wholly or mainly zero-rated, in
which case it is possible to apply for exemption from registration. The government
confirmed in Budget 2012 that with effect from 1 December 2012, a zero VAT
registration threshold will apply for businesses not established in the United Kingdom.
The rules applying to VAT and territoriality are different to those applying to direct
tax in that they derive from the principles of the place of supply in EU law, as
enshrined in European Commission (EC) VAT Directives. Having determined that a
supply of goods or services has taken place, the second condition to be determined, if
the transaction is to fall within the scope of UK VAT, is whether the supply takes
place within the United Kingdom. The place of supply rules is different for goods and
for services. A person or business belonging outside the United Kingdom, with no
place of business in the United Kingdom, may nevertheless be liable to UK VAT
registration where the place of supply of those goods or services is in the United
Kingdom.

For goods, the basic rule is that a supply of goods is taxable in the territory where
those goods are physically located at the time of supply. Hence, if goods are supplied
in the United Kingdom by a non-established taxable person, there will still be a
liability for VAT purposes, and the person must register for VAT in the United
Kingdom if the taxable supplies exceed the current UK VAT registration thresholds.

For services, the basic rule is that services are treated as made where the customer
‘belongs’ or is established for VAT purposes, and the customer is responsible for
accounting for the VAT due via the reverse charge procedure. However, this is
subject to a number of special rules and exceptions. Determining where a business is
established for VAT purposes is based on EU law criteria.

For business to consumer (B2C) supplies, the basic rule is that services are treated as
made where the supplier ‘belongs’ or is established for VAT purposes.

VAT returns and payments

VAT returns must be completed at preset intervals (usually every three months).

Larger companies may be required to file monthly returns or make monthly payments
on account. As of 1 April 2012, all businesses are required to file VAT returns online

                               238
         and make electronic payments. Smaller enterprises can apply for annual returns.
         VAT returns are usually required to be filed 30 days after the end of the period.
         Annual accounting is available for taxable persons with annual turnover (taxable
         supplies, excluding VAT) not exceeding GBP 1,350,000.

         Cash accounting is available for taxable persons with annual turnover (taxable
         supplies, excluding VAT) not exceeding GBP 1,350,000.

         In addition, a flat rate scheme operates for small businesses and is intended to simplify
         VAT accounting procedures.

BRICS

BRAZIL   VAT is payable on imports, sales, and transfers of goods and products in the form of
         (j) a federal excise tax Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados or IPI) at various rates
         in accordance with the nature of the product (normally around 10% to 15%, but in
         certain cases ranging to over 300%) and (ii) a state sales and service tax (Imposto
         sobre as operações relativas à Circulação de Mercadorias, e sobre a prestação de
         Serviços de transporte interestadual e intermunicipal e de comunicaçao or ICMS) with
         rates ranging from 7% to 25%.

         Except for services related to freight and transportation, communications, and electric
         energy, which are subject to ICMS, income from services rendered is normally subject
         to a municipal service tax( lmposto Sobre Serviços de qualquer natureza or ISS),
         which is not a VAT, with rates ranging from 2% to 5%.

CHINA    Pilot Program of indirect tax reform in Shanghai

         In order to mitigate the multiple taxation issue associated with goods and services and
         to support the development of ‘modern service industries’ in China, the State Council
         resolved in early 2011 to introduce a Pilot Program in the city of Shanghai to expand
         the scope of value-added tax (VAT) to cover selected industries that were originally
         subject to business tax (BT).

         The Pilot Program in Shanghai started from 1 January 2012. This earmarks the
         official kick off of the long-awaited transformation of BT to VAT for service
         industries in China.

         The industries selected for the Pilot Program and the applicable VAT rates (for
         general VAT-payers) are set out in the following table.




                                         239
Small-scale VAT-payers in the above Pilot Industries are subject to the VAT rate of
3%.

Enterprises (including foreign enterprises) providing Pilot Services in Shanghai are
subject to VAT instead of BT from 1 January 2012.

There are some other cities, including but not limited to Beijing, expressing interest to
run similar Pilot Programs in the near future. It is possible that after the Pilot
Programs in different localities, the Chinese authorities will collect the experience and
modify the Pilot Programs before the transformation is implemented nationwide. It is
generally contemplated that the transformation will need to be completed within
China’s 12th Five Year Plan (2011 to 2015).

Value-Added Tax (VAT)

The sales or importation of goods and the provision of repairs, replacement, and
processing services are subject to VAT. VAT is charged at a standard rate of 17%,
and the rate for small-scale taxpayer is 3%. The sales of certain necessity goods may
be subject to VAT at a reduced rate of 13%, as specified in the VAT regulations.

The VAT system is a consumption-based VAT system, which means that input VAT
on fixed assets is fully recoverable except for situations specified in the VAT
regulations.

Export of goods from China may be entitled to a refund of VAT incurred on materials
purchased domestically. The refund rates range from 0% to 17%. There is a
prescribed formula for determining the amount of refund, under which many products
do not obtain the full refund of input VAT credit and suffer different degree of export
VAT costs.

In order to mitigate the multiple taxation issue associated with goods and services and
to support the development of ‘modern service industries’ in China, the State Council
resolved in early 2011 to introduce a Pilot Program in the city of Shanghai to expand
the scope of VAT to cover selected industries that were originally subject to BT.

The Pilot Program in Shanghai started from 1 January 2012. This earmarks the


                                240
        official kick off of the long-awaited transformation of BT to VAT for service
        industries in China.

        The industries selected for the Pilot Program and the applicable VAT rates (for
        general VAT-payers) are set out in the following table.




        Small-scale VAT-payers in the above Pilot Industries are subject to the VAT rate of
        3%. Enterprises (including foreign enterprises) providing Pilot Services in Shanghai
        are subject to VAT instead of BT from 1 January 2012.

        Business tax (BT) A BT is imposed on services, transfer of intangible assets, and
        immovable property taking place within China. Services taking place within China
        refers to situations where the service provider, the service recipient, or both are in
        China. This may make services even being rendered outside China subject to BT in
        China. BT rates are 3% or 5%, except for the leisure and entertainment industry,
        which may be subject to a rate of up to 20%. BT is not recoverable but is deductible
        for CIT purposes.

        As indicated above, under the Pilot Program of the indirect tax reform in Shanghai,
        enterprises providing Pilot Services in Shanghai will be subject to VAT instead of BT
        from 1 January 2012.

INDIA   The sale of movable goods in India is chargeable to tax at the central or state level.
        The Indian regulatory framework has granted power to state legislatures to levy tax on
        goods sold within that state. Such sales are, therefore, chargeable to VAT at the rates
        notified tinder the VAT laws of the relevant state. All goods sold in the course of
        interstate trade are subject to CST.

        Where goods are bought and sold by registered dealers on an inter-state basis for
        trading or for use as inputs in the manufacture of other goods or specified activities
        (such as mining or telecommunication networks), the rate of sales tax is 2%, provided
        Form ‘C’ is issued by the purchasing dealer. In the absence of Form ‘C’, the
        applicable rate would be the rate of VAT on such goods in the originating state.
        Interstate procurement, on which CST is charged by the originating state, is not
        eligible for input tax credit in the destination state and hence is a cost to a buyer.

        State level sales tax has been replaced by VAT in all the states. Under the VAT

                                       241
regime, the VAT paid on goods purchased within the state is eligible for VAT credit.
The input VAT credit can be utilized against the VAT/CST payable on the sale of
goods. It is, thus, ensured that the cascading effect of taxes is avoided and only the
value addition is taxed.

Currently, there is no VAT on imports into India. Exports are zero-rated. This means
that while exports are not charged to VAT, VAT charged on inputs purchased and
used in the manufacture of export good or goods purchased for exports is available to
the purchaser as a refund.

The state VAT is charged at tax rates of 1%, 4%, 5%, and 20%. Goods other than
those notified to be covered under the above rates are charged in the range of 12.5% to
15%. The rare of VAT depends on the nature of goods involved and varies from state
to state.

Turnover threshold is prescribed so as to exclude small traders from the ambit of the
VAT.

A tax tinder composition scheme, at a lower rate, may be levied on small traders,
within a specified turnover limit, in lieu of VAT.

CENVA T (Excise Duty)

Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT) is an excise duty levied by the Central
Government on the manufacture or production of movable and marketable goods in
India. The rate at which excise duty is leviable on the goods depends on the
classification of the goods under the Excise Tariff. The Excise Tariff is primarily
based on the eight digit HSN classification adopted so as to achieve conformity with
the Customs Tariff.

The excise duty on most consumer goods, which are intended for retail sale, is
chargeable on the basis of the MRP printed on the package of the goods. However,
abatements are admissible at rates ranging from 15% to 55% of the MRP. Goods,
other than those covered by MRP based assessments, are generally chargeable to duty
on the ‘transaction value’ of the goods sold to an independent buyer. In addition, the
Central Government has the power to fix tariff values for charging ad valorem duties
on the goods.

Typically, the duty i-ate is 12%. However, notifications granting partial or complete
exemption for specified goods from payment of excise duties are also available.

Education cess at 2% and secondary and higher education cess at 1% are applicable
on the aggregate of excise duties. Thus, the effective rate of excise duty is 12.36%.

The central excise duty is a modified VAT wherein a manufacturer is allowed credit
of the excise duty paid on locally sourced goods and the CVD and ADC paid on
imported goods. The CENVAT credit can be utilized for payment of excise duty on


                               242
         the clearance of dutiable final products manufactured in India. Manufacturers of
         dutiable final products are also eligible to avail CENVAT credit of the service taxes
         paid on input services used in or in relation to the manufacture of final products and
         clearances of final products from the place of removal, subject to fulfillment of
         conditions.

RUSSIA   VAT is a federal tax in Russia, payable to the federal budget.

         There is no separate VAT registration in Russia. The established general tax
         registration requirements are applicable to all taxes, including VAT.

         Taxpayers follow a ‘classical’ input-output VAT system, whereby a VAT payer
         generally accounts for VAT on the full sales pi-ice of the transaction and is entitled to
         recover input VAT incurred on inventory costs and other related business expenses.
         The Russian VAT system, although not originally based on the European Union (EU)
         model has moved towards it. However, it still currently differentiates from the EU
         VAT system in multiple ways.

         Output VAT

         Generally, VAT applies to the value of goods, works, services, or property rights
         supplied in Russia. The standard VAT rate is 18% in Russia (with a lower rate of
         10% applicable for certain basic foodstuff, children’s clothing, medicines and medical
         products, certain printed publications, etc.). The same VAT rates apply for imports of
         goods into Russia.

         Exports of goods, international transportation and other services related to the export
         of goods from Russia, international passenger transportation, and certain other
         supplies are zero-rated with an input VAT recovery right. The application of the 0%
         VAT rate and recovery of the respective input VAT should be confirmed by
         submitting a number of documents to the tax authorities within certain time limits.
         Special rules are provided in respect of the documentary confirmation of the right to
         tax export supplies to Customs Union member countries with a 0% VAT rate,
         including an input VAT recovery right.

         The list of VAT exempt goods and services includes basic banking and insurance
         services, educational services by certified establishments, sale of certain essential
         medical equipment, passenger transportation, and certain other socially important
         services. Most accredited offices of foreign legal entities (as well as the accredited
         employees of these offices) may be exempt from VAT on property rental payments.

         Performance of VAT exempt supplies gives no right for the recovery of the
         attributable input VAT; instead, costs associated with non-recoverable input VAT are,
         in most cases, deductible for profits tax purposes.




                                         243
Withholding VAT

Russian VAT law contains rules for determining where services are supplied from a
VAT perspective. These rules divide all services into different categories for
determining where they are deemed to be supplied for VAT purposes. For example,
certain services ai-e deemed to be supplied where they are performed, some where the
‘buyer’ of the services carries out the activity, others where the immovable property is
located, etc.

Under the reverse-charge mechanism, a Russian company must account for VAT on
any payment it makes to a non-tax registered foreign company, if the payment is
connected to a supply of goods or services regarded as supplied in Russia, based on
the VAT place of supply rules and not falling under any VAT exemption based on the
domestic VAT law. In such circumstances, according to the law, the Russian buyer
shall act as a tax agent for Russian VAT purposes by withholding Russian VAT at the
rate of 18/118 from payments to the foreign supplier and remit such withheld VAT to
the Russian budget.

The withheld VAT may be recovered by the Russian payers in accordance with the
standard input VAT recovery rules provided by law.

Input VAT Recovery

Generally, taxpayers are eligible to recover input VAT associated with the purchase of
goods, works, services, or property rights, provided a set of rules established by the
VAT legislation is met. Input VAT could potentially be recovered by the taxpayer in
the following cases:

VAT related to goods, services, or works acquired for the purpose of conducting

VATable Transactions

VAT related to the purchased goods, works, or services used in non-VATable
transactions, if the portion of expenses related to non-VATable operations does not
exceed 5% of total amount of expenses.

Input VAT related to advance payments performed to Russian suppliers of goods

(works, services) provided such acquired goods (works, services) are aimed at being
used in VATable activities. Please note that application of this rule is the right of
taxpayers (rather than an obligation), and taxpayers may choose whether to enjoy this
right or not.

VAT Compliance Requirements

Each taxpayer performing supplies of goods, works, services, or property rights is
liable to issue VAT invoices and provide them to customers. VAT invoices shall be
issued within five days after the supply has occurred. The form of the VAT invoice is

                                244
         a standard one, established by the government. Compliance with invoicing
         requirements is critical to the buyer’s ability to recover input VAT.

         E-invoicing is also allowed under the Russian Tax Code. However, the e-invoice
         format and the necessary protocol are not yet established by the respective authorities.

         E-invoicing requires digital signature and data transfer via operators and is subject to
         mutual agreement of the transaction parties. Operators are companies who provide
         services for exchange of open and confidential information via telecommunication
         channels.

         Generally, incoming and outgoing VAT invoices shall be registered by taxpayers in
         special purchases and sales VAT ledgers.

         VAT returns shall be submitted to the tax authorities on a quarterly basis. VAT must
         be paid to the Russian budget after the end of each quarter in three installments not
         later than the 20th day of each of the three consecutive months following the quarter
         except for the remittal of VAT withheld by Russian buyers tinder the reverse charge
         mechanism, which is to be transferred to the Russian budget at the date of the external
         payment.

         Import VAT

         Import VAT is payable in customs upon importation of goods. The tax base for
         import VAT purposes is generally the customs value of the imported goods, including
         excise payments. Either the 18% or 10% VAT rate may apply upon import of goods
         in Russia, depending on the specifics of the goods.

         A limited range of goods is eligible for exemption from import VAT. The list of such
         goods includes, for example, certain medical products and goods designated for
         diplomatic corps. Relief from import VAT is available on certain technological
         equipment (including their components and spare parts) analogues of which are not
         produced in Russia. The list of such equipment is established by the Russian
         government.

SOUTH    VAT is an indirect tax, which is largely directed at the domestic consumption of
AFRICA   goods and services and at goods imported into South Africa. The tax is designed to be
         paid mainly by the ultimate consumer or purchaser in South Africa. It is levied at two
         rates, namely a standard 14% rate and a zero rate (0%).

         Very few business transactions carried out in South Africa are not subject to VAT.
         The tax is collected by businesses which are registered as vendors with SARS on all
         taxable supplies throughout the production and distribution chain. Sales or supplies
         by non-vendors are not subject to VAT.

         VAT Registration and Administration



                                         245
All suppliers of goods and services having an annual turnover currently exceeding
ZAR 1 million are obliged to register as VAT vendors and to charge output VAT.
Other vendors may elect to register as VAT vendors, provided their annual turnover
exceeds ZAR 50,000. If they do not register, they are prohibited from charging VAT
on goods or services they supply and claiming an input tax (rebate of VAT paid) on
goods and services which they acquire.

Under the VAT system, vendors normally pay VAT on expenses (input tax) and
charge VAT on supplies made (output tax). This mechanism, therefore, ensures that
only the so-called ‘added-value’ is taxed. Due to VAT being a self-assessment
system, the output tax collected may be reduced by input tax paid. Thereafter, the net
amount is payable to, or refundable by, the SARS. The self-assessment returns are
due regularly within prescribed periods (tax periods).

Taxable Supplies

Standard rated and zero-rated supplies are known as taxable supplies. Other supplies
are known as exempt and non-supplies.

Goods and Services

For a liability for VAT to exist, there must be a supply or importation of goods or
services. Goods are corporeal movable things, fixed property, and real rights in such
things and property. The meaning of ‘services’ is very broad and includes the
granting, assignment, cession, or surrender of any right or the making available of any
facility or advantage.

Imports

Services imported by a vendor and utilized or consumed by the vendor for the making
of taxable supplies are not subject to VAT. In addition, the VAT Act has a schedule
that lists goods that are exempt from VAT on importation, whether by a vendor or an
unregistered person.

Zero-rated Supplies

The VAT Act contains a list of the supplies of goods or services that are taxed at the
zero rate. Most of the items refer to exports and international transport, but other
specified goods utilized for farming purposes, the sale of an enterprise as a going
concern, fuel subject to the fuel levy, and deemed supplies by welfare organizations
are also zero-rated.

A zero-rated supply made by a vendor is subject to VAT but at a rate of 0%. Under a
zero-rated supply, a vendor does not charge VAT on the consideration for the supply
and obtains a refund or credit for the VAT paid on taxable supplies utilized in the
making of the zero-rated supplies.



                               246
            Exempt Supplies

            In addition to zero-rated supplies, the VAT Act contains a list of the supplies of goods
            or services that are exempt from VAT. While all fee-based financial services are
            subject to VAT, the charging of interest is exempt. Other exempt supplies include
            residential rentals, basic foodstuffs, non-international passenger transport by road or
            rail, and educational services.

            Under exempt supplies by vendors, the vendors do not charge VAT on the supply, and
            they are not entitled to a deduction or credit for the VAT paid by them on goods and
            services supplied to them for the making of the exempt supply. Accordingly, vendors
            treat the VAT paid by them, and for which they do not obtain a deduction or credit, as
            another cost and recover it in the consideration they charge for the making of the
            exempt supply.

NEIGHBORS

CAMBODIA    VAT is applicable to real-regime entities and is charged at 10% on the value of the
            supply of most goods and services.

            Exported goods and services rendered outside Cambodia are zero-rated. In addition,
            0% VAT applies to the supporting industries or contractors who directly supply goods
            or services to the export-oriented garment manufacturers, textile, footwear industries,
            and domestic supplies of paddy rice.

            Some supplies are VAT exempt, the main categories being public postal services,
            medical and dental services, electricity, transportation of passengers by wholly state-
            owned public transport systems, insurance services, and primary financial services.

            VAT returns and payments are due within 20 days of the following month. Note that
            strict record-keeping requirements do exist.

INDONESIA   With a few exceptions, VAT is applicable on deliveries (sales) of goods and services
            within Indonesia at a rate of 10%. VAT on export of goods is zero-rated while the
            import of goods is subject to VAT at a rate of 10%. Zero-rated VAT is also
            applicable on exported services, but subject to a MoF limitation. Currently, only
            certain exported services, including toll manufacturing services, are subject to the 0%
            VAT rate. Services performed within the Customs Area for customers outside of the
            Customs Area are considered as locally delivered and are therefore subject to the
            regular VAT i-ate of 10%. Inbound use or consumption of foreign services or
            intangible goods, with a few exceptions, is also subject to a self-assessed VAT at a
            rate of 10%.

            The VAT law allows the government to change the VAT rate within the range of 5%
            to 15%. However, since the enactment of the VAT law in 1984, the government has
            never changed the VAT rate.


                                            247
           In general, VAT collection is based on the accrual principle, whereby VAT must be
           collected at the time of delivery of taxable goods or services. The term delivery, in
           this case, is defined as the time when risk and ownership of goods have been
           transferred or when income from a service delivery can be reliably estimated or
           measured. In the accrual system, income or receivables are acknowledged when a
           transaction takes place, regardless of whether the transaction has been paid for or not.
           The recognition of revenue or receivables is indicated by the issue of a commercial
           invoice, which is a source document for this recognition and a basis for recording it.

           VAT filing is done on a monthly basis, with payment and filing being due no later
           than the last day of the month following the taxable delivery.

LAOS       The Standard VAT Rate is 10%.

           VAT is imposed on the final consumer of goods and services. Goods and services
           used for production, trading, and consumption in Lao PDR, goods imported into Lao
           PDR, and services rendered by foreigners to Lao PDR customers are subject to VAT.

           Certain goods and services are exempt from VAT. Exempted items include
           unprocessed agricultural products, seeds, fertilizers, textbooks, education services,
           medical services, banking services, and insurance.

           Exported goods and services are zero rated. The conventional credit method is used to
           calculate the VAT payable (i.e. output VAT less input VAT). Excess input VAT can
           be carried forward for six months (extendable). Input VAT for exports is refundable.

           Organizations engaged in production or trading of taxable goods and services must
           register for VAT if their annual revenue is 400 million Lao kip (LAK) or more.
           Companies below this threshold may voluntarily register. Only registered VAT
           taxpayers may claim VAT refunds.

           One unique feature of Lao PDR VAT is that VAT is charged on withholding taxes
           (WHTs). WHT is applied to various types of payments made to domestic and foreign
           recipients.




           VAT of 10% is charged on the above WHT. In the case of a foreign recipient, the
           WHT is considered a final tax.

MALAYSIA   A GST of 4% was originally expected to be implemented in mid- 2011, but its


                                           248
             Implementation is now delayed indefinitely. The reason reported for the delay is to
             allow the government more time to engage with the public in order to gather feedback
             on the implementation of the GST. When implemented, GST will replace the current
             sales tax and service tax.

             Sales Tax

             A single-stage ad valorem tax (sales tax), at rates ranging from 5% to 10%, is imposed
             on all goods imported into or manufactured in Malaysia, unless specifically exempted.

             Service Tax

             Service tax is imposed at the rate of 6% on the value of taxable services sold or
             provided by taxable persons. A list of ‘taxable services’ and ‘taxable persons’ is
             found in the Service Tax Regulations 1975.

PHILPPINES   VAT applies to practically all sales of services and imports, as well as to sales, barter;
             exchange, or lease of goods or properties (tangible or intangible). The tax is
             equivalent to a uniform rate of 12%, based on the gross selling price of goods or
             properties sold, or gross receipts from the sale of services. On importation of goods,
             the basis of the tax is the value used by the Bureau of Customs in determining tariff
             and customs duties plus customs duties, excise taxes, if any, and other charges.
             Where the valuation used by the Bureau of Customs is by volume or quantity, the
             VAT basis is the landed cost plus excise taxes, if any.

             Certain transactions are zero-rated or exempt from VAT. Export sales by VAT
             registered persons are zero-rated.

             Certain sales of services exempt from VAT, including services provided by financial
             intermediaries, are subject to percentage taxes based on gross sales, receipts, or
             income. A 3% percentage tax also applies to persons who are not VAT-registered
             because their annual sales or receipts do not exceed PHP 1,919,500.
